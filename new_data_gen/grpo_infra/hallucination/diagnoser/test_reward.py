You are an expert clinical fact-checker. Your job is to compare a clinical vignette with a diagnostic reasoning response to identify any hallucinations or inaccuracies.

CLINICAL VIGNETTE (SOURCE OF TRUTH):
{clinical_vignette}

DIAGNOSTIC REASONING TO EVALUATE:
{completion}

Please analyze if the diagnostic reasoning adds any information that was NOT in the clinical vignette AND if it missed any important information that WAS in the vignette. Look for:

HALLUCINATIONS (things added that weren't in the vignette):
1. Symptoms not mentioned in the vignette
2. Demographic information that contradicts the vignette
3. Medical history not provided in the vignette
4. Timeline details not specified in the vignette
5. Severity descriptions not supported by the vignette
6. Physical exam findings not mentioned in the vignette
7. Test results or lab values not provided in the vignette

OMISSIONS (important things from vignette that diagnosis missed):
1. Key symptoms from vignette not considered in differential
2. Important demographic details that affect diagnosis
3. Relevant medical history that impacts diagnostic reasoning
4. Timeline information that narrows differential
5. Physical findings that support or rule out diagnoses

INAPPROPRIATE DIAGNOSTIC REASONING:
1. Diagnoses that don't match the clinical presentation
2. Missing common/likely diagnoses for the presentation
3. Including diagnoses without proper justification from vignette

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "hallucinated_items": [list of specific things added that weren't in vignette]
- "omitted_items": [list of important vignette details not considered]
- "accurate_items": [list of diagnoses/reasoning correctly based on vignette]
- "score": a number from -10 to +10 (-10 = severe hallucination/poor reasoning, +10 = perfect diagnostic reasoning)

Scoring guidance:
- Deduct 3 points for each hallucinated clinical detail
- Deduct 2 points for each inappropriate diagnosis
- Deduct 1 point for each important omitted consideration
- Add 1 point for each accurate diagnosis with proper justification
- Perfect diagnostic reasoning based only on vignette information = +10

Example response:
{{"hallucinated_items": ["patient reports chest pain", "history of diabetes"], "omitted_items": ["age consideration for pancreatic cancer"], "accurate_items": ["gallstone obstruction matches jaundice", "abdominal pain fits biliary pathology"], "score": -3}}
