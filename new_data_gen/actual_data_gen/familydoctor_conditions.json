    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nThe main blood vessel in your body is the aorta. It is a long blood vessel called an artery that reaches from your chest into your abdomen. It carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. The part of the aorta in your abdomen is called the abdominal aorta. It supplies blood to your stomach, pelvis, and legs.\nSometimes an area of a blood vessel wall will get weak. It can start to swell like a balloon and become abnormally large. This is called an aneurysm. If an aneurysm forms in your abdominal aorta and grows too large, your aorta could tear or burst.\nAs the aneurysm develops, there are usually no symptoms. This can go on slowly for years. Often, AAAs don\u2019t cause symptoms unless they leak, tear, or rupture. If this happens, you may experience:\nIf you have these symptoms, go to the emergency room. Internal bleeding from a ruptured AAA can cause you to go into shock. Shock can be fatal if not treated right away\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes an AAA. Weaker aorta walls increase your chance of developing an aneurysm. There are many conditions that can weaken the walls of the aorta. These include aging, smoking, and high blood pressure. If any of the following factors apply to you, you are at higher risk of having an AAA.\nTalk to your doctor if you have a higher risk for an AAA, or if you have any of the symptoms.\nDoctors commonly find AAAs by chance during a routine exam. They also find them when testing for other issues, including pain in your abdomen. Doctors recommend an AAA screening for men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked.\nIf your doctor finds or thinks you have an AAA, they may order tests. Common tests include:\nIf your doctor finds or thinks you might have an AAA, he or she might refer to you a specialist for treatment.\nYou can\u2019t always prevent an AAA from forming. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk. These include:\nTreatment for an AAA depends on its size. If your aneurysm is small, it might not need to be treated. Your doctor may just monitor it using routine testing. If your doctor is concerned about it, he or she may prescribe medicine. These can be used to lower blood pressure or relax blood vessels. This can help prevent the AAA from rupturing.\nIf your aneurysm is large or is growing quickly, you will most likely need surgery. There are 2 main kinds of surgery to remove or repair AAAs:\nThe type of surgery you have depends on many factors. Talk to your doctor about which kind is best for you.\nIf you have an AAA, it is important to get regular medical care. Listen to your doctor and follow your treatment plan. He or she may advise you to avoid lifting heavy objects. Try to avoid highly emotional situations or crises that could raise your blood pressure.

    "article_title": "What is abnormal uterine bleeding?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nAbnormal uterine bleeding is any heavy or unusual bleeding from the uterus (through your vagina). It can occur at any time during your monthly cycle, including during your normal menstrual period. Bleeding after sex or post-menopause would also be considered abnormal.\nSymptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding\nVaginal bleeding between periods is one symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding. Having extremely heavy bleeding during your period can also be considered abnormal uterine bleeding. Very heavy bleeding during a period and/or bleeding that lasts more than 7 days is called menorrhagia. For example, women may bleed enough to soak through 1 or more tampons or sanitary pads every hour.\nA variety of things can cause abnormal uterine bleeding. In most women, abnormal uterine bleeding is caused by a hormonal imbalance. When hormones are the problem, doctors refer to this as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Abnormal bleeding caused by hormonal imbalance is more common in teenagers or in women who are approaching menopause.\nOther common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding are pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or growths in the uterus. These are called polyps or fibroids and can range from small to large growths. Less common causes include an infection, liver, kidney, or thyroid disease, a bleeding disorder, or cancer of the uterus or cervix.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, but the cause usually depends on your age.\nTeens, 20s, and 30s\nA common cause of abnormal bleeding in teenagers and young adults is pregnancy. Abnormal bleeding can occur in the first few months of a normal pregnancy. Some birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs) can also cause abnormal bleeding.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding during a menstrual cycle can occur when your body does not release an egg from your ovaries (called ovulation) as it should. This is common for teenagers who have just started getting their periods. This creates a hormonal imbalance in which the estrogen in your body makes the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium) grow until it gets too thick. When your body gets rid of this lining during your period, the bleeding will be very heavy. A hormonal imbalance may also cause your body not to know when to shed the lining. This can cause irregular bleeding (\u201cspotting\u201d) between your periods.\n40s and early 50s\nIn the years before menopause and when menopause begins, it is common to have months when you don\u2019t ovulate. This can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, including heavy periods and lighter, irregular bleeding. Thickening of the uterine lining is another cause of bleeding in your 40s and 50s. This thickening can be a warning of uterine cancer. You need to talk to your doctor if you have abnormal uterine bleeding and are in this age group. It may be a normal part of getting older, but it\u2019s important to make sure uterine cancer isn\u2019t the cause.\nPost-menopause\nHormone replacement therapy is a common cause of uterine bleeding after menopause. Other causes include endometrial and uterine cancer. These cancers are more common in older people than in younger people. But cancer is not always the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Many other problems can cause bleeding after menopause. For this reason, it\u2019s important to talk to your doctor if you have any bleeding after menopause.\nThe tests your doctor orders may depend on your age. If you could be pregnant, your doctor will order a pregnancy test. If your bleeding is heavy, your doctor may want to order a blood test. This will make sure you don\u2019t have a low blood count from the blood loss, which could lead to iron deficiency and anemia.\nAn ultrasound exam of your pelvic area shows both the uterus and the ovaries. It may also show the cause of your bleeding.\nYour doctor may want to do an endometrial biopsy. This is a test of the uterine lining. It\u2019s done by putting a thin plastic tube (called a catheter) into your uterus. Your doctor will use the catheter to remove a tiny piece of the uterine lining. They will send that lining sample to the lab for testing. The test will show if you have cancer or a change in the cells. A biopsy can be done in the doctor\u2019s office and causes only mild pain.\nAnother test is a hysteroscopy. A thin tube with a tiny camera in it is put into your uterus. The camera lets your doctor see the inside of your uterus. If anything abnormal shows up, your doctor can collect tissue for a biopsy.\nCan abnormal uterine bleeding be prevented or avoided?\nMost causes of abnormal uterine bleeding are not preventable. However, if a hormonal imbalance is caused by being overweight, losing weight could help. Your weight affects your hormone production. Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent abnormal uterine bleeding in some cases.\nThere are several treatment options for abnormal bleeding. Your treatment will depend on the cause of your bleeding, your age, and whether you want to get pregnant in the future. Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is right for you. If your doctor decides that a hormone imbalance is causing your abnormal bleeding, you and your doctor may decide to wait and see if the bleeding improves on its own.\nSome treatment options include the following:\nBirth control pills.Birth control pills contain hormones that can stop the lining of your uterus from getting too thick. They also can help keep your menstrual cycle regular and reduce cramping. Some types of birth control pills, especially the progestin-only pill (also called the \u201cmini-pill\u201d), can cause abnormal bleeding. Let your doctor know if the pill you\u2019re taking doesn\u2019t control your abnormal bleeding.\nIntrauterine device (IUD).Your doctor may suggest an IUD. An IUD is a small, plastic device that your doctor inserts into your uterus through your vagina to prevent pregnancy. One type of IUD releases hormones. This type can significantly reduce abnormal bleeding. Like birth control pills, sometimes IUDs can be the cause of abnormal bleeding. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\nDilation and curettage (D&C).A D&C is a procedure in which the opening of your cervix is stretched so that a surgical tool can be put into your uterus. Your doctor uses this tool to scrape away the lining of your uterus. The removed lining is checked in a lab for abnormal tissue. A D&C is done under general anesthesia (while you\u2019re in a sleep-like state).\nIf you\u2019re having heavy bleeding, your doctor may perform a D&C both to find out the cause and treat the bleeding. The D&C itself often makes heavy bleeding stop. Your doctor will decide if this procedure is necessary.\nHysterectomy.This type of surgery removes the uterus. If you have a hysterectomy, you won\u2019t have any more periods and you won\u2019t be able to get pregnant. A hysterectomy is major surgery that requires general anesthesia and a hospital stay. It may require a long recovery period. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of a hysterectomy.\nEndometrial ablation.This is a surgical procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus. Unlike a hysterectomy, it does not remove the uterus. Endometrial ablation may stop all menstrual bleeding. However, some people will have light menstrual bleeding or spotting after endometrial ablation. In rare cases, you may still have regular menstrual periods after the procedure. After endometrial ablation, you should still use some form of birth control even though, in most cases, pregnancy is not likely after the procedure.\nYour doctor can do endometrial ablation in several different ways. Newer endometrial ablation techniques do not require general anesthesia or a hospital stay. The recovery time after this procedure is shorter than the recovery time after a hysterectomy.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can impact your life in a negative way. Not being able to predict when bleeding will begin can cause you to be anxious all the time. Also, heavy menstrual bleeding may limit your daily activities during your period. For some people, it even prevents them from leaving the house.\nIf you have heavy menstrual bleeding, try taking ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin) during your period (or a few days before you expect your period). Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs can help reduce pain and cramping.\nYou also should be sure to get enough iron in your diet. Your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement to ensure that you don\u2019t become anemic.\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Heavy Menstrual Bleeding\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is an ACL injury?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nACL refers to the anterior cruciate ligament. It is 1 of 4 ligaments in your knee. The other knee ligaments are PCL (posterior cruciate ligament), MCL (medial collateral ligament), and LCL (lateral collateral ligament). The ACL is located behind the kneecap (patella). It stabilizes the knee when it rotates. The ACL and PCL connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shin bone (tibia).\nAn ACL injury is the overstretching or tearing of the ACL ligament. A torn ACL is a common knee injury. On average, women are 2 to 8 times more at risk of ACL injuries than men. Teenagers also are getting ACL injuries at an increased rate, probably because more kids are involved in organized sports. The increase in ACL injuries is also due to more awareness and advanced testing.\nThe primary sign of an ACL injury is a popping noise. This is often combined with pain and swelling. You could experience grinding feelings of your bones or kneecap. Another sign is not being able to put weight on your leg. People with a mild ACL injury might feel like their knee is unstable, or like it might \u201cgive out\u201d when they are using it.\nACL injuries often occur in sports or active environments. They usually occur without contact rather than with direct contact. Several things can cause the injury, such as:\nThese things can happen while doing things like skiing, playing soccer or football, or jumping on a trampoline.\nWhen you injure your ACL, it can be a partial or full tear. In a partial tear, only part of the ligament is torn. A full or complete tear happens when the ligament is torn into two pieces.\u00a0 ACL tears usually happen in the middle of the ligament. Sometimes the ligament is pulled completely off the thigh bone. Other injuries can occur at the same time. These include other torn knee ligaments (primarily the MCL, the ligament that gives your knee stability), a torn meniscus (knee cushion), or bone bruises.\nIf you think you\u2019ve injured your ACL, seek medical attention. Your doctor will perform a knee exam to check your range of motion and the extent of the injury. They may order an X-ray to look for damage to the bones of your knee. If no bone damage is found, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your knee could confirm an injury to your ACL.\nThe leading way to prevent injuries such as an ACL tear is to follow a training routine. A physical therapist, athletic trainer, or other sports medicine specialist can help you develop an exercise program that will help reduce your risk of injury. Such a program will usually include:\nThere is no clear evidence that use of a knee brace prevents ACL injuries. There also is no proof that a knee brace helps more during treatment or physical therapy.\nWhen the injury first happens, you can apply first aid to your knee:\nAfter this, you should see your family doctor. Your doctor will weigh several factors to decide on a treatment plan. These include the severity of the injury, your age, your physical condition, your medical history, and other injuries or illnesses you may have.\nPeople who are young, active, and healthy typically have surgery. Your family doctor will refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. In surgery, the ACL will be repaired or reconstructed with tissue. This can come from your hamstring or a minor knee tendon. It can also come from a donor. After surgery, you will need intense physical therapy to rebuild strength in your knee and leg. It can take 8 to 12 months of rehabilitation before an athlete who has ACL surgery can return to their sport.\nAnother treatment option for people who are aren\u2019t as active or healthy is therapy. This is less intense and invasive. Therapy programs can range anywhere from 10-32 weeks. The goal is to increase movement and strength, and allow the ligament to heal naturally.\nRecovering from an ACL injury can be difficult. This is especially true if the injury happened during a daily or regular activity. Keep in mind, your doctor\u2019s goal is to restore your ACL, so treatment is important. Stick to your rehabilitation plan so you heal properly and have the best chance for a full recovery.\nThere is some evidence that people who have ACL injuries will develop osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis over time. This outcome is similar regardless of how the injury is treated.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury\u2014aftercare\nLast Updated:February 19, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It causes bumps on the skin known as pimples. Pimples form when the tiny hair follicles in your skin are blocked by dead skin and oil. This causes bacteria to grow and irritate the skin. Pimples commonly appear on the face. However, they can appear on the back, chest, arms, and neck. Acne usually starts in your early teen years. It can last into or begin in adulthood. Both boys and girls get it.\nAcne is caused by debris that block the hair follicles in your skin. The debris is made up of dead skin and oil. This blockage allows bacteria to grow in the hair follicles. There are several types of acne:\nFamily history contributes to acne. If your parents had bad acne, you may have it too. Your immune system plays a role too. Some people are extra sensitive to the bacteria that get trapped in their hair follicles.\nMost of the time, your doctor can diagnose acne by examining the irritation on your skin. He or she will also consider your age, lifestyle, or circumstances. For example, some women get acne when they are pregnant. Some teens and adults get acne from certain foods.\nAcne cannot be prevented or avoided. However, some people can reduce the severity by knowing what triggers the irritation.

This happens because the bronchial tubes take a while to heal. A lasting cough may signal another problem, such asasthmaorpneumonia.\nAcute bronchitis is most often caused by a contagious virus. The same viruses that causecoldscan cause this condition. First, the virus affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then the infection travels to the lining of the bronchial tubes. As your body fights the virus, swelling occurs and mucus is produced.\nYou can catch a virus from breathing it in or by skin contact. You are at higher risk of catching the virus if you have close contact with someone who is ill.\nLesser-known causes of acute bronchitis are:\nYour doctor can confirm acute bronchitis. He or she will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. He or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Your doctor might order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. This will help rule out pneumonia.\nYou can help prevent acute bronchitis by staying healthy and avoiding germs.

They make hormones that affect your mood, growth, metabolism, tissue function, and how your body responds to stress.\nAddison\u2019s disease damages those glands. It causes your body to shut down production of the hormones. The disease commonly affects people 30 to 50 years of age. However, it can occur at any age and affects both men and women.\nSymptoms appear over a period of several months. They are difficult to diagnose because they are vague.

Symptoms of ADHD can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and school performance. ADHD begins in childhood and can continue into the teen years and adulthood.\nDespite decades of research, an exact cause of ADHD in children is unknown. However, the strongest research suggests ADHD may be genetic. Research also hints at environmental factors. However, exact factors haven\u2019t been defined.\nCertain risk factors do put children at a higher risk for\u00a0ADHD. They include:\nAlthough many people believe sugar causes hyperactivity, there\u2019s no proof of this. Many issues in childhood can lead to difficulty sustaining attention, but that\u2019s not the same as\u00a0ADHD.\nStruggling with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity most of the time are the primary symptoms of ADHD in children. Specific symptoms for each include:\nInattention.\nHyperactivity and impulsivity.\nThanks to increased physician training and growing parental awareness, children who have ADHD are being diagnosed earlier. When making an ADHD diagnosis, doctors consider whether symptoms have been present before the age of 12. Children up to age 16 are diagnosed with ADHD if they have had at least 6 persistent symptoms of inattention and/or 6 persistent symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity present for at least 6 months. Symptoms must be present in two or more settings. For example, the symptom occurs at home or school or with friends or relatives and interferes with the quality of social or school functioning.\nTalk to your doctor if you think your child has symptoms of ADHD. Although your primary care doctor can likely diagnose and treat ADHD, they may also refer you to a developmental pediatrician or a mental health professional. These may include a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, who can do a thorough evaluation and make an ADHD diagnosis.\nDuring an evaluation, your doctor or mental health professional may:\nThere are standardized behavior rating scales or ADHD symptom checklists to determine whether a child or teen meets the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Although there is no single ADHD test, multiple psychological tests can look at working memory, executive functioning (abilities such as planning and decision-making), visual and spatial skills, or reasoning skills. These tests can detect psychological or cognitive (brain) strengths and challenges as well as identify or rule out possible learning disabilities.\nThere is no cure for ADHD. However, most children who have been diagnosed with ADHD are treated with a combination of prescription medicine, psychological and psychosocial behavioral therapy. They also may participate school-based programs that embrace ADHD-friendly classroom strategies, parent, and school support. Each is dependent on a child\u2019s needs and symptoms.\nThe most common type of medication used to treat ADHD are \u201cstimulants.\u201d Historically, these medications have been effective. However, as with any medication, there can be side effects. If your child is taking ADHD prescription medicine, they must be monitored by their doctor at regular intervals to check for the appropriate dosage and any side effects. Nonstimulant medications are also available. Sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressants to treat children with ADHD. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these medications for treating ADHD. In many cases, a person diagnosed with ADHD must try several different medications or dosages before finding what works for them.\nUnlike specific psychotherapy and medication treatments that are scientifically proven to improve ADHD symptoms, complementary health approaches for ADHD, such as natural products, do not qualify as evidence-supported interventions. For more information, visit theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website.\nThanks to growing awareness and treatment approaches, there are many tools available for parenting a child with ADHD today. Primary care doctors, as well as mental health professionals, have become experienced in combining prescription medicine and behavioral therapy to help a child be successful in school, at home, and with peers. Similarly, most schools are equipped with ADHD-friendly classrooms and strategies to assist. Often, these strategies are good for all students, including taking breaks to get up out of their chairs and stretch or move.\nIt\u2019s important for parents to share with the school administration, teaching staff, and school nurse if their child has ADHD. This enables a discussion of medicine and strategies. It\u2019s also important to look for local parent support groups to share your journey. You may find a tip of nugget of information that will help in your journey.\nAlso, talk to your mental health professional about coping strategies for your child. ADHD isn\u2019t just a challenge for parents, it is frustrating to the child as well. Learning to recognize their own stresses and how to cope with them can help.\nBe cautious about taking your guidance from online social media platforms. Trends that appear on TikTok and other platforms can potentially do more harm than good. Aways rely on medical professionals. Also, learn to separate fact from fiction. Some of the ADHD myths that often circulate include:\nRemember, too, that ADHD can coexist and/or be confused with other conditions such as anxiety and depression. Because stress, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and other physical conditions or illnesses can cause similar symptoms to those of ADHD, a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the symptoms.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: What is ADHD?\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at a Glance\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Teens: What You Need to Know\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nEsta informaci\u00f3n proporciona una visi\u00f3n general y puede que no se aplique a todos.

    "article_title": "What is adhesive capsulitis?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nAdhesive capsulitis is commonly called frozen shoulder. This occurs when the joints in your shoulder are inflamed. The inflammation leads to scar tissue. This prevents you from being able to move your shoulder in all directions without pain. Your shoulder can become stiff, and it may be difficult for you to move it at all.\nThe primary symptom is difficulty moving your shoulder without pain and stiffness. You may feel this when you:\nAt first, your shoulder may ache and feel stiff. Then it may get very painful. This is called the painful stage. It may last about 3 to 8 months. The second stage is called the adhesive stage. You may not have as much pain. However, your shoulder keeps getting stiffer. This stage usually lasts about 4 to 12 months. By the time you reach the final stage, it becomes very hard to move your shoulder, even a little bit. This stage usually lasts about 1 to 3 months. However, it isn\u2019t very painful. Eventually, the stiffness slowly goes away. You can move your shoulder again. You may not get the full movement of your shoulder back. As your shoulder movement increases, you may still have pain at times. However, you should be able to do more activities.\nThis condition develops when the tissue in your shoulder joint tightens and restricts movement. This occurs when you are not active because of another injury, such as a rotator cuff injury, broken arm, or recovering from a surgery. Also, it happens when you use your shoulder the wrong way. Certain risks factors can increase frozen shoulder. Risks are higher for:\nYour doctor may be able diagnose frozen shoulder just by talking to you about your symptoms and watching you move your shoulder. During an exam, your doctor may press on parts of your shoulder to see what might be causing the pain. Your doctor may also want to take an X-ray or do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your shoulder to look for other problems.\nFrozen shoulder can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. However, you can reduce your risks. A person with diabetes can reduce the risk of diabetes-related illness by following his or her doctor\u2019s lifestyle and prescription medicine advice. If you are having surgery, see a physical therapist and follow his or her post-surgery shoulder exercises. If you have any shoulder discomfort, see your doctor earlier rather than later. This may prevent serious pain and damage.\nYour doctor can teach you physical therapy exercises to help break up the scar tissue in your shoulder. They may refer you to a physical therapist to show you how to do the exercises. Many of the exercises can be done at home.\nSometimes the exercises hurt. Your doctor may give you something for the pain or to relax your muscles. This might include over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medications, and/or steroid injections in your shoulder. Putting a heating pad or an ice pack on your shoulder for a few minutes before you do the exercise may help. Remember to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting your exercises. Warm up by doing very gentle exercises and small movements with your shoulder. Warm up and stretch other parts of your body (neck, back, hands, and elbows), too.\nTreating the underlying reason for frozen shoulder might be necessary. Surgery may be required if other treatments are not effective. The surgical procedure is calledshoulder arthroscopy. It removes scar tissue. The surgery is done under anesthesia. That means medicine is injected into your vein prior to surgery to make you sleep and numb to pain. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments from the scar tissue.\nLiving with frozen shoulder requires planning and maybe pain medicine. For example, you may have to avoid certain tasks or movement that you know will cause you shoulder pain. You may have to do daily physical therapy exercises. And you may have to follow your doctor\u2019s advice for over-the-counter and prescription medicines.\nAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Frozen Shoulder\nHarvard Health Publishing: How to release a frozen shoulder\nLast Updated:August 4, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder represented by a group of behaviors. It used to be called attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADHD is not just present in children. Adults can be diagnosed with ADHD, too. As such, it is a disorder that is considered to affect a person across the lifespan. It is more common in adult men. People who have ADHD have trouble paying attention (executive function) at school, work, or home. Even when they try to concentrate, they find it hard to pay attention. It can interfere with relationships to a degree.\nAdults who have ADHD are more likely to be distracted, careless, or impulsive. Someone who finds it difficult to pay attention may have adult ADHD if they have 6 or more of the following symptoms:\nSomeone who is impulsive may have adult ADHD if they have the following symptoms.\nPeople who have ADHD do not make enough chemicals in certain parts of the brain that help organize thoughts. This is thought to be the cause of ADHD. The shortage of chemicals may be due to a person\u2019s genes. Research shows that ADHD is more common in people who have a close family member with the disorder.\nRecent research suggests there are certain risk factors for ADHD, including:\nA person diagnosed with ADHD will have had symptoms for at least 6 months. You may have been diagnosed with ADHD as a child, or it may have gone undiagnosed. Some adults who have ADHD may be diagnosed when they find out their children have ADHD.\nTalk to your doctor if you notice ongoing signs of adult ADHD. They will discuss your symptoms, lifestyle, and overall health. In order to be diagnosed with adult ADHD, you must have had symptoms prior to age 12.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid adult ADHD.\nAdults who have ADHD can help manage symptoms. Start by identifying the areas of your life that are most impaired by ADHD and then seek treatment to address them. Treatment options include medicine, therapy, and/or lifestyle changes.\nOne type of medicine used to treat ADHD is called psychostimulants. This includes methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and a drug that combines dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. These medicines have a stimulating effect in most people. However, they have a calming effect in people who have ADHD. These medicines improve attention and concentration and decrease impulsive and overactive behaviors. Your doctor may consider other non-stimulant medicines, such as atomoxetine, clonidine, desipramine, imipramine, or bupropion.\nAll medicines have side effects. Psychostimulants may decrease your appetite and cause a stomachache or a headache. The loss of appetite can cause unplanned weight loss in some people. This side effect seems to be more common in children. Some people haveinsomnia(trouble sleeping). Other possible side effects include fast\u00a0heartbeat, chest pain, or vomiting. To avoid or reduce the side effects of psychostimulants, follow these tips:\nIt\u2019s important to take the medicine the way your doctor prescribes it. Follow their advice, even if you think the medicine isn\u2019t working. Medicines used to treat ADHD have been shown to improve a person\u2019s ability to do specific tasks. This includes paying attention or having more self-control. The length of time a person will need to take medicine depends on each person. Some people only need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years. Others need treatment for longer.\nIf your doctor thinks you have adult ADHD, they may suggest therapy. This could include individual counseling and/or support groups. Your doctor also may recommend testing and counseling with someone who specializes in treating ADHD. You can learn ways to change your work environment and keep distractions to a minimum. Organizational tools can help you learn how to focus on activities at work and at home. Many people who have ADHD find counseling helpful.\nIt is important to make some personal changes to help improve your condition. These may include:\nPeople who have ADHD should visit their doctor for regular checkups. A lifetime of ADHD behaviors can cause social problems, such as low self-esteem, trouble learning or working, and problems with relationships. ADHD can put you at risk of addiction. Some people who have ADHD may have problems sleeping or eating. They may have related health conditions as well (which can be mistaken for adult ADHD).

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nAIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the last stage of the life-threatening human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that makes your body\u2019s cells unable to fight off infections. Having it makes you more susceptible to the serious consequences of infections and other diseases. Essentially, AIDS attacks your body\u2019s immune system, killing CD4 cells (also called T cells). If HIV is left untreated, it will continue to kill off CD4 cells your body needs to fight off infections. When this happens, it is considered stage 3 HIV, or AIDS.\nIt is important to note that treatment options have come a long way for HIV/AIDS, making it more of a chronic disease than a fatal one. However, once you have been diagnosed with HIV, you cannot cure it. It requires a lifetime of management.\nAIDS symptoms are triggered by the body\u2019s weakened immune system. This means that if you have AIDS, your body can\u2019t fight off infections and other conditions. People who have AIDS are at high risk of getting opportunistic infections. These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc. They can affect any part of the body. AIDS also puts you at higher risk for certain cancers, especially lymphomas, skin cancer, and cervical cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nAIDS symptoms will vary, but may include:\nAIDS is caused by HIV, a virus. HIV is spread from person to person several ways. You can get HIV by having sexual contact with a person who has HIV. You can also get it if you share a needle with someone who has HIV. Pregnant mothers who have HIV may pass it to their babies during pregnancy, childbirth, or while breastfeeding.\nWhen you have HIV, your doctor will monitor your CD4 count by ordering a blood test. A healthy CD4 count ranges from 500 to 1,600 CD4 cells. The lower your CD4 count, the less your body can fight infection. If your CD4 count drops below 200, your doctor may diagnose you with AIDS. Many times, you will also already have an infection or pneumonia due to the low number of CD4 cells.\nYou can prevent AIDS by preventing HIV. The best way to prevent HIV is to not have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a person who has HIV, or share a needle with a person who has HIV.\nOther ways to prevent HIV include:\nEven though there is no cure for HIV, there are many medicines available to help combat it. These medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) will often prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. Even when HIV does progress to AIDS, ART is often still effective. However, it\u2019s most effective the earlier you begin treatment.\nOne HIV preventive medicine is known asPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). This is a medicine for people who are at high risk of contracting HIV from sex or drug use. When taken as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective for preventing HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAnother HIV medicine, known as PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis)\u00a0is effective when taken 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. It is designed to prevent the virus from taking hold. However, when taking both these medicines, the virus can still be transmitted through sex and drug use.\nWithout treatment, the survival rate for someone with AIDS is about 3 years. That number decreases if they get an infection or cancer as a result of their weakened immune system.\nWith treatment, though, the survival rate for HIV and even AIDS is much better. In the United States, most people with HIV don\u2019t develop AIDS because effective ART stops disease progression.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: About HIV/AIDS\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention:PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: What is PEP?\nHIV.gov\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: HIV/AIDS\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can cause a bleeding ulcer and irritate the lining of your stomach. Alcohol also can cause you to gain weight, feel sick or dizzy, cause you to have bad breath, and make your skin break out.\nPeople misuse alcohol for many reasons. It may be due to social pressure, a desire to relax, a coping mechanism for anxiety, depression, tension, loneliness, self-doubt or unhappiness, or a family history of misusing alcohol.\nMany people who are misusing alcohol will hear from family and friends that they have a problem.

Additional symptoms may include pain, and itchy, watery eyes. Allergic conjunctivitis can affect both eyes.\nPink eye is caused by bacteria, viruses, or allergens. When allergies are the cause, it is known as allergic conjunctivitis. Some common allergens include:\nThis type of conjunctivitis isn\u2019t contagious.\nTo diagnose allergic conjunctivitis, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and health history. He or she will examine your eye. If your doctor sees the irritation is severe, they may swab the corners of your eye to send a sample of the liquid to a lab. If your doctor determines allergies are to blame, they may suggest you undergo allergy testing.\nYou can reduce your risk of allergic conjunctivitis by avoiding things that irritate your eyes. For example, if you\u2019re allergic to pollen that comes from grass and trees, limit your exposure outdoors. Check weather reports for pollen and mold levels. Keep your doors and windows closed. Use an air conditioner during the summer months. Also consider using an air purifier in your house.\nIf you\u2019re allergic to animals, consider not having a pet. If you\u2019re around a pet, avoid touching the animal and then touching your eyes. Always wash your hands and body after exposure to allergens.\nThere are many ways to treat the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Some treatments include:\nYou can buy manyantihistaminepills and lubricating eye drops without a prescription.\nAlong with lubricating eye drops, other types of eye drops can help allergic conjunctivitis. Some contain medicine. These medicines may include an antihistamine, a decongestant, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or a mast cell stabilizer. Some drops contain a combination of these medicines. Some of these eye drops require a prescription.\nAs with all medicines, eye drops may cause side effects. You may experience burning and stinging when you first put the drops in.

By definition, allergic rhinitis is swelling of the nasal passages caused by allergens. It\u2019s important to note that while many people refer to it as hay fever, it is not caused by hay. Nor does is cause a fever. Allergic rhinitis is triggered by having allergies. You have an allergy when your body overreacts to things that don\u2019t cause problems for most people. These things are called allergens.\nThere are 2 forms of allergic rhinitis:\nYour symptoms can vary, depending on the severity of your allergies. Symptoms can include:\nAllergic rhinitis can last several weeks, longer than a cold or the flu. It does not cause fever. The nasal discharge is thin, watery, and clear. Nasal discharge from a cold or the flu tends to be thicker. Itching (mostly in the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, and skin) is common with hay fever but not with a cold or the flu. Sneezing occurs more with hay fever. You may even have severe sneeze attacks.\nIf you have allergies, your body releases chemicals when you are exposed to an allergen. One such chemical is called histamine. Histamine is your body\u2019s defense against the allergen. The release of histamine causes your symptoms.\nHay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen. Pollen comes from flowering trees, grass, and weeds.\u00a0If you are allergic to pollen, you will notice your symptoms are worse on hot, dry days when wind carries the pollen. On rainy days, pollen often is washed to the ground, which means you are less likely to breathe it. Your allergies can vary depending on the time of year:\nAllergens that can cause perennial allergic rhinitis include:\nIf your symptoms interfere with your daily life, see your family doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history and perform a physical exam. Keeping a record of your symptoms over a period of time can help your doctor determine what triggers your allergies.\nYour doctor may want to do an allergy skin test to determine what you are allergic to. Tiny amounts of allergens are applied to your skin. You will feel tiny pricks that are usually not painful. Your doctor will observe and record the way your skin reacts to each allergen.\nYour doctor may also decide to do a blood test, such as the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). This test identifies antibodies in your blood that determine what you\u2019re allergic to. Once your allergens are identified, you and your doctor can decide the best treatment.\nAllergic rhinitis cannot be prevented. You can help your symptoms by avoiding the things that cause your symptoms.\nYou can also avoid things that can make your symptoms worse, such as:\nSeveral medicines can be used to treat allergies. Nasal steroids are often the most effective treatment. Your doctor will help you determine what medicine is best for you depending on your symptoms, age, and overall health. If you are pregnant, your doctor will advise what medications are safe for you to take. Some allergy symptoms during pregnancy are a naturally occurring part of being pregnant and not allergic rhinitis.\nThese medicines help prevent symptoms if you use them regularly, before you\u2019re exposed to allergens:\nLiving with the symptoms of allergic rhinitis can affect your daily life. Nasal symptoms can be worse when lying down. This can disturb your ability to sleep well. Fatigue and headaches can affect your ability to function at school and work.\nThere is also a link between asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis.

    "article_title": "What is alopecia areata?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nAlopecia areata is a form of alopecia (hair loss). It\u2019s a non-life-threatening disease of your immune system that affects the hair on your scalp. With this condition, your body mistakenly views your hair follicles as an enemy. Your body attacks the hair follicles. This causes some or all of your hair to fall out. It usually begins with the hair on your head. There are three severe forms of alopecia, including:\nAlopecia is not contagious. It occurs in people of all ages. However, it is more common in children and adults in their early 20s.\nAlopecia is different than telogen effluvian, which is hair loss that can be caused by physical stress such as rapid weight loss or pregnancy. Telogen effluvian is more common and usually, your hair does grow back after this type of hair loss.\nThe main symptom of alopecia areata is hair loss that occurs in small, round patches on your head. This leaves smooth, peach-colored areas of scalp exposed. A mild case of alopecia areata starts with one to two coin-size hairless patches. In many instances, it stops after that. Sometimes, the hair will grow back. However, there\u2019s no guarantee. The condition is unpredictable, and the cycle of hair loss and regrowth can repeat itself.\nAlopecia areata can grow into another form of alopecia. In its worst form, alopecia universalis causes you to lose all body hair. This includes eyebrows, eyelashes, arms, legs, underarms, pubic, and chest and back hair for men. Rarely, people who have alopecia may feel burning or itching in the areas where they once had hair.\nSome people with alopecia areata see changes in their fingernails and toenails. Nails can have tiny dents (pitting), have white spots or lines, and be rough.\nThere is no known cause for alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease. This means your immune system attacks part of your body by mistake. Scientists think the cause of the disease may be related to a person\u2019s genes. In that case, they believe a virus or something in your environment may trigger the disease.\nSee your doctor if you are experiencing significant hair loss. There are many reasons for hair loss. Your doctor will look at your hair loss pattern. He or she will review your medical history. They will check to see if the hairless areas of your scalp are smooth and peach-colored. Sometimes, the remaining hair in alopecia areata has a specific shape. Your doctor may pull a couple of hairs from your head to examine under a microscope. If your doctor can\u2019t confirm a diagnosis, he may send you to a lab for a test. They will scrape a small sample of skin from your scalp and look at it under a microscope. This can help them rule out other conditions that cause hair loss. You may also have a blood test to look for other autoimmune diseases.\nThe condition cannot be prevented or avoided. The cause is unknown and varies by person. Alopecia areata is not tied to stress, as some people believe. Some people have a family history of alopecia areata. Having a family member with alopecia areata and another immune system disease can raise your risk of having it. Other immune system diseases include type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, lupus, Addison\u2019s disease, and atopic dermatitis. It is rare for a parent to pass the condition onto a child.\nThere is no cure for alopecia areata. If you have a few, small patches of hair loss on your head, it\u2019s likely your hair will grow back within a few months. Your doctor may not prescribe treatment in those cases.\nFor larger areas of hair loss, your doctor may prescribe steroid injections under your scalp. This could help regrow your hair. Other treatments include hair growth medicines that contain steroids that you apply to your skin.\nContact immunotherapy is another treatment. It purposely causes an allergic reaction on your scalp that could trigger hair growth. With this treatment, the medicine that is applied to your scalp irritates your skin, making it red and scaly. It could take as long as three months to see hair growth if this treatment works. Contact immunotherapy does have side effects, including a severe rash and swollen lymph nodes in your neck.\nNo matter what therapy you try, hair loss usually returns when you stop treatment.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recognizes that living with alopecia areata can be emotionally difficult. It affects social interaction and self-confidence, as people are embarrassed to let others see their hair loss. It can also be frustrating to not know if your hair is going to grow back or fall out again.\nConsider joining a patient support group for people who have alopecia areata. Support groups give you a chance to talk about your condition. They help you realize you are not alone in your frustration with alopecia areata. A support group can be a good resource for practical tips to deal with the condition.\nHairstyling techniques or hair care products can help to cover bare patches on your head. But some products can be harsh on your hair. This could cause additional damage and loss. You might want to talk with your doctor about what products to avoid. People who have alopecia areata are encouraged to be creative with hats, scarves, and wigs.\nLosing your eyelashes, eyebrows, and the hair in your nose and ears also can be a problem. Hair protects your eyes, nose, and ears from the irritation of dust, germs, and small, foreign particles. Wear eyeglasses or sunglasses to protect your eyes. You can use antibiotic ointment inside your nose to help keep germs out.\nBe sure to cover areas of exposed scalp with a hat or sunscreen to reduce your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.\nNational Alopecia Areata Foundation\nAmerican Academy of Dermatology, Alopecia areata\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Alopecia Areata\nLast Updated:July 2, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

However, other things can also cause dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s disease most commonly affects people older than 65 years of age. People who are younger than 65 years of age can also have Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is called early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Woloski\nDoctors don\u2019t know what causes Alzheimer\u2019s disease. One theory is that the disease develops when clumps of abnormal proteins grow in the brain. This growth likely begins with many small changes in the brain. This typically starts long before any symptoms are noticeable. Over time, these changes add up. Eventually, brain cells become damaged and die.\nAlso, doctors believe certain things increase a person\u2019s risk for developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Those risks factors include:\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease also appears to be more common in women than in men. Nearly two-thirds of people who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease are women.\nAn Alzheimer\u2019s disease diagnosis may take some time. There is no test that can tell your doctor whether you have the disease. Give your doctor plenty of information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor may want to evaluate the following in you or your loved one:\nBased on this information, your doctor can almost always tell whether you have dementia. Your doctor will likely be able to tell whether Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the cause. Alzheimer\u2019s disease can only be diagnosed with certainty after death. That is when the brain is examined under a microscope. The brain will show distinct changes that only happen when Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the cause.\nIf you are worried that you or a loved one might have some of the warning signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, talk to your doctor. An early diagnosis will help you get treatment sooner. Also, it will give you time to address questions of care, finances, and legal issues with your family.\nNo one knows how to prevent or avoid Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, doctors believe that healthy living and keeping your brain active can help lower your risk.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nAmblyopia is also called \u201clazy eye.\u201d It is an eye problem that starts in early childhood. Amblyopia is the most common cause of vision problems in children. It happens when one eye doesn\u2019t work properly with the brain. The brain favors the eye that does work correctly. This causes a loss of vision in the other eye.\nAmblyopia\u00a0usually affects only one of the eyes. Sometimes it can affect both. It is important to detect amblyopia in your child early and treat it promptly. If you do, they most likely will not have long-term vision problems. Left untreated, it can cause severe vision problems, including legal blindness.\nAmblyopia usually starts between birth and age 7. Symptoms in your child could include:\nSometimes symptoms are not noticeable except in an eye exam.\nAll babies are born with poor eyesight. As they grow older, their vision continues to improve. For good eyesight, both eyes need to provide the same clear, focused image. Some children develop conditions that cause problems with their vision. These problems can cause the child to get a different picture from each eye. The child\u2019s brain naturally tries to fix this problem by blocking out the weaker picture. If the problem is not fixed when the child is young, the child\u2019s brain will always ignore pictures from the weak eye. This causes amblyopia.\nAny condition that prevents the eye from focusing clearly can cause amblyopia. The 3 most common conditions are:\nSome children have a higher risk of having amblyopia. These include children who:\nIf you notice any of the above symptoms in your child, even when they are an infant, call your doctor. They will do an eye exam. They will ask about symptoms, family history, and risk factors.\nOtherwise, children should have an initial eye checkup between the ages of 3 and 5.\nAmblyopia cannot be prevented. But vision loss resulting from it can be avoided. Watch your child\u2019s vision habits. If you have any concerns, call your doctor. When amblyopia is caught and treated early, children should be able to keep most of their vision. If it is left untreated past the age of 10, they will probably have vision problems for the rest of their life. Early detection is the key to preventing vision loss.\nTreatment for amblyopia involves the child using the weaker eye more. This helps the eye get stronger. To make the child use the weaker eye, they will wear an adhesive patch over the stronger eye. Most children wear their patches 2 to 6 hours a day.\nSometimes, eye drops or special glasses are used to blur the vision in the stronger eye. This also makes the weaker eye work harder and strengthens it. Glasses or contact lenses can fix problems with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Surgery may be needed for cataracts, droopy eyelids, or crossed eyes.\nTreatment usually lasts until vision is normal, or until vision stops getting better. For most children, this takes several weeks to several months. A few children need to use eye patches until they are 8 to 10 years old.\nThere\u2019s a small chance that using an eye patch for too long can hurt the strong eye. Children who are wearing eye patches should see their doctor often during the treatment.\nThe first years of life are the most important for eyesight development. During a child\u2019s first 7 to 10 years, connections between the eye and brain are created. It is much more effective to treat amblyopia while those connections are still maturing. After your child\u2019s vision system is fully developed, it is hard to change. If the amblyopia hasn\u2019t been treated, they will most likely have poor vision for life. It won\u2019t be possible to fix it with glasses, patching, or any other treatment.\nOne clinical trial showed that there could be benefits for treating children up to age 17. More research is needed on how treatment could help teenagers or adults.\nDepending on your child\u2019s age, it could be difficult for them to wear an eye patch. If a patch bothers your child, ask your doctor if you have other options. Glasses or eye drops might be a better choice for your child.\nAmblyopia can come back after treatment is finished. It\u2019s important to continue to watch your child for symptoms. If symptoms do come back, treatment will need to be repeated. Some children\u2019s treatment lasts until they are 10 years old.\nNational Eye Institute: Amblyopia\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It\u2019s a common condition. Sometimes people confuse anal fissures withhemorrhoids.\nThe most common symptom of an anal fissure is a shooting pain in the anus and surrounding area. Anal fissures often cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. You may also see blood on the toilet paper after wiping. Anal fissures may also cause itching in the anal area.\nAnal fissures are usually a result of straining during a bowel movement, causing injury to the anal canal. They also can be caused by repeated diarrhea, when blood flow to the area is decreased (in older adults), after childbirth, or in people with Crohn\u2019s disease.\nYour doctor will perform a rectal exam. Usually, a visual exam is all that\u2019s necessary to see the fissure. Your doctor might have to insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the anal canal.\nKeeping bowel movements regular and avoiding constipation can help reduce your chances of an anal fissure. Add more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to your diet to get enough fiber. Drink plenty of fluids and get some exercise in every day to help keep your digestive system moving.\nAbout half of all fissures heal by themselves and need no treatment at all. If fissures don\u2019t heal on their own, other treatments may involve prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers. You may even need Botox injections into the muscle in the anus (called the anal sphincter). Minor surgery to relax the anal muscle can be used as a last resort.\nYour doctor may prescribe stool softeners to make going to the bathroom easier and less painful while the fissure heals. Numbing cream can also make bowel movements less painful. Petroleum jelly, zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, and products like Preparation H can help soothe the area. Instead of toilet paper, use alcohol-free baby wipes that are gentler on the area.\nSitz baths can help heal fissures and make you feel better. Fill the tub with enough lukewarm water to cover your hips and buttocks. Don\u2019t use soap or bubbles or any other products unless prescribed by your doctor. Relax in the sitz bath 2 to 3 times a day for about 10 minutes at a time.\nPeople who develop fissures once are more likely to have them in the future, so it\u2019s important to keep bowel movements regular. If you\u2019ve had a fissure in the past, you may be tempted to hold your bowel movement in to avoid the pain of passing it. But that\u2019s not a good idea.

If your doctor sees a fistula, they will usually try to determine the depth and direction of the fistula. In some cases, your doctor may order an ultrasound or an MRI.

They range from mild to severe. Possible symptoms or problems include:\nAnaphylaxis is most often caused by exposure to an allergen. During a normal reaction, your body produces antibodies to fight the allergen. During a severe reaction, your immune system can panic. This leads to anaphylaxis, which is very dangerous.\nAn allergy to peanuts, for example, can result in anaphylaxis. In order to have an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts, a person must have ingested the protein. The smell of peanuts may cause anxiety, but it doesn\u2019t cause a whole-body reaction.\nAlthough peanut allergies are common, new research suggests they may be preventable in most cases. Recent National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guidelines say that introducing small amounts of peanut foods to children as early as 4 to 6 months may prevent the allergy. These guidelines have been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and championed by the AAFP. New peanut-based products are now available for children within that age range. Talk to your family doctor before introducing this food.\nAccording to Dietary Guidelines for Americans, healthy eating from birth through 23 months can reduce the risk of chronic disease, including lowering the risk of peanut allergy.\nAllergens that may cause anaphylaxis include:\nIf you or someone around you has anaphylaxis, call 911 immediately. Call your doctor if you have milder symptoms of anaphylaxis. They will want to see you whether your symptoms are mild or severe. They can diagnose the cause of the reaction and provide treatment.\nBelow are ways to help prevent or avoid anaphylaxis.\nTreatment for anaphylaxis should begin right away. If you see someone have a reaction, call 911 to get medical help. If the person has an emergency kit with an EpiPen, inject it into the muscle of their arm or leg. An EpiPen is a short-term treatment. The person still should go to the hospital for treatment and care. Certain allergies may require a series of desensitization shots.\nMost people who receive treatment live a normal, full life. If you do not get treatment and symptoms are severe, you could die. After treatment, you should have someone stay with you for 24 hours to make sure another attack does not occur. Talk to your doctor about how to prevent future attacks. They can prescribe an emergency kit and teach you how to use it.

    "article_title": "What is anemia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nAnemia is the most common blood disorder in the United States. It affects your red blood cells and hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. You need iron in order to make hemoglobin. Most people who have anemia have a shortage of iron. This condition is called iron deficiency anemia.\nThere are a few other types of anemia, including:\nMild forms of anemia may not cause any symptoms. Fatigue, or feeling tired, is a common symptom. This is because the hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen. A lack of oxygen reduces energy. It can cause your heart to work harder to pump oxygen. Other common anemia symptoms include:\nContact your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They can diagnose the type and cause of the condition.\nThere are three main reasons why anemia occurs.\nNot being able to produce enough red blood cells can happen for several reasons, including diet, pregnancy, disease, and more.\nDiet\nYour body may not produce enough red blood cells if you lack certain nutrients. Low iron is a common problem. People who don\u2019t eat meat or follow \u201cfad\u201d diets are more at risk of low iron. Infants and toddlers are at risk of getting anemia from a low-iron diet. Not having enough vitamin B12 and folic acid can cause anemia as well.\nAbsorption difficulty\nCertain diseases affect your small intestine\u2018s ability to absorb nutrients. For example, Crohn\u2019s disease andceliac diseasecan cause low iron levels in your body. Some foods, like milk, can prevent your body from absorbing iron. Taking vitamin C can help this. Medicines, such as antacids or prescriptions to reduce acid in your stomach, can affect it as well.\nPregnancy\nPeople who are pregnant or breastfeeding can get anemia. When you\u2019re pregnant, you need more blood (up to 30% more) to share with the baby. If your body lacks iron or vitamin B12, it can\u2019t produce enough red blood cells.\nThe following factors may increase your risk of anemia during pregnancy:\nGrowth spurts\nChildren younger than 3 years of age are prone to anemia. Their bodies grow so fast that they can have a hard time getting or keeping enough iron.\nNormocytic anemia\nNormocytic anemia can be congenital (from birth) or acquired (from a disease or infection). The most common cause of the acquired form is a chronic (long-term) disease. Examples include kidney disease,cancer,rheumatoid arthritis, andthyroiditis. Some medicines can cause normocytic anemia, but this is rare.\nTreatments, such as chemotherapy, can damage your red blood cells and/or bone marrow. Infection caused by a weakened immune system can lead to anemia. You may be born with a condition that destroys or remove red blood cells. Examples include sickle cell disease,thalassemia, and a lack of certain enzymes. Having an enlarged or diseased spleen can cause anemia, too.\nHeavy periods may cause low iron levels in women. Internal bleeding, such as in your digestive or urinary tract, can cause blood loss. This can be caused by conditions such as a stomach ulcer or ulcerative colitis. Other reasons for blood loss include:\nTalk to your doctor if you think you or your child might have anemia. They will do a physical exam and review your health history and symptoms. To diagnose anemia, your doctor will test your blood. This test is called a complete blood count (CBC). Based on the results, they may need to do other tests, such as testing your bone marrow. This can help confirm the cause of anemia or another health condition.\nYou cannot avoid anemia caused by a genetic disease. You often cannot avoid it due to blood loss. If your blood loss is from heavy periods, receiving treatment can help prevent anemia. If your body can\u2019t absorb certain nutrients, such as iron or vitamin B12, talk to your doctor about taking a supplement. This can help manage your levels and prevent anemia.\nA balanced diet can help prevent some types of anemia. Eat foods high in iron to prevent a deficiency.\nFoods high in iron include:\nVitamin C can help your body absorb iron. Try eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits or juice, peppers, and broccoli. Some foods can make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include coffee, tea, milk, egg whites, fiber, and soy protein. Try to avoid these foods if you have iron deficiency anemia.\nFoods high in vitamin B12 include:\nFoods high in folic acid (folate) include:\nPregnant people may be tested for anemia or take an iron supplement to help prevent it. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) has insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and risks of screening all pregnant people for iron deficiency anemia or having them take an iron supplement.\nEvidence also is lacking to measure the benefits and risks of screening children ages 6 to 24 months. To help prevent your child from getting iron deficiency anemia, you can:\nWarning:Keep all products with iron stored out of reach of your child. Iron can be toxic if taken in large amounts.\nThere are many treatment options for anemia. They vary based on the type, cause, and severity, as well as your overall health. The first goal of treatment is to create more healthy red blood cells that can carry enough oxygen to your body. Often this is achieved by increasing your red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin. The other goal is to treat the cause, if possible. For example, if anemia results from losing too much blood, your doctor will need to treat the cause of your blood loss.\nIf you have a type of anemia caused by a deficiency, make changes to your diet. This can increase your nutrient levels or help your body absorb nutrients.\nIn some cases, your doctor can prescribe medicine to help your body produce more red blood cells. Examples include:\nOther forms of anemia require intense treatment. You may need surgery to stop blood loss or have your spleen removed. Other treatments include a blood transfusion or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant.\nTalk to your doctor about how to manage a chronic disease or other health problem that causes anemia.\nFollowing treatment, most people go on to live normal, healthy lives. However, anemia can have lasting, or life-threatening, effects. These are more common if the condition is chronic, severe, or left untreated. They include:\nChildren who have iron deficiency anemia have a higher risk oflead poisoning. They also can develop mental, motor, or behavioral problems over a long time.\nPregnant women who have iron deficiency anemia may have their baby premature or at a low birth weight. There also is a risk of needing a blood transfusion if you lose a lot of blood during delivery. Anemia may be associated withpostpartum depression.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Anemia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Anemia\nLast Updated:March 10, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nYour ankle is the joint that connects your leg to your foot. This joint is made up of bones and connected to three ligaments. These ligaments keep the bones from moving out of place. An ankle sprain happens when one or more of those ligaments is stretched or torn.\nSprained ankles are divided into three grades, based on severity.\nSymptoms of ankle sprains include:\nWith mild sprains, you may have stiffness while walking. That should get better in a few days to a few weeks. People who have moderate and severe sprains may have limits for several weeks. And they may have ankle pain for a year or more.\nAnkle sprains often occur during physical activity. Sometimes they can happen when you walk or run on a rough surface. The unevenness can make you fall, land on your ankle wrong, and sprain it.\nPeople who have high arches in their feet or weak muscles are more likely to sprain their ankles. If you\u2019ve sprained your ankle before, you\u2019re more likely to sprain it again.\nYour doctor can diagnose an ankle sprain. He or she will examine your ankle and ask about your symptoms and activity. The doctor may take an X-ray to confirm your ankle isn\u2019t broken or fractured. Once they diagnose the sprain, your doctor will determine the grade. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. If your ankle doesn\u2019t get better, your doctor may request anMRI. This is a type of image that allows him or her to see the ligaments inside your ankle.\nThere are ways to help prevent an ankle sprain. Certain exercises can strengthen your ankle and the muscles around it. These exercises stabilize your ankle and improve your balance. It is also important to stretch before and after you exercise. Your doctor will show you which exercises are best.\nWear supportive shoes, whether you\u2019ve had an ankle sprain before or not. This helps prevent your foot from twisting or your ankle joint from moving out of place. You may also find it helpful to wear an ankle brace when playing sports, running or jogging. This may add stability to your ankle.\nYou can treat a lot of ankle sprains at home. Doctors recommend the RICE approach (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation), listed below.\nTo relieve pain, your doctor may suggest you take over-the-counter medicine. Examples include acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin, or Nuprin).\nYou\u2019ll need additional treatment for a higher-grade ankle sprain. Your doctor might give you a cast, boot, or brace to wear. This will keep the ligaments and joint in place while they heal. It limits motion, provides protection, and helps reduce pain. You may need to wear it for 2 to 6 weeks. Your doctor may also refer you to physical therapy. The amount and length of time of treatment will depend on the grade of your sprain and your state of health.\nAnkle sprains are common problems, but they do heal. However, depending on the grade of your sprain, you may not be able to return to normal activities right away. Your doctor can provide a time frame for your situation. Once you return to regular activities, you still may need to wear an ankle brace or bandage for support and protection.\nYour doctor or physical therapist may provide a list of ankle exercises for you to do. This will help strengthen your muscles. He or she will tell you when to start the exercises and how long to do them. Depending on the severity of the sprain, you may need to do them for several weeks. It\u2019s important you do the exercises for the amount of time your doctor says.

Your heart may beat too fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradycardia). Your heartbeat may be irregular. This occurs if your heart skips a beat or has an extra beat. Arrhythmias are common. For most people, they are minor and not serious. However, they can be severe or life-threatening. Arrhythmias are more serious if you have other heart problems.\nThere are several types of arrhythmias.

Asperger\u2019s syndrome behaviors will not improve on their own without therapy. As your child progresses through school, therapy may change to reflect your child\u2019s needs at the time. More importantly, ask your therapists how to apply the therapy at home. Children do best when therapy is the same at school and home.\nTherapy is not a one-time treatment. Repetitive therapy helps your child develop appropriate behavior. Children should not be punished for inappropriate behavior. Instead, therapists use incentives and rewards (giving your child extra free time, a healthy snack, or something that is important to them) to encourage appropriate behavior.\nIf your child was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome or ASD, developing relationships for him or her will take practice and effort. A person diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome may not display appropriate emotions (or any emotion), may not understand the irony in a joke, vague concepts, or the simple points of a conversation. Peers may feel like their behavior is eccentric.\nAlthough Asperger\u2019s syndrome or ASD cannot be cured, therapy can help. Your child can be successful at school and in their adult life. Many employers say that the focus and attention a person with Asperger\u2019s syndrome or ASD gives to his or her job is a good thing. Adults diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome or ASD may continue to need therapy or counseling to teach appropriate personal and workplace behavior.\nMedlinePlus: Autism Spectrum Disorder \u2013 Asperger Syndrome\nAARP: What is Occupational Therapy: Everything Caregivers Need to Know\nLast Updated:January 31, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nAsthma is a chronic (long-term) disease of the lungs. It inflames and narrows the airways, making it harder to breathe. These are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. It most often starts in childhood but can affect people of all ages.\nThe airways of people who have asthma are extra sensitive to the things they\u2019re allergic to (allergens). They are also sensitive to certain substances that can be inhaled through the air.\nAsthma symptoms start when irritants cause the lining of the airways to become inflamed (swollen) and narrow. The muscles around the airways can then spasm (contract rapidly). This causes the airways to narrow even more. When the lining of the airways is inflamed, it produces more mucus. The mucus clogs the airways and further blocks the flow of air. When these symptoms are severe and not easily controlled, it\u2019s called an \u201casthma attack.\u201d\nAn asthma \u201cflare up,\u201d or attack, happens when excess mucus causes your air tubes to swell and tighten. Asthma attacks can be mild, moderate, or severe. Symptoms of an asthma attack include the following:\nSevere asthma attacks can be life threatening. Call your doctor right away if you experience any or all of the following issues. He or she may want you to seek emergency care right away.\nAn exact cause of asthma has not been determined. Scientists and researchers think that genetic and environmental causes lead to asthma. These may include:\nMany things can cause your asthma to flare up, including:\nFor some people, strong emotions or stress can trigger an asthma attack. Pay attention to the way these things affect your asthma. Work with your doctor to figure out which things bother your asthma.\nYour doctor will ask you for your medical history, especially any family history of allergies and asthma. Keep a record of your asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Your doctor will want to know what seems to trigger and worsen your symptoms.\nHe or she will perform a physical exam. They will listen to your breathing and look for signs of allergies and asthma. These can include wheezing, swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).\nThey will conduct a spirometry test. You will breathe into a machine called a spirometer to see how well your lungs work. It records the amount of air and how quickly you breathe in and out. Your doctor may need to perform other tests, such as:\nAsthma cannot be prevented, and there is no cure. You can help avoid asthma attacks by avoiding the triggers that can start an asthma attack. Examples of common allergens and irritants include:\nYour doctor will work with you to create an action plan to control your asthma. The plan will include recognizing your symptoms and avoiding your asthma triggers. It will give guidance on taking medicines properly. Your plan will help you track your level and control and know when to seek emergency care when needed.\nYour doctor may have you use a peak flow meter to track your symptoms. A peak flow meter is a handheld device that measures your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). This is how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. Measuring your peak flow regularly can help you tell whether your asthma is getting worse.\nAsthma medicines are divided into two groups: controller medicines (to prevent attacks) and rescue medicines (to treat attacks). Your doctor will talk to you about these medicines and what to do if you have an asthma attack. Ask your doctor for written instructions about how to take your medicines. The following are examples of medicines most commonly used by people who have asthma:\nController Medicines (to prevent attacks, usually taken daily)\nQuick-Relief Medicines (to treat an attack, usually only taken when an attack occurs)\nWith the treatments available today, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They may have few symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma.\nTreating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care. They can even be fatal.\nAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology: Asthma\nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute: Asthma\nLast Updated:September 30, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

However, we know plenty about what triggers an asthma attack. People with asthma are commonly sensitive to:\nOther triggers include:\nNewer research suggests that asthma is tied toobesity(being significantly overweight).\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam on your child. They will look at your child\u2019s medical history and perform a breathing test called spirometry. Spirometry measures how much air you breathe out after taking a deep breath. It is painless and can be done in the doctor\u2019s office. Your doctor will give your child a disposable mouthpiece that attaches to a tube. That tube attaches to a machine that records their breathing. There is usually an image on the machine\u2019s screen, such as birthday candles or a wall of bricks. As your child exhales, the candles will go out (or the bricks will fall down). Your child will be asked to repeat the test more than once during their doctor\u2019s visit to get accurate results. Your doctor will likely give your child a dose of an inhaled prescription medicine that opens up their airway for the test.\nOther, more involved tests may include:\nAsthma cannot be prevented. However, your child can reduce their asthma attacks by learning their triggers and avoiding them. For example, limit your child\u2019s exposure to pets and cigarette smoke, and have them stay indoors on days when air pollution is bad. Avoid wearing strong perfume or cologne around your child. Strong smells can trigger an asthma attack.\nThere is no cure for asthma. It can often be a lifelong condition. However, you can improve your child\u2019s quality of life by knowing and avoiding their triggers, reminding them to take their prescription medicine, and following the written asthma plan their doctor gives them. The plan gives details on their triggers and what to do if they feel the start of an attack.\nThere are two types of asthma medicines. The first are maintenance medicines (taken daily to keep their asthma under control). The second are quick-acting medicines (usually in the form of an inhaler to bring them immediate relief when they have an asthma attack). Some people take their medicine with a nebulizer. A nebulizer changes liquid medicine into a fine mist that is inhaled through a mask or mouthpiece. Your doctor will determine which is best for your child.\nLiving with asthma as a child can be difficult. An asthma attack can interfere with physical activity (playtime and sports), sleep, and cause children to miss school or be hospitalized. Teach your child to recognize their asthma triggers and to plan for those triggers if they can\u2019t avoid them. Also, teach your child to keep their quick-acting medicine nearby in the event of an asthma attack. With proper monitoring and medicine, your child can enjoy a full and active life.\nLast Updated:July 1, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nAtherosclerosis causes plaque to collect in your arteries. (Plaque is made of fat,cholesterol, calcium, and other things naturally found in your blood. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body.) The plaque hardens, making your arteries narrow. Sometimes arteries become completely blocked with plaque. This limits how much blood can flow to the rest of your body.\nAtherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease. It\u2019s a slow disease that may get worse as you get older. It\u2019s sometimes called \u201chardening of the arteries.\u201d\nMany people don\u2019t know they have atherosclerosis until they have a medical emergency caused when blood can\u2019t get through the arteries. This can cause chest pain, breathing difficulties, and stroke. Some people also have issues with their kidneys, intestines, and legs.\nDoctors don\u2019t know what causes atherosclerosis. However, it may first develop when the inner layers of your arteries become damaged. Many things can cause this damage, including:\nYour doctor will talk with you about your family history. They also will do a physical exam. This exam may include listening to your heart or other areas of high blood flow. Certain sounds may indicate you have a problem with blood flowing through your arteries. Your doctor also may check your pulse in your leg or foot. This will show them how well your blood is traveling through your arteries. If they feel a weak pulse or no pulse in one of those areas, it may mean you have a blocked artery.\nYour doctor may order tests to check for atherosclerosis. These may include:\nAn important way to prevent atherosclerosis is by living a healthy lifestyle. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, and exercise. These changes may help you lose weight (if necessary), lower your LDL \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, increase your HDL \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol, and lower your blood pressure. They may also help control your blood sugar, which is important if you have diabetes.\nIf you smoke,stop smoking. This is the most important step you can take to decrease your risk of atherosclerosis.\nYour doctor has a way to calculate your risk of developing atherosclerosis based on your age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors. If you\u2019re at higher risk, your doctor may recommend you take a statin. Statins are medicines that slow down your body\u2019s production of cholesterol. They also remove cholesterol buildup from your arteries.\nYour doctor will likely recommend lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and exercise, to treat atherosclerosis. If those don\u2019t work, they may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. For example, if you are 50 to 59 years of age and have a high risk for heart disease, your doctor may want you to take a low dose of aspirin each day. Aspirin helps keep your blood from forming clots that can clog your arteries. However, it isn\u2019t appropriate for everyone. Don\u2019t start taking aspirin without talking to your doctor first.\nIf you have severe atherosclerosis or have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open your blocked arteries or surgery to go around (bypass) the blockage.\nLiving a healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of atherosclerosis.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute:\u00a0Atherosclerosis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Atherosclerosis\nLast Updated:August 2, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behaviors. It used to also be called attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADHD is common in children and adults. People who have ADHD have trouble paying attention in school, at home, or at work. Even when they try to concentrate, they find it hard to pay attention. Children who have ADHD may be more active or impulsive than what is typical for their age. These behaviors cause problems in friendships, learning, and behavior. For this reason, children who have ADHD are sometimes seen as being \u201cdifficult\u201d or as having behavior problems.\nMost of what we hear about ADHD is how it affects children. Not as much is known about the way ADHD affects adults. Adults who have ADHD often are diagnosed when they find out their children have ADHD. For adults to be diagnosed, they must have developed symptoms prior to age 12. ADHD may run in families. Hyperactivity is more common in boys. However, other symptoms (especially inattention) are more common in girls. Some people who have ADHD may have other conditions as well. These could include learning disabilities, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), bipolar disorder, and Tourette syndrome. Also, these conditions can be mistaken for ADHD, so it is important to work with health care professionals for a diagnosis.\nPeople who have ADHD have difficulty organizing things, listening to instructions, remembering details, and/or controlling their behavior. This can make it difficult to get along with other people at home, at school, or at work.\nA person with ADHD who has difficulty paying attention will have 6 or more of the following symptoms:\nA person with ADHD who is hyperactive or impulsive will have at least 6 of the following symptoms:\nPeople who have ADHD do not make enough chemicals in certain areas in the brain that are important for organizing thoughts. Without enough of these chemicals, the organizing centers of the brain don\u2019t work well. This is thought to be the cause of ADHD. The shortage of chemicals may be due to a person\u2019s genes (research shows that ADHD is more common in people who have a close family member with the disorder), environment, or physical development. Recent research also links smoking and other substance abuse during pregnancy to ADHD. Exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead, also can be a factor.\nADHD is not caused by eating sugary foods.\nA doctor will be better able to diagnose ADHD when getting information about your child\u2019s behavior. It may take information from several people who know your child (teachers, daycare providers). Your doctor also may have forms or checklists that you and your child\u2019s teacher can complete. This will help you and your doctor compare your child\u2019s behavior with other children\u2019s behavior.\nUnfortunately, many people try to diagnose themselves by using a quiz or a checklist they find in a magazine or see on TV. However, it\u2019s best to see your doctor. Some of the questions your doctor may ask you or about your child include:\nYour doctor will probably want to test your child\u2019s vision and hearing if these tests haven\u2019t been done recently. A person diagnosed with ADHD will have had symptoms for at least 6 months.\nAlso, it might be hard for your doctor to tell if your child has ADHD. Many children who have ADHD aren\u2019t hyperactive in the doctor\u2019s office. Your doctor may ask you to fill out a questionnaire regarding your child\u2019s behavior patterns. Eventually, your doctor may want your child to see someone who specializes in children\u2019s behavior.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that any child 4 through 18 years of age should be evaluated for ADHD if they have academic or behavioral problems, and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.\nADHD cannot be prevented or avoided. However, doctors believe that avoiding smoking and substance abuse during pregnancy can lower the baby\u2019s risk of developing ADHD. Still, there\u2019s no guarantee that doing everything right during pregnancy will protect a baby from developing ADHD. Additionally, exposure to environmental toxins, such as lead, also can be a risk factor for ADHD.\nSome of the medicines used to treat ADHD are called psychostimulants. They include methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, and a drug that combines dextroamphetamine and amphetamine. These medicines have a stimulating effect in most people. However, they have a calming effect in people who have ADHD. These medicines improve attention and concentration and decrease impulsive and overactive behaviors. Your doctor may consider other non-stimulant medicines, such as atomoxetine, clonidine, desipramine, imipramine, and bupropion.\nAll medicines have side effects. Psychostimulants may decrease your appetite and cause a stomachache or a headache. The loss of appetite can cause weight loss in some people. This side effect seems to be more common in children. Some people have insomnia (trouble sleeping). Other possible side effects include fast heartbeat, chest pain, or vomiting. To avoid or reduce the side effects of psychostimulants, follow these tips:\nIt\u2019s important to take the medicine the way your doctor prescribes it. Follow your doctor\u2019s advice, even if you think the medicine isn\u2019t working. Medicines used to treat ADHD have been shown to improve a person\u2019s ability to do specific tasks. This includes paying attention or having more self-control. The length of time a person will need to take medicine depends on each person. Some people only need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years. Others need treatment for many more years. In some people, ADHD may continue into adolescence and adulthood.\nPeople who have ADHD should be checked regularly by their doctors. If your child has ADHD, your doctor may suggest that they take a break from their medicines once in a while to see if the medicine is still necessary. School breaks or summer vacation might be best.\nAAFP suggests several treatment recommendations. Preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) should be treated with behavior therapy as the first line of treatment. The medicine methylphenidate may be prescribed if behavior treatment does not provide significant improvement. Your doctor may recommend this medicine if ADHD is interfering with the child\u2019s friendships, home, and school life at a moderate to severe level. Elementary school-aged children (6-11 years of age) may benefit from FDA-approved medicine for ADHD and behavioral therapy. Adolescents (12-18 years of age) are more likely to benefit from treatment with FDA-approved medicine but should also incorporate behavioral therapy to help build and maintain organizational skills. In all cases, medicine doses should be measured and adjusted to achieve maximum benefit with few adverse effects.\nSymptoms of ADHD often get better as children grow older and learn to adjust. Hyperactivity usually stops in the late teenage years. But about half of children who have ADHD continue to be easily distracted, have mood swings, hot tempers, and are unable to complete tasks. Children who have loving, supportive parents or guardians who work together with school staff, mental health workers, and their doctor have the best chance of becoming well-adjusted adults.\nChildren who have ADHD may be difficult to parent. They may have trouble understanding directions. Their constant state of activity can be challenging for adults. Some children benefit from counseling or from structured therapy. Families may benefit from talking with a specialist in managing ADHD-related behavior and learning problems.\nChildren who have ADHD also tend to need more structure and clearer expectations. You may need to change your home life a bit to help your child. Here are some things you can do to help:\nIf your child has ADHD, it is a good idea to work with their school to help them be more successful. This could include putting together an individualized education plan (IEP) for your child or a 504 plan. These plans ensure that your child is receiving any accommodations they may need to help them learn in the most appropriate environment.\nIf your doctor thinks you have ADHD as an adult, he or she may suggest counseling. Your doctor also may recommend testing and counseling with someone who specializes in treating ADHD. You can learn ways to change your work environment and keep distractions to a minimum. Organizational tools can help you learn how to focus on activities at work and at home. Many people who have ADHD find counseling helpful. A lifetime of ADHD behaviors and problems can cause low self-esteem and problems with relationships. Individual counseling and support groups may help you with these problems.\nAmerican Psychiatric Association: Help With ADHD\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness: Not Just a Childhood Disorder: How ADHD Affects Adults\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nLast Updated:April 26, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It affects your social, behavioral, and communication skills. People who have autism start showing signs at an early age. Autism levels vary from person to person. Because of this, doctors often refer to autism as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). People who have mild symptoms may be considered \u201chigh-functioning.\u201d\nWhat used to be called Asperger\u2019s syndrome (AS) is the most common ASD. It is a form of \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autism. Typically, people who have what was formerly known as AS have a normal-to-high IQ. They may exhibit a special skill or area of interest. Their verbal language development is considered normal. However, people who have AS can have trouble using language correctly in social situations. They often have a hard time with nonverbal communication, such as making eye contact, reading facial expressions, and using body gestures. General social skills, such as developing relationships and adjusting to change, also can be affected. People who have AS can learn these skills through behavior and communication therapy.\nPeople with autism can have a range of symptoms. Some are common, and some depend on the severity of the disorder. Your child may:\nApproximately 20% of children who have autism develop normally for the first 1 to 2 years of their lives. Then, they experience what doctors call a regression. This means that they lose skills that they had before, such as the ability to talk.\nHowever, some autistic children gain special skills. For example, they may be able to do complex math problems in their heads. Abilities like these are less common.\nDoctors are not sure what causes autism. Some studies suggest that it is genetic (runs in families). Certain health problems or things in your child\u2019s environment may play a role. Kids who are born to older parents have an increased risk of autism. Boys are more likely to have autism than girls. In most cases, the cause of a child\u2019s autism is not known. As doctors continue to study autism, they may learn more about what causes it.\nVaccines do not cause autism. This includes the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vaccines are an important part of your child\u2019s health. If you have concerns about the safety of vaccines, talk to your doctor.\nThere is no lab test that can detect autism. Talk to your doctor if your child does not behave as expected for their age. If the doctor suspects autism, they may suggest seeing a child psychiatrist or other pediatric specialist. A specialist can observe your child to look for signs of autism.\nSome children who have autism also have anintellectual disability. This means that their intellectual abilities function well below average. It causes developmental delays in reading, writing, and math, for example. This can make it hard to diagnose autism. Children with autism do not respond to questions the same way other kids do. An expert can give your child special tests to learn more about your child\u2019s condition.\nMore children are being diagnosed with autism. It is not clear if this means that more childrenhaveautism. It may mean that parents, doctors, and teachers are better at recognizing the signs of autism.\nChildren do not \u201coutgrow\u201d autism, and there is no cure. Medicine alone cannot treat autism. It can help manage some symptoms, such as aggression or sleeplessness. Research shows that some children benefit from intense behavior and language therapy. The earlier the therapy starts, the better the results. With therapy, your child\u2019s symptoms may improve as they get older. Talk to your doctor about what kind of treatment is best for your child.\nPeople who have autism can live normal, healthy lives. They may see and react to things in different ways. They may have a harder time paying attention. As a parent, you may need to find other ways to teach and connect with your child. Work with the doctor or specialist to improve your child\u2019s lifestyle. This could mean creating routines or habits, so your child feels safe and relaxed. It is important to do this at a young age. It can help your child cope better when they become an adult.\nAsk your doctor to recommend a counselor or support group.

In rare cases, certain strains of the virus can transform into a human virus and spread to people. Most people who get infected with bird flu have close contact with infected birds or bird droppings. It is mostly a problem in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.\nAccording to theCDC, in 2024, sporadic cases of a serious bird flu virus have been found in animals in the United States, Canada, and other countries, but the risk to most people is still low. The H5 bird flu is common in wild birds and is causing problems for poultry and dairy cows in the U.S. There have been a few cases of people getting sick from a different type of bird flu, but the illness was not severe.\nSymptoms usually appear 2 to 7 days after exposure. They are similar to what you experience with seasonal flu. Common symptoms include:\nMore serious symptoms can include:\nIn some cases, avian flu can cause mental confusion and seizures.

It can also spread if you touch the surface of where an infected bird has been.\nThe virus spreads when your contaminated hands touch your nose, eyes, or mouth. The virus can also be inhaled through small moisture droplets or dust particles. It can only be passed from human to human if it transforms into a human flu virus. This is rare.\nIt is also possible to get the virus from undercooked meat or eggs from infected birds. Meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0 F. Eggs should be cooked until the whites and the yolks are firm.\nYour risk of getting bird flu is higher if:\nAvian flu is commonly diagnosed during a visit to the doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask you questions about your symptoms. They will ask you about recent events that may have put you in contact with a contaminated bird or human. Lab tests are needed to confirm the virus. Your doctor will take a sample of mucus from your nose or the back of your throat with a long cotton swab. That swab will be sent to the lab for testing.\nThe best way to avoid the virus is to avoid direct contact with birds in high-risk areas. This includes when traveling to the countries most affected and visiting live-animal markets. Avoiding contact with a human known to have the virus also is a good way to avoid illness. As with all viruses, regular hand washing is the best way to control your exposure. If you can\u2019t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands. If possible, use a tissue to cover a cough or sneeze.\nIf you know you have the disease, do not expose others at work, school, and the community. Try to separate yourself from the rest of your family at home. People who work with live poultry should follow their work safety guidelines.\nBecause Avian flu is rare, a\u00a0vaccine\u00a0to prevent it is not available to the public. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a vaccine they are storing in case the disease becomes widespread in the U.S.\nSome antiviral\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicines can lessen or shorten the symptoms of the virus. However, they won\u2019t prevent or eliminate the virus. Doctors treat the symptoms by recommending over-the-counter medicines, extra fluids, and rest. For more serious symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. Hospitalization could involve intravenous fluids (given through a small needle inserted into your vein) and breathing treatments.\nLiving with avian flu may mean a week or two of living with mild symptoms that get better over time.

It is caused by a single-cell parasite called Babesia. The parasite is carried by deer ticks, the same ticks that carryLyme disease.\nBabesiosis infections in humans used to be rare, but the number of cases is increasing. Most reported infections are in the northeastern states and the upper Midwest.\nSymptoms of babesiosis\nSymptoms of babesiosis usually start 1 to 8 weeks after you are bitten by a tick. Some people may not have any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are often similar to symptoms of the flu:\nIn young, healthy adults, the infection usually isn\u2019t severe. But the illness can quickly become serious and can even cause death. Babesiosis could be life-threatening in people who:\nPeople get babesiosis when an infected tick bites them. The Babesia parasite is usually spread when the tick is in its nymph (pre-adult) stage. At that stage, the tick is the size of a poppy seed. It can be hard to detect a tick this small.\nTicks live in areas with a lot of plant life, such as wooded areas or fields. They sit near the top of grassy plants and low bushes. They wait there for people or animals to brush up against them. Ticks can crawl on your clothes or body for several hours before attaching to the skin.\nTicks can attach to any part of your body. They are usually found in hard-to-see areas, including the armpits, groin, or scalp. An infected tick needs to be attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours before it passes the parasite on to you.\nPeople who spend time in outdoor areas where ticks are common are at higher risk of getting tick-borne diseases.\nThough rare, it is possible to get babesiosis through a blood transfusion. It is also possible for an infected mother to pass the parasite to her baby. This can happen during pregnancy or delivery. This is also rare.\nHow is babesiosis diagnosed?\nYour doctor will look at a sample of your blood under a microscope. If you have babesiosis, your doctor will be able to see the parasite in your red blood cells. They might test your blood for other infections that could be causing your symptoms. This includes other diseases ticks can carry, such as Lyme disease. It is possible to have more than one tick-borne illness at a time.\nThe best way to prevent babesiosis and other tick-borne diseases is to avoid being bitten by ticks. When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:\nDuring the months of May through September, stay away from places where ticks are common. This is especially important if you have:\nWhat do I do if I find a tick on my skin?\nDon\u2019t panic. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick back out on its own. These methods are not effective.\nWash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Monitor how you\u2019re feeling for the next month or two. Call your doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened.\nPeople who have healthy immune systems and only mild cases of babesiosis usually don\u2019t need treatment. The body fights the infection on its own. People with more severe cases are treated with antibiotics. If you develop shortness of breath or other symptoms during treatment, tell your doctor right away. If you have a severe case of babesiosis or a weak immune system, you may need to go to a hospital.\nLiving with babesiosis\nMany people infected with babesiosis don\u2019t have any symptoms. They don\u2019t even know they have it. Those who experience symptoms can be treated with antibiotics. They usually make a full and complete recovery.\nPeople at risk of a more severe infection could experience complications. The most common is hemolytic anemia. This happens when the Babesia parasite destroys red blood cells faster than the body can make new ones. It can lead to jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and dark urine.\nOther complications could include:\nIf you experience any of these issues, get medical help right away.\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Babesiosis\nLast Updated:May 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

That\u2019s the tube that food travels down when you eat. It connects your throat to your stomach.\nA section of muscles separates your esophagus from your stomach. Its job is to keep acid from your stomach from coming back into your esophagus. If those muscles don\u2019t close the right way, acid goes back into your esophagus. This is known asgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Over time, this acid can damage the lining of your esophagus. It also can make the tiny cells in your esophagus change. If this happens, it\u2019s called Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Although uncommon, Barrett\u2019s esophagus can lead tocancer.\nBarrett\u2019s esophagus doesn\u2019t cause symptoms. Instead, it\u2019s the symptoms of GERD that typically lead your doctor to discovering you have it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to tell your doctor if you have GERD 3 or more times a week. Symptoms of GERD include:\nRepeat damage from stomach acid causes Barrett\u2019s esophagus. People who have GERD have a higher risk of getting it. Also, people who are smokers, have obesity, or older than 50 years of age are at greater risk. Barrett\u2019s esophagus is more common in white and Hispanic men.\nIf you have GERD, your doctor likely will monitor you for Barrett\u2019s esophagus. People who have severe GERD may need an endoscopy. This is an outpatient procedure to look at your esophagus and check for damage. For this test, you are given medicine to relax. Then the doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube in your throat. He or she may take a tissue sample to biopsy. This can detect abnormal cells, which can lead to cancer.\nIf the test shows normal cells, your doctor will recommend a follow-up endoscopy every 3 to 5 years. If the test shows abnormal cells, you may need an endoscopy once a year.\nOne of the complications of Barrett\u2019s esophagus is esophageal strictures (when the esophagus becomes very narrow). One symptom of this is difficulty swallowing. When the doctor performs an endoscopy for that symptom, they often will find and diagnose Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\nYou can help prevent Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, such as:\nAvoiding foods that trigger heartburn. Common ones are coffee, chocolate, peppermint, and alcohol. Greasy, spicy, or tomato-based foods can cause heartburn as well.\nThe main form of treatment is a group of medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These help relieve pain and reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. They keep Barrett\u2019s esophagus from getting worse. In severe cases, surgery may be done to stop reflux and keep stomach acid out of the esophagus.\nThere is no cure for Barrett\u2019s esophagus.

If the vagina were the face of a clock, these glands would be found at about 4 and 8 o\u2019clock. Normally they\u2019re invisible. They make a small amount of fluid that lubricates the vaginal lips. If a flap of skin grows over the opening of one of the glands, the fluid backs up. It causes a round swelling called a cyst. The\u00a0cyst\u00a0can grow from the size of a penny to larger than an orange. Most don\u2019t get bigger than a golf ball.\nYou may notice a round bulge on one of your vaginal lips, near the opening of the vagina. It may be painless or slightly tender. It may stay the same size or may slowly grow larger. Cysts that get infected are usually very tender. They usually appear quickly. In more severe cases, walking or sexual intercourse may be painful.\nWhile most aren\u2019t, some Bartholin\u2019s gland cysts can be infected. Your doctor may want to check the fluid in the cyst. Most infected cysts (called abscesses) contain the normal\u00a0bacteria\u00a0(germs) found on your skin. Some are caused by bacteria that are transmitted sexually.\nIf your Bartholin\u2019s gland cyst is small, you may not notice it. Once it grows large or becomes infected, you will notice symptoms. Your doctor will be able to diagnose the cyst by looking at it.\nThere is no sure way to prevent a Bartholin\u2019s gland cyst from forming. Good hygiene may play a role in prevention. However, sometimes the cysts appear no matter how good your personal hygiene. If you think you have one, tell your doctor right away. This way, you can get early and effective treatment.\nTreatment depends on the size of the cyst, how painful it is, if it\u2019s infected, and your age. You can often treat a small Bartholin cyst by soaking in a few inches of warm water (called a sitz bath) several times a day for 3 or 4 days. Adding Epsom salt or sitz salt can help even more. This allows the cyst to rupture and drain with little pain or discomfort.\nIn rare cases, the doctor can perform a minor procedure in the office. The doctor makes an incision and puts a small tube (called a catheter) into the cyst. The catheter stays in place for 4 to 6 weeks, draining the fluid. While the catheter is in, you can continue normal activity. However, ask your doctor if it\u2019s safe to have sexual activity during this time. At the end of treatment, your doctor easily removes the catheter in his or her office.\nAnother procedure is when the doctor makes a small cut in the cyst to drain the fluid. He or she will place stitches at the edge of the cyst to allow a small opening to form. This procedure is called a marsupialization. You may have light discharge for a few weeks. Panty liners should be all you need to take care of this discharge.\nLess common procedures involve using a laser or having surgery to remove the entire gland. Both of these are usually performed in a hospital as same-day surgery.\nIt\u2019s possible for Bartholin\u2019s gland cysts to come back after treatment. This can happen even years later. If so, your doctor can treat the cyst again.

They have 6 legs and are about 1/5 of an inch long. They range in color from white to brown, and look dark red after feeding. Bedbugs feed on blood during the night and hide during the day. They prefer human blood, but also will feed on other mammals, such as dogs or cats.\nBedbugs live in dry, dark openings, such as mattress seams. Mattresses are ideal because bedbugs feed at night. However, they live in more places than just mattresses. They can live in gaps in your furniture, walls, or floors, then crawl into your bed at night. Places such as hotels, apartments, dorms, and shelters are more likely to be infested with bedbugs. This is because more people come and go in these places. Bedbugs can travel from place to place on clothing, luggage, furniture, and used bedding.\nBedbug bites show up as small, swollen, red bumps. They may or may not have a bite mark in the center. The bites are very itchy. It is common to have several bites at a time, often in a straight row on your skin.\nOther signs that you have bedbugs are:\nThe best time to search for live bedbugs is in the middle of the night when they come out to feed.\nBedbugs are a growing problem in the United States. One cause could be an increase in international travel. This leads to people bringing bedbugs back in their luggage or on their clothes. The change in pesticides is another possible cause. Chemicals that used to get rid of bedbugs in the past have been replaced with milder chemicals that do not harm bedbugs. This has allowed the bedbug population in the United States to grow.\nA doctor can usually diagnose bedbug bites. You should call your doctor right away if:\nYou may have an infection or a severe allergic reaction.\nInsect repellent does not keep bedbugs away. The best way to prevent them is to avoid bringing them into your home. When you travel, be sure to inspect your bed for signs of bedbugs before you sleep in it. Check your luggage for bed bugs before and after you travel. Inspect all used furniture before you bring it home. If you buy used clothes, bring them home in plastic bags and wash them right away in hot water. Try to keep bedrooms clean and picked up. Dirt and clutter give bedbugs more places to hide.\nBedbug bites should go away within 2 weeks. You can apply an over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream or lotion on the bites to relieve the itchiness and swelling. An OTC antihistamine pill or cream called diphenhydramine (brand name: Benadryl) can relieve itchiness as well. It\u2019s important to avoid scratching your bites as much as possible. Scratching can damage your skin, which can cause an infection.\nIf an OTC treatment doesn\u2019t help, you may need to call your doctor. They can order a prescription-strength medicine to treat your symptoms. They also will prescribe an antibiotic if you have an infection.\nBedbugs can be a terrible nuisance, but they have not been shown to spread disease.\nIf you have bedbugs in your home, wash all of your clothes and bedding in hot water. The water temperature must be at least 120\u00b0F to kill the bedbugs. Then, dry them in a hot dryer. If possible, avoid taking your laundry to a public laundromat or dry cleaner. This can lead to a bedbug outbreak.\nVacuum all of your luggage and furniture, including your mattress and box springs. If anything is infested, either replace it or cover it with plastic. Dark plastic works better. Then, place it in a dry spot with direct sunlight. The hotter it is the more bedbugs will die from the heat. Keep the item in sunlight for at least 24 hours. Afterward, fix any cracks in your furniture. Fill and seal any cracks or holes in the walls or floors.\nIf it is cold outside, you can freeze the infested items instead. Place them in a dry, shaded spot outside. Freezing will take 2 to 4 days at 0\u00b0F and about 7 days at 20\u00b0F.\nIf your infestation is severe, you may need to contact a pest control professional. Ask questions about what chemicals they use. Be sure to keep children and pets away during the treatment.\nLast Updated:March 10, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can affect all or part of the muscles in your face. In rare cases, both sides of your face may be affected. Bell\u2019s palsy occurs when your facial nerve (or 7th cranial nerve) is damaged. The facial nerve carries signals for movement, taste, and other information to and from your face. When this nerve is damaged, the signals between your face and brain do not work as well.

It causes you to feel dizzy for a short period or longer. It comes on suddenly. It is the most common form of vertigo and the easiest to treat.\nYou might feel like the room is spinning or that your surroundings are moving. This feeling is called vertigo. BPPV is associated with feelings of vertigo when you move a certain way. This could be when you turn your head, stand up, roll over in bed, or lie down. Even moving your eyes quickly can trigger dizziness. You might also feel nauseated. The\u00a0nausea\u00a0and dizziness usually go away in a few seconds. Sometimes it can last longer. BPPV is bothersome, but it\u2019s rarely serious.\nYour inner ear contains tiny calcium particles that help you keep your balance. When you move your head, the calcium particles stimulate your nerves. The nerves send your brain a signal telling it which direction your head is moving. Normally, these particles are distributed evenly in the inner ear\u2019s 3 canals.\nSometimes, the particles get displaced. When this happens, the nerves tell your brain that your head has moved more than it has. This incorrect signal causes vertigo.\nBPPV is most often associated with aging. Other causes include a family history, an ear infection, or a head injury.\nYour doctor may suspect BPPV if you feel dizzy when you move your head or body in certain ways. He or she will conduct a physical exam and ask you about your symptoms. They may order tests to rule out other causes of your vertigo. These could include different types of tests to provide an image of your inner ear and head.\nThe primary thing you can do to prevent or avoid BPPV is to avoid head positions that trigger it. Also, talk to your doctor about preventing ear infections.\nYour doctor can show you some easy head movements that will help relieve BPPV. These movements help shift the particles out of the inner ear canals and into areas where they will not cause vertigo. Doing these movements can stop the symptoms. They may keep the dizziness from coming back.\nIf your BPPV is caused by an ear infection, your doctor may be able to suggest antihistamines. Other medicine to treat the dizziness includes anticholinergics, meclizine,\u00a0or scopolamine.\nBPPV can be bothersome and uncomfortable. But the simple head maneuvers usually help the symptoms go away.

The condition affects the prostate gland in men. The enlargement isn\u2019t caused by cancer or infection.\nThe prostate makes semen. It is located between the bladder (where urine is stored) and the urethra (the tube urine passes through). As men age, the prostate gland slowly gets bigger. As it gets bigger, it may press on the urethra. This can cause a slower, weaker urine stream.\nMost symptoms of BPH start gradually. They include:\nThese symptoms can be caused by other things besides BPH. They may be signs of more serious diseases, such as a bladder infection or bladder cancer. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms. They can decide which tests to use to find the possible cause.\nSevere BPH without treatment can lead to bladder and kidney infections.\nThe exact cause of BPH isn\u2019t well understood. It appears to be related to aging. About 50% of men over age 50 have BPH. Up to 90% of men older than 80 have it. The following factors could increase your risk of BPH:\nChanging male hormone levels as a man ages may also be to blame.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They will do a rectal exam to check your prostate. For this, your doctor will put a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. They will feel the size of your prostate gland.\nYour doctor may do blood or urine tests to make sure that your prostate problem is benign. An ultrasound exam or a biopsy of the prostate may also help in the \u00a0diagnosis.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid BPH. Exercise, controlling your type 2 diabetes, and losing weight may reduce your risk of BPH.\nTreatment for BPH depends on what symptoms you have and how severe they are. Options include lifestyle changes, medicine, minimally invasive procedures, and surgery.\nIf your symptoms are mild or only slightly bothersome, you can usually control them with simple changes. These include:\nMedicine\nYour doctor can prescribe different medicines to treat BPH. Some of these improve urine flow or reduce blockages in the bladder. Others stop or shrink the growth of the prostate. Sometimes a combination of different medicines is used. Your doctor will recommend medicine based on your symptoms and condition.\nMinimally invasive procedures\nMinimally invasive treatment does not involve surgery. These treatments use heat to destroy prostate tissue that is pressing on the urethra. They can usually be done in the doctor\u2019s office. This is done by inserting a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) through the urethra to reach the prostate. These treatments may require local, regional, or general anesthesia.\nThese treatments relieve symptoms. They do not cure BPH. Your doctor will consider your symptoms and overall health when deciding what procedure you should have.\nSurgery\nSurgery is the most effective treatment for BPH. It is a last resort when other treatments fail. This is also the best way to diagnose and cure early cancer of the prostate. Surgery is usually done through the urethra, leaving no scars. Surgery does have risks. These include bleeding, infection or impotence. Risks are generally small.\nBPH is not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. There are also some complications that can occur. These include:\nSome men have urinary symptoms that are not related to BPH.

More common reasons include minor things, such as being tired or high caffeine use. Serious reasons might include neurological diseases. Blepharospasm affects women more than men. It may run in families.\nSymptoms of blepharospasm include repeated, uncontrolled eye twitching or blinking. The twitching often happens during times you are overly tired, stressed, or anxious. It can also happen when you\u2019re exposed to bright light and sunlight. It might get better when you\u2019re sleeping or concentrating on a task.\nThe uncontrollable twitching can become worse over time.

Bloating occurs in your abdomen (stomach). It happens when your\u00a0gastrointestinal\u00a0(GI) tract is filled with air or gas from what you eat, your lifestyle, or for medical reasons. The GI tract runs from the mouth to the anus (bottom). It includes your entire digestive system. When you are bloated, you feel as if you\u2019ve eaten a big meal and there is no room in your stomach. Your stomach feels full and tight. It can be uncomfortable or painful. Your stomach may look bigger. It can make your clothes fit tighter. The good news is that certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can reduce that awful feeling.\nCommon symptoms of bloating include stomach pain, discomfort, and gas (flatulence). You may also burp or belch frequently or have abdominal rumbling or gurgling.\nHowever, if you have any of the following symptoms, along with severe bloating, call your doctor:\nBloating happens when the GI tract becomes filled with air or gas.

If it happens all the time, your doctor may order other tests. These could include an imaging test to look inside your abdomen. This could be an X-ray or\u00a0CT\u00a0scan.\nThere are many ways to prevent and avoid bloating:\nFor temporary bloating, ask your doctor about over-the-counter medicines that relieve gas and bloating. These could include simethicone or charcoal caps. Probiotics (such as some types of yogurts), and certain herbal ingredients can relieve your discomfort, too. Herbal ingredients include peppermint and chamomile tea, anise, caraway, coriander, fennel, and turmeric.\nPlace a hot water bottle or compress on your stomach, or even take a hot shower to help relieve bloating.\nExercise can do wonders. Walk, do yoga, dance, or work on abdominal core strengthening exercises to alleviate bloating. Even laying down and bringing your knees to your chest and holding them there for 3 to 5 minutes can help.\nLiving with bloating can be uncomfortable.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nBlood clots are differently sized clumps of blood that have formed inside your body. Clotting is important to prevent excessive bleeding if you are injured or cut. However, when a blood clot blocks blood flow to important areas of your body, it can be harmful, even deadly. Blood clots can occur in your arms and legs, abdomen (stomach), heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys.\nThere are two different types of blood clots. These include clots that stay in place and don\u2019t move (thrombosis) and those that break away from the spot where they developed and move to different areas inside your body (embolism). Depending on what the clot blocks or where it moves, a blood clot can be deadly.\nSymptoms are different depending on where the blood clot is located.\nMany of these symptoms are the symptoms associated with other conditions, such as heart attacks andstroke. If you suspect you have a blood clot, see a doctor immediately.\nYour body reacts to an injury or cut by clotting your blood just the way it should. These types of clots are not a problem. Sometimes a blood clot will form without a trigger (such as an injury or cut). This is more likely to happen with certain risk factors or conditions. Risk factors include:\nWhether you go to your doctor\u2019s office or an emergency room, the doctor will examine your symptoms. The doctor also will ask you about your medical history, your family\u2019s medical history, and the medicines you are taking. They may order a blood test to send to the lab.\nA blood test also can diagnose an autoimmune disorder or certain infections. The test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to draw a sample of blood. There are several lab tests that can check for abnormal clotting and for the presence of antibodies that interfere with clotting.\nBlood clots are highly preventable. To prevent or avoid a blood clot, know your personal risk factors and control the risks you can. For example, if you smoke, stop. If you have obesity, try to lose weight. Increase your activity level if you are inactive. If you take birth control pills, talk to your doctor about an effective alternative. Finally, if you have a family history of blood clots, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may determine whether you should be taking blood-thinning medicine to prevent clots.\nA blood clot is treated based on where it is located. Oral blood thinner medicines are the most common treatments for blood clots. Some medicines can be given through a catheter (a long, thin tube) inserted into the area of the clot. Some clots can be surgically removed. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant. Medicines may involve risks to your unborn child. If your blood clot is due to an infection, your doctor may be able to treat the infection and reduce the risk of a clot.\nA blood clot can usually be treated successfully if detected early. If it was not treated early, your quality of life depends on the seriousness of the damage. For example, a blood clot can cause stroke, even death. If you\u2019ve successfully survived a blood clot, you may live with the fear of having another. Take care not to cut yourself (even when shaving) if you take blood thinner medicines. The medicine can make it difficult to stop the bleeding.\nAmerican Society of Hematology: Blood Clots\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Understanding Blood Clots\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Sepsis is the body\u2019s life-threatening response to a bacterial infection and is often a medical emergency.\u00a0Sepsis happens when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body.\u00a0Bacterial infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\nBoth blood poisoning requires immediate treatment. This is to prevent sepsis from infecting major organs, like the lungs, kidneys, and heart. Sepsis is unpredictable, aggressive, and progresses rapidly.\nAnyone can get blood poisoning, but the risk is higher for:\nThe symptoms of blood poisoning are similar to symptoms of a cold or the flu and may include:\nAdditional symptoms that indicate sepsis, include:\nIf you recently had surgery or a wound that could be infected, take these symptoms seriously. They could signal blood poisoning. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away.\nBlood poisoning is most often caused by a bacterial infection entering your bloodstream. However, it also can be cause by some viral infections, such as COVID-19, influenza, and fungal infections. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream in multiple ways, including daily activities, such as brushing your teeth too vigorously. A simple dental cleaning can cause bacteria to enter your bloodstream. This is true if you have certain risk factors. Risk factors include prior knee or hip replacement. It\u2019s difficult for your body to clear bacteria around prosthetic devices. In dental visits, your dentist will have you take antibiotics before your appointment to prevent infection. Bacteria can enter your bloodstream through a scraped knee or other wound. Urinary tract infections are a common source of blood poisoning. Even a sinus infection can cause bacteria to enter your bloodstream.\nYour immune system will eliminate small amounts of germs. When this doesn\u2019t happen, it can cause blood poisoning. Too many germs can enter your bloodstream at once. Your immune system can\u2019t keep up. This causes blood poisoning.\nBlood poisoning is diagnosed by examining a blood sample to find bacteria in the blood. Also, doctors check the number of white blood cells in the sample. If you suspect you have blood poisoning, call your doctor right away. Your doctor will examine you and order blood tests, if necessary.\nIf bacteria are in your blood, your doctor will identify the type of bacteria. If you have a cut or other wound on your body, your doctor may swab that area to collect bacteria.\nTo lower your risk of blood poisoning:\nThe treatment of blood poisoning often involves admission to a hospital\u2019s intensive care unit (ICU) for those who are very sick. This is so that your doctor can give you antibiotics and other medicines intravenously and closely monitor your organ systems. Fast treatment is important. Blood poisoning can become a more serious case of sepsis. Sepsis is life-threatening. It damages vital organs. When blood poisoning is caught early and doesn\u2019t do any serious damage, you can then be switched to oral antibiotics that you can take at home. These are usually in pill form.\nMany people fully recover from blood poisoning. However, untreated blood poisoning or catching it too late can worsen is serious sepsis. When you have sepsis, damage to major organs may be irreversible. For example, kidney damage could lead to lifelong dialysis. Once you have had blood poisoning, you\u2019re at higher risk for developing infections in the future.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Sepsis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Sepsis\nLast Updated:September 9, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nBone cancer is cancer of the bones. It can begin as a tumor in a bone or it can spread to the bone from another area. Most cases of bone cancer start in other areas. When the cancer spreads to the bones, it is called metastatic cancer, or secondary cancer. It is rare for cancer to start in a person\u2019s bones.\nBone cancer consists of cancerous (malignant) tumors. These destroy bone tissue and can continue to spread. Noncancerous (benign) tumors are often not life threatening but can still cause damage to your bones.\nThere are three main forms of bone cancer.\nChordoma is another kind of bone cancer that is very rare and forms in the spine. This cancer is more common in men than women, and typically occurs in older adults.\nThe main symptom of bone cancer is pain. However, not everyone has pain. You also may have swelling in the area where bone cancer exists, fractures, or high levels of calcium in the blood. Other symptoms include:\nThere are several causes of bone cancer. Many times, cancer from another part of your body spreads to your bones. This is more likely to occur in people who have had radiation or chemotherapy. Children are more vulnerable to this.\nOther less common causes include:\nIn some cases, the cause of bone cancer is unknown.\nThere are several tests your doctor may do to look for and diagnose bone cancer. If the doctor finds a tumor, they will need to find out if it is cancerous or not. These tests may include:\nCan bone cancer be prevented or avoided?\nIn general, bone cancer cannot be prevented or avoided.\nTreatment options vary based on the type of bone cancer, the size, and the location. They also depend on your age and overall health. Surgery is the most common form of treatment. The goal is to remove the entire tumor. In some cases, this may require amputation of your arm or leg.\nIn place of surgery, the doctor may recommend cryosurgery. This treatment uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the tumor and cancer cells. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are other forms of treatment. Chemotherapy uses medicine to stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be given by mouth, injection (shot), infusion (through an IV) or even on the skin. Radiation uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.\nSome types of treatment will require physical therapy or rehabilitation. Your doctor also may recommend certain lifestyle changes.\nAfter treatment, it is important for you to have routine visits with your doctor. This can help to identify problems right away. Once bone cancer is removed, it can still come back or spread. You also may develop other types of cancer or health problems.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nBreast cancer is a cancer that begins in breast tissue. It usually shows up as a tumor. There are three types of breast tumors.\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer among women (afterskin cancer). The good news is that the rate of death from breast cancer has declined over the last few years. This is probably because more tumors have been found early. This is when treatment can help the most. Regular mammograms can help find breast cancers early.\nSymptoms of breast cancer can include:\nIt is not known exactly what causes breast cancer. There are certain risk factors that seem to increase your chance of getting the disease. It\u2019s estimated that about 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary (run in the family). In many of these cases, you inherited a gene from your parents that has mutated (changed from its normal form). This mutated gene makes it more likely for a person to get breast cancer.\nEveryone has two genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Normally, these genes help prevent cancer tumors from growing. But sometimes a person inherits a mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2 from his or her family. This person\u2019s chance of getting breast cancer increases. Mutations in these genes have also been linked toovarian cancer.\nThere are other mutated genes that may make it more likely for a person to get breast cancer. Scientists know about some of these genes. They are working to identify others.\nBreast cancer in 2 or more first-degree relatives is a sign that the mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2 might run in your family. First-degree relatives include your parents, siblings, and children. Another sign is a first-degree relative who got breast cancer before the age of 50.\nThe chances of inheriting breast cancer aren\u2019t high. This is true even if someone in your family has had the disease. Many people have had breast cancer without carrying a mutated form of BRCA1 or BRCA2. Anyone with first-degree relatives who have had breast cancer is at increased risk. But most people don\u2019t get the inherited kind of breast cancer.\nTalk with your doctor about your family history. He or she will want to know your relation to any family members who have had breast cancer. Your doctor will also want to know how old your relatives were when their breast cancer was diagnosed.\nYour doctor can help you decide if a gene test might be useful to you. He or she can also discuss the pros and cons of taking the test. Talking with a genetic counselor might also be helpful.\nThink about how you would feel if the test results showed that you are at greater risk of getting breast cancer. Some people want to know if they have one of the mutated genes. Knowing instead of wondering helps them deal with the risk of breast cancer. It allows them and their doctors to watch more closely for early signs of cancer. But other people would rather not know they have the abnormal gene. They feel that it would be too hard to cope with. Talk with your doctor about your feelings.\nIf you notice a lump or other change in your breast, see your doctor right away. He or she will do a physical exam. They will ask you about your health history and your family\u2019s history of breast cancer. They will carefully feel your breasts and under your arms for lumps.\nIf they find something abnormal, your doctor may order a mammogram. A mammogram is a special X-ray of your breasts. Your breast will be pressed between two plates. This spreads out your breast so that a better X-ray picture can be taken. The entire process usually takes about 20 minutes.\nIf the mammogram shows something, your doctor may order more tests. These include:\nThere are different kinds of biopsies that look for breast cancer. These include:\nIf cancer cells are found in a biopsy, your doctor will do more testing. This will help him or her find out how quickly the cancer may grow, how likely it will spread, and how certain treatments might work.\nThere are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting breast cancer. Lifestyle changes have been shown to decrease risk, even in high-risk women. These changes include:\nYou can\u2019t always avoid breast cancer, but you can find it early. This increases your chances of a full, speedy recovery. There is no evidence that breast self-exams can help prevent breast cancer. The best way to find it early is with regular mammograms.\nA mammogram is the most effective way to find breast cancer early. It can detect an abnormal area up to 2 years before it becomes large enough to feel. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends all women 50 years of age and older get a mammogram every 2 years. If you have risk factors for breast cancer, your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often. He or she also may want you to start having them at a younger age.\nMammograms can be uncomfortable, but they don\u2019t take very long. New technology is being developed that may improve the experience. You may find that scheduling your mammogram shortly after your period makes it less uncomfortable. Your breasts may be less tender at this time.\nDoing these things gives you the best chance to find cancer as early as you can. Finding breast cancer early makes treatment much easier and more effective.\nThere are many treatment options for breast cancer. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:\nAvailable treatments include:\nMany cases of breast cancer can be cured with treatment. How well you do after treatment depends on many things. This includes how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated, breast cancer can spread to other parts of the body, including internal organs. This could cause serious health problems or be fatal. It is very important to get treatment as soon as possible.\nLiving with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.\nMany women choose to do nothing and to be proud of their bodies after a mastectomy. Some women may choose to have a breast reconstruction. This is surgery that rebuilds the shape of the breast. If you don\u2019t want more surgery, you have other options. Some women wear a breast form, a device that replaces the breast. They also may wear padding inside their bras.\nEven after your cancer is gone, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Breast Cancer\nNational Cancer Institute: Breast Cancer\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Medline Plus: Breast Cancer\nLast Updated:June 16, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nBursitis is the painful swelling of bursae. Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that cushion your tendons, ligaments, and muscles. When they work normally, bursae help the tendons, ligaments, and muscles glide smoothly over bone. But when the bursae are swollen, the area around them becomes very tender and painful. Trochanteric bursitis is swelling affecting the bursae of the hip.\nBursitis does not only happen in the hip. It can also occur in the shoulder, knee, and elbow joints. Bursitis may be acute (short-lived) or chronic (long-lasting).\nSymptoms include joint pain and tenderness. You may also see swelling and feel warmth around the affected area. The pain is often sharp in the first few days. It may be dull and achy later. You may notice it more when getting out of a chair or bed. You may also notice it when sitting for a long time and when sleeping on the affected side.\nAcute bursitis usually flares over hours or days. Chronic bursitis can last from a few days to several weeks. Chronic bursitis can go away and come back again. Acute bursitis can become chronic if it comes back or if a hip injury occurs.\nOver time, the bursae may become thick, which can make swelling worse. This can lead to limited movement and weakened muscles (called atrophy) in the area.\nSeveral things can lead to hip bursitis, including the following:\nYour doctor will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Sometimes certain tests may be needed to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These tests may include X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nYou can avoid getting bursitis by not putting too much strain on your hips. Avoid activities that are especially difficult or painful. And take breaks to rest your hips. When you exercise, remember to warm up your muscles and then stretch to prevent injury. If you\u2019re overweight, losing weight can help reduce pressure on your joints, including the hips.\nBuilding strength in your hips with an approved workout routine can greatly reduce your chances of getting bursitis. Ask your doctor what types of exercise are best for you.\nTreatment for bursitis usually involves doing strengthening exercises and stretching. This helps prevent muscle atrophy\u2014and can also be used to prevent bursitis, not just treat it. You should avoid activities that cause pain. Ask your doctor about exercises to help build strength in the area. Your bursitis may affect your ability to function normally. If so, you may need physical therapy to help you move again. This is especially true if you have chronic bursitis.\nYou can also use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (brand name: Aleve) to relieve pain and swelling. You also may want to use an ice pack on the area to reduce swelling.\nIf these treatments don\u2019t help, you may need to have fluid taken out of the bursa. Or you may need steroid shots to reduce pain and swelling. Steroid shots are usually very effective in treating bursitis. You may need another shot after a few months.\nSurgery is rarely needed to treat bursitis. It\u2019s used only when all other treatments fail. For people who do need surgery, it\u2019s a simple procedure. The doctor removes the bursa from the hip. The hip can function normally without the bursa. Usually, the surgery doesn\u2019t require a long hospital stay. The recovery period is typically short.\nIf you have chronic bursitis, try to minimize flare-ups by stretching each day to increase range of motion. And avoid activities that you know will result in pain. Repetitive-motion activities are especially bad for bursitis. If you do have a flare up, remember that resting your hip is important. Without proper rest, healing is delayed.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Bursitis\nLast Updated:August 18, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nClostridium difficile (C. diff.) is a type of bacteria that lives in many people\u2019s intestines. C. diff. is part of the normal balance of bacteria in your body. It also lives in the environment, such as in soil, water, and animal feces.\nMost people never have problems with C. diff. However, if there is an imbalance in your intestines, C. diff. may begin to grow out of control. The bacteria start to release toxins that irritate and attack the lining of your intestines. This is what leads to symptoms of a C. diff. infection.\nC. diff. infections can range from mild to severe.\nMild symptoms can include:\nSevere symptoms can include:\nCall your doctor if:\nThe most common risk factor for C. diff. is the use of an antibiotics. Antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance in your intestines. Your risk increases if you have taken antibiotics for a long period of time or if the antibiotic is broad-spectrum (treats a wide variety of bacteria)..\nPeople who are 65 years of age or older are at greater risk of a C. diff. infection. Other risk factors include:\nIf you are in good health, you likely will not get a C. diff. infection\nYour doctor will need to test a stool sample to diagnose C. diff. Follow-up tests may be needed to confirm. Your doctor may do an X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan of your colon.\nYou can test positive for a C. diff. infection without having any symptoms. This is known as C. diff. colonization. Some people are carriers for C. diff. but do not have C. diff. A positive test result plus symptoms indicate that you have an active C. diff. infection.\nA C. diff. infection is contagious. The bacteria can spread person to person. They also live a long time on surfaces, such as toilet seats, telephones, and doorknobs. Good hygiene can help you avoid the bacteria.\nIf you have\u00a0a C. diff.\u00a0infection, wash your hands with soap and water before eating and after using the restroom. Use a chlorine bleach-based product to clean surfaces you may have touched to avoid spreading the infection to others. About 1 in 5 people who have C. diff. will get it again.\nIf you were taking an antibiotic when your symptoms started, your doctor will probably ask you to stop taking it. They will watch you for dehydration if you have severe diarrhea. About 25% of patients begin to improve 2 to 3 days after they stop the antibiotic that caused the infection.\nFor severe cases, your doctor may prescribe a 10-day dose of an antibiotic that has proved effective in treating C. diff. infections. Examples include metronidazole and vancomycin. You should improve after 72 hours of starting the medicine, although the diarrhea may continue. In about 15% to 35% of cases, a second round of antibiotics is needed.\nWhile you recover, drink plenty of fluids to replace what your body lost due to diarrhea. Avoid milk products and foods that contain wheat flour or are high in fiber. Your digestive tract may be sensitive to them for a few days.\nIf your infection gets worse, you may become dehydrated or be unable to pass stool. In rare cases, C. diff. can lead to sepsis (a life-threatening blood infection) or a puncture in your intestines.\nIf you have diarrhea and think it could be caused by C. diff., check with your doctor before using antidiarrhea medicine. These drugs can make your infection worse.\nCertain probiotics, or \u201cgood bacteria,\u201d may help prevent repeat C. diff. infections. Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements. They can instruct what to take along with antibiotics.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Clostridium difficile infection information\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Clostridium Difficile Infections\nLast Updated:January 3, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is cancer?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nCancer is a collection of many diseases that all involve the growth of abnormal cells. The body is made up of many types of cells. Normally, cells grow, divide, and then die. Sometimes, cells mutate (change). They begin to grow and divide more quickly than normal cells. Rather than dying, these abnormal cells clump together to form tumors.\nSometimes these tumors are benign (not cancer). But if the cells in these tumors are cancerous (malignant), they can invade and kill your body\u2019s healthy tissues. From these tumors, cancer cells can metastasize (spread) and form new tumors in other parts of the body. Cells in benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body.\nThere are many different types of cancer. All cancers begin with abnormal cells growing out of control. The type of cancer is determined by what type of cells begin to grow abnormally and where they grow. Cancer cells that grow in the skin are skin cancer. Those that grow in the breast are breast cancer cells. Even if these cancers spread to another part of the body, they are still considered skin or breast cancer. That is because it is the skin or breast cancer cells that spread. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it would still be breast cancer. In this case, it would be called metastasized breast cancer.\nThe most common cancers in adults areskin cancer,breast cancer,lung cancer,prostate cancer, andcolorectal cancer.\nThere are many different symptoms of cancer. Often, your symptoms will depend on what kind of cancer you have. For example, a symptom of breast cancer is a lump in the breast. A symptom of skin cancer is an abnormal-looking mole. General symptoms that tend to go with multiple types of cancer include:\nCancer is caused by mutations in the DNA in your cells. DNA is what makes up your genes, which give instructions to the cells about what they are supposed to do. When the DNA mutates, it causes errors in the instructions. This makes the cell stop functioning normally. It can lead the cell to become cancerous.\nMany things can cause your genes to mutate. Sometimes you are born with a mutation. This means you inherited it from your parents. More commonly, the mutations happen after you\u2019re born. Factors that can cause this include:\nEveryone has some risk for cancer. In the United States, cancer is likely to affect 1 in 3 people in their lifetime. The amount of risk you have depends on several factors. These factors include:\nTalk to your doctor. They can help you understand your risk for cancer. They can also help you understand how your risk for cancer is affected by the following:\nDepending on your age and your risk factors, your doctor may begin screening you for certain types of cancer. Screening means looking for certain cancers before they cause any symptoms. Some doctors recommend that people who are at high risk or have a family history of cancer be screened more often, or at a younger age, than people who have average cancer risks. The recommendations for screening vary for different cancers.\nThere are a variety of tests your doctor will need to do if cancer is suspected:\nIf your doctor determines that you have cancer, you will undergo more tests. These will tell the doctor the stage of your cancer. This means the size of the tumor and how far it has spread. The stage of your cancer helps determine what kind of treatment you will have. It also helps the doctor know how likely it is that your cancer can be cured.\nFurther testing usually includes more imaging tests. These will show if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nIn some cases, cancer is caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking or not protecting your skin in the outdoors. In those cases, it can be avoided by making better choices. Sometimes the gene mutation that causes it is inherited. Other times, it happens even when you are doing all the right things to lower your risk. In those cases, cancer can\u2019t be prevented. But finding it early can make a big difference in your treatment and your outcome.\nSome common cancers are easier to treat if they are found early. If the tumor is found when it is still small and has not yet spread, curing the cancer can be easy. However, the longer the tumor goes unnoticed, the greater the chance that the cancer has spread. This usually makes treatment more difficult.\nUnfortunately, some risk factors for cancer (such as family history) are out of your control. But there are things you can do each day to improve your health and lower your risk of cancer. The best ways to lower your cancer risk are to:\nIf you are a cancer survivor, these same lifestyle habits can help you stay healthy.\nSeeing your doctor regularly can also help. Depending on your age and medical history, your doctor will probably run tests (called screenings) to try to detect the early signs of certain cancers. For most types of cancer, the sooner the cancer is found and treatment begins, the better your chances of recovering.\nThe three most common types of cancer treatment are surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment is aimed at removing the cancer cells or destroying them with medicines or by other means.\nSome cancers cannot be cured. Some people choose to focus on quality of life and opt not to have treatment. In these cases, they may rely on palliative and hospice care. Palliative care can help provide comfort and treat symptoms. It can begin as early as diagnosis. Hospice care begins nearer the end of life. That is typically when the person is not expected to survive for more than 6 months.\nSurgery is a way to physically remove the cancer. Surgery can be very successful in treating some kinds of cancer. But it isn\u2019t an option in all cases. It may be possible to safely remove a tumor and any affected surrounding tissue if:\nSurgery may not be possible if:\nRadiotherapy uses radiation to damage cancer cells so that they can\u2019t multiply. The radiation is in the form of special X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons. There is usually no pain during this kind of therapy. Depending on the area that is treated, side effects from radiation damage to normal tissues may occur. Your doctor can tell you what to expect. Radiotherapy is sometimes the only treatment needed. It can also be used with other therapies. A combination of surgery and radiotherapy may be used for tumors that grow in one place.\nChemotherapy uses strong medicines to attack the cancer cells. This treatment sometimes causes a lot of fear because the side effects can be severe. However, not all people experience severe side effects. The side effects of chemotherapy can often be treated with other medicines.\nChemotherapy is usually used when the cancer has spread to other areas in the body. It can also be used in combination with surgery and radiation. Sometimes the tumor is surgically removed. Then chemotherapy is used to make sure any remaining cancer cells are killed.\nOther specialized treatments may be available. Your doctor may talk to you about these treatments if they are an option for you.\nMany kinds of cancer are treatable, especially when detected early. Cancer treatments continue to get better. Life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis is much higher than it used to be.\nLiving with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.\nEven after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. Being in partial remission means you may be able to take a break from treatments as long as the cancer stops growing. If you are in full remission, there is no evidence of the disease still in your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Cancer\nNational Cancer Institute\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cancer\nLast Updated:September 23, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

However, you should check with your doctor before starting an exercise program.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine to treat cardiomyopathy. They may also suggest that you eat less than 2,300 mg of salt or less per day. Sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure and heart disease.\nIf you have significant heart failure, you may need a small device that is like a pacemaker to help your heart work correctly. You will need surgery to place the device in your body.\nIn serious cases, a person who has cardiomyopathy may need a heart transplant.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a painful disorder of the wrist and hand. The carpal tunnel is a narrow tunnel formed by the bones and other tissues of your wrist. This tunnel protects your median nerve. The median nerve helps you move your thumbs and the first 3 fingers on each hand.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs when other tissues in the carpal tunnel (such as ligaments and tendons) get swollen or inflamed. When they do, they press against the median nerve. That pressure can make part of your hand hurt or feel numb.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome usually isn\u2019t serious. With treatment, the pain will typically go away and you\u2019ll have no lasting damage to your hand or wrist.\nThe symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include the following:\nDoing the same hand movements over and over can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. It\u2019s most common in people whose jobs require pinching or gripping with the wrist held bent. People at risk include people who use computers, carpenters, grocery checkers, assembly-line workers, meat packers, musicians, and mechanics. Hobbies such as gardening, needlework, golfing, and canoeing can sometimes bring on the symptoms.\nWomen are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome than men. It also tends to be hereditary. This means it runs in families.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome may also be caused by an injury to the wrist, such as a\u00a0fracture. Or it may be caused by a disease such asdiabetes,rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0or thyroid disease. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also common during the last few months of pregnancy.\nYour doctor will probably ask you about your symptoms. He or she may examine you and ask you how you use your hands. Your doctor may also do these tests:\nYour doctor may order a nerve conduction test or an electromyography (EMG) test. They use these tests to see whether the nerves and muscles in your arm and hand show the typical effects of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nYou can take steps to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. The following actions may help to prevent it:\nMany products you can buy, such as wrist rests for a computer keyboard, are supposed to ease symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. No one has proven that these products really prevent wrist problems. Some people may have less pain and numbness after using these products, but other people may have increased pain and numbness.\nIf carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by a medical problem (such as rheumatoid\u00a0arthritis), your doctor should treat that problem first.\u00a0Your doctor may ask you to rest your wrist or change how you use your hand. He or she may also ask you to wear a\u00a0splint\u00a0on your wrist. The splint keeps your wrist from moving but lets your hand do most of what it normally does. A splint can help ease the pain of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially at night.\nPutting ice on your wrist to reduce swelling, massaging the area, and doing stretching exercises may also help. An over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can relieve swelling and pain. These medicines include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and naproxen (Aleve). In more severe cases, your doctor might inject your wrist with a corticosteroid, which reduces\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and pain.\nIn some cases, surgery is needed to make the symptoms go away completely. The surgery involves cutting the\u00a0ligament\u00a0that may be pressing on your median nerve. You\u2019ll usually get back the normal use of your wrist and hand within a few weeks to a few months after surgery.\nDoing the hand, wrist, and finger exercises that your doctor tells you to do after surgery is very important.

It is caused by bacteria in cat saliva. Cats likely get the bacteria from fleas.\nCat-scratch disease is also called cat-scratch fever. It is not a severe illness in healthy people. But it can be a problem for young children or people with weak immune systems. These include people withcancer,diabetes, oracquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nA red bump, sore, or blister may develop where a cat has bitten or scratched you. This could happen 3 to 10 days after the bite or scratch. The sore or blister may take a long time to heal. You may experience a low-grade fever (under 102\u00b0F), headache, fatigue, or poor appetite.\nAn infection of the lymph nodes can also develop. This happens most often in the glands closest to the scratch or bite. If the scratch is on your arm, the glands in your armpit or near your elbow may become tender and swollen.\nCall your family doctor if you notice any of the following problems:\nCat-scratch disease is caused by bacteria that cats carry in their saliva. They likely get the bacteria from fleas. They can spread it to their paws or fur when they lick themselves. You can get cat-scratch disease from a cat biting, scratching, or licking you. You can also get the bacteria in your eyes if you rub them after petting a cat that has the bacteria on its fur. Many people who get cat-scratch disease do not remember being scratched or bitten by a cat.\nYour doctor will examine the bite or scratch and ask you about your symptoms. He or she will check your lymph nodes for swelling or tenderness. If a diagnosis is not clear, they may order a blood test.\nYou can prevent cat-scratch disease in the following ways:\nYoung cats are more likely to carry the bacteria than older cats. Households with kittens have higher rates of infection. If the kittens have fleas, the infection rate is even higher. If you are planning to adopt a cat, consider a cat that is at least 1 year old.\nIn most people, cat-scratch disease clears up without treatment. You can take an over-the-counter pain reliever to help relieve pain and discomfort. Ibuprofen (two brands: Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (one brand: Aleve) can help. Applying heat compresses to the affected area may also help. If a lymph node is very large or painful, your doctor may drain it to help relieve the pain.\nAntibiotics may be needed if your symptoms don\u2019t go away in a month or two. In rare cases, the infection can travel to your bones, liver, or other organs. This requires more intensive treatment.\nMost cats with the bacteria do not get sick or need treatment. Rarely, they could develop inflammation of the heart that could make it hard for them to breathe. If you are worried that your cat may be experiencing symptoms from the bacteria, contact your vet.\nIf you get scratched or bitten by a cat, wash the area with soap and water.

You experience the problems when you eat foods that have gluten. Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is not the same is having gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease.\nIn people with celiac disease, gluten causes the immune system to attack and damage the small intestine. When this happens, your body doesn\u2019t absorb or get the important nutrients it needs. These include vitamins, calcium, protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Your body can\u2019t work well without these nutrients.\nSome people with celiac disease don\u2019t notice or have symptoms. But most people do, including:\nIn infants and young children:\nIn teenagers:\nIn adults:\nOther common symptoms in people of any age include:\nDoctors and researchers don\u2019t know exactly what causes celiac disease.

It could be triggered later on by severe stress, physical injury, infection, childbirth, or surgery.\nCeliac disease can be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are similar to other digestive disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome. But blood tests can help your doctor diagnose this disease.\nIf your blood test indicates that you might have celiac disease, an intestinal biopsy is often done. Using a thin tube, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine. Positive biopsy results will confirm you have celiac disease.\nDiagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis\u2014a chronic skin condition caused by a reaction to gluten ingestion\u2014will also confirm it.\nDon\u2019t stop eating gluten before you have a blood test or a biopsy. If you do, it can skew your results.\nThere is no way to prevent or avoid getting celiac disease.\nCeliac disease is serious. Fortunately, you can control the disease by following agluten-free diet. This means you remove gluten completely from your diet. By doing this, you can reverse the damage caused by celiac disease. You\u2019ll feel better. But if you \u201ccheat\u201d on your diet, the damage will come back. Sometimes you may not feel sick right away, so you think it\u2019s okay to eat gluten.

Gluten-free eating has become more mainstream. Many restaurants offer gluten-free options. Many grocery stores have gluten-free sections. These mean plenty of gluten-free products can be found.\nLearning to be gluten free may be hard at first. It will take time for you and your family to learn how to avoid gluten. You\u2019ll have to learn to read ingredient labels at the grocery store. You\u2019ll have to be careful when you eat out.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nCellulitis is a skin infection that is caused by bacteria. It is a common infection but can become a serious condition if not treated. Most of the time, cellulitis affects the skin on your lower legs. But it can appear anywhere on your body and even on your face. The infection begins on the surface of your skin, but can affect the underlying layers of skin, too. Untreated, cellulitis can even spread to your lymph nodes or cause ablood infection (sepsis).\nCellulitis is usually painful. The affected area will be red and possibly inflamed (swollen). It may also feel warm to the touch.\nOther common symptoms include:\nMore serious symptoms that could mean the infection is spreading:\nIf you have any of these symptoms, you should contact your doctor immediately or seek emergency care.\nCellulitis is caused by bacteria. It is normal for bacteria to live on your skin. When you have a break in your skin, those bacteria can enter and cause an infection. A break in your skin can be caused by many things. It could happen when you scratch dry skin, when an insect bites you, or you accidentally bump up against something that scrapes your skin.\nYour doctor will most likely be able to tell that you have cellulitis by looking at your skin. They will also feel your glands to see if they are swollen. Your doctor may want to order some blood tests to make sure the infection hasn\u2019t spread to your blood. They could also collect fluid from the affected area to test it.\nCellulitis cannot always be prevented. You can lower your risk for cellulitis by moisturizing and taking care of your skin. You should also wash your hands often and keep your fingernails trimmed.\nIf you have a skin wound, make sure to keep it clean. You should wash it daily or use an antiseptic or antibiotic cream to lower the risk of infection. Look at it every day for possible signs of infection. If you see that the wound is growing or becoming more painful, contact your doctor.\nCertain illnesses or conditions may increase your risk for getting cellulitis. If you have diabetes or vascular disease, you may have more breaks in your skin in the form of ulcers. Eczema can cause more breaks in your skin, too. You may also be at higher risk if you use medicines that could suppress your immune system, such as corticosteroids. Obesity can also increase your risk for cellulitis.\nYour doctor will most likely prescribe oral antibiotics to treat your cellulitis. They also may offer you pain medicine, if needed.\nIf your infection is more severe, your doctor may recommend that you go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This is liquid medicine delivered directly into your vein (usually an arm vein) using a needle. Other reasons your doctor may recommend this treatment include:\nIn most cases, cellulitis goes away with antibiotic treatment. It is rare for it to spread to your bloodstream, but it can happen. That is why it is important to keep an eye on rashes and wounds. Cellulitis can return if you have a disease or condition that makes you prone to wounds or nicks in your skin. Good wound care and washing your hands can help keep the infection from spreading.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cellulitis\nLast Updated:May 3, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nPuberty is the time of life when boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 bodies begin to develop or mature. Puberty involves sexual, physical, and emotional changes. Children go through puberty on their own time. Normally, it begins for girls between the ages of 8 and 13. In boys, it begins between the ages of 9 and 14.\nPrecocious puberty refers to early onset puberty symptoms. Central precocious puberty (CPP) is the more common type. Medically, it is known as gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty. The other type is peripheral (gonadotropin-independent) precocious puberty. A girl younger than 8 years old or a boy younger than 9 years old who has puberty symptoms may have CPP.\nThe symptoms of CPP are the same as normal puberty. The difference is that they occur at a younger age.\nCommon puberty symptoms for girls are:\nCommon puberty symptoms for boys are:\nIn most cases of CPP, the cause is unknown. Potential causes involve health problems that occur in your child\u2019s brain. These include:\nTalk to your child\u2019s doctor if you notice early signs of puberty. The doctor will do a physical exam. Blood and urine tests check hormone levels. High levels suggest the onset of puberty. After diagnosis, other tests can be done to determine a cause. The doctor can check your child\u2019s hormones to see if precocious puberty is central or peripheral. MRIs and CT scans scan the brain for any problems. An X-ray checks your child\u2019s bone growth to see if it\u2019s normal.\nCan central precocious puberty be prevented or avoided?\nYou cannot prevent CPP. Children who are genetically female are at greater risk for CPP. Those who are overweight or have obesity also carry a greater risk.\nTreatment for CPP depends on how early it occurs. If puberty begins slightly before the normal age, your child may not need any treatment. If puberty begins much earlier, the doctor may want to stop it. This can be done with medicines, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). They lower your child\u2019s sex hormone levels to stop puberty.\nAny underlying cause of CPP also needs to be treated. Your doctor will explain options for tumors, infections, trauma, or other causes.\nThe following complications are possible for children who do not get treatment for CPP:\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Puberty and Precocious Puberty\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

These disorders affect body movement and muscle coordination. It usually appears in infancy or early childhood, as the brain develops. Children with CP may have stiff or weak muscles. This can cause them to make unusual\u00a0muscle\u00a0movements. It may take a baby with CP longer than usual to start rolling over, sitting up, crawling, or walking.\nCP can be mild or severe. A child with mild CP may have awkward movements but require little or no assistance. A child with severe CP may not be able to walk. He or she may have trouble speaking and may require lifelong care and assistance.\nThere are 3 general types of CP:\nSome children will show signs of more than one type of CP. This is referred to as mixed CP.\nMany children with CP have other conditions as well. Some of the most common include:\nChildren with CP show a wide variety of symptoms. The symptoms usually do not get worse over time. They may include:\nSigns of CP usually show up in the first few months of a baby\u2019s life. They often are signs of developmental delay. This means they don\u2019t reach developmental milestones in the typical time. These milestones include learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk.\nCP is caused by abnormal brain development or brain injury. The brain damage can occur before the child is born. It can also occur during birth or in the first few years of life. In most cases, CP is present at birth.\nNormally, the brain sends out messages telling the body exactly how and when to move. Children with CP have damage to the part of the brain that sends out these messages. This affects the way a child who has CP talks, walks, and moves.\nCertain infections in the pregnant mother can increase the risk of brain damage in the developing baby and cause CP. These infections include rubella\u00a0or\u00a0chickenpox. Sometimes, a baby\u2019s brain does not develop properly in the womb. This can also lead to CP. Doctors don\u2019t know for sure why this happens. In some cases it can be associated with the mother\u2019s exposure to certain\u00a0toxic\u00a0substances.\nA difficult labor or delivery can cause CP. This can happen if there is a lack of\u00a0oxygen to the baby\u2019s brain during birth.

Viral encephalitis causes inflammation of the brain.\nCP can also be caused by brain injuries during the first few months or years of life. These could be from an accident or from being shaken.\nIn many cases, the cause of a child\u2019s CP is never found.\nSome things can increase the risk of a baby developing CP. Risk factors include:\nCP is often diagnosed in the first two years of a child\u2019s life. Your doctor will look at your child\u2019s muscles, posture, and reflexes. They will ask you about your child\u2019s physical development. They may monitor your child over time, tracking their growth and development. They may also order special tests, such as a\u00a0CT\u00a0scan or an\u00a0MRI. These can help the doctor see if there is any damage to the brain. These tests can also help your doctor determine if your child\u2019s symptoms are the result of a different disorder.\nChildren with milder symptoms may not be diagnosed until they are 4 or 5.\nSome cases of CP cannot be prevented. They are the result of complications that happen during pregnancy or birth that could not be foreseen.\nThe best way to prevent CP is to take measures to lower the risk factors. You can do this by:\nThere is no cure for CP. If your child has CP, your doctor will help you create a treatment plan. Treatment should improve his or her skills. The plan may include:\nMany people with CP are in treatment for most of their lives. Some use other methods to help manage their disease. Orthotic devices help stabilize movement. These could include braces, wedges, special chairs, rolling walkers, or powered scooters. Many assistive devices have been developed to help people with CP and other disabling diseases. These include computers, software, voice synthesizers, and picture books to help with communication.\nMany parents explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for their children.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nCervical cancer is abnormal growth of cells in a woman\u2019s cervix. The cervix is the lowest part of the uterus (womb). It connects the uterus and the vagina. Cervical cancer is almost always caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).\nIn its early stages, cervical cancer may not have any symptoms. This is the case with many cancers. In later stages, symptoms could include:\nThese could also be signs of a condition other than cervical cancer. If you experience any of these symptoms, see your family doctor.\nAlmost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV. This is a common sexually transmitted virus that can cause infections. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Some types cause no symptoms. Others cause body warts or genital warts. More aggressive kinds can cause cancer in both women and men. Cervical cancer is the most common kind of cancer caused by HPV.\nAbnormal results from a routine Pap test (or smear) could lead to a cervical cancer diagnosis. During a Pap test, your doctor takes a sample of cells from your cervix. The sample is sent to a lab and checked under a microscope.\nAbnormal Pap test results could mean there are changes in the cells on your cervix, including:\nIf the results of your Pap test are abnormal, your doctor may repeat the test. He or she may also do a cervical HPV test. This test can show if you have one of the types of HPV that can cause cancer. Your doctor may want you to have a colposcopy. During this procedure, he or she will use a magnifying lens to look more closely at your cervix. They can also take a sample of tissue (biopsy) to test for cancer.\nCells of the cervix go through many changes before they turn into cancer. A Pap test can show if your cells are going through these changes. If caught and treated early, cervical cancer is not life threatening. This is why it is so important that you get regular Pap tests.\nIn many cases, cervical cancer can be prevented. The best ways to do this are to avoid getting HPV and to get regular Pap tests.\nAn HPV vaccine can protect young people against the virus. The vaccine is FDA-approved for all boys and girls between 9 years and 26 years of age. It is most effective when you get it before you have been exposed to HPV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that girls and boys who are 11 or 12 get the vaccine. But anyone age 26 or younger should get the vaccine, even if you\u2019ve already had HPV.\nOther ways to lower your risk of getting HPV include:\nAll women should get regular Pap tests. These can detect abnormal cells before they turn into cancer.\nCertain things put you at higher or lower risk for cervical cancer. Your doctor will consider these when recommending how often you should have a Pap test. Most women can follow these guidelines:\nIn many cases, precancerous cells are found before cancer develops. Treatment for these is different than for invasive cancer cells.\nTreatment will depend on several factors. These include severity, age, general health, desire to get pregnant in the future, and preference. Options include cryosurgery (freezing), cauterization (burning), or laser surgery. These procedures destroy the abnormal cells without causing much damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nThis means that the cancer has spread from the surface of the cervix. It may spread to tissue deeper within the cervix or to other parts of the body. Treatment options depend on the size of the tumor and how far the cancer has spread. They also may depend on your plans for having children in the future. The most common treatments include:\nTreatment of invasive cancer often involves a team of specialists. This could include your family doctor, a gynecologist, and an oncologist (cancer specialist). You will all work together to develop the best treatment plan for you.\nCervical cancer is treatable, especially when detected early. Precancerous cells can be removed before they develop into cancer. Early treatment often does not affect your ability to have children. Treatment of more advanced cancers could require removal of the uterus or other reproductive organs. Some women have their eggs frozen for future use before undergoing this kind of surgery.\nCancer treatments can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active.\nEven after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.\nIf you are sexually active:\nIf the results of your last Pap test were normal:\nIf the results of your last Pap test were abnormal:\nIf you are diagnosed with cervical cancer:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Basic information about Cervical Cancer\nNational Cancer Institute: Cervical Cancer\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cervical Cancer\nLast Updated:April 14, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The vagina opens up into the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus.\nCervical dysplasia is detected by a pap test (pap smear). It\u2019s diagnosed with a biopsy. Abnormal changes in cells can be mild, moderate, or severe. The presence of abnormal cells doesn\u2019t mean you have cervical cancer. But the cells could lead to cancer if they aren\u2019t treated.\nPeople with cervical dysplasia don\u2019t usually have symptoms. This is why it\u2019s important to get screened regularly. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends routine pap tests to diagnose cervical cancer early. You can check AAFP\u2019s clinical guidelines (at the end of this article) to see when and how often you should be tested.\nThe cells on your cervix can change over time. This means that you can develop cervical dysplasia at almost any age.\nHPV is the primary cause of cervical dysplasia. There are more than 200 different HPV viruses. About 40 of these affect the genitals. The viruses are spread through sexual contact. Most viruses are low risk for cancer. About 12 are high risk. High-risk HPV types 16 and 18 cause about 70 percent of cervical cancer cases.\nIn the United States, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection.\nThere are several factors that can increase your risk of cervical dysplasia:\nCervical dysplasia is typically detected during a routinepap test. For this test, your doctor swabs your cervix to collect a sample of cells. This is generally not painful. The cells are then sent to a lab. It can take up to 3 weeks for the lab to process the test.\nThe pap test results can be normal, inconclusive, or abnormal. If normal, you should follow AAFP\u2019s recommendation for regular pap tests.\nInconclusive results don\u2019t indicate cervical dysplasia. You could have a simple infection in your cervix or vagina. Your doctor may order a repeat pap test. Further action or diagnoses will depend on your age and medical history.\nAn abnormal result is known as cervical dysplasia. It\u2019s called a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the pap test, the precancerous cells may be classified as:\nAdditional testing is needed to see if the cell changes are mild, moderate, or severe. A colposcopy is an in-office procedure that gives your doctor a closer look at your cervix. He or she may take a biopsy of the cervix to help identify the abnormal area. These biopsies are small and don\u2019t cause much discomfort.\nCervical dysplasia that is found on a biopsy is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). There are 3 levels:\nAn HPV test can be completed at the same time or separately as the pap test. It will identify the presence and type of HPV.\nThe best way to prevent cervical dysplasia is to get the HPV vaccine. It\u2019s proven to lower your risk of HPV. It doesn\u2019t fully prevent cervical dysplasia. Consult your doctor to know if you meet all criteria for the vaccine. For best results, girls and boys between the ages of 9 and 26 should get vaccinated before becoming sexually active. However, vaccination can be helpful after onset of sexual activity and up to age 45.\u00a0 Consult your doctor to discuss the vaccine criteria and if you should be vaccinated.\nYou can also take the following steps to reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia:\nTreatment for cervical dysplasia will depend on the degree of abnormal cells and your medical history. Most mild cases will clear up without treatment. Your doctor may suggest getting a pap test every 6 to 12 months, instead of every 3 to 5 years. But if the changes don\u2019t go away or get worse, treatment will be needed.\nInstances of moderate or severe cervical dysplasia could require immediate treatment. Options include:\nRare cases of severe cervical dysplasia could require a hysterectomy to fully remove the cervix.\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. Follow your doctor\u2019s and AAFP\u2019s screening recommendations for early detection.\nOnce treated, cervical dysplasia can return.

That means without you making them move. This muscle contraction can make your head lean or twist to one side. Your chin may pull up, down, forward, or backward. Your shoulder also can contort up.\nThe disorder is more common in men than women. It\u2019s more likely to develop during middle age, although it can happen at any age.\nThe disorder also is known as spasmodic torticollis (ST). It can cause severe pain and discomfort. It often begins slowly, gets worse, and then stabilizes.\nThe main symptom is involuntary muscle contractions in your neck. Other symptoms include:\nIn many instances, doctors don\u2019t know what causes cervical dystonia. In some cases, people who have a neck injury may develop it. When the cause isn\u2019t known, it\u2019s called primary dystonia.\nSecondary dystonia can be caused by disease or injury, such as a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. You may develop it if there\u2019s a problem with your basal ganglia. This is the part of your brain that sends messages to start muscle movement. Nerve damage from certain medicines is another possible cause.\nBoth primary and secondary cervical dystonia can be genetic, meaning it runs in families.\nYour doctor will review your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They also will want to know about any health problems or disorders you may have. Your doctor may want to do some tests to see how your muscles work. These tests can detect the underlying cause of your muscle contractions. Cervical dystonia can resemble stiff neck, an acute pain, or spasm that goes away.\nCervical dystonia can\u2019t be prevented or avoided.\nThere are several treatment options for cervical dystonia. Medicines can help your neck muscles relax and reduce spasms. These include muscle relaxers and certain medicines used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. Injections may also help.\nYour doctor may recommend physical therapy. This includes exercises to stretch and strengthen your muscles.

The cervical spine is the part in your neck. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a compression of the spinal cord in your neck. A compression of the spinal cord means pressure, pinching, or squeezing on it.\nCSM often affects adults 40 years or older. It can affect younger people born with narrow spinal canals and men at an earlier age than women.\nSymptoms of CSM are wide-ranging and occur over time. They can include:\nChanges in the bones, discs, and ligaments of your spine as you age can cause pressure on the spinal cord. Sometimes growths called bone spurs add pressure to the spine. These changes often occur due to normal aging. Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause CSM as well as spinal cord trauma.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They will look for changes in your feeling, strength, and reflexes. Your doctor also will do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test. This uses radio waves to take pictures of your spine. The test can confirm if you have spinal cord compression in your neck. It also can show other problems that have similar symptoms to CSM. Your doctor may have to do other tests to confirm the cause of CSM. One of these tests may be a CT scan. They also may refer you to an orthopedist or neurosurgeon.\nYou can\u2019t prevent CSM. It\u2019s caused by a natural breakdown of the body as you age.\nMild cases of CSM can be treated with neck braces, physical therapy, and pain relief medicine. These treatments help some symptoms but may not provide long-term relief. They also don\u2019t help other symptoms, such as weakness or numbness. Severe cases may require surgery. This can help reduce or relieve the compression of your spinal cord.\nCSM can get worse if left untreated.

    "article_title": "What is chickenpox?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nChickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It is most common in children. The classic symptom is an itchy rash of red spots all over the body. Your child could have as many as 250 to 500 red spots before the virus runs its course in 5 to 7 days.\nChickenpox used to be a common childhood disease. Then a vaccine was invented to prevent it. Now there are many fewer cases.\nYou may not know your child has chickenpox at first. They may have flu-like symptoms to start off with. These include:\nSeveral days later, the rash appears. It usually starts on the child\u2019s stomach, back, and face before spreading to his or her entire body. In more severe cases, the spots can move inside your child\u2019s throat, eyes, bottom, and vagina. The spots begin as raised bumps, turn into fluid-filled blisters, and end as scabs. They are extremely itchy. Scratching causes the blisters to break open. This can lead to infection and scars.\nMost cases of chickenpox are mild. Symptoms last 5 to 7 days.\nChickenpox is caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. You can catch it by coming in contact with someone who is infected. It is spread through touching or breathing in virus particles that have come from the blisters.\nA person with chickenpox is contagious from 1 to 2 days before they develop the rash. The can pass on the disease until all of their blisters have formed scabs. This usually takes 5 to 7 days.\nThe varicella-zoster virus also causes a disease called shingles. This is a painful skin condition that lays dormant until you get older. It also appears as an itchy, sore rash with blisters. If you have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles.\nYour doctor can generally tell if the rash is chickenpox just by looking at it. He or she may check for other flu-like symptoms. They also can test blood or test a small sample from one of the blisters.\nYou should call your doctor if your child:\nThe best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the vaccine. Children should receive the vaccination when they are 12 to 15 months old. They should get a booster vaccination between ages 4 and 6. The vaccine is 99 percent effective in protecting against the virus. On rare occasions, children who get the vaccine may still get chickenpox. But their case is usually milder than if they hadn\u2019t gotten the vaccine.\nChickenpox is an airborne virus. It can also be spread through mucus, saliva, or by touching the fluid from the blisters. If you know a child who has chickenpox or was recently exposed to the virus, keep your child away from that friend or classmate. Keep your child home once you know he or she has chickenpox. This minimizes spreading it to others.\nAdults\u00a0who escaped chickenpox as a child, but have not gotten the vaccine, are at risk for getting the virus. Getting chickenpox puts you at a higher risk of getting shingles. If you\u2019ve never had chickenpox or the vaccine, talk to your doctor. You can still get vaccinated, even as an adult.\nA virus causes chickenpox. That means antibiotics won\u2019t help in treating it. Doctors might prescribe an antibiotic if the spots become infected from scratching. This will depend on the age and health of your child. It will also depend on how bad the chickenpox have become in a 5-to-7-day period.\nSome people with chickenpox may need antiviral medicine. Your doctor may recommend antiviral medicine if you:\nIn most cases, the best your doctor can offer is solutions to treat the symptoms. For itching, your doctor may suggest applying a cool, wet cloth to the blisters. Do not rub the sores or they will break open. Cool or lukewarm baths also may help. Many people find that lotions and bathing products made with oatmeal help relieve itching. Using calamine lotion on areas below the face also can provide relief from itching.\nIf your child has mouth blisters, avoid causing the blisters to break open. Give him or her foods and drinks that are cold, soft, and bland. Topical pain relief creams approved by your doctor also can help. Keeping your child from scratching the sores will be a big challenge. Have them wear mittens or socks on their hands. This will reduce the damage from scratching with their fingernails.\nIf your child is experiencing pain, you can give them over-the-counter pain medicine. Do not give your child aspirin. It can cause Reye syndrome, which can cause liver failure and death. Acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol) is an acceptable oral pain relief medication.\nFor the short time you have chickenpox, there\u2019s little you can do other than make yourself as comfortable as possible. Follow the guidelines in the treatment section. Limit your exposure to others.\nIn most cases, once you have chickenpox, you will not have it again in your lifetime. Rarely, someone may get it more than once.\nSome people are at higher risk of developing serious complications from chickenpox.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nChlamydia is one of the most commonsexually transmitted infections (STIs), and it often shows no symptoms. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that can occur in any person.\u00a0That\u2019s why understanding chlamydia symptoms and treatment is so important. Left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems\u2014but with early testing and proper care, it\u2019s easy to treat and manage. Knowing how chlamydia spreads and what signs to watch for can help protect your health and your partner\u2019s.\nChlamydia often doesn\u2019t produce symptoms, especially early on. Most people don\u2019t know they have it. Symptoms may appear 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the bacterial infection. These can include:\nAt its worst, chlamydia can affect fertility, making it difficult to get pregnant. It can sometimes cause an ectopic pregnancy (fertilization that develops outside the womb). Ectopic pregnancies are serious and can be life-threatening.\nChlamydia is caused by engaging in unprotected sexual activity (vaginal, anal, and oral) with a person who has the infection. It also can spread by touching an infected person\u2019s genitals.\nYour doctor can easily diagnose chlamydia. They may order a urine test. This involves peeing in a cup provided by the doctor\u2019s office. The urine sample is sent to a lab to be tested. Your doctor may want to take a sample of bacteria. This involves taking a sample from your genitals with a swab to test.\nIf you are pregnant, your doctor will check for chlamydia even if you have no signs of the disease. This infection can be extremely dangerous to a newborn.\nChlamydia can be treated with antibiotic medicine. Your doctor will prescribe either a single-dose pill or a several-day course of the same pill taken by mouth. Your partner also needs to be tested and treated. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any type of antibiotic. Finish taking your entire antibiotic. Do not engage in sexual contact again until 7 days after you finish the medicine. Tell your doctor if you get a fever or stomach pain while taking the medicine. Also, tell your doctor if you are or might be pregnant.\nYou can reduce your risk of chlamydia by always using protection properly during sexual activity. Using it incorrectly can lessen this protection. Limit your number of sexual partners. Know the people with whom you have sexual contact, since the disease can also spread by touching your partner\u2019s genitals. If you use spermicide for birth control, be aware that they contain nonoxynol-9 which can cause genital irritation. This can increase your risk of STIs.\nWomen ages 25 and younger who are sexually active should be screened for STIs by their doctor on a regular basis. Women also should avoid douching (a form of vaginal hygiene). It reduces the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in the vagina and increases the risk of infection.\nIf you have chlamydia, you should tell anyone you have sexual contact with. If your partner has chlamydia or another STI, you should be tested right away.\nIf left untreated, chlamydia can spread to different parts of your body. This can cause additional harm. For example, if it spreads to your eyes, it can cause eye infections and blindness. If chlamydia spreads to the testicles and prostate, it can cause swelling, painful urination, fever, and lower back pain. The infection can also spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes (part of the female reproductive system). This can cause scarring in the area, as well as infertility or difficulty becoming pregnant. It may cause an ectopic pregnancy. If chlamydia is passed on to a newborn baby through a vaginal delivery, it can cause pneumonia, an eye infection, and even blindness in the baby.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: About Chlamydia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Chlamydia Infections\nLast Updated:May 14, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nBronchitis is an inflammation (or irritation) of the airways in the lungs. Chronic means it lasts longer than 3 months. Airways are the tubes in your lungs that air passes through. They are also called bronchial tubes. When the airways are irritated, thick mucus forms in them. The mucus plugs up the airways and makes it hard for air to get into your lungs. That makes it hard to breathe.\nBronchitis also causes a cough that produces mucus (sometimes called sputum) and a feeling of tightness in your chest.\nChronic bronchitis is one type ofchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and often occurs with emphysema.\nWhen I see patients with chest colds, they usually don\u2019t need antibiotics. Instead, I tell them about some simple treatments they can do at home.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Shilpa Mehta\nThe main symptom of chronic bronchitis is a persistent cough that doesn\u2019t go away for months. The cough nearly always produces mucus. The cough is also associated with wheezing (while breathing) and shortness of breath.\nWhat causes chronic bronchitis?\nCigarette smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. When tobacco smoke is inhaled into the lungs, it irritates the airways, and they produce mucus. People who have been exposed for a long time to other things that irritate their lungs \u2013 such as chemical fumes, dust, and other substances \u2013 can also develop chronic bronchitis.\nCigarette smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. When tobacco smoke is inhaled into the lungs, it irritates the airways, and they produce mucus. People who have been exposed for a long time to other things that irritate their lungs, such as chemical fumes, dust, and other substances, can also develop chronic bronchitis.\nYour doctor can diagnose chronic bronchitis. He or she will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as:\nIf your doctor thinks you have chronic bronchitis, you may be tested to find out if your lungs are damaged. You might have a pulmonary function test to see how well your lungs are working. During this test, you breathe into a machine that measures the amount of air in your lungs. Your doctor may also order blood tests and a chest X-ray or chest CT scan.\nIf you smoke, the most important thing you can do is to stop. The more smoke you breathe in, the more it damages your lungs. If you stop smoking, you\u2019ll breathe better, you won\u2019t cough as much, and your lungs will begin to heal. You\u2019ll also reduce your chance of getting lung cancer. Ask your doctor to help you stop smoking.\nTry to avoid other things that can irritate your lungs, such as aerosol products like hairspray, spray deodorant, and spray paint. Also avoid breathing in dust or chemical fumes. To protect your lungs, wear a mask over your nose and mouth if you are using paint, paint remover, varnish, or anything else with strong fumes.\nYour doctor may prescribe a medicine called a bronchodilator to treat your chronic bronchitis. This medicine dilates (or opens) the airways in your lungs and helps you breathe better.\nThis medicine is usually inhaled (breathed in) rather than taken as a pill. An inhaler is the device used to get the medicine into your lungs. It\u2019s important to use your inhaler the right way, so you get the most from the medicine. Your doctor will show you how to use your inhaler.\nIf you have severe shortness of breath, your doctor may also prescribe other medicines (such as medicines that help thin mucous) for you to take in pill form.\nIf your symptoms don\u2019t get better with these medicines, your doctor may prescribe steroids. You can take steroids either as an inhaler or in pill form.\nWill antibiotics help chronic bronchitis?\nIn general, antibiotics can\u2019t help chronic bronchitis. You may need antibiotics if you get a lung infection along with your chronic bronchitis. If you have a lung infection, you may cough up more mucus. This mucus may be yellow or dark green. You also may have a fever, and your shortness of breath may get worse.\nWhat about oxygen therapy?\nBecause of the damage from chronic bronchitis, your lungs may not be able to get enough oxygen into your body. Your doctor may prescribe oxygen if your chronic bronchitis is severe, and medicine doesn\u2019t help you feel better. If your doctor prescribes oxygen for you, be sure to use it day and night to get the most benefit. Oxygen can help you breathe better and live longer.\nExercising regularly can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe. Try to exercise at least 3 times a week. Start by exercising slowly and for just a little while. Then slowly increase the time you exercise each day and how fast you exercise. For example, you might begin by walking slowly for 15 minutes 3 times a week. Then, as you get in better shape, you can increase your walking speed. You can also increase the length of time you walk to 20 minutes, then 25 minutes, then 30 minutes. Ask your doctor for help creating an exercise plan that\u2019s right for you.\nAn exercise program called pulmonary rehabilitation may help you improve your breathing. Pulmonary rehabilitation is often given by a respiratory therapist (a health care worker who knows about lung treatments). Your doctor may refer you to the pulmonary rehabilitation program at your local hospital.\nA breathing method called \u201cpursed-lip breathing\u201d may also help you. To do this, you take a deep breath and then breathe out slowly through your mouth while you hold your lips as if you\u2019re going to kiss someone. Pursed-lip breathing slows down the fast breathing that often comes with chronic bronchitis. It may help you feel better.\nChronic bronchitis increases your risk of lung infections, so be sure to get a flu shot every year. Also, get a pneumococcal vaccination as directed by your doctor to help protect against pneumonia. A COVID-19 vaccine is also important.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Chronic Bronchitis\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

A chronic cough lasts for 8 weeks or more. It\u2019s commonly caused by allergies, acid reflux (heartburn), some health conditions, infections, or medicine. It usually goes away after the underlying condition is treated.\nCoughing is a symptom of an underlying health condition. An occasional cough is common. However, see your doctor if your cough won\u2019t go away and includes any of the following:\nSeveral lifestyle and health conditions can cause chronic cough, including:\nSometimes, a chronic cough occurs because of aspiration (inhaling food or drink).\nYour doctor will examine you. This includes taking your temperature, looking at the back of your throat, and inside your ears. They will place a stethoscope on your back and chest. This is to listen to you breathe. They will ask you about your symptoms and health history. Your doctor may ask you if you know what triggers your cough. Your doctor also may check your oxygen level by placing a small clip on your index finger. This device measures how much oxygen you are getting. A reading of 100 is ideal. A reading of less than 90 is a concern. You may be given oxygen by placing a mask over your nose. The mask is connected to the oxygen canister with a tube.\nAdditional tests may include lab tests, such as a blood sample (to check for infection), throat swab, and mucus sample. Your doctor may order a chest X-ray or a CT (computed tomography) scan to look at your lungs. They may have you do a spirometry test. This involves breathing into a tube that is connected to a computer. The computer evaluates your breathing. Another breathing test is the methacholine challenge test if your doctor believes you may have asthma. For this test, you breathe in a mist of a substance called methacholine. Methacholine causes your lungs to open and close. After breathing in the methacholine, you will do a spirometry test.\nYou can prevent or avoid a chronic cough if the underlying cause of your cough is treatable. If your cough is due to allergies, your doctor can treat your allergies with medicine. If it is caused by smoking, you should quit smoking. If your cough is triggered by food, avoid those foods. If your doctor believes your chronic cough is due to other health conditions or medicines you take, they can evaluate alternative options.\nTreatment depends on the cause of your chronic cough.\nLiving with a chronic cough is uncomfortable. It leaves you feeling exhausted (from coughing day and night). It causes chest pain, headache, urinary incontinence (when you unexpectedly urinate a little), and even broken ribs.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs from progressive damage to your kidneys. The damage occurs slowly, over time. Normal, healthy kidneys remove waste and extra water from the blood. Then, your body removes the waste in your urine. Kidneys help to control your blood pressure and make hormones. If you have CKD, your kidneys cannot remove waste from the blood as well as they should. Almost 20 million people in the United States have this disease.\nMost people who have CKD do not have symptoms early on. As the disease progresses, symptoms can include:\nThe most common causes of CKD are high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Infections and urinary blockages can cause CKD as well.\nCKD may be genetic (run in families). You may be at risk of CKD if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors. It is important to diagnose CKD early.\nYour doctor can review your symptoms and do an exam. There are 3 tests they may do if they suspect CKD:\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not currently recommend screening for CKD in adults who don\u2019t have symptoms. However, if you are at high risk of CKD, talk to your doctor to see if you should be tested.\nIf you are at risk of CKD, there are things you can do to prevent it:\nTreatment for CKD depends on the cause of your condition. CKD can cause other problems. Talk with your doctor about how to treat these. They may have you take medicine for:\nPeople who have CKD may lose their appetite. A nutritionist can help you plan a\u00a0diet\u00a0that will keep you strong. Talk to your doctor aboutCKD and nutrition. He or she may want you to eat less protein. Too much protein can make your kidneys work too hard. Proper hydration is important, too. Make sure you are drinking enough water.\nEven with the right treatments, CKD can get worse over time. You need to have regular checkups so your doctor can check your kidney function.\nIf your kidneys stop working, you have kidney failure. This can cause waste to build up in your body and poison your blood. It can cause vomiting, weakness, confusion, and coma. Kidney failure is treated with dialysis. A special machine filters your blood to remove the waste build-up. Dialysis may be done in a clinic or hospital setting. Some dialysis machines are small enough to strap to your body and use at home.\nPeople with CKD should also avoid taking NSAIDs (non-steriodal anti-inflammatory medications).\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians: Clinical Practice Guideline for Chronic Kidney Disease\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Chronic Kidney Disease\nLast Updated:August 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nCOPD is a disease that makes it hard for you to breathe. The two main types of COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis happens when there is an increase of swelling and mucus in your airways. (The airways are the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs.) This swelling causes your airways to narrow, making it harder to push air through them. Emphysema happens when the walls of the air sacs inside your lungs are damaged. This traps air inside your lungs. It can make you feel short of breath.\nCOPD develops slowly and gets worse over time. When COPD is severe, it can interfere with basic tasks. These include doing light housework, walking, or even washing and dressing.\nCOPD can cause a variety of symptoms, including:\nCOPD symptoms start slowly. They get worse over a period of years if not diagnosed and treated early. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to complications. These could include heart problems (irregular heartbeat and heart failure), high blood pressure, and respiratory infections. Infections can further damage your lungs.\nCOPD is caused by damage to the lungs. Damage occurs from breathing in unhealthy substances over time. This includes:\nThe majority of COPD cases are caused by smoking.\nYou are at higher risk of developing COPD if you smoke or are around secondhand smoke. Your risk also increases if you have long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs. This could include certain chemicals, air pollution, or dust. Some people have a genetic condition that can cause COPD, even if they have never been exposed to lung irritants.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not recommend general screening for COPD. If you are showing symptoms of COPD, your doctor will perform an exam. They will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. They will place a stethoscope on your chest and back to listen to you breathe.\nAn important test to diagnose COPD is called aspirometry test. This simple, non-invasive test measures the amount of air you can blow out of your lungs. It involves breathing into a tube that is connected to a computer. The computer may have a graphic (such as candles or a brick wall) to help you with the test. You are asked to take a deep breath and blow into the tube to blow out as many candles (or knock down as many bricks) as you can. You may be asked to repeat the test multiple times in order to get a good reading.\nThe spirometry test will tell your doctor if you have COPD and how severe it is. It can also be used to determine if something else is causing your symptoms, such as asthma or heart failure. Your spirometry reading will help your doctor decide on the best treatment for you.\nIn most cases, COPD is an avoidable disease. The best way to prevent COPD is to not smoke. You should also limit your exposure to things that can irritate your lungs over time. This includes secondhand smoke, air pollution (avoid being outside on days when air pollution is high), chemicals, and dust.\nIf you are at risk for COPD, an early diagnosis is key. According to the AAFP, death from COPD is preventable with early diagnosis and treatment. Treatment includes:\nLifestyle changes:Stop smoking if you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or e-cigarettes. Don\u2019t smoke anything. Talk to your family doctor about quitting. They can provide great resources for helping you quit.\nMedicines:Your doctor may prescribe one or more medicines to ease your symptoms and help you breathe. These medicines may include:\nSeveral of these medicines can be combined into a single inhaler.\nInhaled medicines involve a small, handheld canister that you carry with you. You can use the medicine as needed or as your doctor has advised. Ask your doctor if you should use a spacer. This is a small, hollow device that helps you inhale more of the medication into your lungs where it is needed.\nSome inhaled medicine is given through a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a machine that turns liquid medicine into a vapor that you breathe in. It is commonly used to treat people who have more serious COPD. It also helps people who have trouble using handheld inhalers.\nVaccines:Certain vaccines can prevent dangerous respiratory infections, such as the flu, pneumonia, RSV, and COVID-19. These infections can cause serious problems for people with COPD.\nOxygen therapy:You may have to use oxygen on a regular basis to help you breathe. This involves wearing a mask or nasal prongs and having the oxygen tank with you to use as you need or as your doctor has advised.\nPulmonary rehabilitation:This is a combination of therapies to help you manage your disease and improve your quality of life. A team of health professionals will help you create a plan to help you feel better. Your plan may include a diet and exercise program, breathing strategies, and ways to conserve energy.\nSurgery:This is rare. This could involve a lung reduction operation or a lung transplant. This is usually a treatment of last resort.\nCOPD is a lifelong condition. But there are things you can do to manage your symptoms.\nOne thing you should do is work with your doctor to develop aCOPD Action Plan. A COPD Action Plan can help you recognize when your symptoms change. It also tells you what actions to take when they do. It is important to follow your plan every day, so make it part of your daily routine.\nYou play an active role in managing COPD symptoms through lifestyle changes. Managing symptoms can also slow the progression of the disease. If you have COPD, you should:\nRemember that early diagnosis can lead to proper treatment, which can help you feel better. The longer you let your COPD go untreated, the worse you will feel. Serious COPD will make it difficult to be physically active. This will affect even the simplest of activities, such as dressing or shopping.\nCOPD symptoms may make you feel fatigued (overly tired). Having difficulty breathing also interferes with eating. Your doctor may discuss a plan for diet, nutrition, and supplements.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\nCOPD Action Plan\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: What is COPD?\nFunding and support for this material have been provided by Boehringer Ingelheim.\nLast Updated:February 28, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Acute pain lets you know that your body is injured. It usually doesn\u2019t last long. It should go away as your body heals. Chronic pain lasts much longer. Chronic pain may last months or even years. Chronic pain may interfere with your daily activities. And because the pain lasts so long, people who have chronic pain may also have low self-esteem,depression, and anger. Sometimes these emotions make the pain even worse.\nChronic pain can occur anywhere in the body. People with chronic pain may have these types of pain:\nThe pain can be described as:\nSometimes people with chronic pain have other symptoms. These could include feeling tired, having trouble sleeping, or mood changes.\nSometimes, chronic pain is caused by an old injury or infection, or by a disease. Sometimes there is no known cause for the pain.\nConditions that may trigger or cause chronic pain include:\nDepression and stress tend to make pain worse, including chronic pain.\nYour doctor will ask you about your medical history. Describing your pain will help your doctor find the right treatment for you. Tell them where the pain is, how bad it is, and how often it occurs. Also talk about what makes the pain better or worse. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may run tests to help determine the cause of your pain.\nThey will also review other health problems you may have (such as breathing problems or heart conditions). These could keep you from doing some types of therapy. Your doctor may also ask if you have had any problems with sleep, mood, or anxiety.\nIn many cases, chronic pain can\u2019t be prevented. Some conditions that cause it, such as cancer, can be avoided in various ways. But there is often nothing you can do to control if you get chronic pain.\nThe goal of treatment for chronic pain is to reduce pain and to improve your ability to function. There are many treatments available. They will usually not take away all of your pain. But they can reduce how much pain you have and how often it occurs. Some of the more common treatments include:\nMedicines used for chronic pain include pain relievers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Different types of medicines help people who have different types of pain. If your doctor recommends anover-the-counter pain reliever, read and follow the instructions on the box. Short-acting medicines treat pain that comes and goes. Your doctor usually will recommend long-acting medicines for constant pain.\nYour doctor might recommend a prescription pain reliever. Be sure to follow their instructions for how to take the medicine. Many prescription pain relievers are opioids. Opioids can be effective when taken as directed. But many people who misuse opioids become addicted.Opioid addictionis a very serious health issue that can lead to death.\nSeveral types of therapy can help ease your pain:\nAlmost anything you do to relax or get your mind off your problems may help control pain. Even if you are taking medicine for pain, you should include relaxing activities in your daily life. Relaxation can actually change the body\u2019s chemicals that produce pain. You might have to use stress-reduction methods for several weeks before you notice a decrease in pain. Your doctor can give you tips about stress reduction and relaxation methods.\nSome people with chronic pain find benefits incomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM). These involve treatments that are not part of mainstream medical care. Acupuncture and massage are examples of these treatments. Talk to your doctor before trying any CAM procedures.\nSevere cases of chronic pain could require more invasive treatment. This could include electrical stimulation, nerve blocks, or surgery. There is usually no cure for chronic pain. Talk to your doctor to learn how to best control your pain.\nLifestyle changes are an important part of treatment for chronic pain. Getting regular sleep at night and not taking daytime naps should help. Stopping smoking also helps because the nicotine in cigarettes can make some medicines less effective and impairs healing. Smokers also tend to have more pain than nonsmokers.\nLiving with chronic pain can be very difficult. It is important to take care of yourself. Get plenty of sleep, eat a healthy diet, and try to exercise moderately. Do the best you can to manage stress and depression. These can make your pain worse.\nLearn about what is causing your pain.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nChronic pelvic pain is pain in your pelvic region (the area below your belly button and above your hips). It\u2019s considered chronic if it lasts for at least 6 months. The pain may be steady, or it may come and go. It can feel like a dull ache, or it can be sharp. The pain may be mild, or it may be bad enough to interfere with normal daily activities.\nThe primary symptom of chronic pelvic pain is the pain itself. How often you feel the pain and the severity differs. It depends on the person and what is causing the pain. A woman may feel it during sex. Another person may feel it only after eating. It may come and go or be present every day.\nSome of the more common causes of chronic pelvic pain include:\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your past and present health. He or she will ask about illness or health-related problems in your family. You may be asked to describe the kind of pain you have, where it is, and how strong it is. Tell your doctor anything you can about what causes the pain to get better or worse. He or she may ask:\nWhat types of tests may be performed?\nSeveral tests can help your doctor find the cause of your pain. Your history and physical exam will help him or her decide which, if any, tests to do. These may include blood tests, urologic tests, ultrasound, or X-rays. In some cases, your doctor may need to perform minor surgery, such as laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is a procedure in which the doctor inserts a thin, lighted tube in your abdomen to look at your pelvic organs.\nWhether your chronic pelvic pain can be prevented or avoided depends on what is causing the pain. There are many different causes. Some of them can be prevented. Others cannot be prevented.\nEarly diagnosis can sometimes prevent chronic pelvic pain. It is important to talk to your doctor when you begin to feel pelvic pain.\nTreatment depends on your individual problem. Your doctor will help you determine which form of treatment is right for you. Some treatment options include:\nRarely, surgery is necessary if doctors can see pelvic abnormalities.\nChronic pain is never easy to live with. If traditional methods of pain relief don\u2019t work, there are alternatives. Your doctor can help you find a way to manage your pain. Sometimes, chronic pain responds to a nerve block that can block the pain for an extended period of time. Sometimes physical therapy or weight loss can help.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nCirrhosis\u00a0is a form of liver disease. It occurs when cells in your liver become damaged and your body can\u2019t repair them. As the liver cells die, scar tissue forms. A buildup of scar tissue prevents proper blood flow. A normal liver is able to filter wastes and toxins to get them out of your body. If scar tissue keeps blood from flowing through your liver, it can\u2019t get filtered. This causes toxins and wastes to build up in your body.\nPortal hypertensionis a leading side effect of cirrhosis. Your body carries blood to your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Cirrhosis slows your blood flow and puts stress on the portal vein. This causes high blood pressure known as portal hypertension.\nCirrhosis is a condition that happens over time. You may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Contact your doctor if you begin to notice the following symptoms or signs:\nThere are three main causes of cirrhosis.\nMinor causes of cirrhosis include:\nTo diagnose cirrhosis, your doctor will begin with a physical exam. They also will review your symptoms, health history, and lifestyle. Tests are needed to check your liver and confirm diagnosis. These include blood and imaging tests. Blood tests can detect hepatitis, abnormal enzyme levels, or abnormal blood cells. Imaging tests take pictures of your liver. In some cases, your doctor may do a biopsy on your liver. This involves taking a sample of liver tissue to look at it in the lab.\nIf you have cirrhosis, your doctor will likely check for portal hypertension. They will check your abdomen for extra fluid (ascites). Your doctor will check for swelling or pressure in the blood vessels around your portal vein. They may perform other tests to diagnose portal hypertension. Your doctor also may do an endoscopy (using a lighted camera scope to look at your digestive system).\nSome people can make lifestyle changes to help prevent cirrhosis. These include drinking safe amounts of alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and protecting yourself from hepatitis. If you\u2019re overweight or have obesity, talk to your doctor about how to safely lose weight.\nThe goal for cirrhosis treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent further damage. Treatment also can avoid or manage complications caused by cirrhosis. With this condition, blood can\u2019t flow normally through the portal vein. The blood has to return to your heart through other blood vessels. Most often it goes through blood vessels in your stomach, esophagus, or intestines. These vessels then swell due to the increased amount of blood flowing through them. This puts pressure on the vessels and can cause them to burst. Bleeding from a broken blood vessel is serious and can be fatal.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine to help prevent your blood vessels from bursting. These medicines have some side effects and may interact with other medicines. They\u2019re not suitable for everyone. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower your blood pressure if you have portal hypertension. If you have hepatitis, your doctor will prescribe an antiviral medicine. You may need other medicines, depending on the cause of cirrhosis.\nIf medicine isn\u2019t enough, you may need surgery. Surgery can decrease pressure by interrupting the blood flow in your blood vessels. The doctor or surgeon will insert a long tube through your mouth to your stomach. Then, they will place rubber bands or hardened chemicals in the swollen blood vessels to block them off. Another type of procedure, called TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), may be done in some cases.\nPeople who have portal hypertension may need surgery to connect certain blood vessels. If a blood vessel bursts, you\u2019ll need surgery to stop the bleeding and repair it.\nIf surgery doesn\u2019t work or you have liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.\nThere is no cure for cirrhosis. However, work with your doctor on a treatment plan to manage symptoms and help prevent more damage.\nYour doctor may recommend screening for liver cancer.

They happen when a baby\u2019s lip or mouth don\u2019t form correctly early in pregnancy. The word cleft means split or break. Cleft lip is an opening in the upper lip and nose. Cleft palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth (palate).\nBabies can have a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. A cleft may affect one side of the lip or palate, or both sides. About 1 or 2 in 1,000 babies are born with cleft lip or palate in the United States each year.\nThe major symptom is the presence of the cleft at birth. A cleft lip could be as small as a tiny notch in the upper lip. It could also be as large as a split or hole that goes up into the nose. A cleft palate could be just a small area that isn\u2019t formed properly. But it also could be a large separation in the roof of the mouth.\nChildren who have clefts often have other health issues. They can have trouble eating and talking. They may also have hearing problems, problems with their ears, or problems with their teeth.\nCleft lip and cleft palate are defects that occur early in pregnancy. A baby\u2019s facial features develop in thefirst trimester (3 months). The lips form first, followed by the mouth and palate. Clefts occur if the tissues and cells don\u2019t form right. Cleft lip and cleft palate can occur by themselves. They also can be part of another condition or syndrome.\nNo one knows exactly what causes clefts.

But there are steps you can take to lower your risk of having a baby with a birth defect. These include:\nTalk to your doctor about these and other ways to help reduce the chance of birth defects.\nThe treatment for cleft lip and cleft palate depends on a few key factors. These include the type of cleft and your baby\u2019s overall health. Clefts can cause problems with a child\u2019s development. So, treatment is recommended to start as early as possible.\nMost babies who have a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both will need some type of surgery. Surgery to repair a cleft lip is usually done before the baby is 1 year old. A cleft palate is usually repaired before the baby is 18 months old. Some children will need more surgeries as they grow.\nClefts can create other health issues, such as speech and dental problems. You should work with your doctor to form a team of experts to treat your baby. The group will contain doctors and nurses from many related areas. It could include an oral surgeon, speech therapist, pediatric dentist, audiologist, and nutritionist, among many others. You also can search for special cleft teams and centers throughout the United States.\nOver time, most children need added treatment to manage their related issues. This is another reason to have a cleft team that you know well and are happy with. Some follow-up problems include:\nAdults who had cleft lip or cleft palate as a child may have some lasting effects.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nClubfoot is a congenital condition (present at birth) that causes a baby\u2019s foot to turn inward or downward. It can be mild or severe and occur in one or both feet. In babies who have clubfoot, the tendons that connect their leg muscles to their heel are too short. These tight tendons cause the foot to twist out of shape.\nClubfoot is one of the most common congenital birth defects. It occurs in about 1 in every 1,000 babies born in the U.S. and affects more boys than girls. In fact, boys are twice as likely to be born with clubfoot.\nUsually, a baby born with a clubfoot is otherwise healthy. In a small percentage of births, it occurs as part of a more serious condition like spina bifida.\nClubfoot is not a painful condition for your baby. Most of the time, clubfoot can be corrected while your child is a still a baby. Treatment should begin a week or two after birth. Correction methods vary from manual foot manipulation over time to surgically fixing the foot.\nThere is a high success rate for treating clubfoot. After correction, your child should be able to participate in a variety of physical activities and lead a normal life. Children who do not get treatment for clubfoot will not be able to walk normally. Their foot or feet will remain deformed.\nThe symptoms of clubfoot vary but are easy to identify by a medical professional. Clubfoot could be more difficult to spot if you are a first-time parent and if the condition is not severe.\nSymptoms include:\nDoctors are not sure what causes clubfoot. There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link. This means it seems to run in families. Also, if you already have one child born with clubfoot, your next child has a greater risk of also having clubfoot.\nThere is also research to suggest clubfoot is more common in babies whose mothers smoked or used recreational drugs (street drugs) during pregnancy. This is especially true if there is already a family history of clubfoot. Plus, there could be a link between low amniotic fluid and clubfoot. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds a baby in the womb.\nIf you are pregnant and have a family history of clubfoot, you may want to meet with a genetic counselor. He or she will be able to tell you more about the chances that your baby will have clubfoot.\nIn most cases, clubfoot is diagnosed after your baby is born. Your doctor will be able to identify clubfoot based on the appearance of your baby\u2019s foot. Sometimes after a visual inspection of the foot, they may also order an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis.\nClubfoot also can be discovered in utero (while the baby is still in the mother\u2019s womb) during an ultrasound. An ultrasound is a type of imaging used to look at babies in the womb. It is routine for a woman to have an ultrasound during her pregnancy to confirm her baby\u2019s growth and development.\nEven if clubfoot is discovered in utero, there is nothing that can be done to correct it until after the baby is born.\nYou cannot prevent clubfoot because no one is sure what causes it. You may be able to lower the risk of clubfoot by not smoking or using recreational drugs if you are pregnant.\nHowever, with treatment, your child should be able to participate in a variety of physical activities and lead a normal life.\nThere are two primary ways to treat clubfoot. One way involves stretching to reshape the foot. The other involves surgery. Most cases of clubfoot can be successfully treated without surgery.\nFor most babies, stretching and reshaping the foot is the best treatment option. There are a few reliable techniques for treating clubfoot with stretching. The most widely used is called the Ponseti method. Treatment usually begins as soon as possible after birth, typically within the first week. This is the best and easiest time to reshape the foot.\nWith this method, stretching is used in combination with a cast. Your doctor (or orthopedic specialist) will stretch your baby\u2019s foot toward the correct position and then place a cast on it to hold it there. Every week or so, the doctor will remove the cast, stretch the foot further toward the correct position, and re-cast it. This will continue until the foot is fully in the correct position (usually several months).\nSometimes, the doctor will also need to clip a portion of the Achilles tendon that connects your baby\u2019s heel to his or her calf muscle. Doing so will allow the tendon to grow to a normal length. If this is required, the doctor will do the clipping before putting on your baby\u2019s final cast.\nOnce the final cast is off, your baby will probably need to wear special shoes and possibly a brace. They won\u2019t have to wear these things forever. It could be several months or even a few years. You\u2019ll also need to continue doing stretching exercises with your baby.\nWhen clubfoot is severe, surgery is often the best option for your baby. The surgeon (usually an orthopedic surgeon) will work to lengthen the tendons in the foot and may also need to realign the bones and joints.\nFollowing surgery, your baby will likely also wear a cast for a few months. Your doctor may also prescribe special shoes and a brace for your baby once the cast is removed.\nIn rare cases, clubfoot is not completely correctable. Most of the time, babies who had clubfoot and received treatment can lead active lives as they get older.\nIf your child\u2019s clubfoot is not treated, they will not be able to walk normally. It is sometimes possible to walk with clubfoot, but it is very difficult. Children who have clubfoot tend to walk on the sides of their feet. This can cause large callouses and chronic pain.\nAs your child gets older, having uncorrected clubfoot will mean having a less active lifestyle.\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nA cold and the flu are viral infections. They both affect your respiratory system. This includes your throat, nose, airway and lungs. It is difficult to tell the two apart. The flu is generally worse than a cold. It is common to get a cold more than once a year. Most people get the flu only a few times every 10 years.\nA cold and the flu have similar symptoms. However, they are two different conditions.\nOne particular type of flu is considered serious. It is calledH1N1 flu. Some people call it swine flu. It is a respiratory infection. It is caused by a virus found in pigs. It can infect humans. Its symptoms are similar to other flu symptoms.\nFor a common cold or the flu, you don\u2019t need to see your doctor. However, if your symptoms become serious, call or see your doctor. Serious symptoms for children include:\nCold and flu symptoms can last between 2 and 14 days.\nViruses cause colds and the flu. More than 200 different viruses can cause colds. Not as many viruses cause the flu. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a vaccine available for the flu and not for colds.\nThere is no test to diagnose a cold. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and suggest treating the symptoms. If your doctor suspects you have the flu, he or she may test you. The test involves swabbing the inside of your nose or back of your throat. Results are available fairly quickly.\nThere are things you can do to reduce your risks for colds and flu. They include:\nThere\u2019s no cure for the common cold or the flu. Antibiotics do not work against the viruses that cause colds and the flu. The illness has to run its course. You can do some things to ease your symptoms. For a low fever, mild aches, and pains, take products such as acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol), naproxen (one brand: Aleve) or ibuprofen (one brand: Advil). Drink plenty of fluids. Get as much sleep as you can. Stay home to avoid spreading germs to others.\nYour doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine for the flu. This only shortens the length of time you are sick. These medicines come as pills, syrup or in an inhaler. The inhaled type may cause problems for some people who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some antiviral medicines can cause nausea and vomiting.\nWhen easing a child\u2019s symptoms, acetaminophen (one brand: Children\u2019s Tylenol) can help ease pain and lower a fever. Be sure you are giving your child the correct dose according to his or her age and weight.\nNasal sprays and decongestants are not recommended for young children. They may cause side effects. Cough and cold medicines are not recommended for children. This is especially true for those younger than 2. There is little evidence that cough and cold medicines and nasal decongestants are effective in treating children.\nTo treat your child\u2019s cold or the flu, make sure that your child rests. Give him or her plenty of fluids. Use a humidifier to moisten the air in your child\u2019s bedroom. This will help with nasal congestion. Use a saline nasal spray to thin nasal mucus. Use a bulb syringe to suction mucus out of your baby or child\u2019s nose.\nCold and flu symptoms are uncomfortable. You will not feel well for the time it takes your cold and flu to run its course.

It\u2019s defined as crying for more than 3 hours a day at least 3 days per week for more than 3 weeks. Sometimes there\u2019s nothing you can do to relieve your baby\u2019s crying. Managing colic can add stress to already tired or stressed new parents.\nColic in babies can start a few weeks after birth. It\u2019s generally the worst between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Babies usually grow out of colic by the time they are 3 to 4 months old.\nIt\u2019s normal for babies to fuss and cry. Babies who have colic cry more than most babies, even though they\u2019re otherwise healthy. Other features of colic can include:\nWhen your baby cries, they can swallow air. This may give your baby gas. It can make their tummy look swollen or feel tight. They might show some relief in symptoms after passing gas or having a bowel movement (pooping).\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes colic. Some of the contributing factors could include:\nYour baby\u2019s doctor can diagnose colic. They will do a physical exam and review your baby\u2019s history and symptoms. The doctor might perform some tests to rule out other possible problems.\nYou can\u2019t prevent or avoid your baby from being colicky.\nColic may be triggered by certain things. There are ways you can avoid these triggers. There are also things you can try to help soothe your baby and reduce their crying.\nIf you\u2019rebreastfeedingyour baby:\nIf you\u2019re feeding your baby formula:\nBabies who have colic can sometimes respond well to different ways of being held or rocked, including:\nTry these movements and stimuli to sooth your baby:\nColic doesn\u2019t cause any short-term or long-term problems for your baby. But colic can be difficult for parents. It can be hard to care for babies who don\u2019t stop crying. You may feel overwhelmed or frustrated. If you\u2019re feeling this way, it\u2019s important to ask for help. Ask someone close to you to help watch your baby. Never shake or harm your child.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nColorectal cancer starts in the tissue of the colon or the rectum (the largest part of the intestine located near the anus). Because they share common features, these two cancers are often referred to as colorectal cancer. Cancers start when cells in your body grow quickly in an abnormal way.\nA colorectal cancer screening procedure, known as a colonoscopy, is the most effective method of checking for cancer. When colorectal cancer is discovered early, it\u2019s usually treatable and not life threatening. However, it can lead to death if found too late to be treated.\nThe primary symptom of colorectal cancer is a polyp (growth) in the lining of your colon or rectum. If you have one, you may not even know. Polyps can only be seen with a special camera during a colonoscopy. Some polyps aren\u2019t harmful, but some can become cancerous.\nOnce a polyp develops, it may lead to the following symptoms:\nOther medical conditions can cause these same symptoms. See your doctor right away to find what\u2019s causing your symptoms.\nThere is no single cause. However, there are several things that can increase your risk for colorectal cancer. These include:\nBeginning at age 45, doctors recommend, in general, you undergo screening every five to 10 years. If you fall into one of the groups above, you may need to be tested at a younger age and more often. You may also need to be test more often depending on past results or testing methods. Doctors have seen an increase in colon cancer cases in younger people in the last 5 to 10 years.\nColorectal cancer is diagnosed through several methods.\nRoutine screening tests can find polyps or cancers before they\u2019re large enough to cause symptoms. This is when the cancer can be more effectively treated.\nIf you have symptoms, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam. In this exam, your doctor will put his or her gloved finger into your rectum to feel for growths. It\u2019s not painful. However, it can be uncomfortable.\nAcolonoscopyis the most effective screening test for detecting colorectal cancer.This test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into your rectum. The tube is connected to a small video camera that can see your entire colon. The tube also can be used to remove polyps and cancers during the exam. Before you have this test, you are given a medicine to make you sleepy. A colonoscopy may be uncomfortable. It\u2019s usually not painful.\nAdditional tests might include:\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, your cancer will be given a stage. Cancer stages include stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV. Stage IV is considered advanced cancer. Stage I cancers offer more hope in a successful outcome after treatment.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for colorectal cancer with fecal tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (tests used to diagnose colorectal cancer) starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75 years.\nFor adults between the ages of 76 and 85, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\u00a0recommends that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer be an individual one. Your doctor will offer advice based on your overall health and prior screening history. The AAFP recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than 85 years.\nColorectal cancer can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. However, you can reduce your risk by choosing a healthy diet and exercising. Also, lose weight, quit smoking, and reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. Genetics tests can tell you if you carry an inherited gene that increases your risk of colorectal cancer. Discuss this option with your doctor, including the costs. You can also catch it early by following screening guidelines.\nIf you have colorectal cancer, your doctor will talk to you about treatment options. These include:\nCancer treatment affects people differently. Some people have few or no side effects. However, many people feel very sick.\nTalk to your doctor about clinical trials available to people with colorectal cancer. Clinical trials offer new research-based treatments that may or may not be effective. People enrolled in clinical trials must qualify for the trial.\nLiving with colorectal cancer can cause fear and discomfort, depending on the stage of your cancer. If you were treated successfully and are cancer free, you\u2019ll be required to have regular screenings the rest of your life.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Colorectal (Colon) Cancer\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Colorectal Cancer\nNational Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute: Colorectal Cancer\nLast Updated:February 27, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is congenital adrenal hyperplasia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) affects your adrenal glands. These glands sit atop your kidneys and produce different hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Both are essential for life. People who have the condition lack an enzyme to make the hormones. CAH also causes the adrenal glands to over-produce the male sex hormone androgen. This hormone causes males characteristics to appear early or inappropriately (in the case of women).\nCAH symptoms vary based on the degree of your condition. Severe cases usually show up before or at birth. Females can be born with unclear genitals. This means that their genitals may look more male than female. As they get older, girls could develop facial hair and a deep voice. They also may have abnormal or no menstrual periods. Boys can be born with an enlarged penis.\nOther severe CAH symptoms for girls and boys can start a few weeks after birth. These include:\nMost people who have CAH have a mild form. Symptoms are delayed until childhood or puberty. Boys can develop muscles and masculine features early. Girls can have irregular periods and eventually, infertility issues. They also may have some masculine features.\nPeople who have CAH often are tall as children, but shorter than average as adults. They may have worse acne and blood pressure problems. When they get colds or infections, it can take them longer to recover.\nWe produce hormones in our adrenal glands. People who have CAH lack all or part of an enzyme to make correct hormone levels. They don\u2019t make enough cortisol and aldosterone. They make too much of a male sex hormone called androgen.\nCAH can be diagnosed before or at birth, or later in life. The timeframe depends on the degree of your condition. The more severe it is, the earlier your doctor can diagnose it. Blood tests can check your hormone levels. Genetic tests also can confirm the disorder.\nSome states include CAH in newborn screening done at the hospital. This is part of the heel-prick blood process. The sample checks for several congenital diseases.\nYou cannot prevent CAH. It is a genetic disorder. You can get it from your parents or a random gene mutation. If you have the condition, you can pass it on to your children.\nIf you are planning a family and you or someone in your family has CAH, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may suggest an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These tests can diagnose CAH before your baby is born. If your baby has CAH, they can get treatment in the womb. Your doctor can give them medicine to help correct hormone levels.\nThe main goal of CAH treatment is to manage your hormones. You want them to be normal or as close to normal as possible. Hydrocortisone increases your cortisol level. You may need extra medicine when you are stressed or sick. The use of steroids is common. Your doctor will prescribe a dose that replaces the hormones you can\u2019t produce naturally. This medicine usually has low or no side effects. Do not stop taking steroids without your doctor\u2019s orders.\nBabies who are born with unclear genitals may require surgery. Your doctor will check chromosomes to confirm the genetic sex. This is called karyotyping.\nCurrently, there is no cure for CAH. Your doctor will want to closely monitor your hormone levels. They will order routine blood tests to ensure your medicine is working. Some symptoms of CAH may be hard to handle on an emotional level.

Here are some tests your baby might have:\nIn many cases, there\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent congenital heart disease. But there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your baby.\nTreatment depends on the heart problem and how severe it is. Some people don\u2019t need any treatment. Other heart problems need treatment with medicine, procedures, or surgery. Your doctor will talk to you about treatment options for you or your child.\nMany babies with heart disease need medicine to make their heart stronger or to prevent other problems. It\u2019s very important to give the medicine exactly as your doctor tells you.\nSome babies need to have surgery. Some heart problems must be fixed as soon as the baby is born. Other problems can wait until the child is older. Sometimes the repair takes more than one operation. After surgery, your baby will probably stay in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a few days. There the doctors and nurses can keep a close watch. Many children are back to normal just a few days after heart surgery.\nBabies with heart disease may get tired easily while they\u2019re feeding. Try giving smaller amounts of milk at one time. Then feed your baby more often. He or she may need more food because a heart defect makes the heart work harder. This makes your baby burn more calories\u2014just like you burn more calories when you exercise.\nSome people with congenital heart problems are at a higher risk for other heart problems, including:\nEven if the problem is fixed, your child will need to be monitored for heart problems for the rest of his or her life.\nCaring for a baby or child with a heart problem can be emotional and stressful. You need all the information and support you can get. Connect with parents of other children with a heart problem. They understand what you\u2019re going through and can share coping skills. Your child\u2019s doctor can help connect you with support groups. Talk to a counselor if you\u2019re having trouble coping. He or she can help you reduce stress, anxiety, anddepression.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Congenital Heart Defects\nLast Updated:April 19, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is constipation?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nConstipation is a common condition that makes it difficult to have a bowel movement. A bowel movement occurs when the food you eat passes through your digestive system. Your body takes the nutrients it needs from that food. What\u2019s left over is called stool. Your stool can be soft or hard. Bowel movements usually happen on a regular basis.\nEveryone has a bowel movement schedule (how often, how consistent, and what time of day it occurs). If your bowel movements become less frequent, are difficult to pass, and you are physically uncomfortable, you may be constipated. People of all ages experience constipation occasionally. Usually, it goes away and is not serious. See your doctor if your constipation is chronic (frequent). It may be a problem with your diet or health.\nBasic symptoms of constipation include:\nYou should see your doctor if these symptoms do not go away. You should also see a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:\nChronic (ongoing) constipation can lead to complications, including:\nComplications of constipation can become serious if left untreated. They may require surgery.\nYou may be constipated for many different reasons. It may have more than one cause at a time, including:\nConstipation may become more common as you age. Certain diseases and disabilities also can cause constipation. These include multiple sclerosis, stroke, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and lupus.\nDehydration (not enough fluids) and dietary changes are the most common causes of constipation in babies. For example, changing from breast milk to cow\u2019s milk or from baby food to solids can cause constipation.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. This will include asking you about any medicines you take. Your doctor also will ask when you had your last bowel movement and how often you have them. It might be helpful to write it down for before your appointment. During the visit, your doctor may examine your rectum (the end of your large intestine near your anus). The doctor will insert his or her finger (while wearing rubber gloves) into your rectum to feel for blockages.\nYour doctor may order additional tests, including a blood test and X-ray. A more thorough test is a colonoscopy. This is an invasive procedure done with anesthesia. During this test, your doctor will examine your colon with a long, flexible scope attached to a camera.\nThere are things you can do to reduce constipation. These include:\nMost cases of constipation are easy to treat at home with diet and exercise. Some cases require doctor recommendations, prescription medicine, or a medical procedure.\nAt home treatment includes:\nDiet:Eating a healthy diet with fiber and drinking plenty of fluids (water is the most helpful) can usually clear up constipation.\nHigh fiber foods include beans, dried fruits, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grain foods (choose brown rice or whole wheat bread instead of white), flaxseed meal, and powdered products containing psyllium. For example, 3 cups of popped popcorn has a little more than 3 grams of fiber. One cup of oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber. Adding fiber to each meal and snack will help you reach your goal for the day. Fiber supplements are helpful. Processed foods, such as desserts and sugary drinks, only make constipation worse.\nThe amount of fiber you need each day varies:\nBowel training:\u00a0Teach your children to go to the bathroom when they have to. Holding it can lead to constipation. This also may be necessary for your elderly parents, if you are caring for them.\nLaxatives:\u00a0This is over-the-counter medicine that helps you have a bowel movement. Laxatives should only be used in rare instances. Do not use them on a regular basis. If you must use a laxative, bulk-forming laxatives are best (two brands: Metamucil and Benefiber). These work naturally to add bulk and water to your stools so they can pass easily. Bulk-forming laxatives can cause some bloating (when your stomach feels full) and gas.\nThere are other treatments that require consulting with your doctor:\nMineral oil:\u00a0Do not use this without your doctor\u2019s recommendation. Your doctor may recommend using it if you recently had surgery and should not strain for a bowel movement. Do not use it regularly. It causes your body to lose important vitamins: A, D, E and K.\nEnema:\u00a0This is a liquid medicine. It is inserted into your anus to help with constipation. It is often used after a surgery or before some medical procedures.\nPrescription medicine:Your doctor will prescribe a medicine based on the reason for your constipation.\nSurgery:This is rare. It might involve removing a damaged intestine for serious reasons.\nLiving with constipation\nLiving with constipation can be uncomfortable and miserable. This is true when it\u2019s just for just a couple of days. Long-lasting (chronic) constipation can be so uncomfortable that it influences how your clothes fit, what foods you eat, and your everyday activities. Keep a journal of your bowel movements to see what a normal bowel movement schedule is for you or your child. A normal schedule is between 3 times per day to 3 times per week. Try to keep your diet and lifestyle as routine as possible to prevent constipation.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Symptoms and Causes of Constipation\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Constipation\nLast Updated:February 1, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The cornea is a clear layer of protective tissue at the front of your eye that lies over the iris (which is the colored part of your eye). The cornea helps focus light.\nThe cornea is very sensitive, so a corneal abrasion is usually quite painful. You may feel like you have sand or grit in your eye. You may notice tears or blurred vision, or your eye may look red. You may also notice that light hurts your eye. Some people also get a headache when they have a corneal abrasion.\nA corneal abrasion can occur when something gets into your eye, such as sand, dust, dirt, and wood or metal shavings. The cornea can also be scratched by a fingernail, a tree branch, or a contact lens that is dry or dirty. Rubbing your eyes very hard is another way that an abrasion can occur.\nIn some people, the outer layers of the cornea are weak. These people may get a corneal abrasion for no apparent reason.\nYour doctor will examine your eye for any damage or particles that may be trapped under your eyelid. They may offer numbing drops to help with the pain so that you can keep your eye open for the exam. Your doctor may also place a yellow-orange dye on your eye (fluorescein drops) and then use a blue light. This helps the doctor see imperfection along the surface of your eye.\nCorneal abrasions can often by avoided by taking the following steps:\nIf you think something has gotten into your eye, first try to wash out the eye by flushing it with clean water or saline solution. Your workplace may have an eye rinse station for this purpose. Sometimes, blinking or pulling the upper eyelid over the lower eyelid may remove a particle from under the eyelid. Avoid rubbing your eye. If you or someone else notices something on the white part of your eye, use a soft tissue or cotton swab to gently lift it out of the eye. Don\u2019t try to remove something that is directly over the cornea \u2014 this might cause more serious damage. Call your doctor if you can\u2019t remove the particle or if there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in your eye.\nYour doctor will probably treat the abrasion with eye drops or ointment. Most small abrasions heal within 1 to 3 days. You may need to return to your doctor for another exam the next day.\nIf you wear contact lenses, you need to be especially careful with a corneal abrasion because you have a higher risk of infection. Your doctor may tell you not to wear your contact lenses for a few days after a corneal abrasion, especially if you\u2019re treating your eye with medicated drops.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Corneal Injury\nLast Updated:June 30, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nCoronary artery disease is also called CAD. It is the most common form of heart disease in the U.S. \u2014 and is the leading cause of death, too. It occurs when the coronary arteries (blood vessels) that carry blood to your heart get blocked with plaque. That plaque collection is calledatherosclerosis. Plaque is made of elements including fat and cholesterol. Over time, plaque can harden inside the walls of your arteries. When it does, it blocks the flow of blood to your heart. That blockage can cause angina (squeezing pain or pressure in your chest), a heart attack, or death. Coronary artery disease can lead to other problems, too, includingheart failureandarrhythmias.\nAs your arteries become blocked over time, you may experience:\nCoronary artery disease may take years to develop. You may not notice symptoms until the disease has progressed far.\nCoronary artery disease affects both men and women. Several factors can increase your risk of developing the disease, including:\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam and listen to your heart. They will discuss your symptoms, family history, diet, activity level, and other medical conditions. There is no single test that can diagnose coronary artery disease. If you doctor suspects you have it, they may order one or more of the following tests:\nCoronary artery disease can\u2019t be completely prevented or avoided. This is because everyone develops some degree of CAD as we age. However, you can reduce your risks for getting the disease by:\nTalk to your family doctor about how to improve your diet. Diet and lifestyle changes will lower your risk of coronary artery disease. Your body will need time to respond to the changes you make. Your doctor will watch your progress. For example, if your cholesterol level hasn\u2019t improved after you\u2019ve made changes for a few months, your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower it. You need to keep up the healthy lifestyle changes you started to help the medicine work.\nMost people who have coronary artery disease take medicine to help control their condition. Medicines called beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates also can help relieve angina. Taking low-dose aspirin daily can reduce the chance of a second heart attack in people who have already had one. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors help lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Statins reduce the LDL cholesterol level in your blood. Your doctor will tell you whether you should take any of these medicines.\nMedicines may have side effects. Aspirin may cause upset stomach. Nitrates may cause a flush (redness in the face) andheadaches. Beta-blockers cause tiredness and sexual problems in some patients. Calcium channel blockers may causeconstipationand leg swelling. Most patients don\u2019t have side effects. If you have side effects after taking a medicine, tell your doctor.\nAngioplasty is a surgery that opens blocked arteries around the heart. During this surgery, your doctor inserts a small tube, called a catheter, into an artery in your arm or leg. A small balloon and a metal stent are on the tip of the catheter. With a special instrument, the doctor threads the catheter from your arm or leg to the area around your heart. They will then inflate the balloon, which also moves the stent into place. The balloon moves the plaque out of the way. The stent keeps your artery open so the blood can flow properly to your heart.\nAnother surgical treatment for coronary artery disease is heart bypass surgery. Pieces of veins or arteries are often taken from the legs and sewn into the arteries of the heart. This moves blood past a blockage and increase the blood flow to the heart. Bypass surgery is usually done when angioplasty isn\u2019t possible. Your doctor also may decide it\u2019s a better choice for you.\nSurgery has potential risks. These include heart attack,stroke, or death. These are rare and most patients do well. After angioplasty, you can usually expect to return to your previous activity level, or a better activity level, within a few days. It takes longer (a few weeks or months) to recover from heart bypass surgery.\nLiving with coronary artery disease means being aware of your risks and reducing the ones you can control. This includes diet, exercise, and stopping smoking. It is important to take your prescription medicine for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and any other health conditions.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Heart Disease\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: What is Coronary Heart Disease?\nLast Updated:June 29, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is also called coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CAD affects the larger coronary arteries on the surface of the heart. CHD is plaque buildup in your arteries. It\u2019s known as hardening of the arteries, too. Arteries carry blood and oxygen to your heart. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States for men and women.\nCHD doesn\u2019t always have symptoms. This is true in the early stages of the disease. Symptoms can vary in men and women.\nPrimary symptoms include:\nCall 911 right away if you have those or any of the following abrupt symptoms. You might be having a heart attack or heart failure.\nCoronary heart disease develops over time. It occurs as your arteries become blocked from plaque (fatty substances). This makes it hard for blood and oxygen to reach your heart. It puts stress on your heart, blood vessels, and body. If the plaque bursts, it can form a blood clot. A blood clot can produce a heart attack. If your brain lacks oxygen, you can have a stroke.\nYour doctor can determine your risks for CHD. They may check your cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Your doctor also will want to know about your lifestyle and family history.\nCurrently, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends against electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for adults without symptoms and who are at low risk for CHD. The AAFP does not have enough data to recommend ECG screening for adults who don\u2019t have symptoms but are at medium or high risk for CHD. In general, the greater the number of risk factors a person has, the more likely it is that the person will benefit from screening.\nIf you have symptoms, though, see your doctor. They will perform certain tests to diagnose CHD, including:\nThere are risk factors that increase your chance of getting CHD. Some of them you can prevent, including:\nOther CHD risk factors that you can manage or treat include:\nMajor risk factors that you can\u2019t avoid include:\nAsk your doctor for specific recommendations. They vary by person.\nTreatment depends on age, health, degree of CHD, and other conditions. Mild or early cases of CHD may just need monitoring. Less invasive treatment options include:\nSurgical treatments include:\nThere are different approaches for heart surgery. Minimally invasive involves small cuts in your chest, between your ribs. Open-heart requires a large cut in your chest to open your rib cage. Surgery can be done off-pump. This is where your heart beats on its own. Or, your surgeon can use a heart-lung bypass machine to pump for your heart.\nAnother type is cardiac rehabilitation. Your doctor can prescribe this instead of or in addition to surgery. Cardiac rehab focuses on education and exercise. It includes counseling to help you handle stress or emotions.\nFinding coronary heart disease early can prevent it from getting worse. If left untreated, you could have a heart attack or get arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). CHD can lead to death. Proper diagnosis and treatment allows you to correct it with lifestyle changes and manage it with medicine or surgery. Surgery has various recovery timeframes.\nTalk to your doctor about your specific outcomes and goals. You likely will need ongoing doctor visits and tests. CHD does increase your risk for a heart attack. Make sure you know the warning signs and when to call 911.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians, Clinical Recommendation for Coronary Heart Disease\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Prevent Heart Disease\nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute: Coronary Heart Disease\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Coronary heart disease\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in 2019. Coronaviruses mutate (change) into new and different variants. However, they remain infectious to people and some animals. The infection spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and even talking.\nSARS-CoV-2, like other virus mutations, behave and present symptoms differently from the original virus strain. This includes the Delta, Omicron, and JN.1 variants. These variants can be transmitted between people more easily, produce different symptoms, and cause severe disease.\nIn early 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 remains a pandemic but is in a different phase. Additionally, many factors can impact COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. This includes poverty, physical environment (e.g., smoke exposure, unhoused), and race or ethnicity.\nCOVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms can differ slightly, based on the variant, but may include some or all of the following:\nYou may never develop symptoms after being exposed to COVID-19, which is referred to as being asymptomatic. But you can still spread the virus to others without symptoms.\nThe most common way to get COVID-19 is by inhaling respiratory droplets in the air. When a person with COVID-19 breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets leave their mouth and nose and go into the air. You can\u2019t see these droplets. If you\u2019re within 6 feet of that person, you may breathe in those droplets. You won\u2019t know you\u2019ve done it. But you may get the germs that cause COVID-19 in your body.\nCOVID-19 also can be shared if you touch a surface an infected person has touched. Some examples include door handles, elevator buttons and shopping carts. The germs can get into your body if you then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nIf you believe you have COVID-19, the first step is to get a test. You can test at home.\nIn general, testing availability may differ depending on where you live. There are someno-cost testing centers. Check yourlocal health departmentto see what locations near you are doing testing and if there is a fee to test. This may include hospitals and pharmacies that offer drive-thru testing during high COVID-19 infection periods in your local community. This will allow you to stay in your car to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Depending on the location, someone may approach your car to collect a sample, or they may ask you to collect it yourself. Medical professionals collect samples for COVID-19 viral tests through nasal swabs. Depending on where you get your test, you may get your results the same day or you may have to wait a few days. If you test at home, be sure to follow the instructions to help insure accurate test results.\nDelays in testing may also delay seeking care and treatment (when sick) as well as delays in self-isolation that could reduce the spread of the virus to others.\nIf you experience respiratory virus symptoms\u2014such as fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, headache, or others\u2014that can\u2019t be attributed to another cause, remain at home and keep your distance from everyone, including healthy household members.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that even if you get a negative test, you may still need to self-isolate if you\u2019ve been exposed to COVID-19. This is because it can take time after exposure for your sample to show a COVID-19 infection.\nOnce you resume your regular routine, exercise extra caution over the following five days. Consider measures likeimproving indoor air quality, maintaininggood hygiene,wearing masks,keeping physical distance, andgetting testedbefore spending time with others indoors. These steps are particularly crucial for safeguarding individuals who are at higher risk of severe respiratory illness.\nGetting theCOVID-19 vaccinecan protect you \u2013 and others around you \u2013 from getting very ill from COVID-19. Wearing well-fitting masks in public settings is very effective at preventing spread of the virus. While any mask will provide protection, people are encouraged to wear higher quality masks (KN95, Kf94, or N95) when possible. Even if you wear a mask, you should still avoid people who are sick or be cautious in large crowds. Stay home if you are sick, and talk with your doctor about getting tested. Cover your cough with a tissue, or cough into your upper sleeve or elbow. Do not cough into your hands.\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nAs with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor. They may prescribe pain or fever medication. \u00a0If you are having trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care.\nIf you catch your symptoms early and test positive, talk to your doctor or health department about Paxlovid, a preferred anti-viral medication that reduces the severity of your symptoms, but does not eliminate the virus. Individuals covered under federal programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and uninsured patients are eligible for the USG Patient Assistance Program (PAP) operated by Pfizer and can receive Paxlovid at no cost. Patients canenroll to participate.\nThere are certain eligibility requirements for receiving Paxlovid. A doctor or health department can tell you if you are eligible.\nThe\u00a0FDA advises people to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Additionally, do not take any form of chloroquine, ivermectin or other medicines unless your family doctor has prescribed them for you. There are a few options to treat COVID-19 for people at high risk of serious illness. Your physician will decide which option is appropriate for you.\nA COVID-19 vaccine offers the best opportunity to reduce the spread of the virus and its symptoms or need for hospitalization. Vaccine recommendations are based on age, time since last dose, and in some cases, the first vaccine received.\nVaccines include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both of which are mRNA vaccines. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine which is a protein subunit vaccine. J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, a viral vector vaccine has expired and is\u00a0no longer available for use in the United States\u00a0as of May 6, 2023.\nThe AAFP and CDC recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for people 5 and older, and the Moderna vaccine for people 18 and older. To maximize protection, COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are now recommended for adults aged 12 and older. People 12-17 years old can only receive a booster dose of Pfizer.\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for children 6 months through 4 years of age.\nThe CDC provides a guideline tovaccine availability and coverageto people who want the vaccine but do not have insurance.\nThere is a lot of misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccine, so be sure you are getting your information and recommendations from a reputable organization or from your family doctor.\nLong COVIDis a term for the wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that occur after a COVID-19 infection. It may also be referred to as Post-COVID condition, long-haul COVID, and chronic COVID.\nSymptoms can come from the long-term effects of the viral infection, a long illness and hospitalization related to severe COVID-19 disease. They include difficulty breathing, fatigue, malaise, \u201cbrain fog\u201d or cognitive impairment, cough, chest pain, headache, rash, impaired daily function, etc. Viewa complete list of symptomsand talk with your family doctor is you\u2019re experiencing any symptoms after a COVID-19 infection.\nIf you had COVID-19 and were hospitalized or needed intensive care, your risk for having long COVID increases. There is also new evidence that repeated COVID-19 infections could increase the likelihood of developing long COVID. That is why it is important to get the vaccine.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in 2019. Coronaviruses mutate (change) into new and different variants. However, they remain infectious to people and some animals. The infection spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and even talking.\nSARS-CoV-2, like other virus mutations, behave and present symptoms differently from the original virus strain. This includes the Delta, Omicron, and JN.1 variants. These variants can be transmitted between people more easily, produce different symptoms, and cause severe disease.\nIn early 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 remains a pandemic but is in a different phase. Additionally, many factors can impact COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. This includes poverty, physical environment (e.g., smoke exposure, unhoused), and race or ethnicity.\nCOVID-19 symptoms range from mild to severe. It takes 2-14 days after exposure for symptoms to develop. Symptoms can differ slightly, based on the variant, but may include some or all of the following:\nYou may never develop symptoms after being exposed to COVID-19, which is referred to as being asymptomatic. But you can still spread the virus to others without symptoms.\nThe most common way to get COVID-19 is by inhaling respiratory droplets in the air. When a person with COVID-19 breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets leave their mouth and nose and go into the air. You can\u2019t see these droplets. If you\u2019re within 6 feet of that person, you may breathe in those droplets. You won\u2019t know you\u2019ve done it. But you may get the germs that cause COVID-19 in your body.\nCOVID-19 also can be shared if you touch a surface an infected person has touched. Some examples include door handles, elevator buttons and shopping carts. The germs can get into your body if you then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nIf you believe you have COVID-19, the first step is to get a test. You can test at home.\nIn general, testing availability may differ depending on where you live. There are someno-cost testing centers. Check yourlocal health departmentto see what locations near you are doing testing and if there is a fee to test. This may include hospitals and pharmacies that offer drive-thru testing during high COVID-19 infection periods in your local community. This will allow you to stay in your car to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Depending on the location, someone may approach your car to collect a sample, or they may ask you to collect it yourself. Medical professionals collect samples for COVID-19 viral tests through nasal swabs. Depending on where you get your test, you may get your results the same day or you may have to wait a few days. If you test at home, be sure to follow the instructions to help insure accurate test results.\nDelays in testing may also delay seeking care and treatment (when sick) as well as delays in self-isolation that could reduce the spread of the virus to others.\nIf you experience respiratory virus symptoms\u2014such as fever, chills, fatigue, cough, runny nose, headache, or others\u2014that can\u2019t be attributed to another cause, remain at home and keep your distance from everyone, including healthy household members.\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that even if you get a negative test, you may still need to self-isolate if you\u2019ve been exposed to COVID-19. This is because it can take time after exposure for your sample to show a COVID-19 infection.\nOnce you resume your regular routine, exercise extra caution over the following five days. Consider measures likeimproving indoor air quality, maintaininggood hygiene,wearing masks,keeping physical distance, andgetting testedbefore spending time with others indoors. These steps are particularly crucial for safeguarding individuals who are at higher risk of severe respiratory illness.\nGetting theCOVID-19 vaccinecan protect you \u2013 and others around you \u2013 from getting very ill from COVID-19. Wearing well-fitting masks in public settings is very effective at preventing spread of the virus. While any mask will provide protection, people are encouraged to wear higher quality masks (KN95, Kf94, or N95) when possible. Even if you wear a mask, you should still avoid people who are sick or be cautious in large crowds. Stay home if you are sick, and talk with your doctor about getting tested. Cover your cough with a tissue, or cough into your upper sleeve or elbow. Do not cough into your hands.\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nAs with a cold or the flu, drink fluids and get plenty of rest. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually go away on their own. If symptoms feel worse than a common cold, contact your doctor. They may prescribe pain or fever medication. \u00a0If you are having trouble breathing, seek immediate medical care.\nIf you catch your symptoms early and test positive, talk to your doctor or health department about Paxlovid, a preferred anti-viral medication that reduces the severity of your symptoms, but does not eliminate the virus. Individuals covered under federal programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and uninsured patients are eligible for the USG Patient Assistance Program (PAP) operated by Pfizer and can receive Paxlovid at no cost. Patients canenroll to participate.\nThere are certain eligibility requirements for receiving Paxlovid. A doctor or health department can tell you if you are eligible.\nThe\u00a0FDA advises people to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat, or cure COVID-19. Additionally, do not take any form of chloroquine, ivermectin or other medicines unless your family doctor has prescribed them for you. There are a few options to treat COVID-19 for people at high risk of serious illness. Your physician will decide which option is appropriate for you.\nA COVID-19 vaccine offers the best opportunity to reduce the spread of the virus and its symptoms or need for hospitalization. Vaccine recommendations are based on age, time since last dose, and in some cases, the first vaccine received.\nVaccines include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, both of which are mRNA vaccines. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine which is a protein subunit vaccine. J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, a viral vector vaccine has expired and is\u00a0no longer available for use in the United States\u00a0as of May 6, 2023.\nThe AAFP and CDC recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for people 5 and older, and the Moderna vaccine for people 18 and older. To maximize protection, COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are now recommended for adults aged 12 and older. People 12-17 years old can only receive a booster dose of Pfizer.\nIn March 2023, the FDA authorized the bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose for children 6 months through 4 years of age.\nThe CDC provides a guideline tovaccine availability and coverageto people who want the vaccine but do not have insurance.\nThere is a lot of misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccine, so be sure you are getting your information and recommendations from a reputable organization or from your family doctor.\nLong COVIDis a term for the wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems that occur after a COVID-19 infection. It may also be referred to as Post-COVID condition, long-haul COVID, and chronic COVID.\nSymptoms can come from the long-term effects of the viral infection, a long illness and hospitalization related to severe COVID-19 disease. They include difficulty breathing, fatigue, malaise, \u201cbrain fog\u201d or cognitive impairment, cough, chest pain, headache, rash, impaired daily function, etc. Viewa complete list of symptomsand talk with your family doctor is you\u2019re experiencing any symptoms after a COVID-19 infection.\nIf you had COVID-19 and were hospitalized or needed intensive care, your risk for having long COVID increases. There is also new evidence that repeated COVID-19 infections could increase the likelihood of developing long COVID. That is why it is important to get the vaccine. Even if you do get COVID-19, the vaccine will reduce your chances of getting severely ill.\nCOVID-19 Health Hub\nHandwashing and COVID-19\nHand Sanitizers and COVID-19\nTop 10 Tips From Your Family Doctor\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: COVID-19\nWorld Health Organization: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)\nCVEEP: COVID-19\nCVEEP: Stay Protected\nLast Updated:April 23, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causesulcersto form in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Crohn\u2019s disease can have \u201cskip\u201d areas that are normal. These normal areas lie in between areas that are affected. Some people who have Crohn\u2019s disease have severe symptoms. Others have symptoms that are not as severe. Some people who have the disease have long periods without symptoms, even without getting treatment. Others who have more severe symptoms will need long-term treatment or even surgery.\nThe symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease vary, depending on which part or parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is/are affected. Common symptoms include:\nOther less common symptoms may include\nSymptoms may be mild or severe, and they can come and go. Symptoms can start suddenly or gradually.\nDoctors don\u2019t yet know exactly what causes Crohn\u2019s disease. It seems to run in families, which means that genetics play a role. Many researchers believe that a problem with the immune system causes inflammatory bowel diseases. Normally, the immune system protects your body from infection. In people who have an inflammatory bowel disease, the immune system mistakes food, healthy bacteria, and other substances for an infection. This causes the immune system to attack the cells of the intestine, which leads to inflammation.\nYour doctor will give you a physical exam and listen to you describe your symptoms. To help diagnose the problem, your doctor may order a number of tests, including blood tests and stool samples. Additionally, your doctor may order one or more procedures to help them view your colon. For example, lower GI endoscopy procedures include colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. During these procedures, your doctor uses a narrow, flexible tube to look directly inside your large intestine. Upper GI endoscopy allows a look at your stomach and small intestine for ulcers. For this type of endoscopy, you may swallow a small camera (called capsule endoscopy). If not, your doctor inserts a scope into your GI tract through your mouth.\nYour doctor may also order other imaging tests such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI.\nCrohn\u2019s disease cannot be prevented, but you can make lifestyle changes to minimize symptoms. The best thing you can do is to take good care of yourself. It\u2019s important to eat a healthy diet. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may ask you to reduce the amount of fiber or dairy products in your diet. It also may be necessary to limit or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. In addition to eating well, you need to get enough rest and exercise regularly. It\u2019s also important that you learn to manage the stress in your life. When you become overly upset by things that happen at home or at work, your intestinal problems can get worse.\nThe goal of treatment is to get rid of the inflammation that causes your symptoms. Many types of medicine can help reduce inflammation. Talk to your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs that suppress the immune system. Some medicines are needed only during flare-ups, however, you may need long-term medicines to suppress your immune system. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend these medicines and supplements:\nIn severe cases of Crohn\u2019s disease, you may need to go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids or surgery.\nA team of doctors will most likely oversee your treatment. This team may include your family physician, a gastroenterologist (a specialist in stomach and intestinal disorders), and, possibly, a surgeon.\nIf you have inflammatory bowel disease, you are at an increased risk for colon cancer. Therefore, it\u2019s important to talk to your doctor about when to start screening for colon cancer and how often to have screening.\nCrohn\u2019s disease can keep coming back, and its symptoms can be unpredictable. This cycle can cause patients who have these illnesses to become depressed. If you feel depressed, talk with your family doctor. They may be able to prescribe an antidepressant medicine could help you feel better.\nHow can I get more information?\nYou can understand and manage your illness better if you are informed. So be sure to ask questions and read about IBD. You can also discuss treatments with your doctor. Finally, consider joining a patient support group, especially if you have severe symptoms.\nCrohn\u2019s and Colitis Foundation of America\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Digestive Diseases\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Treatment of Crohn\u2019s Disease\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nEsta informaci\u00f3n proporciona una visi\u00f3n general y puede que no se aplique a todos.

    "article_title": "What is croup?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nCroup is a commonchildhood infectionthat affects breathing. It is recognizable by a \u201cbarking\u201d cough commonly referred to as croup cough. It is caused by a virus and is common during winter and spring months. It usually affects children age 5 and younger, but older children can contract it as well.\nThe \u201cbarking\u201d cough associated with croup is caused by inflammation of the upper trachea as a result of the virus.\nIn addition to the barking cough, your child may have a fever and a high-pitched noise as they breathe in (stridor). Another sign that it may be croup is that the cough is worse at night. Your child may have these symptoms for 3 to 5 days.\nThe most common cause of croup is an infection from the human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs). HPIVs are a group of 4 viruses. The viruses are airborne and can spread from an infected person\u2019s cough or sneeze. The virus also spreads from hand to mouth when your child touches a contaminated surface or item and then puts his or her hand into their mouth or nose.\nYour doctor will examine your child\u2019s breathing and listen with a stethoscope. Also, he will look at the inside of your child\u2019s throat and ask about any recent history of illness. A chest X-ray may be required to rule out other reasons for the cough.\nGood and frequent hand washing is the best way to prevent the virus that causes croup. Additionally, don\u2019t allow your child to share cups, plates, and utensils with others. If you know someone with croup, avoid contact with that person. If your child has croup (or has been diagnosed with a respiratory virus), keep your child home from school and play dates.\nYour doctor may prescribe a steroid to help with the trachea inflammation caused by croup. In more severe cases, doctors may prescribe certain breathing treatments. However, most cases of croup can be treated at home. Your child will need more fluids than normal when battling croup. You can help your child breathe easier by exposing him or her to moist air. This can be done with a warm, steamy room (let the shower run in a bathroom with the door closed) or a mist humidifier. Cool air also helps. You can take your child outside in the winter months for a few minutes for cool air.\nAlso, try having your child breathe through a warm, wet washcloth for a few minutes to help them breathe. If your child is coughing for long periods, he or she may have chest pain. Over-the-counter children\u2019s pain medicine can help ease the pain. Do not give your child aspirin.Call 911 immediatelyif your child:\nCaring for a child with croup can be tiring. Since the coughing occurs more frequently at night, you may have to get up with your child several times a night to give them relief. The sound of their coughing also can interrupt the sleep of others in the house. Be prepared for your child to be irritable. The coughing is uncomfortable and interrupts their sleep.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Croup\nThe Nemours Foundation, KidsHealth: Croup\nLast Updated:August 6, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is Cushing\u2019s syndrome?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is a disease that occurs when your body makes too much of the hormone cortisol. Also, it can occur from getting too much cortisol from medicines.\nA little cortisol is acceptable. Prolonged exposure to the hormone causes problems. Cortisol is produced by the outer area of your adrenal glands. These glands are located above each kidney. Cortisol is good for your body in limited amounts. In fact, cortisol is sometimes called a \u201cstress hormone.\u201d This is because it helps the body respond to stress. Also, it helps your body use nutrients, treat inflammation, control the amount of water in your body, and tell your liver when to increase your blood sugar as it needs it.\nCortisol is controlled by another hormone known as ACTH. It is made in your pituitary gland. This gland is located just below your brain.\nThe following are some of the symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome:\nThe most common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is taking corticosteroid medicines (in pill form) every day for weeks to months. These medicines are usually used to treat inflammatory diseases, such asasthma,lupus, andrheumatoid arthritis.\nInhaled steroid medicines for asthma and steroid skin creams don\u2019t usually cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome. These forms are used for eczema and other skin conditions. Even pills taken every day for short periods of time or every other day for longer periods don\u2019t often cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nThe next most common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is when the body makes too much cortisol. It may be one adrenal gland producing too much cortisol, or it may be both adrenal glands. This overproduction could be triggered by a tumor on the pituitary gland. Pituitary gland tumors causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome aren\u2019t usually malignant (cancerous). However, if these tumors get too big, they can cause problems with your eyesight.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome also can be caused by other tumors in your body. Ectopic ACTH-producing tumors can be malignant or benign (not cancerous). They release too much of the hormone ACTH. This tells your body to produce more cortisol. Not much is known about what causes the tumors. If your body isn\u2019t getting enough ACTH, your cortisol levels will decrease. As this happens, it shrinks your adrenal glands. This can lead to another disease called Addison\u2019s disease.\nA primary adrenal gland disease or disorder can also cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome. With this type of disorder, your glands make too much or too little cortisol. This production of cortisol is not in response to ACTH.\nYour doctor may start by asking you questions about your medical history. They also may do a physical exam. If the cause is a medicine you\u2019re taking, no tests are usually needed. If your doctor thinks you have Cushing\u2019s syndrome and you\u2019re not taking medicines that cause it, you may need to have blood and urine tests. These tests measure the amount of cortisol in your body.\nYou may be asked to collect your urine for 24 hours. You also may be given a certain medicine before your blood or urine is collected. This tests your body\u2019s response to steroids. You also may be asked to collect your saliva late in the evening. How much cortisol is in the saliva can help your doctor determine if you have Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nYou may need a computerized tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. These tests take a picture of your insides. Looking at these pictures, your doctor will be able to tell whether there are tumors on the pituitary gland or in other parts of your body that may be causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nIf your doctor plans to treat any of your health issues with steroid medicines, talk with them first. Discuss how long you will have to take the steroids. Ask them if there\u2019s a possibility it will cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome. There is no way of preventing pituitary gland tumors.\nIf a corticosteroid medicine is causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome, your doctor will gradually lower your dose. Abruptly stopping a corticosteroid can cause a dangerous drop in your cortisol levels. Never stop taking these medicines without your doctor\u2019s approval. Your doctor also may prescribe a noncorticosteroid medicine to replace the corticosteroid that was causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nIf a tumor is causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome, sometimes a medication can be used to treat it. If not, your doctor will surgically remove it from your pituitary gland. This type of surgery is usually successful. Radiation treatments are sometimes used after surgery to lower the risk the tumor will return. You\u2019ll need to take a cortisol replacement medicine after the tumor is removed. This is because it will take your body some time before it starts producing normal amounts of cortisol. Most people only need to take the cortisol replacement medicine for a few months. However, it could take up to year.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome treatment does not always return people to the same level of health they once had. Their bones may not be as strong. People who no longer have Cushing\u2019s syndrome are at higher risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. A person cured of Cushing\u2019s syndrome might have some memory loss and slight mental decline. But the change is slight. In rare cases, people who have had surgery to remove a tumor that was causing Cushing\u2019s syndrome never regain normal cortisol levels and must therefore continue to take the cortisol replacement medicine.\nOnce you\u2019ve been diagnosed with Cushing\u2019s syndrome and treated, you will need regular checkups for the rest of your life. In rare cases, surgery to remove a tumor may miss some of the tumor and it may grow again.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Cushing\u2019s Syndrome\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cushing\u2019s syndrome\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is cystic fibrosis?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder (it runs in families) that causes your mucus and sweat glands to behave abnormally. CF causes your mucus to be very thick. This thick, sticky mucus can gather in the lungs and intestines. Over time, it causes permanent damage to these organs.\nCF affects all races and ethnic groups but is more common in the white population, especially those with northern European ancestors. As of 2022, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimates that nearly 40,000 children and adults are living with cystic fibrosis in the U.S.\nCF is a progressive disease. This means it takes a toll on your body over time. Treatments for CF have improved over the years. This has resulted in a longer life expectancy for those who have CF. Currently, the average life expectancy for a CF patient is mid 40s. However, some patients are living into their 50s.\nThe symptoms of CF vary from child to child. In most cases, a child will have symptoms before they are a year old. Other times, CF won\u2019t be identified until later \u2014 sometimes even not until adulthood.\nCF symptoms also vary in severity. One person may have only a few symptoms, while someone else will experience more severe symptoms. Respiratory symptoms are the most common. There are also digestive symptoms and reproductive symptoms. All these symptoms are a result of the thick mucus associated with CF. It blocks air passageways in the lungs. It clogs the digestive system, making it harder for digestive enzymes to pass. In women, a thick cervical mucus may hinder fertility (ability to get pregnant).\nSymptoms of CF, as reported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), can include:\nWhat causes cystic fibrosis?\nCF is a genetic disorder. This means it is caused by a defect in a gene. Specifically, this defect occurs on the CFTR gene. The CFTR gene is responsible for producing a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body\u2019s cells.\nWhen the CFTR gene is affected, it produces a protein that does not work the way it should. Instead of normal mucus and sweat, the protein causes thick mucus and very salty sweat.\nHow is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?\nThe sweat test is considered the most reliable test for diagnosing CF. If you show symptoms of CF, your doctor will order a sweat test. Or, if a blood test or genetic test suggests that you or your child may have CF, a sweat test is typically used to confirm that diagnosis.\nA sweat test is simple and painless. During the test, your doctor will apply a chemical to your arm or leg and use electrical stimulation to encourage your sweat glands to begin sweating. They will collect the sweat and send it to the lab. The lab will measure the amount of chloride in the sweat.\nIf chloride levels are high, that means the salt levels in the sweat are high. High salt levels confirm a CF diagnosis.\nOther tests\nOnce you have been diagnosed with CF, there are other tests your doctor may order. These tests can reveal more information about the severity of your CF and how to treat it.\nOther tests include:\nCan cystic fibrosis be prevented or avoided?\nCF is a genetic disorder that cannot be prevented. It is passed along when a child inherits the defective gene from both parents.\nA child who inherits the defective gene from only one parent is a carrier. When two carriers have a child, there is a 25% chance their child will have CF; there is a 25% chance their child will not have CF and will not be a carrier; there is a 50% chance their child will be a carrier but not have CF.\nThere is no cure for CF. The only way to cure or prevent it would involve gene therapy. Researchers continue to explore ways to make this a reality.\nUntil then, doctors will continue to treat the symptoms of CF to prolong the life expectancy and quality of life for people who have CF. Their treatment plans have improved dramatically over the years.\nLung treatments\nThere are many ways to treat CF because it varies in severity and symptoms. Mostly, treatment plans for CF aim to prevent and control lung infections. With this being the primary goal, much effort is focused on loosening and removing the thick mucus from the lungs.\nRespiratory therapy, physical therapy and exercise, combined with medication, helps reduce the mucus in the lungs. If you have CF, there are several medications your doctor may prescribe. These include:\nIf you have advanced lung disease because of CF, you may also need oxygen therapy as part of your treatment plan.\nIf your lung disease is severe, a lung transplant may be an option. A lung transplant is a surgical procedure to remove your diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a donor.\nDigestive treatments\nCF can cause many digestive problems.

Today, it\u2019s more than twice that (46 years). And some people who have CF live into their 50s.\nLiving with CF does come with many challenges. Even though treatment options have improved, they are still expensive and can be time consuming. And because care is ongoing (daily), it can become frustrating.\nDespite this, most people who have CF are still able to work, go to school, and participate in most typical activities.\nResources\nCystic Fibrosis Foundation\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Cystic Fibrosis\nNational Institutes of Health, Medline Plus: Cystic Fibrosis\nLast Updated:May 3, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus. Most people are exposed to the virus as infants. It is that believed most adults are diagnosed with the virus by age 40. Many people are infected with CMV and don\u2019t know it. That\u2019s because the virus rarely causes symptoms. It usually does not cause long-term problems. However, CMV can cause problems in people who have a weakened immune system. Also, it can cause problems in a newborn if the mother gets the infection during pregnancy.\nUsually, CMV does not cause symptoms. Sometimes, it causes mild symptoms. A few people will have symptoms that are similar to themononucleosisvirus. Symptoms of CMV can include:\nNewborns infected with CMV while in the womb can be very sick when they are born. Symptoms at birth can include:\nPeople taking immunosuppressant medicines for conditions like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or from having an organ transplant may have severe symptoms. Immunosuppressant medicines lower or suppress the immune system. Symptoms of severe CMV include:\nCMV is likely to cause vision problems in people who have weakened immune systems. So if you have certain conditions, such as HIV or AIDS, your doctor may recommend that you visit an eye doctor to check for infection. Let your doctor know if you are having painless, blurry vision (floaters) in one eye, light flashes, or areas of blindness. Also tell your doctor if you are experiencing frequent shortness of breath with flu-like symptoms, or if you are having problems hearing.\nThe virus is similar to the viruses that cause chickenpox and mononucleosis. It gets into body fluids, such as saliva, blood, urine, semen, and breast milk. A person can pass the virus onto others when it is active in his or her system. It spreads from one person to another through sexual contact or contact with blood and other body fluids. CMV is rarely spread by blood transfusion or organ transplantation.\nIf a pregnant woman passes CMV onto her unborn baby, it could cause a miscarriage, stillbirth, or death of the newborn. Newborns who survive are at an increased risk for hearing loss and mental disability. However, only a small percentage of newborns infected with CMV during pregnancy experience problems from the virus. Most are born healthy or with only mild CMV symptoms.\nCMV is diagnosed with a blood test. If you are pregnant, your doctor may want to test you for CMV. If you do carry the virus, your doctor may suggest a test called amniocentesis. During this test, a needle is inserted into the mother\u2019s uterus to collect a sample of fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid will be sent to a lab for testing.\nCareful, frequent hand washing with soap and water may help prevent the spread of CMV. Daycare centers are high-risk areas for children 1 to 3 years of age. People caring for someone diagnosed with HIV, AIDS, or with weakened immune systems from organ transplant should wear gloves when dealing with bodily fluids. Avoid kissing and sexual contact with a known infected person. Always practice safe sex by using condoms.\nFor otherwise healthy people, CMV usually doesn\u2019t require treatment. If your immune system is weakened, your doctor may use a medicine to treat CMV. However, because CMV is a virus, regular antibiotics won\u2019t work. Antiviral drugs are usually prescribed. This slows the virus. However, it cannot cure CMV.\nIf you are pregnant and your baby has CMV, you doctor will likely check your baby for any health problems once he or she is born so they can be treated early. Treatable symptoms in newborns include pneumonia, hearing loss, and inflammation of the eye.\nWhen the virus is inactive (no signs of symptoms), there is no discomfort. When the virus is active, the symptoms can affect your quality of life. See your doctor for recommendations on ways reduce the discomfort of the symptoms.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Congenital CMV Infection\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection\nLast Updated:September 10, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nDe Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is a painful condition that affects the tendons in your wrist. It occurs when the 2 tendons around the base of your thumb become swollen. The swelling causes the sheaths (casings) covering the tendons to become inflamed. This puts pressure on nearby nerves, causing pain and numbness.\nThe main symptom of de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is pain or tenderness at the base of your thumb. You might also feel pain going up your forearm. The pain may develop slowly or come on suddenly. It may get worse when you use your hand, thumb, or wrist.\nOther symptoms include:\nThe most common cause of de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is chronic overuse of the wrist. Repetitive movements day after day cause irritation and pain. One common movement that causes it is lifting a child into a car seat. Another is lifting heavy grocery bags by the handles. Other causes could include a direct injury to the wrist or inflammatory arthritis.\nYou are more likely to develop de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis if:\nTo diagnose de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis, your doctor may do a simple test. It is called the Finkelstein test. First, you bend your thumb so it rests across your palm. Then you make a fist, closing your fingers over your thumb. Last, you bend your wrist toward your little finger. If you have tenderness or pain at the base of your thumb, you probably have de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis.\nOther tests such as X-rays usually aren\u2019t needed to diagnose the condition.\nThe best way to prevent de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is by avoiding repetitive movements. Change your actions to reduce the stress on your wrists. Take frequent breaks to rest if you are using your wrists. Wear a brace or splint on your thumb and wrist, if necessary. Follow the exercise routine suggested by your doctor or physical therapist. Be sure to tell them about any activities that cause pain, numbness, or swelling.\nTreatment for de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis focuses on reducing pain and swelling. It includes:\nA physical therapist or occupational therapist can show you how to change the way you move. This can reduce stress on your wrist. They can also teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles.\nMost people notice improvement after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. They are able to use their hands and wrists without pain once the swelling is gone.\nYou might need surgery if your case is severe or if other treatments don\u2019t relieve your pain. During outpatient surgery, the surgeon makes a small cut in the sheath around the swollen tendons. This provides more room for the tendons to move.\nAfter surgery, you will need to do physical therapy to strengthen your wrist and thumb. This will help keep the problem from coming back. Once the area has healed and returned to full strength, you should have normal use of your hand.\nDe Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis is a temporary condition. It generally responds well to treatment. It is important to treat de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis. If this condition isn\u2019t treated, it can permanently limit your movement or cause the tendon sheath to burst.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nDeep vein\u00a0thrombosis\u00a0(DVT) is a\u00a0blood\u00a0clot. These clots usually occur deep down in your leg veins. DVT is common and can be dangerous. If the blood clot breaks off and travels through your bloodstream, it can block a blood vessel in your lungs. This blockage (called a\u00a0pulmonary\u00a0embolism) can be fatal.\nSome people who have DVT do not have any symptoms. Most have some swelling in one or both legs. Often, there is pain or tenderness in one leg (may happen only when you stand or walk). Your skin may feel warm or look red or discolored. If you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away.\nOften, there are multiple factors that cause DVT. Your risk for DVT increases if you have several risk factors at the same time. You are at higher risk for DVT if you:\nVisit your doctor if you think you might have DVT. They will review your symptoms and health history and do a physical exam. They may order tests to help diagnose it. An ultrasound is the most common test. It uses sound waves to check the blood flow in your veins. A venography also can be done to find blood clots. A doctor injects dye into your veins and then takes an X-ray to check your blood flow.\nThere are several things you can do to help prevent DVT. These are more important if you are at increased risk.\nThe main goals of DVT treatment are to:\nSeveral medicines are used to treat and prevent DVT. Common ones include warfarin or heparin. These thin your blood so that clots won\u2019t form. Warfarin is taken as a pill and heparin is given intravenously (in your veins). Warfarin can cause birth defects. Women who are pregnant should not take warfarin. If you can\u2019t take heparin, your doctor may prescribe another type called a thrombin inhibitor. Newer treatment programs recommend NOACs (novel oral anticoagulants) as preferable medicines in most settings. Brand names include Eliquis, Pradaxa, and Xarelto.\nAnticoagulants can cause you to bleed more easily. For example, you might notice that your blood takes longer to clot when you cut yourself. You may bruise more easily as well. If you have any unusual or heavy bleeding, call your doctor right away.\nSome other medicines can affect how well an anticoagulant works. Talk to your doctor before you take any new medicine. This includes over-the-counter medicines and vitamins. Certain foods rich in vitamin K, such as dark green vegetables, also can have an effect.\nThere are other treatment options if you can\u2019t take medicine to thin your blood, or if a blood thinner doesn\u2019t work. Your doctor may suggest putting a filter in your vena cava. This is the main vein that carries blood from your lower body to your heart. This filter can catch a clot as it moves through your bloodstream and prevent it from reaching your lungs. This treatment is more common for people who have had several blood clots travel to their lungs.\nIt is important to start treatment right away for DVT. It takes about 3 to 6 months for a blood clot to go away. During this time, there are things you can do to relieve symptoms. Elevate your leg to reduce swelling. Talk to your doctor about using compression stockings. These cover the arch of your foot up to your knee. They create pressure on your leg to reduce swelling and relieve pain.\nFor some people, the clot may never fully dissolve. This can cause scar tissue in your veins. DVT also can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome. People who get this have chronic (long-term) swelling and pain.\nIf you have DVT and experience the following symptoms, get help right away. These are signs that the clot may have traveled to your lungs.

However, it\u2019s not related to normal aging.Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseis the most common form of dementia.\nDementia makes it hard for people to remember, learn, and communicate. It may cause changes in mood and personality, such asdepression. Early on, memory lapses and foggy thinking may bother someone who has dementia. Later, disruptive behavior and other problems can create a burden for caregivers and family. Over time, these changes make it hard for people who have dementia to care for themselves.\nSymptoms of dementia may appear over time or all at once. Sometimes you may notice the symptoms in yourself. Sometimes those around you may notice them first. Either way, if you have two or more of the symptoms listed below, visit your doctor right away.\nDementia is caused by the damage of brain cells. A brain disease, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, could trigger dementia. A brain tumor, head injury, orstrokecould cause dementia.\nDementia isn\u2019t the same as normal aging. As you get older, it becomes harder to recall information. Your short- and long-term and remote memories are less affected by aging. Your recent memory is more affected. For example, you may forget what you ate for breakfast or where you set your keys. These are normal changes.\nA memory problem is serious when it affects your daily life.

The sooner you do this, the sooner you can talk about treatment options.\nIf your family member shows signs, try to get them to see a doctor. You may want to go to the visit with them. This lets you speak with the doctor in private. You can tell them how your loved one is acting and learn about treatment.\nThere is little you can do to prevent or avoid dementia. If you have a head injury or brain tumor, ask your doctor if there are lifestyle changes you can make. You\u2019ll want to take precautions to avoid additional head trauma or concussions.

This may include visiting more, helping out, hiring medical care, orswitching residences.\nPeople who have dementia may become agitated for various reasons. Examples are frustrating or stressful situations, or a sudden change in surroundings. Simple things such as getting dressed or not remembering can lead to frustration. It\u2019s possible that a person who is irritable may try to hurt themselves or others. Try to avoid things or places in which your loved one might become frustrated.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nDepression is a serious medical illness of the brain. It is not a feeling of sadness or feeling \u201cblue.\u201d Someone who has depression has symptoms\u00a0nearly every day, all day, for 2 weeks or longer. It\u2019s persistent and interferes with everyday life\u2014from work, home, and school to relationships and daily tasks. For some, depression can lead to suicidal thoughts. If you or a loved one are having suicidal thoughts, call or text 988. This is the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. It is staffed around the clock. Your call or text will never be turned away.\nDepression can affect people of all ages and is different for every person. A person who has depression can\u2019t control their feelings. If you or your child, teen, or older relative is depressed, it\u2019s not their fault. Left untreated, depression can last for weeks, months, or even years.\nWomen are twice as likely as men to experience depression. The reason for this is unknown. Changes in a woman\u2019s hormone levels may be related to depression.\nSymptoms are different for every person. You may have one or many of the symptoms listed below. Your symptoms may appear as emotional, physical, or a combination of both. The symptoms of depression may be different for children, teens, and seniors.\nEmotional symptoms include:\nPhysical symptoms include:\nDepression is typically caused by one or more factors. This includes genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological causes.\nFor example, depression may be caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain. Sometimes there aren\u2019t enough chemical messengers (called neurotransmitters) in the brain. Neurotransmitters that affect your mood are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. A chemical imbalance in the brain may be caused by one or more of the following:\nDepression is not caused by personal weakness, laziness, or lack of willpower.\nIn the days following the birth of a baby, it is common for some mothers to have mood swings. They may feel a little depressed or have a hard time concentrating. They may lose their appetite or find that they can\u2019t sleep well even when the baby is asleep. This is called the baby blues and goes away within 10 days after delivery. However, some women have worse symptoms or symptoms that last longer. This is calledpostpartum depression.\nTell your doctor about your symptoms. Don\u2019t expect your doctor to guess that you\u2019re depressed just by looking at you. You may feel embarrassed. It may be hard for you to imagine that treatment will help you feel better. But don\u2019t wait to talk to your doctor. The sooner you seek treatment, the sooner the depression will lift.\nOnce you tell your doctor how you\u2019re feeling, they may ask you some questions about your symptoms, your health, and your family history. Your doctor may also give you a physical exam and do some tests. It is important to tell your doctor about any medicines that you are taking, including substance abuse.\nReasons to get help early:\nGenerally, depression is a condition that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms of depression (see depression treatment).\nDepression can be treated with prescription antidepressant medicines,counseling, or a combination of the two. Lifestyle changes can help, too. This includes a nutritious diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, drugs, and too much caffeine. Research has shown that fueling your body with healthy foods can fuel your brain.\nDepression usually can be treated through visits to your doctor. You may need in-hospital treatment if you have other medical conditions that could affect your treatment. In-hospital treatment is required if you\u2019re at high risk of suicide.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine to treat your depression. These are calledantidepressants. They help increase the number of chemical messengers (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) in your brain.\nAntidepressants work differently for different people. They also have different side effects. So, even if one medicine bothers you or doesn\u2019t work for you, another may help. You may notice improvement as soon as 1 week after you start taking the medicine. But you probably won\u2019t see the full effects for about 8 to 12 weeks. You may have side effects at first. They tend to decrease after a couple of weeks. Don\u2019t stop taking the medicine without checking with your doctor first.\nThere is some new research that ketamine therapy may have a rapid effect on improving severe depression.\nCounseling (or talk therapy) may be a good treatment option for mild to moderate depression. For major depression and for some people with minor depression, counseling may not be enough. A combination of medicine and talk therapy is usually the most effective way of treating more severe depression. If you continue the combination treatment for at least a year, you are less likely to have depression come back.\nInpsychotherapy, you talk with a trained therapist or counselor about things that are going on in your life. The focus may be on your thoughts and beliefs, on things that happened in your past, or on your relationships. Or the focus may be on your behavior, how it\u2019s affecting you, and what you can do differently.\nIn more serious cases, your doctor may suggest the use of electroconvulsive therapy (also called ECT or electroshock therapy). It changes your brain\u2019s chemistry. Electric currents are passed through the brain to trigger a seizure (a short period of irregular brain activity). It lasts about 40 seconds. Medicine is given during ECT to prevent damage to muscles and bones.\nElectroconvulsive therapy may help people who have the following conditions:\nThe most important part of living with depression is not giving up. Stay focused on your goal to feel better and be consistent with your doctor-recommended treatment. Do not try to \u201cself-medicate\u201d for depression with substance use. It only makes it worse.\nConsider these dos and don\u2019ts as you work toward recovery.\nPeople who have depression sometimes think about suicide. This thinking is a common symptom of the depression. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself, tell someone. Tell your doctor, your friends, or your family. Or you could call your local suicide hotline, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.\nGet help right away. There are people who can help you.

    "article_title": "What is diabetes in kids?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nDiabetes\u2014in kids and adults\u2014is a long-lasting (chronic) condition that affects how your body turns sugars known as glucose into energy. Your body turns most of the food you eat into glucose and releases it into your blood stream. It does this using a hormone called insulin.\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn\u2019t make or use insulin properly. It causes too much glucose to build up in the blood. There are two types of diabetes.\nType 1occurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce any insulin. It is often called juvenile diabetes because it is typically diagnosed when people are young but can be diagnosed in adults, too. Until recently, this was the most common type of diabetes in children and teens. In more recent years there has been an increase in Type 2 diabetes in all age groups.\nType 2diabetes occurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin or doesn\u2019t use the insulin as it should. Doctors think the increase in Type 2 diabetes among kids is tied to an increase in having obesity and a drop in physical activity.\nThe symptoms of diabetes can vary from person to person. The early stages might have very few symptoms. You may not even be aware your child has the disease.\nCommon symptoms include:\nThe cause of diabetes depends on the type.\nWith type 1 diabetes, your child\u2019s body doesn\u2019t make insulin. This is because the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin. Your child\u2019s risk for type 1 diabetes is greater if one of their parents or one of their siblings has it.\nWith type 2 diabetes, the pancreas still makes insulin, but it doesn\u2019t make enough. Type 2 diabetes can also happen if the cells in your child\u2019s body can\u2019t use insulin properly. This is called insulin resistance. This causes glucose (a form of sugar) to build up in the child\u2019s blood instead of moving into the cells. Too much glucose in the blood can lead to health problems that damage the blood vessels, nerves, heart eyes and kidneys.\nThere are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes in kids. These include:\nAfter examining your child, discussing symptoms and going over their health history, your doctor may test for diabetes if they suspect your child is at risk. Testing can include:\nType 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or avoided. There are some lifestyle changes that may help lower your child\u2019s risk for type 2 diabetes:\nThe single most important thing your child can do is control their blood sugar level. They can do this by eating right, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and, if needed, taking oral medicines or insulin.\nYour child\u2019s diet should include lots of complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains), fruits, and vegetables. It\u2019s important to eat at least 3 meals per day and never skip a meal. Your child should eat at about the same time every day. This helps keep their insulin or medicine and sugar levels steady. Avoid empty calories, such as foods high in sugar and fat, or alcohol.\nExercise\nExercising helps your child\u2019s body use insulin and lower their blood sugar level. It also helps control their weight, gives them more energy, and is good for their overall health.\nLosing excess weight and maintaining a healthy body weight will help insulin work better in your child\u2019s body.\nIf your child\u2019s diabetes can\u2019t be controlled with diet, exercise, and weight control, their doctor may recommend medicine or insulin. Most people who have type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine (taken by mouth). Oral medicines can make their body produce more insulin. They also help their body use the insulin it makes more efficiently. Oral medicine doesn\u2019t work for everyone, though. It isn\u2019t effective in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Some people need to add insulin to their bodies with insulin injections, insulin pens, or insulin pumps.Insulin therapyis necessary for all people who have type 1 diabetes and for some people who have type 2 diabetes. If insulin is required, you\u2019ll have to help give your child a shot or teach them to do it on their own (either with a syringe or with an insulin pen). Your doctor will tell you which kind of medicine your child should take and why. Make sure your child takes their medicines exactly as their doctor prescribes.\nYour doctor will test your child\u2019s blood sugar every 3 months with an A1C test. Your doctor may ask you to test your child\u2019s blood sugar on your own throughout the day if they are taking insulin or they are adjusting their medication. You will need to use ablood glucose monitorto check it on your own at home. This involves pricking your child\u2019s finger for blood and putting a test strip in the blood. You then insert the test strip in the monitor for results.Continuous glucose monitors (CGM)are also an option to help people with diabetes measure their blood glucose around the clock. A CGM is worn on the arm and offers real-time blood sugar levels you can check with an app on your phone.\nIf your child\u2019s blood sugar gets too low, they might:\nAt the earliest sign of any of these symptoms, your child should eat or drink something that will raise their blood sugar fast. This could include candy, juice, milk, or raisins. If they don\u2019t feel better in 15 minutes or if monitoring shows that their blood sugar level is still too low, they should eat or drink another item to raise their blood sugar fast. Always keep a supply of these items on hand for emergencies.\nYou may not know if your child\u2019s blood sugar is too high unless you test it yourself. However, they may experience common symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurry vision, and feeling tired. Some factors unrelated to food can make your child\u2019s blood sugar high. These include not taking your insulin correctly, overeating at a meal, illness, having hormonal changes, and stress.\nIf your child\u2019s blood sugar level is too high and they take insulin, they may need to take an extra dose of rapid- or short-acting insulin to return it to normal. Your doctor can tell you how much insulin they need to take to lower their blood sugar level.\nYour child can live a normal life with well-controlled diabetes. However, they have to pay attention to their diet, weight, exercise, and medicine. If you don\u2019t control your diabetes, you will have too much glucose in your blood. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and damage to the nerves and kidneys.\nMayo Clinic: Type 1 Diabetes in Children\nNational Institute of Health: MedlinePlus: Diabetes in Children and Teens\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nEsta informaci\u00f3n proporciona una visi\u00f3n general y puede que no se aplique a todos.

Diabetes insipidus is a hormone disorder. It occurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce enough antidiuretic hormone (ADH). It can also occur if your body doesn\u2019t use the hormone effectively. ADH helps your body balance water in the urine and blood.\nThere are several symptoms of diabetes insipidus, including:\nDiabetes insipidus has several causes. In some people, a part of the brain (called the hypothalamus) doesn\u2019t make enough ADH. In other cases, the pituitary gland doesn\u2019t release enough of the hormone. Damage to either the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland can cause diabetes insipidus. This can occur after a head injury, during brain surgery, or when a tumor grows on the glands.\nAbnormalities in the kidneys can also cause diabetes insipidus. This can affect the way they process ADH.\u00a0Diabetes insipidus can be caused by some medicines, such as lithium.\u00a0About 30% of the time, doctors can\u2019t find the cause.\nTo check for diabetes insipidus, your doctor may order one of several tests:\nMost of the time, diabetes insipidus is a permanent condition. You likely won\u2019t be able to prevent it. It is often associated with another health problem, such as abnormal kidney function or tumors. Even though you can\u2019t prevent it in these cases, you can often manage the symptoms.\nIf your symptoms are mild, you might not need treatment. However, your doctor will want to check on you more often. You should make sure you always have something to drink. This will ensure that your body doesn\u2019t get dehydrated.\nFor more severe cases of diabetes insipidus, your doctor may prescribe medicine. This medicine will help your body produce or more effectively use ADH. One medicine called desmopressin is a synthetic form of ADH. It comes in pill form, as a shot, or as a nasal spray. Drinking too much while taking this medicine can overload your body with fluids. This can make you feel sick, weak, or dizzy.\nOther treatments will depend on the cause of the illness:\nTalk to your doctor about which option is right for you.\nThere is no cure for diabetes insipidus. But you can work with your doctor to manage the symptoms. Medicine can help prevent the constant thirst and excessive urination that comes with this condition. Preventing these symptoms will add a great deal to your quality of life.\nNational Institutes of Health, Medline Plus: Diabetes Insipidus\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Diabetes Insipidus\nNDI Foundation\nLast Updated:April 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) happens when your blood sugar is higher than normal and your insulin level is lower than normal. This imbalance in the body causes a build-up of ketones. Ketones are toxic. If DKA isn\u2019t treated, it can lead to diabetic coma and even death.\nDKA mainly affects people who have type 1diabetes. But it can also happen with other types of diabetes, including type 2 diabetes andgestational diabetes(diabetes during pregnancy).\nDKA is a very serious condition. If you have diabetes and think you may have DKA, contact your doctor or go to a hospital right away. The first symptoms to appear are usually:\nThe next stage of DKA symptoms includes:\nIf your sugar is very high or symptoms are severe (especially confusion), you should go to the nearest emergency room.\nThe main cause of DKA is not producing enough insulin. A lack of insulin means sugar can\u2019t get into your cells. Your cells need sugar for energy. This lack of insulin causes your body\u2019s glucose levels to rise. To get energy, your body starts to burn fat. This process causes ketones to build up. Ketones can poison the body.\nHigh blood glucose levels can also cause you to urinate often. This leads to dehydration.\nDKA can be caused by missing an insulin dose, eating poorly, or feeling stressed. An infection or other illness (such aspneumoniaor aurinary tract infection) can also lead to DKA. If you have signs of infection (fever, cough, orsore throat), contact your doctor. It\u2019s important to get the right treatment. For some people, DKA may be the first sign they have diabetes.\nIf you think you may have diabetic ketoacidosis, contact your doctor right away. They will want to run some blood tests before giving you an official diagnosis. These tests include checking your blood sugar and ketone level. Your doctor also may order a urinalysis (requiring a urine sample) and chest X-ray.\nIf you have diabetes, there are some things you can do to watch for diabetic ketoacidosis. When you\u2019re sick, watch your blood sugar level very closely so it doesn\u2019t get too high or too low. Ask your doctor what your critical blood sugar level is. Patients should watch their glucose level closely when those levels are more than 250 mg per dL.\nWhen you\u2019re sick or stressed, you should check your blood sugar level more often than normal (sometimes every 3 to 4 hours). If your blood sugar reaches a critical level, check it every 1 to 2 hours. Ask your doctor if you should test your blood sugar level during the night.\nYou should also test your urine for ketones every few hours if you\u2019re sick, stressed, or if your blood sugar level is more than 250 mg per dL.\nYou should talk to your doctor to develop a plan if your blood sugar level gets too high. Make sure that you know how to reach your doctor in an emergency.\nDKA causes excessive urination. This means you will urinate more than usual. You can become dehydrated and your body can lose\u00a0electrolytes\u00a0(minerals in your blood that help your body function). If you are diagnosed with DKA, your doctor will most likely treat you with fluids (usually through an\u00a0IV). These fluids will contain electrolytes and insulin. Electrolytes will help your body function normally. Insulin will help lower your blood sugar level. Overall, fluids can help rehydrate you and dilute some of the sugar in your blood.\nKeeping the balance between blood sugar and insulin is the key to controlling diabetic ketoacidosis. In most cases, this means sticking to your insulin schedule. But you may need to adjust the amount of insulin you\u2019re taking.\nYou should also try to recognize when you feel stressed or sick. Small adjustments to your eating or drinking can make a big difference.\nYou should keep taking your insulin, even if you are too sick to eat. Your body needs insulin even if you\u2019re not eating. Ask your doctor whether it\u2019s necessary to adjust your dose or take extra insulin.\nIf you use an insulin pump, keep a variety of supplies on hand. Make sure that you have short-acting insulin, long-acting insulin, and needles in case your pump is not working right. You also should have an emergency phone number to call for help with your pump.\nWhen you\u2019re sick, drink lots of sugar-free,\u00a0caffeine-free liquids. Sip small amounts every few minutes if you\u2019re feeling sick to your stomach.\nIf your blood sugar level is more than 250 mg per dL, avoid foods that are high in\u00a0carbohydrates.\nAmerican Diabetes Association: DKA (Ketoacidosis) & Ketones\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Diabetic Ketoacidosis\nLast Updated:May 1, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nDiabetic nephropathy is a complication ofdiabetesand affects the kidneys. In healthy kidneys, many tiny\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels filter waste products from your body. These blood vessels have holes that are big enough to allow tiny waste products to pass through into the\u00a0urine. But the blood vessels are still small enough to keep useful products (such as\u00a0protein\u00a0and red blood cells) in the blood. High levels of sugar in the blood can damage these vessels if diabetes is not controlled. This can cause\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease, which is also called nephropathy. If the damage is bad enough, your kidneys could stop working.\nDiabetic nephropathy does not usually cause any symptoms until kidney damage is severe. As the condition progresses, symptoms can include the following:\nDiabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes. Over time, high levels of sugar can damage kidneys. Kidney damage is more likely if your blood sugar is uncontrolled, and your diabetes is not managed. It is also more likely if you smoke or if you have high blood pressure. Diabetic nephropathy is more common in people who are African American, Mexican American, or Native American, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nYour doctor will test your urine for protein. If there is protein in your urine, this could mean that your diabetes has damaged the holes in the blood vessels of your kidneys. This makes the holes big enough for protein (and other nutrients your body needs) to leak into your urine. Your doctor may also want to do a blood test to see how much damage has been done to the kidneys.\nThe best way to prevent diabetic nephropathy is to keep your blood sugar regulated. You should also regularly check your blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to a decrease in kidney function. Keeping blood pressure in the normal range can help prevent damage to your kidneys.\nIf you have been diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy, you cannot reverse the damage, but you can slow it. Here are some of the most important things you can do to protect your kidneys:\nEven with the right treatments, diabetic nephropathy can get worse over time. Your kidneys could stop working. This is called kidney failure. If this happens, waste products build up in your body. This can cause\u00a0nausea,\u00a0vomiting, weakness,\u00a0shortness of breath,\u00a0and confusion. In severe cases, kidney failure can cause seizures and coma.\nIf you have kidney failure, your doctor will refer you for\u00a0dialysis. In dialysis, a machine is used to take waste products out of the blood. One kind of dialysis must be done in a clinic. For another kind of dialysis, the machine is so small you can strap it to your body while you go about your daily activities. If you develop kidney failure, your doctor will help you decide which type of dialysis machine is right for you.\nReceiving treatment early can slow or even stop diabetic nephropathy from advancing. The disease progresses slowly. Not everyone who develops diabetic nephropathy will reach the stage of kidney failure.

It affects your retina. The retina is the part of your eye that is sensitive to light. The retina sends messages to your brain about what you see. A healthy retina is necessary for good vision.\nDiabetic retinopathy can cause blurry vision and progressive vision loss. When it\u2019s found early, laser treatment can help keep you from losing your vision. If it\u2019s not treated, retinopathy can cause blindness.\nIt is important to note that retinopathy can occur even in well-controlled diabetes. You should be evaluated for retinopathy if you have diabetes.\nThe early stages of diabetic retinopathy may present few, if any, symptoms. That\u2019s why eye exams are important. The American Optometric Association recommends that people who have diabetes get a comprehensive dilated eye exam once a year.\nThe symptoms for diabetic retinopathy can be mild to severe. Call your doctor if you:\nUncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes can damage the small blood vessels of the retina. When the blood vessels of your retina are damaged, fluid can leak from them and cause swelling. The swelling and fluid can cause blurry vision and make it hard for you to see. If retinopathy worsens, your eye may begin to form new blood vessels over the retina. These vessels are fragile and can break easily and bleed. This bleeding can cause severe vision loss and blindness.\nYour eye doctor may find evidence of diabetic retinopathy during a routine eye exam even if you have no symptoms. You probably won\u2019t notice the early signs of diabetic retinopathy. These early changes in your eyes can only be seen using special equipment.\nThe best way for your eye doctor to check for this condition is to dilate your eyes. Dilating your eyes opens up your pupils. This makes it easier to see the insides of your eyes. They can dilate your eyes using eye drops.\nWhile your eyes are dilated, your doctor will look for anything unusual. This includes looking for swelling, scar tissue, and abnormalities in blood vessels. They will also evaluate your optic nerve.\nThe best way to prevent diabetic retinopathy is to work with your doctor to manage your diabetes. You should also have your eyes checked regularly\u2014at least once a year. Your doctor can tell you if you should have them checked more often.\nOften, especially in rural areas, your family doctor may be able to screen you for diabetic retinopathy in their office.

They may ask about your bowel habits,\u00a0diet,\u00a0and any medicines you take. Your doctor may want to do tests to look for diverticular disease. These tests can include:\nSometimes, doctors find diverticular disease when you are being tested for something else. This could include a routine screening to check forcolorectal canceror when tests are performed to diagnose other digestive problems.\nThe best way to prevent diverticular disease is with a healthy lifestyle and ahigh-fiber diet. You can increase the amount of fiber in your diet by eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods. Also, be sure to drink plenty of fluids and exercise regularly.\nDiverticulosis treatment focuses on preventing the pouches from getting inflamed or infected. Your doctor may recommend:\nFor mild cases of diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend rest and a liquid diet until symptoms ease. They may also prescribe medicine to treat the infection.\nFor severe cases of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding, you may need to stay in the hospital. There you can get intravenous medicine and the rest you need. Some people need surgery to remove the pouches and diseased parts of their colon.\nIf you have diverticulosis, you may sometimes get flare-ups of diverticulitis. To prevent these, your doctor may suggest you eat more fiber, drink plenty of fluids, and exercise regularly. This should help prevent the pouches from becoming infected or inflamed.\nIn the past, doctors thought people with diverticulosis should avoid certain foods like nuts, seeds, and popcorn. However, research now suggests these foods aren\u2019t harmful and won\u2019t cause diverticulitis flare-ups. Still, everyone is different. If you think certain foods are making your symptoms worse, stop eating them and talk to your doctor.\nIf you start feeling symptoms of diverticulitis, call your doctor right away. Untreated diverticulitis can lead to dangerous complications, including intestinal blockages and openings in the bowel wall. Diverticular disease can also lead to an abscess that could require surgery.\nNational Institutes of Health, Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Diverticular Disease\nNational Institutes of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine: Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis\nLast Updated:September 23, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nDown syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes physical problems and intellectual disabilities. It is most often caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome number 21. This condition is called Trisomy 21.\nEach person born with Down syndrome is different. Some have health problems. These could include heart disease, hearing problems, thyroid disorders, obesity, or problems with their intestines. Many begin treatment for medical issues early and live full, healthy, productive lives.\nThere are many signs and symptoms of Down syndrome. Some people have different symptoms than others. Additionally, some have different problems at different points in their lives. Many people with Down syndrome share a distinct appearance.\nBecause of some of these physical features, children with Down syndrome often develop at a slower rate. This includes when they learn to roll over, sit, stand, and walk. They do eventually reach these milestones, but it takes them longer. Physical issues in areas such as the heart, brain, and GI tract can cause health problems.\nIn addition to physical signs, people with Down syndrome often have problems with thinking and learning.\nWhile these kinds of problems are common, they are rarely severe.\nDown syndrome is caused by a problem during cell division. This results in extra genetic material. The extra genetic material causes the features and problems of Down syndrome.\nScreening for Down syndrome is a normal part of prenatal care and has evolved over time. Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a blood test used in prenatal screening. It can determine the risk that the fetus will be born with certain genetic abnormalities. The test is most often used to look for chromosomal disorders, such as the one that causes Down syndrome. NIPT is considered noninvasive because it requires drawing blood only from the pregnant woman and does not pose any risk to the fetus, according to the National Institutes of Health.\nThe NIPT test is very accurate, but cannot be used to diagnose Down syndrome. It only indicates your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. Some women test positive in the screen but have perfectly healthy babies.\nThe only way to diagnose Down syndrome before birth is through diagnostic testing. This involves checking the tissue and fluid in the womb for the extra chromosome. This can be done through:\nThere is a slight risk that these tests can cause a miscarriage. So, doctors only use these tests when there is a higher chance of a genetic problem in the baby. This could be if the mother is 35 or older or if the mother received an abnormal screening result. After birth, your doctor can test the baby\u2019s blood for the extra chromosome. This is done if the baby has any of the physical signs or birth defects of Down syndrome.\nThis decision is up to you. Some women feel better if they know their risk. They can prepare themselves for the possibility of having a baby who has Down syndrome. Your doctor can help you understand your risks and consider the pros and cons of getting tested.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid your child having Down syndrome. However, the risk is lower if you have children at a younger age.\nThere isn\u2019t one standard treatment for Down syndrome. A person\u2019s treatment depends on their individual case. This includes their physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations. Having Down syndrome puts your child at increased risk for a number of health problems. These need different forms of treatment. Treatments could be one-time (such as surgery) or lifelong (such as a special diet).\nTreatment could start when your child is a baby. This could happen if they are born with a problem, such as a heart defect. Doctors may screen them for other problems that commonly occur with Down syndrome. These includehypothyroidism, hearing loss, vision problems, blood disorders, and digestive problems.\nYour child will most likely have a team of health professionals. This team will include doctors, specialists, and therapists. They will work together to give your child the treatment and therapy they need. This will allow them to live as productive a life as possible. Services may include early intervention, therapies, and assistive devices.\nEarly intervention involves specialized programs and resources. These are provided to babies and toddlers with Down syndrome and their families. They usually start at birth and last until the child turns 3 years old. From that age, the public school system provides physical, academic, speech and occupational therapy, and life skills support through the age of 21. Research has shown that early intervention improves outcomes for these children later in life.\nThere are a variety of therapies that can help a child with Down syndrome. These include:\nAn assistive device is any tool, technology, or piece of equipment that helps your child function more easily. This could include something as simple as a modified pencil that makes writing easier, a special touchscreen computer that allows your child to communicate or hearing aids.\nThere are other health problems that often go along with having Down syndrome. Every person with Down syndrome is different. Your child may or may not have or develop any of these other conditions.\nKeep your child physically healthy. Provide therapy or treatment for his or her impairments. This will help them be better able to learn. With therapy, many children with Down syndrome grow up to have jobs and live independently. There are even post-secondary programs designed to give people with Down syndrome a college experience. This allows them to develop life skills through life in a dorm, to take specially designed classes and to train for employment in their communities.\nNational Down Syndrome Society\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Down Syndrome\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development: Down Syndrome\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Down Syndrome\nLast Updated:October 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Also, it causes pain during tampon use. The pain can be felt in a woman\u2019s genitals or deep inside her pelvis.\nThe pain may feel sharp, burning, or like menstrual cramps. Pain during sex may feel like it is coming from deep inside the pelvis. Women often report the feeling that something is being bumped into inside them.\nDyspareunia can have many causes, including.\nDuring a visit with your doctor, they will ask you to describe your pain, where it is located, and when it began. They may also ask you to describe what you have tried in the past to relieve the pain. For example:\nYour doctor may want to examine your genital area or perform a pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your doctor may apply a cotton-tipped swab to the area around the vagina to see if it is painful. Your doctor will examine your vagina and cervix using a tool called a speculum. This helps the doctor gently open the area for the exam. It is similar to the way you get a Pap smear. For some women, this part of the exam may be painful. Your doctor may use a smaller speculum to decrease the discomfort. Your doctor may also delay the exam until the pain has decreased. It is important to let your doctor know if the exam becomes too painful.\nDuring the final part of the exam, your doctor will feel your uterus and ovaries with one hand on the abdomen and finger(s) in your vagina. This is similar to exams performed during a pelvic exam.\nIf your symptoms and exam suggest an infection, your doctor may take a sample from your vagina or cervix to send to the lab. A urine test is another possible test. Your doctor may order a pelvic sonogram, CT (computed tomography), or X-ray test to look inside your pelvis.\nDepending on the cause of your dyspareunia, it could be prevented through treatment. For example, if it is caused by vaginal dryness or lack of foreplay, it can be prevented through the use of a sexual lubricant.\nTreatments depend on what is causing your pain. They may include sexual lubricants (over-the-counter products), antibiotics for infections, a different type of birth control, or surgery.\nLiving with dyspareunia may be physically uncomfortable. However, it may affect your sexual relationship as well. Anticipating\u00a0painful sex may cause you to avoid it.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nDysphagia is a swallowing disorder, which means it may be difficult to swallow. People who have\u00a0dysphagia\u00a0have trouble swallowing solid foods, liquids, or saliva. They may not be able to swallow at all. Dysphagia can make it hard to take in enough calories and fluids to keep your body working properly.\nIf you have dysphagia, you may have some of the following symptoms:\nIf you regularly have trouble swallowing or have these symptoms, call your family doctor. If food has gotten stuck and you\u2019re having trouble breathing, call for emergency help right away.\nDysphagia can happen at any age, but it is more common in older people. Many different things can cause dysphagia:\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms. They will probably ask you what foods or liquids you have trouble swallowing. They will want to know if you have pain when swallowing or frequent\u00a0heartburn. Your doctor may also ask you if you\u2019ve coughed or thrown up any blood. If your doctor decides you may have dysphagia, they may order tests to figure out what is causing it.\nYou may have a test called a\u00a0barium\u00a0swallow. During this test, you will drink a liquid that contains a small amount of barium. Then the doctor can watch it travel through your body on an X-ray machine. This test can show whether something is blocking your esophagus, or if another problem is causing your dysphagia.\nYou may also need an endoscopy. For this test, the doctor uses a flexible tube with a light at the end of it. They will look inside the esophagus, stomach, and the first part of the small intestine. The doctor may take a small sample of tissue (called a biopsy) to rule out\u00a0cancer\u00a0or other possible causes of your dysphagia. You will probably be given a sedative medicine. This should make you more relaxed and comfortable during the test. Your throat will also be numbed, so you shouldn\u2019t feel pain when the tube is inserted. You may feel some irritation in your throat after the test and biopsy.\nThere isn\u2019t anything you can do to prevent having swallowing difficulties. The best way to reduce your risk of occasionally having trouble swallowing is to eat slowly, eat small bites, and chew your food well. In addition, treating acid reflux early can help lower your risk of developing scar tissue in the throat.\nTreatment for your dysphagia will depend on what is causing it.\nIf poor eating habits are the cause, your doctor may have you work with a speech pathologist to learn how to improve your ability to swallow. This could include chewing carefully or drinking more water while eating. Or you may need to change positions while swallowing. This could be as simple as turning your head at a different angle.\nYour doctor may also work with you to find foods that are easier for you to swallow. You might need to do exercises to strengthen your swallowing muscles, such as your tongue and your esophagus.\nSometimes, medicine or other treatments may be used to treat the cause of dysphagia. For example, if your dysphagia is caused by heartburn, your doctor might suggest taking an antacid or acid reducer before every meal. If you have a muscle problem causing dysphasia, a medicine called botulinum toxin may be used to relax throat muscles. This will make swallowing easier.\nSometimes dysphagia is caused by a\u00a0tumor\u00a0or something else blocking the esophagus. You may need surgery to treat these problems. For some people, surgery won\u2019t help. They would need a feeding tube in the stomach to make sure they are getting the foods and fluids they need.\nDysphagia can lead to complications.

The symptoms are worse in children and older people, and especially in people who have another illness.E. coliinfection\u00a0is more common during the summer months and in northern states.\nSymptoms can start from 1 to 10 days after you\u2019re exposed to the germ. The first symptoms are severe abdominal cramps that start suddenly. After a few hours, watery diarrhea starts. The diarrhea causes your body to lose fluids and electrolytes (dehydration). This makes you feel sick and tired. The watery diarrhea lasts for about a day and then may change to bright red bloody stools. The infection makes sores in your intestines, so the stools become bloody. The bloody diarrhea may last for 2 to 5 days. You might have 10 or more bowel movements a day. Some people say their stools are \u201call blood and no stool.\u201d You may have a mild\u00a0fever\u00a0or no fever. You may also have\u00a0nausea\u00a0or vomiting. If you have any of these symptoms\u2014watery, bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, nausea, or\u00a0vomiting\u2014try to get to your doctor right away.\nOne uncommon but severe complication is calledhemolytic uremic syndrome. People with this problem get hemolyticanemia(which is a low red\u00a0blood\u00a0cell\u00a0count), thrombocytopenia (which is a low\u00a0platelet\u00a0count), and\u00a0renal\u00a0failure (which is\u00a0kidney\u00a0damage).\u00a0Hemolytic uremic syndrome\u00a0is more common in children. It can cause acute renal failure in children. This problem starts about 5 to 10 days after the diarrhea starts. People with this problem must go to a hospital for medical care.\nMostE. coliinfections come from:\nHealthy beef and dairy cattle may carry theE. coligerm\u00a0in their intestines. The meat can get contaminated with the germ during the slaughtering process. When beef is ground up, theE. coligerms get mixed throughout the meat. That is why it is important to make sure ground meat is cooked all the way through. For beef steaks, a pink middle is still OK.\nThe most common way to get this infection is by eating contaminated food. You can be infected with theE. coligerm if you don\u2019t use a high temperature to cook your beef, or if you don\u2019t cook it long enough. When you eat undercooked ground beef, the germs go into your stomach and intestines.\nThe germ also can be passed from person to person in daycare centers and nursing homes. If you have this infection and don\u2019t wash your hands well with soap after going to the bathroom, you can give the germ to other people when you touch things, especially food.\nPeople who are infected withE. coliare very contagious. Children shouldn\u2019t go to a daycare center until they have 2 negative\u00a0stool\u00a0cultures (proof that the infection is gone). Older people in nursing homes should stay in bed until 2 stool cultures are negative.\nThe\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0is made by findingE. coliin a stool culture. If you have bloody diarrhea, see your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor will do a culture to find out if you haveE. coliin your intestines. The culture has to be taken in the first 48 hours after the bloody\u00a0diarrhea starts.\nYou can help prevent this infection by handling and cooking meat in a safe way. For your protection, follow these rules:\nIn restaurants, always order hamburgers that are cooked well done so that no pink shows.\nThere is no special treatment, except drinking a lot of water and watching for complications. Don\u2019t take medicine to stop diarrhea unless your doctor tells you to do so. This medicine would keep your intestines from getting rid of theE. coligerm. If you are seriouslydehydrated, you might need to go to the hospital to have fluids put into your veins with an IV.\nAs you are managingE. coliat home, get plenty of bed rest. Rest promotes recovery. Drink plenty of fluids to keep from being dehydrated. Stick to clear liquids and avoid drinks that have caffeine or alcohol. When you feel you are able to eat, start slowly. Try some crackers or toast. If that sets well, begin to add in other foods, but nothing too high in fiber for a while.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nAn ear infection is one of the most common conditions among children. It is caused by a viral or bacterial infection. These infections create pressure in the Eustachian tube that connects the throat to the middle ear. This pressure causes the ear pain.\nA\u00a0chronic\u00a0ear infection can last for 6 weeks or more, but most infections are viral and go away on their own after 3 days without needing to see a doctor. Children are more likely to get an ear infection when they\u2019re exposed to illness from other kids, especially during the winter months. Babies who drink from a bottle while lying down are likely to get the infections, too.\nIntense pain in your child\u2019s ear is usually the first sign of an ear infection. Young children can tell you that their ear hurts, but babies may only cry. Your child may repeatedly pull on the ear that hurts. The pain is usually worse at night and when your child is chewing, sucking a bottle, or lying down. That\u2019s when the pressure is at its greatest. Other symptoms include a runny nose, cough,\u00a0fever,\u00a0vomiting, or dizziness, and hearing loss.\nEar infections happen in the middle ear. They are caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The infection creates pressure in the Eustachian tube. This tube does not work properly when filled with drainage from the nose or mucous from allergies, colds, bacteria, or viruses.\nA child\u2019s adenoids (the little bits of\u00a0tissue\u00a0that hang above the\u00a0tonsils\u00a0at the back of the throat) sometimes can block the opening of Eustachian tubes because they are larger in young children.\nYour doctor will check for an ear infection by using a small scope with a light to look into your child\u2019s ear. They will know if the eardrum is infected if it looks red. Other signs of infection they may see include fluid in the ear or a ruptured eardrum\u2014which leaves a hole. Your doctor will also look for other symptoms in your child, such as a runny nose, cough, fever, vomiting, and dizziness.\nAlthough an ear infection is not\u00a0contagious, the bacteria or\u00a0virus\u00a0that caused it is often contagious. It\u2019s important to:\nCommon\u00a0allergy\u00a0and\u00a0cold\u00a0medicines do not protect against ear infections.\nEar infections need to be treated. If left untreated, they can lead to unnecessary pain andpermanent hearing lossfor your child.\nEar infections usually go away in a few days. Your doctor will likely treat your child\u2019s pain and fever with over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers or eardrops. If your child isn\u2019t better in a few days after treatment starts, you may need to take them back to the doctor. At that point, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if the infection is caused by bacteria.\nDoctors are cautious about prescribing antibiotics for ear infections unless they are chronic and frequent.\u00a0Research shows that over prescribing antibiotics for ear infections is not effective. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends doctors wait 2 to 3 days before prescribing antibiotics for an ear infection in children 2 to 12 years of age who have non-severe symptoms. This allows time to see if the OTC medicines will work.\nIf your child has chronic ear infections, signs of hearing loss, or speech delays because of hearing loss, your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor. The ENT may suggest your child have surgery. During this surgery, the ENT inserts tubes inside your child\u2019s middle ear. The tubes relieve the pressure and allow the fluid to drain. Some children naturally have small Eustachian tubes, so this helps correct that problem. As your child\u2019s ears grow and develop, the tubes fall out and the ear infections are no longer a problem. Sometimes, the tubes fall out too soon and have to be replaced. For some children, they never fall out and eventually have to be surgically removed.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nAn early pregnancy loss is known as a miscarriage. This represents any pregnancy that ends on its own in the first 20 weeks of gestation.\nExperts estimate that 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.\nThere are several classifications of miscarriage:\nThe most common symptoms of miscarriage are bleeding and cramping. But they don\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re having a miscarriage. Up to one-third of pregnancies come with some bleeding early on. About half of those result in normal pregnancies. If you have any bleeding or cramping in your first trimester, call your doctor.\nThere are other common signs that indicate you may be having a miscarriage. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away:\nIn some cases, the cause of your pregnancy loss is unknown. Often, it is a random problem with chromosomes that happens at conception. You might be afraid that you did something that caused your miscarriage. But things like working, exercising, having sex, or morning sickness do not cause miscarriage. Any kind of fall or blow is rarely to blame. The research on the effects of alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine is unclear. So, there is nothing you could have done to prevent it. It is not the result of anything you did or didn\u2019t do. You should never blame yourself for a miscarriage.\nYour doctor will start by asking you questions about your symptoms and when they started. They will do a physical exam. Your doctor might do an ultrasound. This can reveal if the embryo is still growing, and it can check for a heartbeat. They may also order blood tests. These can measure pregnancy hormone levels. This can give your doctor an idea if you are losing the pregnancy.\nThere is no conclusive research that says there is anything you can do to prevent a miscarriage. You didn\u2019t cause it, so you couldn\u2019t have prevented it.\nPatients who are pregnant and who have had a miscarriage are at greater risk of having another one. Your risk also increases as you get older. You are at highest risk when you are age 35 or older. Some medical conditions also increase your risk. These include:\nEven if you have one of these conditions, you can\u2019t do anything to avoid having a miscarriage. Many patients who are pregnant and have these health conditions have healthy pregnancies.\nThere are two main types of treatment for miscarriage: non-surgical and surgical.\nIn many cases, your body passes all of the pregnancy tissue naturally. This could take a few days up to a few weeks. No treatment is needed. If it is taking a long time, your doctor can give you medicine that can help pass the tissue.\nThe process of passing the tissue can involve heavy bleeding, cramping pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Your doctor may give you pain medicine to help ease your symptoms. If you are in your first trimester, the tissue will be small. It will look like a blood clot. It will not look like a baby.\nYour doctor may do an ultrasound or blood tests after you are finished with the miscarriage. This will confirm that the miscarriage is complete, and no tissue remains.\nSurgical treatment is usually done if there are complications with your miscarriage.\nAfter treatment, your doctor may recommend you not put anything into your vagina for a few weeks. This includes using tampons and having sex. This helps prevent infection.\nCall your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms.\nEveryone handles loss differently. Some patients who are pregnant may have trouble coping with the feelings that can go along with miscarriage. If you are very upset or feel like you need help, there are resources available. Talk to your doctor. They may be able to refer you to a local support group. There are also national resources you can access, such asSHARE: Pregnancy and Infant Loss Support.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nAn eating disorder is a mental health condition. It is an obsession with food and weight that harms a person\u2019s emotional and physical well-being and interferes with their everyday life. Many people worry about their weight. However, people who have an eating disorder go to extremes to keep from gaining weight. The 3 most common eating disorders are:\nAnorexia nervosa (often shortened to anorexia) is an illness that usually occurs in teenage girls. It also can occur in teenage boys, and in adult women and men. People who have anorexia are obsessed with being thin. They don\u2019t want to eat. They may try to hide their eating disorder by pretending to have eaten. They are afraid of gaining weight. They may constantly worry about how many calories they consume or how much fat is in their food. They may take diet pills, laxatives, or water pills to lose weight. They may exercise too much.\nPeople who have anorexia usually think they\u2019re fat even though they\u2019re very thin. They may get so thin that they look like they\u2019re sick. Anorexia isn\u2019t just a problem with food or weight. It\u2019s an attempt to use control over food and weight to deal with emotional problems.\nPeople who have anorexia may feel cold all the time, and they may get sick often. They are often in a bad mood. They have a hard time concentrating and are always thinking about food. It is not true that anorexics are never hungry. They are always hungry. Feeling hunger gives them a feeling of control over their lives and their bodies. It makes them feel like they are good at something\u2014they are good at losing weight. People who have severe anorexia may be at risk of death from starvation.\nBulimia is eating an unusual amount of food at once (called bingeing), and then getting rid of it. This includes throwing up or using laxatives to remove the food from the body (called purging). After a binge, some bulimics fast (don\u2019t eat) or over-exercise to keep from gaining weight. People who have bulimia may also use water pills, laxatives, or diet pills to \u201ccontrol\u201d their weight. People who have\u00a0bulimia\u00a0often try to hide their bingeing and purging. They may hide food for binges. People who have bulimia are usually close to normal weight, but their weight may go up and down.\nBinge eating disorder is eating an excessive amount of food at once and not purging it. People who have a binge eating disorder are typically overweight or have obesity. It is the most common eating disorder in the U.S.\nThe following are possible warning signs of anorexia and bulimia:\nMore serious warning signs may be harder to notice because people who have an eating disorder are skilled at keeping it a secret. Watch for these signs:\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly. Possible causes include genetic, environmental, peer pressure, and emotional health. Certain risk factors contribute to an eating disorder, including:\nEating disorders are most often diagnosed by examining physical health as well as mental health. Your doctor will evaluate your eating habits and order tests to help determine a diagnosis. They will also likely refer you to a mental health provider for evaluation.\nThere is no known way to prevent eating disorders. The reason some people develop eating disorders isn\u2019t known. People who have anorexia may believe they would be happier and more successful if they were thin. They want everything in their lives to be perfect. People who have this disorder are usually good students. They are involved in many school and community activities. They blame themselves if they don\u2019t get perfect grades, or if other things in life are not perfect.\nMost of the time, eating disorders are treated with a combination of prescription medicine (anti-depressants, anti-anxiety), talk therapy, and nutritional counseling.\nIf you\u2019re malnourished or very thin, you may be admitted to the hospital to treat the serious side effects of an eating disorder. Your doctor will probably want you to see a\u00a0dietitian\u00a0to learn how to pick healthy foods and eat at regular times. Family and individual counseling (talking about your feelings about your weight and problems in your life) is helpful for people who have eating disorders.\nFor people who have anorexia, the first step is getting back to a normal weight. Treatment of anorexia is difficult, because people who have anorexia believe there is nothing wrong with them. Patients in the early stages of anorexia (less than 6 months or with just a small amount of weight loss) may be successfully treated without having to be admitted to the hospital. But for successful treatment, patients must want to change and must have family and friends to help them.\nPeople who have more severe anorexia need care in the hospital, usually in a special unit for people who have anorexia and bulimia. Treatment involves more than changing the person\u2019s eating habits. Anorexic patients often need counseling for a year or more so they can work on changing the feelings that are causing their eating problems. These feelings may be about their weight, family problems, or problems with self-esteem. Some anorexic patients are helped by taking medicine that makes them feel less depressed.\nThe most important thing that family and friends can do to help a person who has anorexia is to love them. People who have anorexia feel safe, secure, and comfortable with their illness. Their biggest fear is gaining weight, and gaining weight is seen as loss of control. They may deny they have a problem. People who have anorexia will beg and lie to avoid eating and gaining weight, which is like giving up the illness. Family and friends should not give in to the pleading of the anorexic patient.\nIt\u2019s healthy to watch what you eat and to exercise. What isn\u2019t healthy is worrying all the time about your weight and what you eat. People who have eating disorders do harmful things to their bodies because of their obsession about their weight. If it isn\u2019t treated, anorexia can cause the following health problems:\nIf it isn\u2019t treated, bulimia can cause the following health problems:\nIf it isn\u2019t treated, binge eating can lead to multiple health conditions, including:\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness: Eating Disorders\nNational Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders\nNational Eating Disorders Association\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Eating Disorders\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration: Eating Disorders\nLast Updated:February 28, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

There are five known strains of the virus. Four of them affect people. One affects only nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) and pigs.\nEVD was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). In 2014, large outbreaks occurred in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11 people were treated in the U.S. during the 2014-2016 epidemic and one person died. EVD is still an ongoing situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with reoccurring outbreaks.\nSymptoms of EVD often begin 8 to 10 days after a person is infected with the virus. The virus cannot be spread to another person until symptoms appear.\nEarly symptoms can include:\nLater symptoms can include:\nEVD is caused by the Ebola virus. It\u2019s origin or how it started is unknown. Scientists believe that it is animal-borne and most likely comes from bats, which transmit the virus to other animals and humans. There is no proof that mosquitos or other insects can transmit the virus. Once infected, a person can spread the virus to other people.\nThe Ebola virus is not as contagious as common viruses, such as colds or the flu. It is not spread through air, water, or food. The virus is spread through direct contact with:\nDirect contact means that a person\u2019s eye, mouth, nose, or broken skin touches contaminated blood, fluids, or an object. Broken skin may be a cut, scratch, scrape, or open wound.\nFor most people, the risk of being infected with the Ebola virus is extremely low. The risk increases if you:\nTell your doctor about your symptoms and risk factors (for example, all recent travel). You must have symptoms of EVD and have had possible exposure to EVD to be diagnosed with it. Your doctor can do a blood test to confirm if you have been infected.\nIf you are diagnosed with EVD, you will be put in isolation right away to prevent the virus from spreading.\nCan Ebola virus disease be prevented or avoided?\nThe is a vaccine to help prevent EBD in people who are 18 years old and older. It is called ERVEBO and can help protect you from getting one type of Ebola virus. It will not protect you from all types of Ebola virus.\nEven if you get the vaccine, you should still try to not be exposed to Ebola virus.\nIt is rare for people in the United States or other developed countries to get infected. You can help lower your risk of infection by doing the following:\nPeople who work in health care settings should be extra cautious around those who are infected or at risk of being infected with the Ebola virus.\nCall your doctor right away if you are at increased risk of being infected and you have symptoms of EVD. Avoid contact with other people until you get medical care.\nCurrently, there is no medicine to treat EVD. Some experimental medicines are being tested.\nThe main goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms. Options may include:\nClose supervision and care by health care professionals is very important. A patient with EVD may need intensive care unit (ICU) services.\nLiving with Ebola virus disease\nOverall, EVD leads to death in about half of people who become infected. People who recover from EVD may still be contagious. The Ebola virus can remain in certain body fluids for some time. For example, men can spread the virus through their semen for up to 3 months after their symptoms first appear. They should not have sex, including oral sex, during this time. The virus also can remain in breast milk, amniotic fluid, eye fluid, and spinal column fluid.\nEbola survivors may have lasting side effects from the virus. These could include fatigue, muscle aches, stomach pain, and eye problems.\nResources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Ebola virus disease\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: History of Ebola virus disease\nWorld Health Organization: Ebola virus disease\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It occurs when you eat food or water that is contaminated with eggs of theEchinococcus. This is a microscopic tapeworm that is found in dogs, sheep, other livestock, and wild animals.\nThe tapeworm settles in your organs, such as your lungs, liver, or brain. It causes large cysts to form over time. There are two main forms of the infection: cystic echinococcosis (known as hydatid disease) and alveolar echinococcosis. Although infections in humans are rare, they can be serious.\nEchinococcosis may not produce symptoms for up to 10 or 20 years. This is because the cysts grow slowly. Symptoms can include:\nThe disease can be found all over the world. Primarily, it occurs in places where humans are in close contact with livestock or dogs. In the United States, echinococcosis mostly is found in the Southwest and Alaska.\nInfected animals, such as dogs or sheep, pass the disease to humans. We can get it directly by consuming food or drink contaminated with feces. Or we can get it indirectly by playing with or handling infected animals.\nFirst, the doctor will review your symptoms and do an exam. Second, they will perform tests to check for cysts. An X-ray often finds the cysts. The doctor also can do a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. If the doctor finds cysts, they may do a biopsy. This involves using a thin needle to puncture the cyst. Then, the doctor collects and tests fluid from the cyst to check for the echinococcosis infection.\nBe careful if you live in an area near livestock and/or you have contact with dogs. There are things you can do to help prevent echinococcosis.\nTreatment for echinococcosis varies. It depends on your symptoms and the location of cysts. Drugs that treat infections cause by worms are called anthelmintics.\nThe doctor can kill the tapeworm using injections. Once the tapeworm is gone, you may need to take medicine to keep it from coming back. Another form of treatment is injections to remove the cysts. Severe cases may require surgery to remove the cysts.\nIt is important to get treatment for echinococcosis once you start having symptoms.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nAn ectopic pregnancy happens when a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus.\nIn a normal pregnancy, a fertilized egg implants and grows in the uterus (also called the womb). In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg doesn\u2019t make it to the uterus. It implants somewhere else, most often in the fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. It can also occur in the ovary,\u00a0cervix,\u00a0or abdomen.\nAn ectopic pregnancy can be dangerous for the mother. As the pregnancy grows, it could cause the organ it is implanted in to rupture (burst). This can cause major internal bleeding. That\u2019s why it is important to find an ectopic pregnancy in its early stages.\nThe early signs of an ectopic pregnancy are like those of a normal pregnancy:\nThe first warning signs of ectopic pregnancy may include:\nIf you have any of these symptoms, you should call your doctor.\nAs an ectopic pregnancy grows, it may rupture. Then you may experience more serious symptoms. These could include:\nIf you experience these symptoms, get medical help right away.\nUsually, an ectopic pregnancy happens because the fertilized egg couldn\u2019t move down the fallopian tube quickly enough. An infection or inflammation in the tube can cause it to be partially or completely blocked. This is commonly caused bypelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nAnother common reason tubes get blocked is endometriosis. This is when cells from the lining of the uterus grow outside the uterus. The cells can grow inside the fallopian tube and cause blockages. Scar tissue from previous abdominal surgery or fallopian tube surgery can also block the tube.\nAny pregnancy can be an ectopic pregnancy. But you\u2019re more likely to have one if you:\nEctopic pregnancies can be hard to diagnose because the first symptoms are the same as those of a normal pregnancy. If your doctor thinks you may have an ectopic pregnancy, they may do the following:\nYou can\u2019t prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can try to control your risk factors. Don\u2019t smoke. If you do smoke, plan on quitting before you get pregnant. Before getting pregnant, use a condom when having sex. This can help prevent sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, which can cause PID.\nIf you\u2019re at higher risk of having an ectopic pregnancy, talk to your doctor. They may take extra steps to detect an ectopic pregnancy early. This could include checking your hormone levels or scheduling an early sonogram.\nIf a pregnancy is ectopic, the egg can\u2019t develop. The ectopic\u00a0tissue\u00a0must be removed. This can be done with medicine or surgery.\nIf an ectopic pregnancy is discovered early, your doctor can give you a shot of medicine called methotrexate. This medicine stops cells from growing and ends the pregnancy. Your body then absorbs the ectopic tissue.\nSome ectopic pregnancies require surgery. These include those that aren\u2019t discovered early enough, or that cause a pelvic organ to rupture. Surgery is usually done with laparoscopy. This procedure uses a tiny camera that is inserted into your body through small cuts in your abdomen. Special tools are used to remove the pregnancy. If your fallopian tube or another organ has burst, your doctor may remove that, as well.\nWhether you\u2019re treated with medicine or surgery, your doctor will want to see you regularly afterward. They will monitor your hCG levels to make sure they go back to normal. This can take several weeks.\nWhether you\u2019re treated with medicine or surgery, your recovery may take several weeks. You may feel tired and have abdominal pain or discomfort. You also might still feel pregnant for a while. It takes a while for the hCG levels in your body to drop. It will probably take a few cycles before your periods go back to normal.\nIf you\u2019ve had an ectopic pregnancy, you\u2019re more likely to have another one. You also may have trouble getting pregnant again. You should give yourself time to heal before you try to get pregnant after having an ectopic pregnancy.\nHaving an ectopic pregnancy can be emotionally hard. You may feel sad, angry, and confused. Talk about your feelings with your partner, a trusted family member, or friend. Allow yourself the chance to Find a family member or friend you can talk to about your feelings.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nEczema is a general term for rash-like skin conditions. The most common type of eczema is called atopic dermatitis. Eczema is often very itchy. When you scratch it, your skin becomes red and inflamed (puffy).\nEczema is most common in babies but also affects children and adults. Moderate to severe eczema in infants puts a baby at higher risk for developing a peanut allergy.\u00a0 As such, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guidelines say that introducing small amounts of peanut foods to children as early as 4 to 6 months may prevent the allergy. It\u2019s important to talk to your family doctor before introducing this food.\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition. It is caused by an allergic reaction. It is the most common type of eczema. \u201cAtopic\u201d describes an inherited tendency to develop\u00a0dermatitis,asthma,\u00a0and hay fever. \u201cDermatitis\u201d means that the skin is red and itchy. Atopic dermatitis usually starts during infancy and continues into childhood.\nThere are times when the condition gets worse (called flare-ups). Flare-ups are followed by times when the skin will heal. During these times, there may be no signs of atopic dermatitis (called\u00a0remission). Remission can last for weeks, months, or even years. Some children will outgrow atopic dermatitis. Others will still have it when they are adults. Flare-ups in adults tend to be less severe.\nAtopic dermatitis and\u00a0eczema\u00a0may start out as dry, extremely itchy skin. The\u00a0rash\u00a0may become very red, swollen, and sore. The more you scratch it, the worse it generally gets. A clear fluid may leak from the rash. Eventually, the rash will crust over and start to scale. Common places for the rash are in the elbow creases, behind the knees, on the cheeks, and on the buttocks.\nYou are more likely to have atopic dermatitis or eczema if a family member has it. These conditions aren\u2019t contagious. This means you can\u2019t catch them from other people. The exact cause of eczema and atopic dermatitis is unknown.\nYour doctor will be able to diagnose eczema simply by looking. As part of your exam, they will also review your medical history. It is important to tell your doctor if you have allergies or asthma. They may order blood and skin patch tests to rule out other conditions.\nYou may never know what causes your eczema or atopic dermatitis. Without knowing, you can\u2019t avoid them. They can\u2019t be cured, but they can be managed. You can also learn to avoid the things that trigger them.\nSome things that may irritate your skin include:\nTry to avoid contact with things that make you break out with eczema. Soaps and wetness can cause skin irritation. Wash your hands only when necessary. Use a mild unscented soap such as Dove, Basis, or Olay, especially if you have eczema on your hands. Dry your hands completely after you wash them.\nWear vinyl or plastic gloves for work that requires you to have your hands in water. Also, wear gloves when your hands are exposed to anything that can irritate your skin. Wear cotton gloves under plastic gloves to soak up sweat from your hands. Take occasional breaks and remove your gloves. This will prevent a buildup of sweat inside your gloves.\nWear gloves when you go outside during the winter. Cold air and low humidity can dry your skin. Dryness can make your eczema worse. Wear clothes made of cotton or a cotton blend. Wool and some synthetic fabrics can irritate your skin.\nBathe only with a mild unscented soap, such as Dove, Basis, or Olay. Use a small amount of soap. Keep the water temperature cool or warm, not hot. Soaking in the tub for a short time can be good for your skin. Doing so allows your skin\u2019s outer layer to absorb water and become less dry. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Then use a soft towel to pat your skin dry without rubbing. Immediately after drying, apply a moisturizer to your skin. This helps seal in the moisture.\nMoisturizers help keep your skin soft and flexible. They prevent skin cracks. A plain moisturizer is best. Avoid moisturizers with fragrances (perfume) and a lot of extra ingredients. A good, cheap moisturizer is plain petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline). Use moisturizers that are more greasy than creamy because creams usually have more preservatives in them.\nRegular use of a moisturizer can help prevent the dry skin that is common in winter.\nToo much heat and sweat can irritate your skin and cause it to itch. Try to avoid activities that make you hot and sweaty.\nYour doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream or ointment to apply to your rash. This will help reduce itching and calm\u00a0inflammation. Use it right after bathing. Follow your doctor\u2019s directions for using this medicine or check the label for proper use. Call your doctor if your skin does not get better with regular use of the medicine.\nAntihistamines like hydroxyzine reduce itching. They can help make it easier to not scratch.

Edema usually happens in the feet, ankles, and legs. It also can affect the face and hands. Pregnant women and older adults often get edema, but it can happen to anyone.\nIf you have swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet not related to an injury, it could be edema. It can cause puffiness of your face and hands, too. You can have swelling in all of these areas at once or in only one area. It can cause you to feel uncomfortable. It can even restrict the range of motion in your ankles and wrists.\nEdema is caused by extra fluid that builds up in the tissues of your body. Many things can cause fluid to build up, including:\nYou cannot catch edema from other people. It does not run in families. However, as you age, the veins in your legs often don\u2019t work as well against gravity and to push the fluid back up. That is why this condition is more common as you get older.\nYour doctor can tell whether you have edema by examining you. The skin over the swollen area may be stretched and shiny. Pushing gently on the swollen area for about 15 seconds will leave a dimple. If this happens, your doctor might want to do some additional tests.\nDepending on what is causing your edema, you may not be able to prevent it from happening. If it is caused by health problems, such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease, you will not be able to prevent it, only manage it. If your condition is caused by eating too much salt, you will be able to prevent it by eating less salt.\nAlso, regular exercise such as walking can help lessen edema because it works the calf muscles. These muscles help push fluid upward.\nThe only way to treat edema is to treat the condition that is causing it. Your doctor might want you to take a medicine called a diuretic. This is also called a water pill. These pills help flush salt and extra fluid out of your body through your urine.\nIt is important to see your doctor if you have edema, especially if you are pregnant. If it is not treated, your skin may keep stretching. This can lead to other health problems. If you have edema and you start to have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away.\nThe following are some things you can do at home to keep the swelling down:\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Edema\nLast Updated:July 6, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

There are four types of endometrial hyperplasia. These vary by the amount of abnormal cells and the presence of cell changes. The types are:\nThe primary symptom of endometrial hyperplasia is abnormal menstrual bleeding. Contact your doctor if you experience:\nEndometrial hyperplasia is caused by too much estrogen and/or not enough progesterone. Both hormones play a role in the menstrual cycle. Estrogen makes the cells grow, while progesterone signals the shedding of the cells. A hormonal imbalance can produce too many cells or abnormal cells.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can be a symptom for many things. Contact your doctor if you experience this. They can perform a physical exam and tests to diagnose the main condition. A transvaginal ultrasound measures your endometrium. It uses sound waves to see if the layer is average or too thick. A thick layer may indicate endometrial hyperplasia. Your doctor will take a biopsy of your endometrium cells to determine if cancer is present.\nYou cannot completely prevent endometrial hyperplasia.

Those with a family history are at higher risk.\u00a0 Retrograde (backwards) menstrual flow is another possible cause. This is when some of the tissue that is shed during your period flows up instead of out. It ends up in your fallopian tubes and other parts of your pelvis.\nOther factors include your body\u2019s response to estrogen and progesterone. If your body resists progesterone, it can have a hard time shedding the uterine lining. Some people have flawed immune systems. This means their bodies don\u2019t destroy all of the lining.

This is the surgical removal of your uterus, and sometimes ovaries.\nEndometriosis can make it harder to get pregnant. You may need surgery and/or fertility treatments to help. Talk to your doctor if you plan to become pregnant. Your doctor may advise you to not put it off. The condition can get worse with age, so your chances of getting pregnant lessen over time. Usually, symptoms go away while you\u2019re pregnant.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nEosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory, allergic disease. It is newly accepted and may be confused for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). EoE occurs when certain white blood cells (eosinophils) build up in your esophageal lining. Eosinophils help fight disease and control allergic reactions. Your esophagus is the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. It is part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\nPeople who have EoE may have symptoms such as:\nEoE is more common in male adults, but children can have it too. Symptoms for kids may include refusing food or having trouble gaining weight.\nToo many white blood cells can cause your esophagus to narrow. This can make food get stuck in your throat.\nThe exact cause for EoE is unknown. It is linked to food and environmental allergies.\nFirst, your doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. Then, they will order an endoscopy. This is a test in which a thin tube is inserted down your throat. A tiny camera takes pictures of your esophageal lining. The doctor will take a sample of this lining (biopsy) to diagnose EoE. Blood tests may be done to rule out other conditions.\nIf the doctor diagnoses EoE, they can do an allergy test to see what is causing the reaction.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid EoE. It may run in families.\nThere is no cure for EoE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent further damage. For children, treatment also helps improve growth.\nMedicine is one form of treatment. Steroids can reduce swelling and the number of eosinophils. Acid suppressors, such as proton pump inhibitors, can ease reflux-like symptoms.\nYou may need to make changes in your diet as well. Your doctor can make suggestions based on the results of your allergy test. You also can remove foods from your diet that commonly cause allergies. These include peanuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, wheat, and soy.\nPeople who have EoE may also have GERD and need additional treatment.\nEoE is not life threatening.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nEpilepsy is a disorder of the brain. People who have epilepsy have electrical activity in the brain that is not normal, causing seizures. There are different types of seizures. In some cases, a seizure may cause jerking, uncontrolled movements, and loss of consciousness. In other cases, seizures cause only a period of confusion, a staring spell, or muscle spasms. Epilepsy is also called a \u201cseizure disorder.\u201d\nEpilepsy is not a mental illness, and it is not a sign of low intelligence. It is also not contagious. Seizures do not normally cause brain damage. Between seizures, a person with epilepsy is no different from anyone else.\nThe primary symptom of epilepsy is seizures. A single seizure is not considered epilepsy. People who have epilepsy have repeated episodes of seizures.\nThere are many different types of seizures, and they each cause different symptoms. Some common types of seizures include the following:\nBefore a seizure begins, some people experience dizziness or emotional changes. They also may experience changes in vision (such as hallucinations), smell (smelling an odor that isn\u2019t there), and touch (such as numbness or tingling). Feeling these things before a seizure is called an aura. Recognizing an aura is useful as a warning that you are about to have a seizure.\nCall your doctor if:\nDoctors don\u2019t always know what causes epilepsy. Some things that may increase your risk for epilepsy include the following:\nTo diagnose epilepsy, your doctor will review your medical history and perform a neurological exam. Your doctor may also recommend blood tests. They may also order an electroencephalogram (EEG), computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests allow your doctor to monitor your brain activity and examine your brain for problems such as bleeding or tumors.\nDoctors don\u2019t always know what causes epilepsy. It seems to run in families. In that case, you may not be able to prevent it. But it also could be caused by a head trauma. If so, you might prevent epilepsy if you could prevent injuring your head.\nEpilepsy usually is treated with medicine. If medicine doesn\u2019t help your seizures, your doctor may recommend surgery or other therapies. If your doctor knows what is causing your epilepsy, treating the cause may make the seizures stop.\nMedicines that help prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptics. Your doctor will recommend a medicine based on the type of seizures you have, how often you have seizures, your age, and your general health. After you begin taking the medicine, your doctor will monitor you closely to determine whether the drug is working. They will also be watching for side effects, and to make sure your dose is correct.\nSide effects may include fatigue, dizziness, skin rash, or problems with your memory, coordination, or speech. Call your doctor right away if you experience depression, suicidal thoughts, or severe rash while taking your medicine.\nTo help your medicine work well, follow your doctor\u2019s instructions for taking it. Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor. Ask your doctor what to do if you miss a dose. Never take extra medicine, even if you think you\u2019re about to have a seizure. Talk to your doctor before you start taking any new medicines, including vitamins or supplements.\nYou should avoid drinking alcohol if you have epilepsy. Alcohol can make it easier to have a seizure and can also affect the way your epilepsy medicine works in your body. Some medicines can also make it easier to have a seizure, so check with your doctor before starting to take any new medicines.\nIt may be possible for some people who have epilepsy to eventually stop taking medicine. However, this decision must be made by your doctor. Before you and your doctor can decide to stop the medicine, several questions should be considered. These include how quickly your seizures were controlled, how long you have been free of seizures, and if you have other illnesses that may affect your problem.\nSurgery is most commonly performed if it\u2019s known that your seizures begin in a well-defined area of your brain that doesn\u2019t interfere with important functions like speech, language, or hearing. In other cases of medicine-resistant seizures, your doctor may recommend a type of therapy called vagus nerve stimulation. This requires a small device be implanted under the skin on your chest. The device delivers electrical pulses to the vagus nerve in the neck. A kind of treatment for children with certain types of epilepsy that are difficult to control involves a strict diet that is high in fat and low in carbohydrates. This diet is known as a ketogenic diet. This diet should be prescribed and monitored by a physician. With all treatments, work with your doctor to determine the best treatment for you.\nIf you have epilepsy, you may want to share the following information with your family, friends, and coworkers. If someone near you has a seizure, use the following general guidelines:\nNever knowing when or where a seizure may occur can make you anxious. This anxiety can lead to depression. It could even trigger more seizures. To help combat this, talk to your doctor. They may prescribe medicine to help reduce anxiety or recommend therapy or a support group. You may need help finding a way to cope with your fear of having a seizure.\nEpilepsy can also increase your risk of injury or other problems.

The condition prevents the man from having sex or finishing sex. This condition used to be called impotence. ED can occur at any age, but it is more common in men older than 75 years of age.\nED doesn\u2019t have to be a part of getting older. As a man ages, he may need more stimulation (stroking and touching) to get an erection. He might also need more time between erections.

This can reduce anxiety about having erections.\nCertain feelings can lead to erectile dysfunction, including:\nED is usually easy to diagnose. If you are tempted to self-diagnose, talk to your doctor. They will want to make sure it isn\u2019t related to another health condition.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your symptoms. They may do a blood or urine test. Your doctor may consider other tests to rule out other conditions.\nThis depends on whether you know what it is causing your ED. There are some things you can do that may help prevent ED, including:\nTreatment depends on what is causing it. If it is caused by uncontrolled blood sugar and high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your doctor\u2019s instructions.\nIf your doctor rules out other causes, he or she may prescribe Sildenafil (brand name: Viagra), tadalafil (brand name Cialis), and vardenafil (brand name Levitra). These medicines are taken by mouth to help you maintain an erection.\nNot everyone can use these medicines. Your doctor may talk to you about alprostadil if oral medicines aren\u2019t an option for you. Alprostadil is a synthetic version of prostaglandin E. It can be injected into the penis or inserted as a tiny suppository into the urethra (the hole at the end of the penis). Your doctor will help you decide which treatment is best for you.\nFollow your doctor\u2019s instructions when taking ED medicine. Usually, a man takes 1 tablet 30 minutes to 1 hour before he plans to have sex. Sildenafil works for 4-8 hours; vardenafil works for up to 8 hours; and tadalafil works for up to 36 hours.\nYou should not take more than 1 dose in 24 hours. Tadalafil and vardenafil come in tablets of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg. Sildenafil comes in tablets of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg.\nEven if you take the medicine, you still need physical and mental stimulation and desire to have an erection. If your first dose doesn\u2019t help, call your doctor. Your doctor may want to change your tablet strength.\nThe side effects of ED medicine are mostly the same. Sildenafil and vardenafil can cause:\nTadalafil has the same side effects, except for the flushing and possible changes in vision. It can also cause back pain and muscle aches. For each of the medicines, headache is the most common side effect. Vision changes are the least common. Talk to your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you.\nCall your doctor right away if you take one of these medications and have a prolonged erection that lasts 4 hours or longer.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nAn esophageal atresia (EA) and a tracheoesophageal fistula\u00a0(TEF) are 2 disorders of the digestive system. The condition affects babies. It starts while the mother is pregnant. This makes it a congenital defect. The 2 disorders often happen together.\nAn EA is when the esophagus doesn\u2019t connect to the stomach. TEF is when the esophagus and windpipe (trachea) have an incorrect connection. The poor connection is called a fistula. There are several types of EA. An EA sends the baby\u2019s nutrients to a pouch. So, nothing the baby swallows enters the stomach. With a TEF, food or milk can get into your baby\u2019s lungs when they swallow. This can cause breathing problems and even\u00a0pneumonia.\nAbout 1 of 4,000 babies has one or both of these problems. Sometimes a baby is born with one and not the other.\nBabies with this condition can breathe saliva and other fluids into their lungs. This can cause pneumonia, choking, and even death. Being born prematurely may make the condition worse.\nThe main problems EA causes are with the digestive system. TEF usually causes breathing problems. Symptoms of EA/TEF include:\nMost babies with EA develop symptoms right after birth. For babies who have TEF but not EA, symptoms are mild and could take weeks to diagnose.\nDoctors are not sure exactly what causes these problems. While pregnant, your child\u2019s esophagus and trachea start to grow from the same bit of\u00a0tissue. Sometimes the tubes don\u2019t develop correctly. Doctors don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherited. In some cases, an EA/TEF have a heart defect.\nAn ultrasound during pregnancy is the first clue. If there is too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby), the baby may have a blockage in his or her digestive system. The blockage could be an EA.\nIf your doctor suspects EA after the baby is born, they can insert a feeding tube through your baby\u2019s mouth or nose. The tube normally goes down to the stomach. If it can\u2019t reach the stomach, your doctor will probably diagnose your baby with EA. An X-ray can detect air in the esophagus, stomach, and intestine. It can help confirm the diagnosis. An X-ray can also help confirm TEF.\nThere is nothing a woman who is pregnant can do to prevent her baby from developing EA/TEF before birth. The best thing she can do is to take good care of herself while pregnant. This includes:\nEA/TEF is an emergency situation. Your baby will need surgery to fix the problem. If your baby has EA, the swallowing tube must be connected to the stomach. If a fistula is connecting the esophagus and windpipe, it must be closed. Your child\u2019s doctor will decide when to do the surgery. Healthy, full-term babies can have the surgery at just a few days old. If the baby has any other problems (such as pneumonia or other birth defects), surgery may have to wait.\nIn uncomplicated cases, your baby may start eating as soon as one week after surgery. Until your baby can swallow milk or formula, they will be fed through an IV or a stomach tube. Your baby will stay in the hospital during this time. Recovery time could be longer if your baby was born premature or the operation was complicated.\nInfants with EA/TEF often have another problem called tracheomalacia. This is a weakness and floppiness to the walls of the windpipe. It can cause their breathing to be noisy or sound high-pitched.\nSome babies who have esophageal atresia also have other problems. These include:\nYour doctor will do a physical exam of your baby. They may order more X-rays or ultrasound tests. These usually show if your baby has other problems. Babies with other problems might have to get those fixed first. Then they can have the surgery to fix the swallowing tube.\nBabies born with esophageal atresia sometimes have long-term problems, including:\nNational Institutes of Health, Genetics Home Reference: Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Esophageal atresia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia repair\nLast Updated:May 13, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It causes shaking movements that you can\u2019t control, most often in your hands. You might notice this tremor when your arms are reaching out in front of your body. It is caused by problems in communication between certain areas of the brain. A tremor affects people in different ways. Some people hardly notice it. Other people may be embarrassed by it. A tremor can sometimes interfere with activities such as eating, drinking, or writing.\nEssential tremor is just one kind of tremor. Other things that can cause a tremor include:\nThere is no cure for essential tremor, but it can be treated.\nMany diseases or conditions cause tremors. Symptoms that could indicate your tremor is essential tremor include:\nOften, tremors are the only symptom you have when you have essential tremor. Other conditions that cause tremors come with other symptoms.\nIt is not clear why some people get essential tremor. It seems to run in families. You may be more likely to have essential tremor if a parent or other close family member has tremor. Tremor can start at any age, but it often begins after age 40. It can get worse as you get older.\nYes, many things can cause tremor. Not all tremors are essential tremors. For example,Parkinson\u2019s diseasecauses tremor that you might notice when your hands are resting in your lap or at the sides of your body. Astrokecan cause tremor that gets worse when you reach for something. Thyroid problems or low blood sugar can cause mild tremor. Tremor can be caused by some medicines. These include heart medicines, decongestants, medicines for breathing problems, and tricyclic antidepressants. Drinks that contain caffeine also may cause a tremor.\nYour doctor will probably perform an exam and tests to look for possible causes of your tremor. These tests rule out other causes and can include a neurological exam, blood and urine tests, and physical performance tests. If they don\u2019t find another cause of your tremor, you may be diagnosed with essential tremor. There is no specific test for essential tremor.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes essential tremor, so it can\u2019t be prevented. If your doctor determines your tremor is caused by medicine or caffeine, you may be able to avoid essential tremor in the future by avoiding those substances.\nThe goal in treating essential tremor is to provide symptom relief that can improve quality of life. Mild tremors may not need treatment. If your essential tremor interferes with your ability to function or bothers you, there are some treatments that could help. These include medicine, focused ultrasound, or deep brain stimulation.\nLifestyle changes are often recommended to prevent the tremor from getting worse. Your doctor will ask you to avoid caffeine, cold medicines, and certain other medicines if they seem to make your tremor worse. These medicines won\u2019t make your tremor go away. However, the medicine may control the tremor enough to allow you to do normal activities without frustration or embarrassment.\nSymptoms do tend to get worse over time.

This makes it hard to breathe. If you have EIB, it may be hard to exercise for more than 30 minutes at a time.\nEIB also is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It is the same thing as exercise-inducedasthma.\nSymptoms of EIB start after about 5 to 20 minutes of non-stop exercise. The length of time depends on how severe your condition is. Symptoms can include:\nEIB is caused by activity that triggers an asthma reaction. For some people, certain types of exercise trigger symptoms. For others, breathing in air that is cooler and drier than the air in your lungs causes EIB. If you have EIB and chronic asthma, your symptoms may be worse in the spring and fall. This is when people have more trouble with allergies.\nIt can also be triggered by airborne irritants related to some sports, including chlorine when swimming and pollution while running.\nContact your doctor if you have symptoms of EIB. The doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They likely will perform breathing tests as well. During the tests, the doctor has you breathe into a spirometer or peak flow meter.

The exact cause of this condition is unknown.\nIf you notice hives and other symptoms, stop exercising right away. Contact your doctor if the hives do not go away 5 to 10 minutes after exercise. The doctor will look at your symptoms and review your health history. They may order a skin-prick test to check for allergies. Or they may do exercise tests to see if the reaction occurs again.\nYou cannot avoid exercise-induced urticaria. However, you can help prevent flare-ups. Avoid food, products, or types of exercise that trigger hives and other symptoms. Work with your doctor to identify these.\nMedicines, such as antihistamines, can prevent and treat some symptoms. In severe cases, symptoms may be life threatening, but this is rare. If you\u2019ve ever had severe symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called\u00a0epinephrine.

They occur in young children with a fever above 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C). Febrile seizures can occur in children ages 6 months to 5 years but are most common in toddlers ages 12 months to 18 months.\nFebrile seizures are frightening, but they aren\u2019t as dangerous as they may appear. Febrile seizures aren\u2019t harmful to a child. A febrile\u00a0seizure\u00a0doesn\u2019t cause brain damage. Also, your child can\u2019t swallow their tongue\u00a0during a seizure (it is physically impossible for someone to swallow their tongue).\nFebrile seizures usually last a few minutes. It\u2019s very rare for a febrile seizure to last more than 5 minutes. Usually, a child who has had a febrile seizure does not need to be hospitalized. They probably don\u2019t need X-rays or a brain wave test. Your child may only need to be seen by your family doctor so the cause of the\u00a0fever\u00a0can be found and treated, if needed.\nIf your child is younger than 3 months old and has what looks like a febrile seizure, they should been seen immediately by their doctor or in the emergency room.\nIf your child has a febrile seizure, they may become unconscious and roll their eyes back. Your child\u2019s arms and legs may become stiff or shake and twitch. Your child may also vomit. After a seizure, your child may seem drowsy and confused.\nFebrile seizures are triggered by fever caused by an infection. Your child is more likely to spike a high fever from a viral infection than a bacterial infection. Examples of viral infections are the flu, common cold, and roseola.\nNo. A single seizure does not mean your child has epilepsy. Even repeated febrile seizures aren\u2019t considered epilepsy. Children outgrow the risk of having a seizure caused by fever. A child who has\u00a0epilepsy\u00a0usually has 2 or more seizures that aren\u2019t caused by fever.\nFebrile seizures don\u2019t cause epilepsy. But the chance of\u00a0epilepsy\u00a0developing in a child who has had several febrile seizures is slightly higher than if they did not have a febrile seizure. That chance is about 2% to 4%. There is no evidence that treating your child with medicine for febrile seizures will prevent epilepsy.\nYou should see your doctor as soon as possible after a febrile seizure. Your doctor will examine your child and ask you questions about the seizure. Your doctor also may order tests to determine what is causing your child\u2019s fever.\nThat is unknown. Many doctors believe the risk of side effects from seizure medicines are worse than another febrile seizure. Even the medicine may not prevent another seizure.\nWhat should I do if my child has a seizure?\nWhen the seizure has stopped, call your doctor. They may want to see your child to find the cause of the fever.\nIf your child has had a febrile seizure, you may worry that they will have another. Most children will not.

    "article_title": "What is fecal incontinence?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nFecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements. This leads to stool (feces) leaking from the rectum at unexpected times. It is more common in women and in the elderly of both sexes.\nMany people who have fecal incontinence are ashamed to talk about this problem with their doctor. They think that nothing can help them. However, many effective treatments for fecal incontinence are available.\nSymptoms of fecal incontinence\nFecal incontinence symptoms can be mild (streaks or stains of leaked stool in your underwear) to more severe (not being able to control bowel movements).\nBowel function is controlled by 3 things: anal sphincter pressure, rectal sensation, and rectal storage capacity. The anal sphincter is a muscle that contracts to prevent stool from leaving the rectum. This muscle is critical in maintaining continence. Rectal sensation tells a person that stool is in the rectum and that it is time to go to the bathroom. The rectum can stretch and hold stool for some time after a person becomes aware that the stool is there. This is the rectal storage capacity.\nA person also must be alert enough to notice the rectal sensation and do something about it. They must also be able to move to a toilet. If something is wrong with any of these factors, then fecal incontinence can occur.\nMuscle damage is involved in most cases of fecal incontinence. For some people, this damage occurs during childbirth. It\u2019s especially likely to happen in a difficult delivery that uses forceps or an episiotomy. An episiotomy is when a cut is made to enlarge the opening to the vagina before delivery. Muscle damage can also occur during rectal surgery, such as surgery for hemorrhoids. It may also occur in people who have inflammatory bowel disease or a perirectal abscess.\nPeople can often compensate for muscle weakness. Typically, incontinence develops later in life when muscles weaken and the supporting structures in the pelvis become loose.\nDamage to the nerves that control the anal muscle or regulate rectal sensation is also a common cause of fecal incontinence. Nerve injury can occur in the following situations:\nFecal incontinence may also be caused by a reduction in the elasticity of the rectum. This shortens the time between the sensation of the stool and the urgent need to have a bowel movement. Surgery or radiation injury can scar and stiffen the rectum. Inflammatory bowel disease can also make the rectum less elastic.\nBecause diarrhea is more difficult to control than formed stool, it is an added stress that can lead to fecal incontinence.\nHow is fecal incontinence diagnosed?\nAlong with a physical exam, your doctor may want to do other tests such as an anorectal manometry. This tests anal pressure, rectal elasticity, and rectal sensation. These tests can pinpoint the cause of your incontinence.\nCan fecal incontinence be prevented or avoided?\nEven though you may be able to reduce your risk of fecal incontinence, you may not always be able to prevent it. This is because anal muscles can be damaged by no fault of yours. These muscles will also naturally weaken over time, despite your best effort to keep them strong.\nFortunately, effective treatment for fecal incontinence is available, so it\u2019s important that you talk to your doctor about it. Attempts at self-treatment are usually unsuccessful.\nThe treatment of fecal incontinence varies and depends on the cause of your problem. Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments:\nLiving with fecal incontinence can be socially and emotionally challenging, no matter what your age. Do not let it isolate you. Do not be embarrassed to talk to your doctor if you have fecal incontinence. It is a very treatable condition. Your doctor can recommend the best treatment for you.\nIf a treatment plan doesn\u2019t completely solve your fecal incontinence, there are many products that can help you discreetly hide it. These include disposable undergarments as well as a patch that tucks between your cheeks for minor bowel leakage.\nResources\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Bowel Incontinence\nLast Updated:June 6, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The female athlete triad also may be due to an eating disorder, such as anorexia.\nGirls and women may be at risk for the female athlete triad if they:\nContact a doctor if you or someone you know may have the female athlete triad. The doctor will ask questions about your periods, eating habits, and exercise routine. They also will do a physical exam. Your doctor may ask you if you take certain medicines, such as diet pills, laxatives, or birth control pills.\nYour doctor may order blood tests to check vitamin D levels. They also may order a bone density study.\nThere are things you can do to prevent the female athlete triad, especially if you are at risk:\nThe female athlete triad is a disorder that should be taken seriously. Most cases require treatment. A doctor will talk to you about healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices. You may need to change your diet. A nutritionist can help create an eating plan that provides enough vitamins and nutrients. You also may need to change your exercise routine. Your doctor may recommend taking at least one day off each week from athletic training.\nIf your periods do not return to normal, you may need more treatment. Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help regulate your cycle. Hormone medicines that include estrogen or progesterone may help as well. These can balance your energy and improve bone strength.\nWomen who have the female athlete triad can develop other health problems. Amenorrhea is a condition that occurs when you miss a period for 3 months or more in a row. Osteoporosis is a disease that makes your bones thin and weak. It can occur when your body doesn\u2019t get the nutrients it needs to help bones grow. It can increase your risk of fractures, breaks, and other injuries.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of medical conditions that can occur in a person who was exposed to alcohol while in the womb. The problems can be physical, mental, or behavioral. They can range from mild to severe. They can start before the baby is born, or they may not be noticeable until childhood, adolescence or even adulthood. \u00a0Diagnosable conditions under the FASD umbrella include Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND), Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD), and Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE).\nNo. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can be dangerous to you and your baby. No amount or type of alcohol is safe during pregnancy. Babies born to people who drink during pregnancy may have serious lifelong health problems, including FASDs.\nFASD can cause a wide range of symptoms and often presents differently based on a multitude of factors.\u00a0FASD is generally considered a brain-based disorder.\u00a0 Effects may include physical, mental, behavioral, and/or learning disabilities with lifelong implications.\u00a0 Symptoms in childhood may change as the child grows older. One of the most serious problems FASD can cause is developmental delay. FASD is the leading cause of preventable developmental delays in the United States.\nThe specific cognitive and behavioral impairments associated with FASD vary widely from one person to another and may include:\nFASDs can occur when a developing baby is exposed to alcohol before birth. This can happen even prior to a person recognizing that they are pregnant. Even small amounts of alcohol will pass across the placenta and to the fetus. The baby\u2019s liver is not developed enough to be able to process the alcohol. The alcohol can damage the baby\u2019s organs or cause other harm. Because no amount of alcohol can be considered safe, pregnant people should avoid all alcohol during the entire pregnancy.\n\u201cBinge drinking\u201d (having 4 \u00a0or more drinks at a time) is especially dangerous for your baby. It makes the level of alcohol in your\u00a0blood (and the baby\u2019s blood) go\u00a0very high very quickly. Even if you don\u2019t drink every day, you may put your baby at risk for FASD if you drink alcohol.\nWhile drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy can be the most dangerous, alcohol exposure remains unsafe throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy. Alcohol can interfere with development and cause birth defects. Drinking at any time during pregnancy is not safe and can harm your baby.\n\u201cFASD\u201d is not a diagnostic term in the United States. However, a diagnosis can be made for a specified condition under the FASD umbrella.\u00a0 These conditions include: Fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, alcohol-related birth defects, and neurobehavioral disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.\nEarly diagnosis and early intervention significantly improve long-term outcomes for people with FASD. There is no simple diagnostic test for an FASD. Often, a multidisciplinary team is needed.\u00a0Your doctor may look for physical symptoms, such as a low birth weight and a small head. Doctors may look at behavioral symptoms, such as attention and coordination. Fetal alcohol syndrome is diagnosed based on physical features alone, while other diagnoses may involve confirmation of alcohol exposure. Your doctor may try to confirm prenatal alcohol exposure, and if so, how much. PAE can be confirmed through interviews or review of patient files.\nThere are a multitude of reasons why it can be difficult to receive a diagnosis for an FASD.\u00a0There is a lack of sufficient diagnostic capacity in most areas. Stigma is another barrier to diagnosis, as well as healthcare access. FASDs may have similar symptoms to other disorders and are often misdiagnosed.\nFASDs are preventable if you are able to abstain from alcohol use throughout pregnancy. The healthiest approach is to stop drinking when you are planning to get pregnant. If you get pregnant, quit drinking alcohol right away. Drink other beverages instead, such as water or milk. Celebrate special occasions with a fun, non-alcoholic \u201cmocktail.\u201d\u00a0 Partners can be supportive by abstaining from alcohol during the pregnancy as well.\nIf you are pregnant and you have been drinking alcohol, be honest with your doctor. Tell them how much you are drinking. They may be able to help you stop drinking before it causes harm to your pregnancy and the developing fetus.\nWhile there is no cure for FASD, there are many treatment options. While FASD presents lifelong challenges, there is help and hope for children and adults living with FASD. Treatment will vary greatly based on the specific diagnosis, the particular symptoms, and the environmental context.\u00a0 No one treatment is right for every child or adult.\u00a0 Early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes significantly. Physical treatments may include occupational therapy and medical and dental care.\u00a0 Behavioral symptoms can be treated with medicine and therapy. Developmental issues in childhood can be addressed through special education services.\u00a0 Parent/caregiver training and education is another potential treatment.\nThere are a number of evidence-based treatments developed for people with FASD.\u00a0 It is important that treatment providers be FASD-informed, and the parent/caregiver may be the one to inform and educate providers on FASD.\u00a0 Effective treatment can help to prevent some of the secondary disabilities associated with FASD, such as problems in school, trouble with the law, employment difficulties, and substance/alcohol abuse problems.\u00a0 Resources are available from FASD United by contacting a Family Navigator.\nPeople living with FASD can thrive and succeed with the right services and support.\u00a0 Often, people with FASD will need ongoing therapy or special services, depending on their symptoms. Early diagnosis is associated with the most positive outcomes and allows doctors to create specialized plans for a person\u2019s development and education.\nIn addition to early diagnosis, research shows that children with FASD do best if they:\nEveryone with FASD is unique, and people with FASD each have different particular challenges.\nFASD is associated with an increased risk of having a mental health disorder, including:\nFASD may lead to \u201csecondary conditions.\u201d A person is not born with a secondary condition but might develop one as a result of having an FASD. These may include:\nRemember that no amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy. Quit drinking if you are trying to get pregnant or if you think you\u2019re pregnant.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nFetal growth restriction (FGR), previously called intrauterine growth restriction, is a term that describes an unborn baby who isn\u2019t growing at the normal rate inside the uterus. These babies usually have a low weight at birth.\nSome babies are born smaller than normal. However, only about one-third of those babies were affected by growth restriction in pregnancy.\nSmall babies tend to run in families. The parents or other children in the family may have been small when they were born, too.\nBabies who have FGR are more likely to have certain health problems (both during pregnancy and after birth), including:\nThe most common cause of FGR is a problem before birth in the placenta (the tissue that carries oxygen, food, and blood to the baby). Birth defects and genetic disorders can also cause FGR.\nA baby also may develop FGR if the mother:\nSometimes a prescribed medicine the mother is taking causes FGR. Babies with genetic conditions such as Down syndrome are also more likely to have FGR.\nDuring your pregnancy, your doctor will do tests to find out if your baby is growing normally.\nThe main test for checking a baby\u2019s growth in the\u00a0uterus\u00a0is an ultrasound. The ultrasound exam lets your doctor see your baby in your uterus with an instrument that is moved across the outside of your abdomen.\nWhile you\u2019re having an ultrasound, your doctor will measure the size of your baby\u2019s head, abdomen, and legs. These measurements will tell him or her if your baby is growing normally. Your doctor will also be able to see the amount of amniotic fluid in your uterus. In some babies who have FGR, the amount of amniotic fluid is low. If your baby is small, you may need more frequent ultrasound exams to check your baby\u2019s health.\nAnother test to check inside your uterus is\u00a0fetal\u00a0monitoring. Monitoring devices are strapped over your uterus as you lie down for about 30 minutes. The devices record your baby\u2019s heartbeat. Your doctor can look at the recording and see if your baby\u2019s heartbeat is normal.\nYour doctor might also order an amniocentesis. During this test, a needle is put through your skin into your uterus. A few teaspoons of amniotic fluid are withdrawn into the needle. The fluid is tested to see if it shows the cause of the FGR. The amniotic fluid can detect infection and some chromosomal abnormalities that can cause genetic problems.\nIf you smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use drugs, stop now. These things can cause FGR.\nHaving FGR in one pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean it will happen the next time. If you do have another pregnancy affected by FGR, you may have an illness, such as hypertension. Good control of illnesses before and during pregnancy lowers the risk of FGR.\nThe best way to help your baby is to keep all your prenatal visits with your doctor. You should also monitor how often your baby moves and kicks. A baby who moves around often is usually healthy. A baby who doesn\u2019t move very often or who stops moving may be sick. If you notice your baby isn\u2019t moving as much, call your doctor right away.\nAnother way to help your baby is to take good care of your body. Eat healthy foods and make sure you eat the recommended number of calories for a pregnant woman. Try to get 8 hours of sleep (or more) each night. An hour or 2 of rest in the afternoon is also good for you. Rest will not only help you feel better, it may even help your baby grow.\nIf your baby has FGR, you may give birth early. The time of delivery depends on how well your baby is doing. Sometimes, babies with FGR appear to be small but healthy. If testing suggests that the pregnancy is not developing well, your doctor may decide that an early delivery could help. In this case, your doctor may want to induce labor. Your baby\u2019s heart rate and movements will be closely watched to help you and your doctor make this decision.\nIf there are no signs of problems with your baby during labor, a vaginal delivery is okay. If your baby has problems during labor, a cesarean section (also called a C-section) may be safer.\nA baby born with FGR usually needs to stay in the hospital longer after birth. This is especially true for babies born early. They need to breathe and feed normally before they can go home.\nBabies born with FGR often catch up in size and have a normal height and weight by about 2 years of age. In the meantime, they should be fed normally without attempting to catch up quicker.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Intrauterine Growth Restriction\nLast Updated:June 20, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is fever in infants and children?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nA fever is a sign that your body is sick or has an infection. A fever helps kill infections, bacteria and viruses that are causing the fever. Your child has a fever if his or her body temperature his higher than normal. A normal temperature is 98.6\u00b0F when checking by mouth. Some doctors ask you to check your baby or young child\u2019s temperature rectally (in their bottom). Normal for that method is 99.6\u00b0F.\nMost fevers are caused by infections (bacteria or virus). Other reasons for a fever include:\nMany doctors diagnose a fever as an oral temperature above 99.5\u00b0F. They diagnose fever as a rectal temperature above 100.4\u00b0F. But fever standards also depend on age, so what may be a fever in one person may not rate as a fever in someone else.\nTo take your child\u2019s temperature rectally, use a digital thermometer. Place your child on his or her stomach across your lap. Apply petroleum jelly (brand name: Vaseline) to the tip of the thermometer. Insert it half an inch into your child\u2019s bottom. Stop if you feel any resistance. Hold the thermometer still and do not let go. When the thermometer beeps, remove it and check the digital reading. Taking temperatures rectally is the preferred method for children.\nTo take your child\u2019s temperature orally, use a digital thermometer. Place the end of the thermometer under his or her tongue. Go towards the back of the mouth. Have your child close his or her lips around the thermometer. Tell your child not to bite down or talk. When the thermometer beeps, remove it and check the digital reading.\nNever use a mercury thermometer. Mercury is poison.\nOther temperature-taking tips include:\nFevers caused by illness or infection can be avoided by avoiding the things that cause illness and infection. Fevers caused by vaccinations can be avoided by giving your child acetaminophen. This is an over-the-counter medicine (brand name: Tylenol). This should be given just before or right after the vaccination.\nAcetaminophen can be given to reduce a fever. Ibuprofen (brand names Children\u2019s Advil, Children\u2019s Motrin) is another medicine that can be used to lower a fever in children older than 6 months of age. Ask your doctor for the correct dosage. This will vary by your child\u2019s age and weight. Don\u2019t give your child medicine if he or she is between 3 months and 3 years of age and has a temperature of 102\u00b0F or lower. If your child is achy and fussy, and his or her temperature is above 102\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), you may want to give him or her acetaminophen.\nIf your baby is younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4\u00b0F or higher, call the doctor or go to the emergency room. A fever can be a sign of a serious infection in young babies.\nNever give your child aspirin for any reason. Aspirin can cause Reye\u2019s syndrome. Reye\u2019s syndrome is a serious childhood illness that can lead to death. Do not give aspirin to children younger than 18 years of age.\nGiving your child acetaminophen and a warm bath may lower his or her fever. Give the acetaminophen before the bath. A bath without medicine will cause your child to shiver. This will raise his or her body temperature. Never use rubbing alcohol or cold water for baths.\nIt\u2019s important to make your child comfortable when he or she has a fever.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nFibromyalgia is a syndrome that causes muscle pain and general fatigue. People who have fibromyalgia often have a heightened sensitivity to pain or experiencechronic pain. This means it lasts a long time. Areas called \u201ctender points\u201d may be especially painful when pressure is put on them. Common tender points are the back of the head, the elbows, the shoulders, the knees, the hip joints, and around the neck.\nFibromyalgia is most common among people between 35 and 60 years of age. Women are more likely than men to have it.\nFibromyalgia is a condition that is often misunderstood. But your symptoms aren\u2019t imagined. Scientific research has shown that fibromyalgia is a real syndrome that causes real pain. Don\u2019t let anyone discourage you from getting a diagnosis and treatment for your symptoms.\nSymptoms of fibromyalgia can include the following:\nPeople who have fibromyalgia often also have one or more of the following:\nDepression or anxiety may occur as a result of your constant pain and fatigue, or the frustration you feel with the condition. It is also possible that the same chemical imbalances in the brain that cause mood changes also contribute to fibromyalgia.\nNo. Although fibromyalgia causes symptoms that can be very painful and uncomfortable, your muscles and organs are not being damaged. This condition is not life-threatening. However, it is ongoing. Although there is no cure, there are many things you can do to feel better.\nDoctors are not sure what causes fibromyalgia. This syndrome might be hereditary, which means it runs in families. You may have family members with similar symptoms.\nThere is a weak association between fibromyalgia and other life events, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include:\nYour doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. Be sure to tell them whether any members of your immediate family have ever had similar symptoms or have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Your doctor will also need to know what medicines, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.\nThey will ask about your symptoms and how long you have had them. It\u2019s very important to give your doctor a clear, detailed description of your symptoms. Before going to your appointment, write down a complete list of the problems you\u2019ve been having. Be sure to describe exactly what type of pain you have (for example, whether the pain is dull or sharp) and where you have been feeling pain. Tell your doctor whether your pain comes and goes, and what makes you feel better or worse.\nIf you have had any trouble sleeping or are fatigued, tell your doctor how long you have had this problem. Your doctor may ask whether you have been feeling anxious or depressed since your symptoms began.\nYour doctor will also perform a physical exam. This may include applying pressure to the tender points on your body. Your doctor may run blood tests to rule out any other conditions with symptoms similar to fibromyalgia. Your doctor will also want to be sure that there isn\u2019t anything else causing your pain.\nUnfortunately, it can take years for some people who have fibromyalgia to get a correct diagnosis. This can happen for many reasons. The main symptoms of fibromyalgia are pain and fatigue. These are also common symptoms of many other health problems, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.\nCurrently, there is no laboratory test or X-ray that can diagnose the condition.\nIt may take some time for your doctor to understand all of your symptoms and rule out other health problems so he or she can make an accurate diagnosis. As part of this process, your family doctor may consult with a rheumatologist. This type of doctor specializes in pain in the joints and soft tissue.\nYou cannot prevent fibromyalgia because no one is sure what causes it.\nFibromyalgia is a chronic condition. This means that it affects you over a long period of time\u2014possibly your entire life. There will be times when your fibromyalgia may \u201cflare up\u201d and your symptoms will be worse. Other times, you will feel much better. The good news is that your symptoms can be managed.\nIt\u2019s important to have a health care team that understands fibromyalgia and has experience treating it. Your team will probably include your family doctor, a rheumatologist, and a physical therapist. Other health care professionals may help you manage other symptoms, such as mood or sleep problems. However, the most important member of your health care team is you. The more active you are in your care, the better you will feel.\nSeveral medicines can help reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Many of these medicines are taken before bedtime and help reduce pain and improve sleep.\nYour doctor may recommend an anti-depressant, such as duloxetine or milnacipran. Anti-seizure medicines, such as preglabin or gabapentin, may also be effective in managing your pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (which include ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen) are not usually effective in treating fibromyalgia when taken alone.\nThere isn\u2019t currently a cure for fibromyalgia. Your care will focus on helping you minimize the impact of the condition on your life and treating your symptoms. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help with your pain, but there are other things you will need to do to ease your symptoms. This is called \u201cself-management.\u201d\nSelf-management means that you take responsibility for doing what it takes to manage fibromyalgia effectively. It\u2019s important for you to be responsible for your health. The treatment recommendations your doctor makes won\u2019t do any good unless you follow them. They can\u2019t make decisions for you or make you change your behavior. Only you can do these things.\nIn self-management, you and your health care team are partners in care. Your health care team can provide valuable advice and information to help you deal with fibromyalgia. However, there isn\u2019t one treatment plan that works best for every person who has fibromyalgia. You\u2019ll have to work with your care team to create a plan that\u2019s right for you and the quality of life you desire. After all, nobody knows more than you do about your feelings, your actions, and how your symptoms affect you.\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Fibromyalgia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Fibromyalgia\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Once you\u2019ve had it, you are unlikely to be at risk of getting it again.\nThe first signs of fifth disease are mild flu- or cold-like symptoms, including:\nAfter a few days of these symptoms, your child may develop a bright red, raised rash on their face. The rash may then spread to the arms, legs, and trunk of the body. After 5 to 10 days, the rash usually fades. It fades from the center outward, making it look blotchy. It could show up again when your child gets hot or is out in the sun. This could go on for several weeks or months after the illness.\nAdults who catch the virus usually don\u2019t develop the rash. Instead, they\u2019re more likely to experience joint pain or swelling. This usually happens in the hands, wrists, knees, and ankles. It can last several months, but usually gets better after 1 to 2 weeks. Some adults who get fifth disease don\u2019t experience any symptoms.\nSymptoms usually show up 4 to 14 days after exposure. The rash may not appear for as long as 3 weeks. Once your child has the rash, they are not contagious anymore.\nFifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This isn\u2019t the same parvovirus that can infect dogs and cats. It\u2019s spread when you or your child comes into contact with saliva or mucus carrying the virus. It can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or sharing items. It can also be spread through blood. A pregnant woman who has this disease could pass it to her baby.\nYour doctor can usually tell if your child has this disease by seeing the \u201cslapped cheek\u201d rash. A blood test can be used, but it\u2019s not usually needed.\nThere is no vaccine for fifth disease. You can prevent your child from getting it by helping them practice good hygiene habits. These include:\nMost cases of fifth disease are mild. It usually goes away without treatment. You can treat fever and flu symptoms in your child with acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol).\nAdults who have joint pain or swelling may need to rest and restrict activity.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nFlat feet is a common condition in which one or both feet don\u2019t have normal arches. At first, all babies\u2019 feet look flat because an arch hasn\u2019t formed yet. Arches should form by the time a child is 2 or 3 years of age. Flat feet, even in older children, usually do not cause any problems.\nYou may be born with flat feet or develop them over time. Adults may not realize they have flat feet for many years. They may not ever notice if they don\u2019t have symptoms related to flat feet.\nIf your child complains of foot or ankle pain, take them to the doctor. Flat feet in an older child may cause pain in the heel or arch. This condition also may cause pain when your child is walking and running.\nSymptoms in adults of flat feet include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing. Feet may also ache following activity, like playing sports or exercising. Flat feet can also cause pain in your lower back, hips, and knees.\nIn children, most flat feet are caused by loose\u00a0joint\u00a0connections and baby\u00a0fat\u00a0between the foot bones. These conditions make the arch fall when your child stands up. This is why you sometimes hear flat feet called \u201cfallen arches.\u201d The feet may look like they have arches when your child is sitting or when the big toe is bent backward. But the arch flattens when your child puts weight on the foot.\nRarely, flat feet can be caused by foot bones that are joined together.\nIn adults, a number of things can cause flat feet. Adult-acquired causes for flat feet include:\nYour doctor will look at your child\u2019s feet to make sure that the pain isn\u2019t caused by a problem in the\u00a0hip\u00a0or the\u00a0knee. Your child may need to have X-rays. Most often, your doctor probably can tell you what the problem is just by looking at your child\u2019s feet.\nIf you have adult-acquired flat feet, your doctor should be able to\u00a0diagnose\u00a0it by examining your feet. They may ask you to stand and will observe your feet from various angles. Your doctor also may ask you to stand on your toes. Your doctor may also order tests, such as X-ray, MRI, or CT scan to diagnose your flat feet.\nAdult flat feet can sometimes be prevented through good foot care. Taking care of your feet and avoiding injury are important. You may be at higher risk for developing flat feet if you havediabetesor are pregnant. You are also more likely to develop flat feet if you are overweight.\nFor many people, flat feet don\u2019t cause pain or related problems so there is usually no need to treat them. If flat feet are painful, there are several treatment options. Some of these include:\nYour doctor can help you decide which treatment is best.\nYour child\u2019s foot development will be the same whether arch supports are worn or not. High-top or special orthopedic shoes, \u201ccookies,\u201d or wedges are only useful to keep the shoe on your child\u2019s foot. If your child has foot pain because of flat feet, a heel cup, shoe insert, or shoes with support may help.\nPeople with flat feet don\u2019t need to limit activities. If flat feet become painful from overuse, your doctor may recommend you rest them. Wearing a certain style of shoe, walking barefoot, running, doing foot exercises, or jumping will not make flat feet better or worse.\nIf you or your child has pain from flat feet, some over-the-counter medicines may help, including ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve).\nFlat feet are common. If flat feet cause you pain, talk to your doctor. Most of the time, this pain can be managed with rest. Supportive footwear can also help.\nNational Institute of Health, MedlinePlus: Flat Feet\nLast Updated:March 16, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nFlatulence is another name for gas. You\u2019ve experienced it. In fact, it\u2019s normal for people pass gas several times a day.\nGas happens when air accumulates in your stomach or intestines. It often happens after eating a meal. The accumulated air needs to get out of your body. Sometimes it leaves through your mouth; that\u2019s a burp. When it leaves your body through your anus, that\u2019s gas. Also, when gas leaves through your anus, it contains sulfur. That\u2019s why gas is sometimes stinky.\nThe most common symptom of gas isbloating. That\u2019s an uncomfortable, swollen feeling in your abdomen. It is caused by the air that\u2019s still in your intestines. Another symptom of gas is actually passing gas. Once you pass gas, the bloating feeling should go away.\nDifferent people get gas for different reasons. But there are several main causes for gas.\nToo much air.When you eat, you swallow a small amount of air. This air travels to your stomach and intestines during the digestion process. If it stays in your intestines, it can cause gas. There are certain times you swallow more air than usual. They include when you:\nWhat you eat.You can also get gas because of what you eat. Sometimes, your stomach and small intestine don\u2019t break down all the foods you eat, especially the fibers, sugars, and starches. These pass from your stomach and small intestine into your large intestine. There, bacteria that live in your large intestine break them down. This process creates gas. Some foods are known to cause gas. They include:\nMedical conditions.You may be more likely to have gas if you have certain medical conditions. Some of them include:\nAdditionally, some antibiotic medicines can cause gas.\nYour doctor will talk with you about your symptoms, medical history, and what you\u2019ve eaten recently. He or she will likely do a physical exam of your abdomen and note if you\u2019re bloated. Your doctor also may listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope.\nIf you have repeated pain from gas, your doctor may ask you to keep afood diary. To do this, you can use any paper or notebook to keep track of all the foods you eat. You\u2019ll also need to note when you have gas. Then when you go back to the doctor, take your food diary with you. The information you\u2019ve recorded will help you and your doctor figure out what foods are causing your gas.\nIn some instances, your doctor may order other tests to see if you have a medical condition that\u2019s causing your gas.\nEverybody has gas from time to time. However, if you have gas on a regular basis, there are some things you can do to prevent it, such as avoiding certain foods and eating slowly.\nIf you have gas, you may want to take an over-the-counter medicine to help you feel better. Some medicines need to be taken before you eat, while others can be taken afterward. Talk with your doctor about which medicines are best for you. If your gas is more serious or related to a medical condition, your doctor may prescribe a prescription medicine for you to take.\nWhile having gas can be uncomfortable, it usually goes away on its own and isn\u2019t a big cause for concern.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nA food allergy is an abnormal reaction by your immune system to a food. The immune system is the part of your body that fights infection. The reaction can be mild or serious. Food intolerance is different than a food allergy. Food intolerance is an unpleasant symptom triggered by food (bloating, gas, stomach cramps). However, it doesn\u2019t involve your immune system.\nSymptoms of a food allergy are usually immediate. The most common symptoms of food allergy include:\nThe person may also feel something bad is going to happen. They may have pale skin (because of low blood pressure) or lose consciousness. They may also have chronic illnesses.Eczema(skin disorder) andasthma(respiratory disorder) are the most common.\nA food allergy can be deadly if it\u2019s severe enough to cause a reaction calledanaphylaxis. This reaction blocks your airway and makes it hard to breathe.\nAlthough people can be allergic to any kind of food, most food allergies are caused by tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish. These 8 foods account for 90 percent of food allergies. Most people who have food allergies are allergic to fewer than four foods.\nAdditionally, studies have found that some food additives, such as yellow food dye and aspartame (artificial sweetener), cause problems in some people. Sugar and fats aren\u2019t associated with food allergies.\nIf you\u2019ve had an abnormal reaction to a food, see your doctor. They will examine your symptoms and ask about your health history. Your doctor may put you on an elimination diet. This is when you don\u2019t eat any suspicious foods for a while then gradually add them back one at a time. Your doctor also may perform skin and blood tests, though these are not as reliable as the elimination diet.\nMany children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. People rarely outgrow allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish.\nRecent studies have found that some food allergies \u2013 such as peanut allergies \u2013 can be prevented if they are treated at an early age. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommends that infants with severe eczema, egg allergy or both be introduced to foods containing peanuts as early as 4 months of age to reduce the risk of a peanut allergy. Talk to your doctor before introducing foods containing peanuts at this early age.\nOnce a food allergy is diagnosed, avoid the food that cause it. If you have an allergy, you must read the labels on all prepared foods you eat. Your doctor can help you learn how to avoid eating the wrong foods. If your child has food allergies, give his or her school and other care providers instructions of what foods to avoid. Tell them what to do if the food is accidentally eaten.\nWhile there is no cure for a food allergy, there are new therapies that increase tolerance to food items so that if you accidentally eat something you are allergic to your body might not have an extreme reaction.\nIf you have a mild reaction (itching, sneezing, hives, or rash), your doctor will give you antihistamines and oral or topical steroid medicine. A severe reaction of anaphylaxis is treated with a medicine called epinephrine. This medicine must be given quickly to save your life. If you or your child has a severe allergy, your doctor may give you a prescription for an epinephrine pen to carry at all times. Your doctor or pharmacists can show you how and when to use the pen. A person having a serious allergic reaction should be taken by ambulance to a hospital emergency room.\nLiving with food allergies can cause fear and anxiety when you\u2019re eating at a restaurant or someone else\u2019s home. You will always wonder if your problem food is combined with the rest of the meal. Also, if you have food allergies to most of the 8 common foods, you can feel frustrated by the restrictions in your life.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Food Allergies\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Food Allergy\nBaby\u2019s First: You Can Reduce the Risk of Food Allergies for Your Baby\nPrevent Peanut Allergies: Introducing Peanut Foods to Your Baby Early\nLast Updated:January 25, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nFood poisoning(also known as food-borne illness) occurs when you eat or drink something that contains harmful germs (bacteria, viruses, or parasites). Bacteria produce a toxin in food. It\u2019s this toxin that causes the problem.\nSymptoms of can begin hours or days after consuming contaminated food or drink. The timing depends in part on the cause of the food poisoning. It can also depend on the amount of food or drink you consumed. Symptoms may include:\nFood poisoning may affect just one person or a whole group of people who are exposed to the contaminated food or drink. It depends on how much of the germ or toxin each person consumed. It also depends on how sensitive they are to the germ or toxin.\nThere are two types of food poisoning you can get from eating fish: ciguatera poisoning and scombroid poisoning.\nCiguatera poisoning symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms can progress to headache, muscle aches, and itchy, tingly, or numbness of the skin. One early sign can be numbness of the lips, tongue, or area around the mouth. You may have a metallic taste or feel like your teeth are loose. You may notice a change in your ability to feel hot or cold temperatures. For example, you may think something feels hot when it is actually cold.\nScombroid poisoning symptoms develop 20 to 30 minutes after you eat the affected fish. They include flushing (turning red) of the face, nausea, vomiting, hives, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are similar to other allergic reactions. Getting scombroid poisoning does not mean you are allergic to fish.\nVibrio vulnificus infection is a bacterial infection to warm, seawater fish. It\u2019s found in shellfish (especially oysters), other seafood, or the ocean. You can get it by eating contaminated fish. You can also get it from contact with a fish or the ocean (through an open cut). It is not common and not contagious. The symptoms are similar to those of general food poisoning: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. More serious symptoms include a high fever, chills, low blood pressure, redness, swelling, and blisters on your skin. If the bacteria enters an open cut, it can become a more serious infection. Once that happens, it can spread through your bloodstream and become life-threatening. Blood and stool tests lead to a diagnosis. Your doctor also may look at the blisters on your skin.\nYou can reduce your risk of exposure by not eating undercooked shellfish and other seafood. Wash kitchen utensils in hot, soapy water. Wear gloves when handling the fish if you have an open cut. Avoid ocean water until your cut or wound has healed.\nAntibiotics are often used to treat the infection. In severe cases, you may need surgery or amputation where a cut or wound was infected with the bacteria.\nMany foods can cause food poisoning. Foods that should be kept cool but often are not are some of the primary causes. That is why food poisoning is more common at picnics and buffets. There, food (such as the mayonnaise in potato salad) is often left out of the refrigerator for a long time.\nOther common sources of food poisoning include:\nMost cases of food poisoning are caused by food contaminated by bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli. Food can also be contaminated by a virus, such as the norovirus.\nMany cases of food poisoning never get an official diagnosis. This is because most people recover within a few days at home. If you have severe symptoms of food poisoning, your doctor will diagnose you. They may order a blood test to determine if the food poisoning is caused by bacteria. Or, they may collect a stool sample to find out what germ is causing the food poisoning.\nI advise my pregnant patients to prevent Listeria infection by avoiding high-risk foods and following basic food safety guidelines.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Karlynn Sievers\nThe best way to prevent food poisoning is to always know what you are eating. The best way to always know what you are eating is to eat at home. You can better control food storage and preparation at home. When dining out, be cautious of buffets.\nYou can take a few simple steps to avoid food poisoning:\nTo avoid ciguatera poisoning, don\u2019t eat the fish that commonly carry the poison. This includes amberjack, grouper, snapper, sturgeon, king mackerel, barracuda, and moray eel. The poison is more concentrated in a fish\u2019s internal organs, so you should never eat those parts of a fish.\nTo avoid scombroid poisoning, don\u2019t eat any fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Be especially careful when you eat fish such as tuna, sardines, mackerel, mahi-mahi, or anchovies.\nMost cases of food poisoning are mild and clear up in a few days. During that time, the goal is to prevent dehydration. Dehydration is the loss of fluids and electrolytes (nutrients and minerals) your body needs. You should avoid solid foods and dairy products until the vomiting and diarrhea have passed. Once you are feeling better, ease into eating and drinking again. Try bland foods, such as crackers, toast, and bananas. Avoid spicy foods, fried foods, dairy, and foods that are high in fat and sugar. Drink plenty of fluids but avoid milk or caffeinated beverages. Also, sports drinks (brand name: Gatorade, others) are not meant to be used to treat diarrhea. They do not replace the body\u2019s electrolytes (salts and minerals) correctly to prevent dehydration.\nMake an appointment with your doctor if:\nSeek emergency care if you:\nCiguatera poisoning is treated with medicines that help ease your symptoms. There is no medicine that will cure ciguatera poisoning. The symptoms will go away on their own over time. Scombroid poisoning is treated using an antihistamine (one brand: Benadryl). An antihistamine is a medicine that blocks the histamine in your blood.\nThe symptoms of ciguatera poisoning can last for 1 to 2 weeks. Exactly how long they last will depend on the amount of poison you have in your body. Symptoms of scombroid poisoning usually last for 24 hours or less, but symptoms can come back any time you eat fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Ciguatera and scombroid poisoning are rarely fatal.\nSymptoms of dehydration include:\nTo treat mild dehydration, try taking frequent sips of water. Clear soups, clear sodas, and juice mixed with water can also help. Avoid coffee, tea, dark sodas, and other caffeinated drinks. These drinks can make dehydration worse. Give children who have mild dehydration water and/or an oral rehydration solution (ORS). An ORS contains the right mix of salt, sugar, potassium, and other nutrients to help replace lost body fluids. You can buy an ORS at most grocery stores and drugstores. If your dehydration is severe, you may need to be treated in the hospital. There, doctors will give you intravenous (through an IV) fluids and electrolytes.\nIt can be. Dehydration can be dangerous, and so can certain types of food poisoning. Food poisoning caused by the Listeria bacteria can be very dangerous for the unborn babies of pregnant women. The infection is usually very mild for the mother, but can cause miscarriage, premature labor, stillbirth, and developmental problems in their babies. People who have weakened immune systems are also at risk of developing complications from Listeria. Food poisoning caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can cause kidney failure, especially in people who have weakened immune systems.\nFood poisoning comes and goes, however, one person may be more likely to get it than another.\nChildren and the elderly are most likely to get food poisoning.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nPeople are poisoned each year after eating mushrooms from their yard or outside locations. These mushrooms should not be eaten. It\u2019s difficult to tell which mushrooms can be eaten and which cannot. Poisonous mushrooms can make you sick. Some are actually deadly.\nCommon symptoms include:\nMore serious symptoms include:\nSymptoms can appear right after eating the poisonous mushroom. Or they could appear several hours later. Symptoms that occur within 2 hours are less dangerous than those that appear later (after 6 hours).\nEating poisonous mushrooms causes mushroom poisoning.\nMushroom poisoning is difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will examine you. They will ask you about your symptoms and when and what you ate recently. The diagnosis is based on the information you provide. If you are able to get a sample of the mushroom you know was eaten, bring it with you to the doctor or emergency department.\nYou can avoid mushroom poisoning by not eating mushrooms picked from the ground. It\u2019s difficult to tell which mushrooms are poisonous and which are not. They can be growing next to each other. There are no tests to tell a poisonous mushroom from a nonpoisonous mushroom. Assume all wild mushrooms are poisonous. It\u2019s best to buy them from the store.\nMushrooms that grow in the ground are more dangerous than mushrooms that grow on living trees. Additionally, mushrooms growing in lawns have likely been exposed to pesticides and other lawn-care chemicals. Mushrooms on the ground in forests are more dangerous than mushrooms in yards. Cooking poisonous mushrooms will not remove the toxins.\nIf you suspect that you or someone you are with has mushroom poisoning, call your doctor. Or call the Poison Control Center. Call 911 if the person is unconscious, not breathing, or having convulsions. The phone number for the Poison Control Center is 1-800-222-1222. This number is answered 24 hours. It\u2019s a good idea to keep this number in your phone contacts. Take the person to the emergency room. If possible, bring a few of the mushrooms the person ate with you to the doctor or the emergency room.\nIf the person has thrown up, the worst is probably over. Doctors may give the person activated charcoal to cause vomiting. The doctor will check the person\u2019s temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. They will be watched closely for severe symptoms and complications. The person will be sent home if they have no symptoms of severe poisoning, and if the mushroom is proven harmless. Your doctor will ask you to watch the person for any symptoms of mushroom poisoning for the next 24 hours.\nOf special note: Decades ago, people were encouraged to keep ipecac syrup in their homes to induce vomiting in case of poisoning. However, current research shows that ipecac syrup is unsafe to use and is not effective. It can no longer be purchased. Bottom line: Do not use it if someone has it and gives it to you.\nShort-term effects of living with mushroom poisoning are unpleasant. These are things related to vomiting and diarrhea.

    "article_title": "What is Fragile X syndrome?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nFragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder. It is most often passed on from a parent to a child at the time the child is conceived. The disorder causesintellectual and developmentaldisabilities. This means it affects a person\u2019s learning and physical growth. It also affects behavior and being able to relate to other people. The symptoms of Fragile X syndrome can be mild or moderate. It affects both girls and boys; however, it is often milder in girls.\nThere are many symptoms that go along with Fragile X syndrome. These include:\nA person diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome may have certain physical features, as well. These include:\nMen who have Fragile X syndrome may have larger-than-normal testicles after puberty. Women may experience infertility and enter menopause earlier than normal. Both men and women with Fragile X syndrome can have tremors (shaking) and difficulty with coordination. Some people will experience seizures.\nFragile X syndrome is caused by a problem with one of your genes. The normal gene makes a protein that is needed for brain development. But when there is a problem with that gene, it has trouble making the protein. This causes the symptoms that come with the disorder.\nMost of the time, children inherit the gene from their parents. That is how Fragile X syndrome is passed on. However, it is possible to have Fragile X even if a child\u2019s parents don\u2019t have the Fragile X gene.\nSome parents notice the developmental delays in their child and see their doctor. This leads to testing. A simple blood test can detect the Fragile X gene in your child any time after he or she is born. That confirms the diagnosis. Most children are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 4.\nIf you suspect or know either parent has the Fragile X gene, prenatal testing can determine if the baby has the gene before it is born. This could include amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Prenatal testing can help families prepare for a baby with Fragile X syndrome so they can start treatment as early as possible. But most parents don\u2019t know they carry the gene, so prenatal testing is uncommon.\nSince Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder, it cannot be prevented or avoided.\nThere is no cure for Fragile X syndrome. Certain therapies can help with the symptoms of the disorder. This includes physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Special education services can help with academic and learning challenges. They also can help with behavior. A young child\u2019s brain is still growing.

It\u2019s not related to milk production in breastfeeding. The breasts may leak only when touched, or on their own. It can occur in women or in men but is less common in men. Rarely, it can occur in newborns.\nGalactorrhea is not a disease but can be a symptom of an underlying health problem.\nThe main symptom of galactorrhea is a milky white discharge from one or both nipples. Sometimes, the discharge is yellow or greenish in color. Blood in the discharge is not a symptom. If you have blood in the breast discharge, you should contact your doctor.\nOther related symptoms may include:\nThere are many possible causes of galactorrhea. Someone who has it most likely has an underlying condition. Possible causes include:\nIn some cases, the cause of galactorrhea is unknown.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They will ask about your health history and lifestyle, and what medicines you take. Your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. For women, your doctor may order a pregnancy test. If the doctor suspects a tumor, they can order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This test scans your head to see if you have a tumor or defect of the pituitary gland. Your doctor can order a mammogram and/or ultrasound to check for cancer.\nYou can\u2019t prevent galactorrhea. However, once you know the cause, you may be able to avoid it.\nTreatment depends on the cause of galactorrhea. Benign tumors can be treated with medicine or surgery. Medicine can help if your body is producing too much of a hormone, such as prolactin. It also helps treat problems, such as hypothyroidism. If a certain medicine causes galactorrhea, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine.\nIn many cases, no treatment is necessary. Over time, the condition may go away on its own.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nGallstones are hard deposits that can form inside the gallbladder. The gallbladder\u00a0is a small, pear-shaped organ\u00a0just under your liver. It stores bile, the digestive fluid that is made by the liver. Sometimes the bile becomes solid and forms stones. Some are as small as a grain of sand. Others can be the size of a golf ball.\nMost people who have gallstones never experience symptoms. These are called silent gallstones. Sometimes, a gallstone can leave your gallbladder and go into a bile duct. Sometimes a gallstone gets stuck in that passageway and blocks it completely. If this happens, you may experience severe pain in the right upper part of your belly or in your upper back.\nThis is known as a gallbladder attack. The pain usually starts suddenly and lasts for several hours. Complete or partial blockage can also cause your gallbladder to get irritated and inflamed.\nIf this happens, you may:\nIn addition, your skin may turn a yellowish color, known as jaundice.\nGallbladder attacks tend to happen after heavy meals. They\u2019re more likely to happen in the evening or during the night. They stop when the gallstones move and are no longer lodged in the duct. If the duct remains blocked for more than a few hours, complications can occur. Call your doctor right away if you\u2019re experiencing a gall bladder attack that lasts more than several hours.\nMost gallstones are made of cholesterol. Normally, acids in the bile break down cholesterol. But a high-fat diet can lead the liver to produce extra cholesterol that the acids can\u2019t break down. This leads the excess cholesterol to solidify.\nOther gallstones are made of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment in bile that is produced when red blood cells break down. These stones are formed when there is too much bilirubin in the bile.\nGallstones may also form if the gallbladder doesn\u2019t empty itself completely.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get gallstones if you:\nGallstones can be hard to diagnose because they share symptoms with other conditions. Your doctor will do a physical exam to look for signs of gallstones. This will include looking for yellowing of the skin and tenderness in the abdomen. They may order blood tests. They may also order imaging tests. These could include an ultrasound or CT scan, which will make pictures of your gallbladder and bile ducts. If your doctor thinks you have a gallstone stuck in a bile duct, they could try to remove the stone.\nEating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding rapid weight loss can reduce your risk of gallstones. A healthy diet should include good sources of fiber like raw fruits and vegetables or beans and whole-grain foods. Avoid eating too much saturated fat.\nYour treatment depends on the severity of your symptoms and what the doctor finds from the tests.\nAre there other treatments?\nOther treatments are available for people who would have a high risk in surgery. This could be because they are elderly, or have\u00a0heart\u00a0problems or lung disease. However, gallstones usually return when they aren\u2019t treated with surgery. Other options include:\nSurgery is the best way to cure symptomatic gallstones. Talk with your doctor about what is right for you.\nIf your gallstones aren\u2019t causing symptoms, you may live the rest of your life without any problems. If you do experience symptoms, your doctor may want to remove your gallbladder. You don\u2019t need your gallbladder to live. So when it\u2019s removed, you won\u2019t notice much difference. You may have diarrhea at first. If you have diarrhea that lasts more than 3 months after surgery, talk to your doctor.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nGastroparesis is a disorder involving your stomach muscles. It is sometimes called delayed gastric emptying. Normally, after you swallow food, your stomach muscles begin squeezing and tightening. These movements are called contractions. This crushes the food and moves it into the small intestine to continue the digestive process. If you have gastroparesis, your stomach muscles don\u2019t contract properly. This can delay or prevent the process of crushing the food and sending it to the small intestine.\nSymptoms of gastroparesis can be mild or severe, and may include:\nThese symptoms are related to a lot of different problems and disorders. This makes gastroparesis hard to diagnose.\nPeople who havediabetesare most at risk for gastroparesis. That\u2019s because high blood sugar levels damage your nerves. In this case, it\u2019s your vagus nerve. The vagus nerve tells your stomach muscles when to contract. Damage to this nerve is one of the most common causes of gastroparesis. Diabetes also can damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the vagus nerve. Other things that cause gastroparesis include:\nYour doctor will examine you and ask about your medical history. Tell your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter medicines you are taking. Your doctor may order blood tests to check the quality of your blood and measure chemical levels. They might want to do additional tests to make sure you don\u2019t have a blockage or another medical problem. These tests may include:\nChange your eating habits. Changing your eating habits can help control gastroparesis.\u00a0 However, make sure you get the proper nutrition and liquids.\nYour doctor may recommend that you:\nIf your symptoms are moderate to severe, your doctor may recommend drinking only liquids. He or she may recommend eating well-cooked foods that have been chopped into small bites or processed in a blender.\nControlling blood glucose levels.If you have gastroparesis and diabetes, you will need to control your blood glucose levels. This includes hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar levels, can delay the emptying of food from your stomach. Your doctor will work with you to keep your blood glucose levels stable.\nYour doctor will give you instructions for taking insulin based on your needs and the severity of your gastroparesis.\nThere is no cure for gastroparesis. Treatment will focus on treating any underlying problem that is causing it and controlling your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to stop taking any drugs that can affect the digestive system. Don\u2019t stop any medicine without first talking to your doctor. Your doctor also may want to treat any eating disorders, infections or other issues that could be causing gastroparesis. Your doctor might also recommend one or more of the following:\nDietary changes.Since you might not be able to eat normally, it\u2019s important to get enough nutrients. You may need to:\nMedicine.Anti-nausea medicines called antiemetics can help with nausea and vomiting. Other medicines, such as metoclopramide and erythromycin, can stimulate stomach muscle contractions. Each of these drugs has some drawbacks, including potentially serious side effects. You and your doctor need to discuss whether the benefits of taking these medicines outweigh the risks.\nFeeding tube.If your gastroparesis is severe, you may need a feeding tube. This tube will be inserted through your skin into your small intestine. Or it may be passed into your intestines through your nose or mouth. The tube allows nutrients to be delivered directly to your small intestine where digestion and absorption of nutrients can occur. A feeding tube can also help when gastroparesis causes unstable blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes.\nGastroparesis can result in complications, including:\nAmerican Family Physician: Gastrointestinal Complications of Diabetes\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Gastroparesis\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Gastroparesis\nLast Updated:September 22, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Normal feelings of anxiety often serve as an \u201calarm system\u201d that alerts you to danger. Your heart may beat fast. Your palms may get sweaty. Anxiety can provide an extra spark to help you get out of danger. It also can give you the energy to get things done in normal, busy situations.

There are many kinds of HPV. Not all of them cause genital warts. HPV is associated withcancerof the\u00a0vulva,\u00a0anus, and penis. However, it\u2019s important to note that HPV\u00a0infection\u00a0doesn\u2019t always lead to\u00a0cancer, and that genital warts are not cancer.\nThe symptoms of genital warts are the actual warts themselves. In men, genital warts can grow on the penis, near the anus, or between the penis and the\u00a0scrotum. In women, genital warts may grow on the vulva and perineal area, in the\u00a0vagina,\u00a0and on the\u00a0cervix\u00a0(the opening to the\u00a0uterus\u00a0or womb). Genital warts vary in size and may even be so small that you can\u2019t see them.\nHPV causes genital warts. HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The most common way to get HPV is by having oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who is infected with HPV.\nJust because you can\u2019t see warts on your partner doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have HPV. The infection can have a long incubation period. This means that months can pass between the time a person is infected with the\u00a0virus\u00a0and the time a person notices genital warts. Sometimes, the warts can take years to develop. In women, the warts may be where you can\u2019t see them, such as inside the body on the surface of the cervix.\nIf you notice warts in your genital area, see your doctor. Your doctor may be able to\u00a0diagnose\u00a0the warts just by examining you. For women, a Pap test can help detect changes on the cervix that are caused by genital warts.\nThe only sure way to prevent genital warts is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, having sex only with a partner who isn\u2019t infected with HPV and who only has sex with you will lower your risk of getting genital warts.\nUsing a\u00a0condom\u00a0may help prevent you from getting HPV, but condoms are not 100% effective. They do not cover all the affected skin.\nThere are two types of HPV vaccine. Both types help protect against the HPV strains that are most likely to causecervical cancer. One type also helps protect against the HPV strains that are most likely to cause genital warts.\nRoutine HPV\u00a0vaccination\u00a0is recommended for the following groups of people:\nIn certain circumstances, your doctor may recommend you receive the vaccination up to age 45.\nThe vaccines are given as shots (injections in the upper arm) and require 2-3 doses, depending on your age. The vaccine is most effective if children receive it before they start having sex.\nGenital warts must be treated by your doctor. Do not try to treat the warts yourself.\nThe warts can be removed, but the viral infection itself can\u2019t be cured. The virus lives inside your skin. This is why the warts often return after they have been removed. You may need to have them removed more than once.\nOne way to remove the warts is to freeze them. This is called cryotherapy. The warts can also be taken off with a laser.\nA treatment called the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) can be used to remove the warts. With this method of removal, a sharp instrument shaped like a loop is passed underneath the wart and the wart is cut out of the skin.\nSpecial chemicals can be used to remove the warts. These chemicals dissolve warts in the genital area. You may need to apply them to the area a number of times over a period of several weeks before the treatment is complete.\nChemicals you can buy at the store to remove warts from your hands should not be used for genital warts. They can make your genital skin very sore.\nIf you have genital warts, talk to your doctor. It is important they treat your warts. Genital warts can grow if you do not get them treated. If you are sexually active, you also risk infecting your partner.\nCertain kinds of HPV can cause abnormal cells to grow on the cervix. Sometimes, these cells can become cancerous if left untreated.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nGestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that starts during pregnancy. If you have diabetes, your body can\u2019t use the sugar (glucose) in your blood as well as it should. This causes the level of sugar in your blood to become higher than normal.\nGestational diabetes affects 1% to 3% of all pregnant women. It usually develops in the second trimester (sometimes as early as the 20th week of pregnancy). Most often, gestational diabetes goes away after the baby is born.\nHigh blood sugar levels can be unhealthy for both you and your baby. If the diabetes isn\u2019t treated, your baby may be more likely to have problems at birth. For example, your baby may have a low blood sugar level or jaundice. Or your baby may weigh much more than normal.\nGestational diabetes can also affect your health. For instance, if your baby is very large, you may have a more difficult delivery. You may even need a cesarean section. Gestational diabetes also increases your risk of developingpreeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that can be serious if left untreated.\nMany times, there are no noticeable symptoms for women who have gestational diabetes. This could be because some of the common symptoms of diabetes are also symptoms of pregnancy. These include:\nOther symptoms can include:\nPregnant women sometimes develop gestational diabetes because of pregnancy hormones. These hormones interfere with insulin. They can make your body more resistant to insulin. When this happens, insulin cannot regulate the sugar (glucose) in your blood. This makes your sugar levels increase.\nAs part of your prenatal care, your doctor will recommend screening for gestational diabetes around 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. This could happen sooner if there is reason to believe you are at risk for developing gestational diabetes. If you have elevated glucose levels in your urine or other risks, your doctor may recommend having the screening sooner.\nDuring the glucose test, you\u2019ll drink a syrupy-sweet bottle of glucose solution. One hour after drinking that, a lab technician will take a sample of your blood. He or she will measure the amount of sugar in your blood.\nIf your blood sugar is too high, your doctor will likely prescribe another glucose test. For this test, you will need to fast (not eat for 8-14 hours before the test). A lab technician will test your blood sugar while you are fasting. Then, you will again drink the glucose solution. The lab technician will test your blood once an hour for 3 hours.\nGestational diabetes cannot always be prevented or avoided. According to the National Institutes of Health, you may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you:\nThere are things you can do to reduce your chances for developing gestational diabetes:\nIf you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, lifestyle changes can help you control it. You will need to follow a diet suggested by your doctor, exercise regularly, and have frequent blood tests to check your blood sugar level.\nDoing these things may not be enough to keep your blood sugar at a normal level. You may also need to take a medicine to help. There are several oral medications that can help control diabetes. Your doctor may prescribe one of these. Or you may need to take insulin injections to lower your blood sugar.\nYour doctor may ask you to see a specialist if you have to start taking insulin.\nWhat changes should I make in my diet?\nYour doctor may ask you to change some of the foods you eat and see a registered dietitian to help you plan your meals. It\u2019s important to eat well-balanced meals. You may need to eat less at each meal, depending on how much weight you gain during your pregnancy. Your doctor or dietitian will talk to you about this.\nAvoid eating foods that contain a lot of simple sugar, such as cake, cookies, candy, or ice cream. Instead, eat foods that contain natural sugars, such as fruits. But cut down on drinking fruit juices, which have a high concentration of sugar. Also, avoid drinking soda or other sugary drinks.\nIf you get hungry between meals, eat foods that are healthy for you, such as raisins, carrot sticks, or a piece of fruit. Whole-grain pasta, whole-grain breads, and rice are also good for both you and your baby.\nWhy is exercise important?\nYour doctor will suggest that you exercise regularly at a level that is safe for you and the baby. Exercise will help keep your blood sugar level normal. It can also make you feel better. Walking is usually the easiest type of exercise when you are pregnant. But swimming or other exercises you enjoy are also beneficial during this time. Ask your doctor to recommend some activities that would be safe for you.\nIf you\u2019re not used to exercising, begin by exercising for 5 or 10 minutes every day. As you get stronger, you can increase your exercise time to 30 minutes or more per session. The longer you exercise and the more often you exercise, the more in control you will be of your blood sugar.\nYou do need to be careful about how you exercise. Don\u2019t exercise too hard or get too hot while exercising. Ask your doctor what activities are safe for you. Depending on your age, your pulse shouldn\u2019t go higher than 140 to 160 beats per minute during exercise. If you become dizzy or have pain while exercising, stop exercising immediately and call your doctor. If you have uterine contractions (labor pains), vaginal bleeding, or your water breaks, call your doctor right away.\nWhat happens after my baby is born?\nYou may not need to have blood tests to check your blood sugar while you\u2019re in the hospital after your baby is born. However, it may be several weeks after your baby\u2019s birth before your gestational diabetes goes away. To make sure it has gone away, your doctor will ask you to have a special blood test 1 or 2 months after you have your baby.\nGestational diabetes increases your risk for diabetes in your next pregnancy and later in life. It is important that you continue to exercise, watch your weight, and eat a healthy diet after pregnancy. If you do these things, you may avoid diabetes when you\u2019re older.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Gestational Diabetes\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Gestational Diabetes\nLast Updated:September 22, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Arteritis is a condition in which the arteries become inflamed (swollen). This reduces blood flow. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) causes certain arteries to become inflamed, red, hot, or painful. It usually affects the arteries above and in front of the ears on both sides of the head (the temples). This type of GCA is also sometimes called temporal arteritis or cranial arteritis.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition involving inflammation of the muscles in your neck, shoulders, hips, and thighs. This causes stiffness and aching in these areas. It usually develops over time. But for some people, it can start as quickly as overnight. With treatment, PMR usually goes away within a year. It can last for several years in some cases. Both disorders mainly affect people over 50, particularly women.\nAbout half of people who have GCA also have PMR. They can have these diseases at the same time, or GCA can develop after PMR.\nThe symptoms of GCA include:\nThe symptoms of PMR include:\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes the\u00a0inflammation\u00a0associated with GCA or PMR. Aging and problems with the\u00a0immune\u00a0system are possible factors. It also could be related to your genes, or to an environmental trigger like an infection.\nYou are more likely to develop GCA and PMR if you are older than 50 years of age. The conditions are most common in women between 70 and 80 years of age. For unknown reasons, Caucasian people are more likely to develop GCA and PMR than people of other races.\nTo diagnose GCA, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine the arteries in your temple. He or she will check if they are swollen or tender. They may order\u00a0blood\u00a0tests to check for inflammation of the arteries and to rule out other conditions. Often, a\u00a0biopsy\u00a0of the temporal\u00a0artery\u00a0is needed to confirm the diagnosis. This is an outpatient procedure that involves removing a sample of your temporal artery from your scalp area.\nTo diagnose PMR, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. He or she may order a blood test. This can help detect inflammation of your arteries and check your blood count. Your doctor could also order a muscle biopsy (removing a small sample of muscle) to check for PMR.\nYour doctor also can order a c-reactive protein test. This blood test measures\u00a0the amount of inflammation in your bloodstream but doesn\u2019t identify where the inflammation is located.\nThere is no known way to prevent GCA or PMR because doctors aren\u2019t sure what causes them.\nYour doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid medicine to treat inflammation and pain. This can help with symptoms of GCA and PMR. These medicines are taken by mouth (in pill form). Once you start taking a corticosteroid, you should feel better quickly. You may need to take this medicine for 6 months up to 2 years.\nEating a healthy\u00a0diet\u00a0and getting enough exercise can help relieve the symptoms of both GCA and PMR.\nTaking a corticosteroid for a long time can raise your\u00a0blood pressure. It can also increase your blood sugar levels or weaken your bones. Your doctor will need to keep checking you for these side effects during your treatment. Corticosteroids can cause other side effects. These include jitteriness, poor sleep, and weight gain. These symptoms usually get better as you take smaller doses of the medicine.\nGetting early treatment for GCA is important. If inflamed arteries aren\u2019t treated right away, they could be permanently damaged. This increases your risk of blindness or stroke. But with proper treatment, GCA and PMR may come back. About half of the time, though, a person who has PMR will experience at least 1 relapse.\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease: Giant Cell Arteritis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Giant Cell Arteritis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Polymyalgia Rheumatica\nLast Updated:June 16, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nGiardiasis is an infection you can get in your small intestine. It is caused by a microscopic parasite called Giardia lamblia. Once you have been infected with the parasite, it lives in your intestines. It is passed along through feces (poop). Anything that comes in contact with feces from an infected person or animal can become contaminated. Giardiasis is one of the main causes of diarrhea in the United States. It can be found all around the world.\nDiarrhea is the main symptom of giardiasis. Other symptoms include:\nSymptoms usually appear 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to the parasite. Although these problems can be very unpleasant, the illness isn\u2019t usually dangerous.\nThe Giardia parasite lives all over the world in soil, food, and water. It also can live on surfaces that have come into contact with human or animal waste. You could be infected if:\nSome people who get giardiasis don\u2019t become ill. But they can still spread the parasite to other people. Giardiasis may be easily spread in daycare centers or nursing homes. It is important that workers wash their hands each time after changing diapers or helping someone go to the bathroom.\nTo diagnose giardiasis, your doctor will want to you to provide stool (poop) samples to the lab. The lab will look at the samples under a microscope. Several samples may have to be checked before the diagnosis can be made. Sometimes other tests may be necessary.\nGiardiasis can be prevented in many cases. The best ways to avoid it are:\nIf one person in your family gets giardiasis, it\u2019s likely that everyone in your home will get it, especially children. Hand washing is very important to help prevent the illness from spreading.\nIf your symptoms are mild, you generally won\u2019t need treatment for giardiasis. Mild infections can go away on their own in a few weeks. If symptoms are severe or aren\u2019t going away, medicine can be used. Infected people who work at a daycare or nursing home may also be treated with medicine. This can help prevent the illness from spreading.\nThere are many medicines that can be used to treat giardiasis. One of the most common is called metronidazole. It\u2019s usually taken 3 times a day for 5 to 10 days. Side effects may include a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, and a severe reaction to alcohol. It is safest for pregnant women to avoid this treatment. Children younger than 5 years of age may be treated with furazolidone. This medicine has fewer side effects and comes in a liquid form.\nGiardiasis spreads very easily. It\u2019s usually best if a whole family is treated at the same time. In most cases, your doctor will want to check a stool sample after the treatment to be sure the medicine worked. Sometimes you may need to take medicine for a longer time. Or your doctor may want you to take another medicine for a complete cure.\nIt is important to treat for dehydration when you have giardiasis. Pregnant women and infants are more likely to get dehydrated when they have diarrhea. Dehydration can be fatal for infants. Talk to your doctor about treatment options if your baby has giardiasis.\nCall your doctor if you have diarrhea, bloating, and nausea for more than a week. Giardiasis is unpleasant, but it\u2019s not usually dangerous. Once you begin the medicine, you can recover in about a week. If it\u2019s left untreated, symptoms can last 6 weeks or more.\nAs with any illness, complications can occur.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nGlaucoma is an eye disease that may cause loss of vision. It usually happens when fluid builds up in the eye, causing an increase in pressure. This damages the eye\u2019s optic nerve.\nAt first, glaucoma has no symptoms. It causes no pain and your vision is normal. Eventually, without treatment, you will start losing your peripheral (side) vision. You might miss seeing objects out of the corner of your eye. Over time, it will seem like you\u2019re looking through a tunnel. If your glaucoma is left untreated, your vision may gradually decrease until it is completely gone.\nMany people who have glaucoma aren\u2019t aware they have the disease. By the time they notice loss of vision, the eye damage is severe.\nRarely, an individual will have an acute (sudden or short-term) attack of glaucoma. In these cases, the eye becomes red and extremely painful. Nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision may also occur. This is an eye emergency. Call your eye doctor right away if you experience these symptoms.\nNormally, fluid in your eye nourishes the eye and keeps it healthy. After the fluid circulates through the eye, it empties through a drain in the front of your eye. In people who have glaucoma, the fluid doesn\u2019t drain properly. Instead, it builds up and causes increased pressure in the eye and damages the optic nerve.\nGlaucoma is usually diagnosed by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. These are people specially trained to provide care for eyes. They will give you a complete eye exam, including tests that can diagnose glaucoma. The tests include:\nSome people are at a higher risk of developing glaucoma. They include people who:\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do to avoid getting glaucoma. But you can prevent it from having a big impact on your vision. The best way to do this is by getting an eye exam regularly by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. People 18 to 60 years of age should have an eye exam every 2 years. After age 60, you should have an eye exam once a year.\nIf you have diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease, follow your doctor\u2019s instructions for managing and controlling those conditions to reduce your risk of glaucoma.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma can prevent damage to the eye\u2019s nerve cells and prevent severe vision loss.\nThere are several treatment options for glaucoma. The first treatment option usually is either medicated eye drops or pills. These aim to lower the pressure in your eye, prevent further nerve damage, and stop vision loss. This treatment works for many people. Keep in mind it may be hard to remember to take your medicine. That\u2019s because glaucoma often doesn\u2019t cause symptoms. But it\u2019s important to take it as your doctor prescribed.\nIf the eye drops or pills don\u2019t help relieve the pressure in your eye, your doctor may suggest laser treatment. During this procedure, a laser is used to open the drain where fluid flows out of your eye. It\u2019s a painless procedure. If that procedure doesn\u2019t work, you may need surgery to create a new channel where fluid can flow out of your eye. Talk with your doctor about the best option for you.\nIf your glaucoma is caught and treated early, you might not notice any difference in your vision. You can lead a normal life with no symptoms, as long as you take your medicine every day. Your eye doctor will likely want to see you every 3 to 6 months for a check-up.\nIf you have lost some of your vision, talk to your eye doctor. They may be able to suggest some services or devices that can help you make the most of your remaining vision. Also, community agencies may offer counseling, training, or other special services for people who have impaired vision.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Don\u2019t Let Glaucoma Steal Your Sight!\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Glaucoma\nNational Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute: Glaucoma\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nGout is a common type of\u00a0arthritis. It is marked by swelling and pain in your joints. It most often occurs in one or both of your big toes. It can affect your feet, ankles, fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees as well. Men develop gout more often than women. Women are more likely to develop gout aftermenopause. The condition can be acute (short-lasting) or chronic (long-lasting). It can be extremely painful.\nThe symptoms of gout may be sudden and often start at night. The affected joint swells and becomes red, hot, and painful. The joint may become stiff and hurt more when you touch it. An acute attack lasts 3 to 10 days on average, and nearly all resolve within 2 weeks. Chronic cases occur more often but may be less severe.\nToo much uric acid in your body causes gout. Uric acid forms naturally when your body breaks down purines. Purines also are found in some foods we eat. Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. In people who have gout, uric acid builds up and forms sharp crystals in the\u00a0joint\u00a0space. Gout is genetic and can run in families. Stress, poor diet, alcohol use, and other health problems, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, and hypertension can trigger the attack.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms and health history. Tell them if gout runs in your family. Your doctor may detect the condition by looking at your joints. To confirm a diagnosis, they can take a sample of the fluid from your joint and look for uric acid crystals. A blood test can check for elevated uric acid in your blood but doesn\u2019t always confirm if you currently have a gout attack.\nThere are several ways you can help lower your risk of gout and prevent future attacks.\nCertain health conditions can increase your chance of gout. Get treatment if you havehigh cholesterol,high blood pressure, ordiabetes. Medicines that may cause gout include:\nThe sooner you start treatment, the sooner your pain will go away. There are several things you can do to treat symptoms.\nWith the proper treatment, your gout attack should go away in a few days. If left untreated, it can last for several days or up to 2 weeks.\nTalk to your doctor if you continue to have attacks. The more frequent they are, the longer they can last and the more joints it can affect. Your doctor can prescribe medicines to help prevent future attacks. These medicines wash the uric acid from your joints, lower the level in your body, and reduce swelling. Aspirin can interfere with the way these medicines work. Work with your doctor on a treatment plan to manage the condition. You may need routine visits to check your uric acid level.\nOver time, gout attacks can lead to tophi. These are uric acid crystals that form lumps on your joints under your skin. Tophi can form on your toes, fingers, hands, and elbows. They causechronic painand can destroy the bones around your joints. You also may developkidney stonesor\u00a0kidney\u00a0disease from uric acid crystals that collect in your urinary tract.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: GoutNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: GoutNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Gout\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can live in the intestine, the rectum, or a woman\u2019s vagina. Group B strep doesn\u2019t usually cause problems in healthy adults. Most of the people who get sick from group B strep are newborns who are exposed to the bacteria during birth.\nAbout 25% of healthy pregnant women have group B strep in their bodies. A woman who has group B strep is said to be \u201ccolonized\u201d with this germ. If you are colonized with group B strep, your baby can become infected with these germs while being born and can get sick. There is less than a 1% chance that this will happen. But because group B strep infection is so dangerous for babies, it\u2019s important to find out if you\u2019re colonized while you\u2019re pregnant.\nGroup B strep doesn\u2019t usually cause symptoms in healthy adults.\nBabies who have group B strep may develop symptoms during their first week of life. This is called early-onset disease. Or they may develop symptoms from 1 week to 3 months of life.

Also, you probably will not make your baby sick. Knowing that you carry the bacteria just helps you and your doctor make decisions that can protect your baby from infection.\nPregnant women can\u2019t avoid having group B strep in their bodies.

It is caused by an increase in breast tissue, not fat tissue. Gynecomastia may be present in one or both breasts.\nBoth boys and men can have the condition. It can occur in newborns as well. Some men or boys have excess fat that looks like breasts. This is known as pseudogynecomastia. It is a similar, but different condition than gynecomastia.\nThe main symptom of gynecomastia is enlarged breasts. Your breasts may be tender, as well. You may feel a slight bump or lump behind the nipple.\nThe main cause of gynecomastia is a change in hormones. Most often, this happens at birth, puberty, or as part of aging. These are natural times when the hormones in your body change levels. An imbalance of hormones\u2014estrogen and testosterone\u2014can enlarge your breasts.\nNewborns who are born with enlarged breasts often have too much estrogen. Mothers transfer this hormone to their babies in the womb.\nGynecomastia is common in teenage boys. More than half of boys have some degree of the condition during puberty.\nIn adult men, the balance of hormones is affected by aging. Gynecomastia is more common in men who are 50 years of age or older. Other causes include health conditions, such as:\nIt can also be caused by medicines, such as:\nAnother potential cause is drugs, such as:\nGynecomastia can also be caused by other lifestyle factors including obesity, alcohol use, and the consumption of estrogen in medicines or in foods that contain soy.\nIt is very rare for breast cancer to be the cause of gynecomastia. Lumps caused by cancer do not form in breast tissue behind the nipple. The lumps also feel different than those caused by gynecomastia. Other signs of breast cancer are dimpling of the skin and bloody discharge from the nipple.\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have concerns. Your doctor may notice symptoms during a routine check-up. They may ask about your symptoms, such as how long you\u2019ve had the tissue growth and if the area is tender. Your doctor also may ask about your health history and what medicines you take.\nThe doctor will decide if tests are needed to diagnose gynecomastia. The most common test is a blood test to check your hormone levels. More tests may be done if your doctor suspects a disease. These can include:\nMost cases of gynecomastia cannot be prevented. They are caused by natural changes in hormone levels. Adults can help prevent gynecomastia by avoiding certain medicines, drugs, and lifestyle factors.\nIn most cases, treatment is not needed. Your doctor may want to check the size of your breast tissue every few months.\nIf treatment is needed, options vary based on the cause of the condition. Talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medicine to treat other medical conditions. Stop taking illegal drugs. You may need to make lifestyle changes as well. If it caused by a disease or tumor, you will need to treat the problem. This may include medicine or surgery. Medicine can help to balance your hormones. In rare cases, the doctor may suggest plastic surgery to remove the extra breast tissue.\nFor most newborns and teenage boys, gynecomastia does not last long.

You can become infected either by inhaling (breathing in) the virus, or touching a surface contaminated by the virus and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. This alone may alert him or her that you have H1N1. Your doctor may do a rapid flu test, but this checks for several viruses. The test to only check for H1N1 takes a few days to get results.

This is common if there is an H1N1 outbreak in your area and lots of people are infected.\nThe best way to avoid H1N1 is to get the flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that anyone 6 months of age or older receive the flu vaccine. People who work in health care should get the vaccine. So should anyone who lives with or takes care of children younger than 6 months of age.\nThere are 2 types of the vaccine. The trivalent flu vaccine protects against the 3 most common strains of flu each season. The quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains. The flu vaccine has protected against H1N1 since 2010. In general, it\u2019s safe, but there is a chance you may have a reaction. Tell your doctor if you have an allergy to something in the vaccine or if you\u2019ve had a reaction in the past. Sometimes there isn\u2019t enough of a certain vaccine for the number of people who need it. This can cause\u00a0a vaccine shortages.\nYou can prevent getting and spreading H1N1 by practicing good care.\nYour doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat H1N1. This helps kill the virus so you can recover and aren\u2019t contagious. If you have a fever, you can take medicine to reduce it. This includes acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (brand names: Advil or Motrin), or naproxen (brand name: Aleve). These drugs also relieve aches and pains. Don\u2019t give aspirin to children or teenagers 18 years of age or younger because of the risk ofReye\u2019s syndrome. Reye\u2019s syndrome is a serious illness that can lead to death. You also should drink fluids to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Rest helps your body fight infection.\nYour doctor may prescribe an anti-viral drug, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir. Anti-viral drugs decrease the flu virus\u2019 ability to reproduce. They can shorten the time you\u2019re sick, reduce your symptoms, and prevent problems caused by the flu. Anti-viral drugs work best if you start taking them when your symptoms begin. This form of treatment is more common if you\u2019re at high risk of flu complications. This includes:\nMost people can fight off and get rid of H1N1 on their own. You may need treatment or close medical care if your symptoms worsen or you\u2019re at risk of having complications.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians: Preventing the Flu\nLast Updated:June 4, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is hair loss?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHair growth typically completes a cycle in 2 to 3 years. Each hair grows approximately 1 centimeter per month during this phase. About 90% of the hair on your scalp is growing at any one time. About 10% of the hair on your scalp, at any one time, is in a resting phase. After 3 to 4 months, the resting hair falls out and new hair starts to grow in its place.\nIt is normal to shed some hair each day as part of this cycle. However, some people may experience excessive (more than normal) hair loss. Hair loss of this type can affect men, women, and children.\n\u201cCommon baldness\u201d usually means male-pattern baldness, or permanent-pattern baldness. The medical term for this is androgenetic alopecia. Male-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men. Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Men who start losing their hair at an early age tend to develop more extensive baldness. In male-pattern baldness, hair loss typically results in a receding hairline and baldness on the top of the head.\nWomen may develop female-pattern baldness. In this form of hair loss, the hair can become thin over the entire scalp.\nFor most people, excessive hair loss is gradual, which means it happens over a long period of time. This is especially true of male-pattern baldness. Hair loss is considered excessive when it results in bald spots or hair that is noticeably thinning. In some cases, hair can fall out suddenly. This is typically caused by sudden or prolonged stress, either physical or emotional.\nA number of things can cause excessive hair loss. For example, about 3 or 4 months after an illness or a major surgery, you may suddenly lose a large amount of hair. This hair loss is related to the stress of the illness and is temporary.\nHormonal problems may cause hair loss. If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, your hair may fall out. This hair loss usually can be helped by treating your thyroid disease. Hair loss may occur if male or female hormones, known as androgens and estrogens, are out of balance. Correcting the hormone imbalance may stop your hair loss.\nMany women notice hair loss about 3 months after they\u2019ve had a baby. This loss is also related to hormones. During pregnancy, high levels of certain hormones cause the body to keep hair that would normally fall out. When the hormones return to pre-pregnancy levels, that hair falls out and the normal cycle of growth and loss starts again.\nSome medicines can cause hair loss. This type of hair loss improves when you stop taking the medicine. Medicines that can cause hair loss include blood thinners (also called anticoagulants); medicines used forgout,high blood pressure, or heart problems; vitamin A (if you take too much of it);birth controlpills; andantidepressants.\nCertain infections can cause hair loss. Fungal infections of the scalp can cause hair loss in adults and children. The infection is treated with antifungal medicines.\nFinally, hair loss may occur as part of an underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. Since hair loss may be an early sign of a disease, it is important to find the cause so that it can be treated.\nYes. If you wear pigtails or cornrows or use tight hair rollers, the pull on your hair can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. If the pulling is stopped before scarring of the scalp develops, your hair will grow back normally. However, scarring can cause permanent hair loss. Hot oil hair treatments or chemicals used in permanents (also called \u201cperms\u201d) may cause inflammation (swelling) of the hair follicle. This can result in scarring and hair loss.\nIf you suspect that you may have excessive hair loss, talk to your doctor. He or she will probably ask you some questions about your diet, any medicines you\u2019re taking, and whether you\u2019ve had a recent illness, and how you take care of your hair. If you\u2019re a woman, your doctor may ask questions about your menstrual cycle, pregnancies, and menopause. Your doctor may want to do a physical exam to look for other causes of hair loss. Finally, your doctor may order blood tests or a biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope).\nThere is no way to prevent male-pattern baldness (or female-pattern baldness) because it is a genetic trait, meaning you inherited a gene for baldness from your parents.\nSome other causes of excessive hair loss can be prevented. For example, you could prevent hair loss by not styling hair too tightly in a way that puts too much pressure on your scalp. You also can talk to your doctor and avoid taking medications that could cause hair loss.\nDepending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine. Recognizing and treating an infection may help stop the hair loss. Correcting a hormone imbalance may prevent further hair loss.\nMedicines may also help slow or prevent the development of common baldness. One medicine, minoxidil (brand name: Rogaine), is available without a prescription. It is applied to the scalp. Both men and women can use it. Another medicine, finasteride, is available with a prescription. It comes in pills and is only for men. It may take up to 6 months before you can tell if one of these medicines is working.\nLosing your hair can be devastating. Many people consider a thick head of hair a symbol of youth and vitality. So losing it \u2014 no matter how young you are \u2014 can make you feel old. It can make you feel less attractive. It can lower your overall self-esteem.\nRemember that it is okay to feel what you\u2019re feeling. It is also okay to seek out a strategy for stopping or even reversing hair loss. Wanting hair doesn\u2019t mean that you are vain. You should not feel guilty about doing something about your hair loss.\nIf adequate treatment is not available for your type of hair loss, you may consider trying different hairstyles or wigs, hairpieces, hair weaves or artificial hair replacement.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hair Loss\nLast Updated:September 25, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHalitosis is the term for bad breath. Bad breath can have many causes and could be a sign of an underlying health problem.\nMany people wake up with smelly breath, often called morning breath. But you may also have bad breath on and off throughout the day and not even know it. Here are some symptoms you may have that are associated with bad breath:\nMost bad breath (also called halitosis) comes from something in your mouth. Food sticks between your teeth, around the gums and on your tongue. If you don\u2019t brush and floss your teeth every day, this food can rot. The rotten bits of food cause a bad smell in your mouth. Rotten food also helps bacteria grow in your mouth. These bacteria can cause gum disease (also called gingivitis). Gingivitis also causes bad breath.\nThe things you eat and drink can also affect your breath. Common examples of foods and beverages that may cause bad breath include onions, garlic, cheese, pastrami, certain spices, orange juice and soda. Once these foods are digested, their oils are absorbed into your bloodstream and carried into the lungs. The odor is given off in your breath until all the food is out of your body.\nIf you believe you may have halitosis, you should ask your doctor. They may be able to diagnose you based on odor alone. They may also ask you some lifestyle questions about how often you brush your teeth or if you floss your teeth. Your doctor may also ask about the medicines you are taking. If your doctor does not believe your bad breath is related to an underlying dental condition, they may refer you to a dentist for evaluation.\nThere are many things you can do on your own to prevent bad breath. These include:\nSometimes a dry mouth has an unpleasant smell. If your mouth is dry, you can suck on sugar-free mints, chew sugar-free gum or sip more water. Most mouthwashes do not have a long-lasting effect on bad breath. If you use a mouthwash, swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.\nIf you wear removable dentures, take them out at night. Brush the dentures and soak them overnight in a disinfecting solution. Removable braces and retainers should also be cleaned. Follow the directions of your dentist.\nYou should see your dentist twice a year to have your teeth cleaned.\nHalitosis treatment mostly includes the things listed above to prevent bad breath. But your doctor or dentist may also offer you a prescription mouthwash to help treat gum disease.\nIf you can\u2019t get rid of bad breath on your own, see your family doctor to find out if a more serious problem is causing it. Bad breath may be a sign of a health problem. Sinus infections, chronic lung infections, liver or kidney diseases, and diabetes are some health conditions that may cause bad breath.\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Over time, the toe gets stuck in a stiff, claw-like position.\nHammer toe usually affects a person\u2019s second toe (the toe next to the big toe). But it can affect other toes, too.\nThe main symptom of hammer toe is a toe that is bent upward at the middle joint. At first you may still be able to straighten out your toe. But over time, it will become painful and harder to do.\nWhen the inside of your shoe rubs against a hammer toe, corns, blisters or calluses may form. They may form on top of the toe or on the bottom of your foot. This can make walking painful, especially with shoes on. You may also have pain in the joint where your big toe joins your foot.\nThe most common cause of hammer toe is wearing short, narrow shoes that are too tight. This causes the toe to bend upward. Muscles and tendons in the toe tighten and become shorter. This makes the toe stay in the bent position.\nPeople who are born with long bones in their toes are more likely to develop hammer toe. Children who wear shoes they have outgrown may develop this condition. People who wear very narrow shoes or high-heeled shoes are also more likely to develop a hammer toe.\nSometimes, pressure from a bunion can cause hammer toe.Rheumatoid arthritisalso can increase your risk.\nYour doctor will be able to diagnose hammer toe by doing a physical examination of your foot.\nAvoid wearing shoes that are narrow or don\u2019t fit well. Also, don\u2019t wear heels higher than 2 inches. Instead, choose shoes with a wide toe box that give you \u00bd inch between the end of your longest toe and the inside tip of the shoe.\nTo prevent hammer toe in children, check often to make sure your child\u2019s shoes fit, especially when he or she is having a growth spurt.\nIf the affected toe is still flexible, you may be able to treat it by taping or splinting the toe to hold it straight. Your family doctor can show you how to do this.\nYou may need to do certain exercises to keep your toe joints flexible. For example, you may need to move and stretch your toe gently with your hands. You can also exercise by picking things up with your toes. Small or soft objects, such as marbles or towels, work best.\nIf your toe becomes painful, you can apply an ice pack several times a day. This can help relieve the soreness and swelling. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (also called NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve), may be helpful. If your pain and swelling are severe, your doctor may need to give you a steroid injection in the toe joint.\nIf you have a severe case of hammer toe or if the affected toe is no longer flexible, you may need surgery to straighten your toe joint. Surgery usually requires only a local anesthetic (numbing medicine for the affected area). It is usually an outpatient procedure. This means you don\u2019t have to stay in the hospital for the surgery.\nIf your hammer toe is not severe, there are things you can do help your symptoms.\nMayo Clinic: Hammer Toe and Mallet Toe\nLast Updated:January 20, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is caused by a virus and is very contagious, but not severe. The disease is easy to spot because of its symptoms: sores or blisters inside and outside the mouth as well as a rash (red spots) or sores on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Infants and children younger than age 5 are most likely to get the virus. But older children, teens, and adults can get it, too. A mild outbreak of the disease commonly occurs during summer and early fall. This disease shouldn\u2019t be confused with foot-and-mouth disease, which affects sheep, cattle, and pigs.\nThe common symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease are:\nThese symptoms don\u2019t usually appear all at once, but in stages. Your child may not have every symptom. Some people, especially adults, get the disease and don\u2019t show any symptoms. They can still pass it on to others.\nSymptoms usually appear 3 to 7 days after coming into contact with someone with the disease. Further symptoms can develop from complications. Because the sores make it painful to swallow, children and adults can become dehydrated. High fevers can cause seizures.\nHFMD is caused by either coxsackieviruses or human enteroviruses. It is found in the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.\nThe virus spreads when a sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can get it if you touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after touching something contaminated with the virus, such as a toy. You can also get it if you touch the stool (poop) or blisters of a person who is infected.\nYour child\u2019s doctor will review signs of illness and examine your child\u2019s sores or blisters to diagnose HFMD. In some cases, you child\u2019s doctor may swab the back of your child\u2019s throat to send to a lab. They may ask you to collect a stool sample from your child to send to a lab. The lab can test for the virus and rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.\nHFMD is contagious. It\u2019s important to avoid contact with anyone who has it. You won\u2019t always know when another person has the virus, especially in the early stages. Make sure you and your child practice good hygiene:\nThere is no cure for HFMD. Antibiotics won\u2019t work since it\u2019s caused by a virus. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.\nYour doctor may recommend tips to relieve your child\u2019s discomfort:\nSymptoms of HFMD often go away on their own. As a parent caring for a child who has the virus, your primary goals are to keep your child hydrated and rested. You should keep your child at home to avoid spreading it to other people. Your child should fully recover in 5 to 7 days. Contact your child\u2019s doctor if symptoms continue or worsen.\nThere is currently no vaccine in the United States to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is an autoimmune disease that affects your thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the front of your neck, below your voice box. It makes hormones that control metabolism. This includes things like your heart rate and how quickly you burn calories. When you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland. This causes it to become swollen and irritated. When this happens, your thyroid can\u2019t make hormones as it normally does.\nMany people who have Hashimoto\u2019s disease have no symptoms at all. If the disease does enough damage to the thyroid, it can causehypothyroidism(underactive thyroid disease). This is because the attack on the thyroid causes the gland to produce fewer hormones. Symptoms of Hashimoto\u2019s disease include:\nHashimoto\u2019s disease is an autoimmune disease. Normally, the immune system produces antibodies. These help protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. Sometimes your immune system produces antibodies that attack your body\u2019s tissues and/or organs. This is an autoimmune disease. When you have Hashimoto\u2019s disease, these antibodies attack your thyroid. Doctors are not sure why people get this disease.\nHashimoto\u2019s disease can affect people of all ages. It\u2019s most common in women between 30 and 50 years of age. If someone in your family has had thyroid disease, you may have an increased risk for Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will ask about your symptoms and your medical history. They will order blood tests that can tell if your thyroid gland is working properly. The tests can measure hormone levels to check for Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\nYour doctor may also order imaging tests. These could include an ultrasound or CT scan. These tests allow your doctor to see images of your thyroid gland to look for problems. Imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\nThere is no known way to prevent or avoid Hashimoto\u2019s disease.\nHashimoto\u2019s disease has no cure. But it can be treated with medicine. This will minimize any long-term effects. It is treated with a synthetic thyroid hormone. This hormone replaces the hormones your thyroid gland usually makes. The medicine is taken daily in pill form. It regulates hormone levels and shifts your metabolism back to normal. It also lowers your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It may help reverse weight gain. How long you need to take the medicine will depend on the results of your blood tests. For most people, taking thyroid hormone medicine causes no problems.\nTo help prevent symptoms, always take your thyroid medicine. Also get regular blood tests to see how your thyroid gland is working. Some medicines, supplements, and foods may affect your body\u2019s ability to absorb the synthetic thyroid hormone. Tell your doctor if you:\nHashimoto\u2019s disease often stays stable for many years. If it does progress to hypothyroidism, it is easily treated.\nIf you are diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s disease and plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your doctor.

No matter how many times you or your child takes a shower or washes his or her hair, it\u2019s still possible to get head lice from head-to-head contact with someone who is already infested with lice. You can also get head lice if you share hats, towels, pillows, combs, or brushes with someone who has head lice.\nIn most cases, you should be able to diagnose head lice yourself. Finding a live nymph (young) or adult louse on the scalp or hair is enough for a positive diagnosis of head lice.\nIf you find only nits (eggs) attached to hair, chances are still fairly strong that there is a lice infestation. However, if the nits are positioned more than \u00bc inch from the base of the hair shaft, they most likely are dead and will not hatch. If you see these nits and no live bugs, you no longer have active head lice.\nIf you can\u2019t find any lice but are still having symptoms, see your doctor for help with the diagnosis.\nIt may be difficult to prevent head lice from spreading among children, but the following are some steps you can take to help keep lice away:\nHead lice can be treated with over-the-counter or\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicines. Over-the-counter shampoos and lotions containing pyrethrin (one brand name: Rid) or permethrin (brand name: Nix) are commonly used. Shampoos and lotions that kill head lice contain pesticides and other chemicals. It\u2019s important to talk to your doctor before using these products, especially if you\u2019re pregnant or nursing, or if you have allergies orasthma. It\u2019s also not safe to use products with pesticides on or near your eyes. If you find head lice or nits in eyelashes or brows, talk to your doctor.\nIf over-the-counter products are not effective, your doctor can prescribe a cream, lotion, or shampoo to treat your head lice. Certain prescription medicines are also safer for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nThe products that kill head lice don\u2019t usually kill all nits. To reduce the risk of another lice infestation, pick the remaining lice and nits by hand or by using a special comb (one brand name: LiceMeister) to remove them. Comb through all of the hair, one section at a time, every 3 days or more often. Do this for at least 2 weeks or until you stop seeing head lice and nits. A repeat treatment might be needed in 10-14 days.\nYou should also use hot water to wash any bed linens, towels, and clothing recently worn by the person who had head lice. Vacuum anything that can\u2019t be washed, such as the couch, carpets, your child\u2019s car seat, and any stuffed animals. Because head lice don\u2019t live very long away from the scalp, you don\u2019t need to use lice spray on these items.\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to live with head lice for long, although it may feel like a long time. It may take a few treatments and a few weeks to get rid of them completely.\nHead lice can\u2019t jump or fly. Only the direct contact with an infested person or their contaminated items can spread lice. Encourage your young and school-aged children to take the precautions listed above to avoid future cases of head lice.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Head Lice\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Head Lice\nLast Updated:September 25, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nA headache is a pain that occurs in your head, upper neck or even your face. There are several different types of headaches. Migraines and tension headaches are the most common. Other types are cluster headaches and rebound headaches.\nAmigraineis an intense, pounding headache. You can get them once or often, and they can last for hours or days. Migraines are more common in women than men.\nTension headaches often are brought on by stress. They frequently start in the middle of the day. They may be mild or severe and get worse over time.\nSinus headaches are caused by sinus pressure. Your sinuses are small, air-filled spaces located behind your nose, cheekbones, and forehead. When your sinuses get irritated by an infection or allergies, these spaces become swollen. This irritation also triggers your sinuses to begin overproducing mucus. Both of these contribute to sinus pressure.\nA cluster headache is a rare type of headache. Cluster headaches typically start all of a sudden and occur once or more each day for a period of time. Often, they occur at the same time(s) each day. The period may last days or up to 12 weeks.\nOn average, each headache lasts about 45 to 90 minutes. The most common times for cluster headaches to occur are between 1 and 2 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m., and around 9 p.m. Cluster headaches are more common in men than women.\nPeople who have problems with medicine or substance abuse get rebound headaches. These headaches occur most days early in the morning. They also are sometimes referred to as medication-overuse headaches.\nIf headache pain is getting in the way of your daily activities, it\u2019s time to see your family doctor.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Jennifer Hanna\nThe main symptom of headaches is head pain. Other symptoms vary, based on the type.\nMigraines are defined by pounding or pulsing head pain. The pain may begin in your forehead, the side of your head, or around your eyes. Migraines often get worse and are hard to get rid of. Movement, bright lights, and loud noises can make the pain worse. Nausea and vomiting are common. You also may have blurry vision or be lightheaded.\nThe pain from tension headaches is constant and dull. You may feel it on both sides of your head or around your head, like a band. In addition to pain, you may feel tightness or pressure. The headaches can cause aches in your jaw or neck. If you regularly use a computer for work, adjusting your work station so that your head is looking forward instead of downward will also help.\nSinus pressure results in headache-like pain in your forehead, around your eyes, or around your nose and cheeks. Straining or sudden movement makes the pain even worse. You may have other symptoms, as well. These include a runny nose, swollen face, and sometimes fever. Your ears may also feel stopped up or like they have pressure, too.\nThe pain from cluster headaches often is severe. It may occur behind or around one or both eyes. The headaches can cause your eyes or nose to become red and swollen. They also can make you feel restless.\nThe pain and symptoms from rebound headaches can vary. Nausea and vomiting are common. You may be anxious, irritable or depressed, or have trouble sleeping.\nThe exact cause of headaches varies and is not always known.\nMigraines may be caused by:\nA lot of factors can cause tension headaches. These include:\nCluster headaches do not appear to be related to health conditions or diseases of the brain. Some of the triggers of cluster headaches include:\nOveruse of medicine is the main cause of rebound headaches. Be careful taking too much of certain medicines. These include:\nIf you get rebound headaches, these medicines should not be taken more than 2 days a week. Talk with your doctor to find out if you should stop taking these medicines altogether.\nYour doctor often can tell what kind of headache you have. They can do this by examining you and reviewing your symptoms. It may help if you keep track of the time and pattern of your headaches, as well as how they feel. This can help determine what the causes, or triggers, are and how to treat them. It also helps to rate your level of pain on a scale.A good way to do this is the keep a headache journal.\nIn rare cases, the doctor may perform tests to aid in a diagnosis. These could include lab tests to check your blood or chemical levels. They also could include imaging tests, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nYou cannot completely prevent headaches. You may be able to lower how many headaches you have by identifying what causes your headaches.\nMedicine to prevent migraines may be helpful if your headaches happen more than 2 times a month. Preventive medicines for migraines can include prescription drugs often used to treat other ailments. Anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, medicines to lower blood pressure, and even Botox injections are some of the preventive medicines your doctor may prescribe. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors can also help prevent migraines. They do so by blocking a gene-related peptide in your sensory nerves. This peptide is known to increase during a migraine attack, so blocking it can help prevent migraines.\nThere are also a number of non-medical treatments designed to help minimize migraine pain and frequency. One is an electrical stimulation device, which has been approved by the FDA. It is a headband that you wear once a day for 20 minutes to stimulate the nerve linked to migraines. Another non-medical treatment is counseling aimed at helping you feel in more control of your migraines. This counseling works best when paired with medical prevention of migraines as well.\nOne way to help prevent tension headaches is to improve your posture. Improved posture can help prevent your muscles from becoming tense or tight. You can practice this while you\u2019re sitting and while you\u2019re standing. While sitting, make sure shoulders are back and your head isn\u2019t slumped forward or backward. This is especially important as you work at your computer and look at your phone. When standing, make sure to hold shoulders back while also tightening your stomach muscles. Straighten your neck and hold your head level.\nKeeping sinuses moist and clean may help prevent sinus headaches. Consider adding a humidifier to your bedroom. This can help your nose from becoming dry and irritated. Talk to your doctor about also using a tool to flush out sinuses. Your doctor may recommend using a neti pot or bulb syringe. This will moisten sinuses and help clean out mucus, too.\nDrinking alcohol and smoking or vaping can trigger cluster headaches. Avoiding triggers may help you prevent cluster headaches. Your doctor may also prescribe calcium channel blockers for prevention.\nThe best way to prevent rebound headaches is to limit your use of pain relievers. You should use them only when you need them and no more than twice a week. If you feel like you need to use them more often, talk to your doctor. You should also avoid caffeine when taking pain relievers. This is because many pain relievers already contain caffeine. A double dose of caffeine can cause a headache or make it worse.\nThe most common treatments for headaches are rest and over-the-counter pain relievers. These include aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Always check the label when choosing an over-the-counter pain reliever. You want to look for side effects or possible drug interactions with other medicines you take. Make sure you read and follow the directions on the label carefully. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nKeep in mind that children should not take aspirin. It can cause a serious illness called Reye\u2019s syndrome in children younger than 18 years of age.\nIt is best to treat headaches when they begin or when they are still mild. It is harder to treat and get rid of headaches once the pain is worse. Talk to your doctor if these common treatments don\u2019t work. They can suggest a different treatment option.\nCertain prescription medicines can prevent headaches. Examples include:\nThese medicines can help prevent or reduce the number of headaches you get. It can take 6 weeks or more for the medicine to start working. Talk to your doctor about whether one of these medicines is right for you. It is important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. Most prescriptions need to be taken each day. Always carry your medicine with you in case you get a headache.\nSeveral treatments are available for people who have cluster headaches. Work with your doctor to discuss the pros, cons, and side effects. Select the right treatment for you and set up a schedule for prescription medicines.\nYour doctor will probably prescribe two medicines. The first medicine is preventive. You take it regularly during the entire cluster period. It helps to reduce the number of headaches you get. The second medicine is reactive. You take it to relieve the pain that occurs from a cluster headache.\nThese medicines can be very effective. They can reduce the number of headaches you get as well as the severity. Cluster headaches often begin quickly. You may not be able to get medical help, so you should have your medicine available. Take this as soon as an attack begins. You may want to tell family or friends about your headaches and medicines. This way, they can help you when you have an attack. For some people, oral medicines (taken by mouth) do not work fast enough. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe another form of medicine. This could be a nasal spray, injection (shot), or rectal suppository. Another treatment that works for some people is a local anesthetic. This is a numbing medicine that you apply to your nose.\nAt the start of a cluster headache, inhaling pure oxygen through a mask can help prevent the attack. However, this is not always practical since the headaches come on quickly.\nSome types of headaches can be very painful. This is especially true if you get them on a regular basis. However, most people cope well with the right treatment.\nIn addition to medicine, a fixed daily routine can help manage your symptoms and prevent headaches. For instance, eating meals at regular hours. Other ways to help prevent headaches include:\nIt is important to know what triggers your headaches, especially if you have them often.Keeping a headache journalcan help you figure out what these triggers may be. A journal can help you keep track of your activities, food, and even the weather leading up to your headaches.\nSome patients try alternative options for headache relief. Examples include acupuncture or chiropractic treatments. Talk to your doctor about the potential risks and benefits of these treatments. Keep in mind that not all alternative treatments are proven effective. For instance, herbal medicines are not tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ask your doctor about taking herbal medicines. They can check for drug interactions with other medicines you take.\nAnother alternative treatment is mind-body therapy. This focuses on the connection between your mind and body. You can do some types of mind-body therapy on your own.\nOther types of mind-body therapy are biofeedback and cognitive behavior. Biofeedback is a technique where you use your thoughts to control your body. Biofeedback may help with physical and mental health problems. Cognitive behavior therapy is a form of counseling called talk therapy. It may help you identify triggers so you can stop them before headaches occur. Cognitive behavior therapy can help ease stress and treat health problems.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Headache\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Migraine\nLast Updated:April 8, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nThere are many types of hearing problems in children. Many of these problems result in hearing loss. This loss may be only temporary, but it can also be permanent. It\u2019s important that parents and other caretakers recognize the signs of hearing loss. The sooner you recognize a hearing problem, the better it will be for your child.\nChildren learn how to talk by hearing and imitating the sounds of people around them. And children start to learn about language and speech before they learn to talk. So the sooner your child has access to sound, the better. If your baby has a hearing problem, exploring communication options early on can help avoid speech delays and problems.\nSigns of hearing loss in very young children may not be easy to notice. Hearing problems may not become obvious until children are 12 to 18 months of age. This is when they should begin saying their first words. Children who can\u2019t hear well often respond to their environment by using their senses of sight and touch. This can hide their hearing problems.\nThere are many things that can cause hearing problems in children. Some children are born with hearing loss. This is called congenital hearing loss. Hearing loss that occurs later is call acquired hearing loss.\nSometimes doctors can identify what caused congenital hearing loss but often they can\u2019t. This type of hearing loss can be genetic (it runs in families) or non-genetic.\nThere are a few ways parents can pass along hearing loss to their child (genetic loss).\nNon-genetic causes are most often related to illness or trauma before or during birth. Common non-genetic causes of hearing loss in children include:\nAcquired hearing loss can happen at any time in your life. It is usually caused by an injury or illness. Here are just a few things that can cause acquired hearing loss:\nChildren who are born with hearing problems can usually be diagnosed with a hearing screening. All babies should have a hearing screening within 1 month after being born. Many hospitals screen newborn babies for hearing problems. If your newborn baby hasn\u2019t had a hearing screening, talk with your doctor.\nAnswer the following questions about your child to identify signs of a hearing problem. If you answer \u201cno\u201d to any question, ask your family doctor if your child should be checked for hearing problems.\nSome types of hearing loss can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. Most types of congenital hearing loss can\u2019t be prevented. There are a few exceptions. Congenital hearing loss caused by a mother\u2019s abuse of drugs or alcohol while pregnant can be avoided.\nMore types of acquired hearing loss are preventable. You can help your child avoid hearing loss by:\nHearing problems can be temporary or permanent. Ear infections or fluid or pressure changes in the middle ear can cause temporary hearing problems. These will go away with time or treatment. Most permanent hearing problems are present at birth. They may be hereditary (run in families) or may be caused by medical problems. In some cases, the cause of a hearing problem may be unknown.\nIf your child has permanent hearing loss, talk to your doctor about communication options. Several types of hearing devices are available for children. Your doctor may refer you to an audiologist who can help you decide which hearing device is right for your child. Your audiologist may also talk with you about other options to help your child communicate. He or she may recommend lip-reading or sign language. Talk to him or her about whether your child may also benefit from listening therapy or speech therapy.\nHearing loss ranges from mild to profound. There are many tools that can help your child hear. The type of hearing loss he or she has will determine which tools can work for him or her. If your child\u2019s hearing loss is mild to moderate, a good hearing aid can help him or her. If his or her hearing loss is severe to profound, he or she may benefit from a cochlear implant.\nThe most important thing is that your child learns to communicate despite his or her hearing loss. This may mean that you and your child need to learn sign language. Your child may need to learn how to read lips. Be flexible and patient. Know that there are many professionals who can help you reach communication goals for your child.\nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Hearing, Ear Infections, and Deafness\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hearing Problems in Children\nLast Updated:June 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "list_title": "Hearing: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss",
    "article_title": "What is noise-induced hearing loss?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nNoise-induced hearing loss is permanent hearing loss that is caused by being around loud noises over a long period of time. It also can occur after you are exposed to loud noise in a short period of time, such as a gunshot or explosion. The more you are around loud noises, the greater your risk hearing loss.\nWhether noise harms your hearing depends on the loudness, the pitch, and the length of time you are exposed to the noise. The loudness of a sound (measured in decibels, or dB) and the length of exposure are related. The louder the sound, the shorter the exposure can be before damage occurs. For example, 8 hours of exposure to 85-dB noise daily can begin to damage a person\u2019s ears over time. Using power tools (at about 100 dB), listening to loud stereo headsets (at about 110 dB), attending a rock concert (at about l20 dB), or hearing a gunshot (at 140 to 170 dB) may damage the hearing of some people after only a few times.\nOne reason people fail to notice the danger of noise is that too much exposure to noise causes few symptoms. Hearing loss is rarely painful. The symptoms are usually vague:\nThese symptoms may go away minutes, hours, or days after the exposure to noise ends.\nPeople assume that if the symptoms go away, their ears have \u201cbounced back\u201d to normal. This is not true. Even if there are no more symptoms, some of the cells in the inner ear may have been destroyed by the noise. Your hearing returns to normal if enough healthy cells are left in your inner ear. But you will develop a lasting hearing loss if the noise exposure is continues and more cells are destroyed.\nThe first sign of a noise-induced hearing loss is not hearing high-pitched sounds, like the singing of birds. It may also be not understanding speech when in a crowd or an area with a lot of background noise. If the damage goes on, hearing declines further, and lower pitched sounds become hard to understand.\nThe following signs should be a red flag that the noise around you is too loud:\nThe human ear is divided into 3 parts \u2014 the external, middle, and inner ear. The inner ear is located inside the skull. It is the most complex part of the ear. The soft tissue of the inner ear is made of different types of cells and nerves, all arranged in a pattern on a thin sheet of tissue. Large tubes filled with fluid surround the soft tissue of the inner ear. Hearing loss occurs when the inner ear is damaged.\nFrequent exposure to loud or moderately loud noise over a long period of time can damage the cells and nerves in the inner ear. If enough cells and nerves are destroyed, hearing is permanently damaged.\nYour doctor can offer a hearing test that will determine if you have a hearing loss. If the test shows that you have a hearing loss, you will be referred to an audiologist (ear care and hearing loss professionals) or otolaryngologist (a doctor with special training in ear and hearing disorders) for a more thorough hearing test. This test will determine the degree of hearing loss you have (mild, moderate, or profound). It also will identify for which frequencies (sound pitches: high sounds and low sounds) you have a hearing loss. For example, your hearing loss may affect only high frequencies (birds chirping) or low frequencies (a bass drum).\nHearing loss is usually progressive. That means it happens over a long period of time. Because it happens over time, you are less likely to notice that it is happening. If you are having trouble hearing in crowded places or it is difficult to talk on the phone, it may be time for a hearing test.\nFollowing a few simple steps could protect you from noise-induced hearing loss.\nThere is no cure for permanent hearing loss. One of the most obvious \u201ctreatments\u201d for this type of hearing loss is avoiding your exposure to noise. This can prevent your hearing loss from getting worse.\nThere is equipment that can help you hear better. Depending on the degree of your hearing loss, you may benefit from using a hearing aid (a device you wear in or on your ear to magnify sound). For profound hearing loss, you may qualify for a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant is an electronic hearing device that replaces the damaged inner ear with a ray of electrodes. These electrodes are surgically implanted in your inner ear. They provide sound signals to your brain.\nHearing allows you to be involved with the world around you. When you begin to lose hearing, you feel disconnected. Even isolated. You have learned most of what you know by listening to parents, teachers, television, and radio. Music, the sounds of nature, and the voices of loved ones can bring you pleasure; sirens and alarms can warn you about danger, even when you are asleep.\nThe first step to cope with this loss is to acknowledge it. Hearing loss is not something you should hide or be ashamed of. Once you recognize it, then you can begin to deal with the loss and take action to correct it, if possible. Being proactive about hearing loss can even stop its progression (continued development), saving you from greater hearing loss.\nRecently, researchers have linked hearing loss to cognitive problems and evendementia. This means that people who have hearing loss are more likely to have these conditions also. However, studies are now finding that treating hearing loss can lessen this increased risk for dementia.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Preventing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss\nHearing Loss Association of America\nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD): Noise-Induced Hearing Loss\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nA heart attack happens when part of the heart muscle is cut off from oxygen. If the oxygen isn\u2019t restored soon, a heart attack occurs. The blood in your coronary arteries carries oxygen to the heart muscle. Most heart attacks occur when a blockage slows or stops blood flow. Heart attack is sometimes called myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Heart attacks are often treatable when diagnosed quickly. However, they can be fatal.\nWomen are less likely to survive heart attacks than men. No one knows why. It may be that women don\u2019t seek or receive treatment as soon as men. Their symptoms can be different from what men experience. Their symptoms may be milder and more often overlooked. Or it may be because women\u2019s smaller hearts and blood vessels are more easily damaged. Doctors are working on finding answers to these questions. It\u2019s important to prevent heart problems before they start.\nThe most common symptoms of heart attack in both men and women include:\nOther symptoms could include:\nThe most common symptom for women is pain or discomfort in the chest. However, women are more likely to have a heart attack without having any chest pain. Therefore, women should pay close attention to other symptoms of heart attack. These include shortness of breath, sweating, fatigue, and dizziness.\nIf you think you may be having a heart attack, get treatment right away. Follow these steps:\nA heart attack occurs when part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies from lack of oxygen. When a blockage occurs in your coronary arteries, blood and oxygen don\u2019t get to the heart. This can lead to a heart attack if it isn\u2019t treated quickly\nMost heart attacks are a result of coronary heart or artery disease. A waxy substance called plaque builds up in the arteries. This is calledatherosclerosis. It takes years for the plaque to build up. When the plaque breaks up,\u00a0it travels through the blood stream. This creates blood clots. The clots slow or stop blood flow to the heart. Then the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen. The tissue not receiving the oxygen begins to die.\nRisk factors for a heart attack include:\nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm, or tightening, of a coronary artery. This can happen in an artery that doesn\u2019t have plaque build-up. Instead, the tightening cuts off the blood flow. Spasms aren\u2019t as well understood as a cause for heart attack. They seem to be related to:\nYou may need several tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.\nOther tests your doctor may want you to have include:\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart attack. This includes:\nHRT is used to treat the symptoms of menopause. However, new studies have shown that HRT actually does more harm to your heart than good. If you\u2019re taking HRT to help prevent heart disease, talk to your doctor about whether you should stop.\nYour treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms. If you have an acute case of angina (chest pain), your doctor will probably give you nitroglycerin and aspirin. Nitroglycerin improves blood flow to your heart. It can temporarily relieve your symptoms by widening the arteries that carry blood to the heart.\nIf you are having a heart attack, your doctor can:\nTreatment of heart attack also includes medicines that you will need to take even after you leave the hospital. These medicines help improve blood flow to your heart, prevent clotting, and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. These medicines include:\nYour doctor will prescribe the medicines that are right for you. If you have had a heart attack, your doctor will also talk to you about lifestyle changes. You can make these changes to prevent more heart problems.\nBefore you leave the hospital, your doctor may talk to you about a cardiac rehabilitation program. These programs provide information that will help you understand your risk factors. It will help you live a healthy lifestyle that can prevent future heart problems. You will learn about exercise and\u00a0diet, and how to reach and maintain a healthy weight. You will also learn ways to control your stress level, your\u00a0blood pressure,\u00a0and your\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0levels.\nYour cardiac rehabilitation program will probably start while you are still in the hospital. After you leave the hospital, your rehabilitation will continue in a rehab center. The rehab center may be at the hospital or in another location.\nMost cardiac rehabilitation programs last 3 to 6 months. Your doctor will talk to you about how often you need to attend the program.

But it simply means your heart isn\u2019t pumping blood as well as it should. It can be caused by many different heart conditions and tends to get worse over time. It does not mean your heart has stopped working or that you are having aheart attack. The most common cause of heart failure is congestive heart failure (CHF). This means fluid is building up in the body because the heart isn\u2019t pumping properly.\nSome people who have heart failure have few problems or symptoms. Others may have many symptoms, including:\nCall your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, especially if you\u2019ve had heart problems in the past.\nWhat causes heart failure?\nHeart failure has many causes. Most of these are other conditions or diseases that damage the heart muscle. These could include:\nSometimes, the exact cause cannot be found. Some people are at higher risk of developing heart failure, including those who are:\nThere is no single test to diagnose heart failure. Your doctor will ask you about your medical history and symptoms. He or she will give you a physical exam and may order some of the following tests:\nHeart failure is the result of other diseases or conditions weakening your heart. These can include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The best way to avoid heart failure is to prevent those conditions. The following can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle:\nIf you do have a condition such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, you need to manage it. Keep levels under control and take any medicines you\u2019ve been prescribed.\nHeart failure cannot be completely cured. But treatment can improve how well the heart pumps and can help relieve your symptoms. An important part of treatment is taking care of any underlying problems. This includes lowering high blood pressure or fixing a heart valve. Treatment also includes lifestyle changes and medicine.\nA variety of medicines are used to treat heart failure. You may need one or more medicines, depending on your symptoms. Your doctor will talk about these medicines with you. It may take some time to find the best type of medicine and the best dosage of medicine for you.\nSeveral kinds of medicines are commonly used to treat heart failure:\nIf you have other problems or experience side effects, you might need to take other medicines.\nWhen you\u2019re taking medicine for heart failure, you\u2019ll also need to have regular blood tests. These will check your potassium level and\u00a0kidney\u00a0function. How often you need blood tests depends on the type and strength of medicine you\u2019re taking. If you have concerns about the medicine or think you\u2019re having side effects, talk to your doctor. It\u2019s important that you take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you.\nIf your heart failure is severe, your doctor may recommend placing a small defibrillator in your chest. It can restart your heart if your heart stops.\nHeart failure has no cure. You will have to follow a treatment plan for the rest of your life. This treatment plan can include medicines, lifestyle changes, guides on activity levels, and keeping your appointments.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nA heart murmur is an abnormal noise between heartbeats. It can be a blowing, whooshing, or swishing sound. When your doctor listens to your heartbeat with a stethoscope, they are listening to the sounds your blood makes as it flows through your heart. A heart murmur is when the blood makes an extra sound as it moves through. A heart\u00a0murmur\u00a0can be a sign of a heart problem. It can also be caused by a minor issue or a normal increase in\u00a0blood\u00a0flow in the heart.\nA heart murmur can be a symptom of another problem. The sound is the only way to know if you or your child has one. If a murmur is caused by a heart problem, you may have other symptoms. These could include:\nMany different things can cause heart murmurs. In many cases, the heart murmur is just the sound of blood flowing through a normal, healthy heart. This is called an \u201cinnocent\u201d or \u201cfunctional\u201d murmur. These noises are commonly heard in children because their hearts are very close to their chest walls. Many innocent murmurs become hard to hear as children grow older. Most go away on their own. Pregnant women also sometimes have innocent heart murmurs because the body makes extra blood during pregnancy.\nOther heart murmurs are caused by problems with the heart. Heart problems that can cause a murmur include:\nYou are at higher risk of developing a heart murmur if you have a family history of a heart defect or certain medical conditions. These could include high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or endocarditis (infection in the lining of the heart).\nYour baby is at higher risk of developing a heart murmur if you used certain medicines, alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy. Other pregnancy conditions can increase the risk, such as uncontrolled diabetes or a rubella infection.\nUsually, your doctor will find a murmur during a regular exam when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Once they hear the murmur, they will listen to the loudness, the location, and the timing of it. This will help them determine if it is an innocent murmur or if it could be something more serious.\nIf your doctor suspects a heart problem, they may refer you to a cardiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in the heart. Your doctor may choose to do some testing. These tests could include a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG), or an echocardiogram (sometimes called an \u201cecho,\u201d which is an ultrasound of the heart). These tests will help them see if there are problems with your heart rhythm, your heart structure, or how your heart is working.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent heart murmurs caused by genetics. Avoiding drugs and alcohol and receiving treatment for infections during pregnancy can prevent some heart murmurs in children.\nThe treatment for a heart murmur depends on what is causing the murmur. An innocent heart murmur doesn\u2019t need any treatment. If a heart problem or other condition is causing the murmur, that problem will need to be treated. These types of conditions are usually treated with medicine. Severe cases could require surgery.\nAn innocent heart murmur does not pose a health threat. If your child has an innocent heart murmur, they can run, jump, and play, with no limits on activity. Your child doesn\u2019t need to take any medicine or be careful in any special way.\nIf you or your child has an innocent heart murmur, you can live a completely normal life. It will not cause you any problems and is not a sign of an issue with your heart. If you have a murmur along with any of the following symptoms, see your doctor:\nIf your child has a heart murmur and any of these symptoms, call your doctor:\nThese could be signs of a more serious heart problem.\nAmerican Heart Association: Heart Murmurs\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Heart murmurs\nLast Updated:June 29, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nHeart palpitations are the sensation that your heart is pounding, racing, or skipping beats (fluttering). It is normal to hear or feel your heart \u201cpounding\u201d as it beats faster when you exercise. You may feel it when you do any physical activity. But if you have palpitations, you might feel like your heart is pounding while you are just sitting still or moving slowly.\nHeart palpitations may feel different to different people. They may feel like your heart is skipping a beat. They may feel like a flutter in your chest. Or they may feel like the pounding described above. You may have heart palpitations while you are sitting or while you are lying down.\nMany things can cause heart palpitations. Some causes include:\nSometimes the cause of palpitations is unexplained. This happens in about 1 of every 7 people who have palpitations. Palpitations in these people usually are harmless.\nIf your heart races when you aren\u2019t exercising, see your doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask you about any medicines you are taking. They will ask about your diet and ask if you have panic attacks. Your doctor may want you to have a resting electrocardiogram test. This test tracks your heartbeat over a certain period of time. Your doctor also may test your blood.\nIf these tests do not show what is causing your palpitations, your doctor may have you wear a heart monitor. If so, you will wear it for 1 to 30 days. This monitor will show any breaks in your heart\u2019s rhythm. Your doctor might refer you to a cardiologist (a heart doctor) for more tests or treatment.\nHeart palpitations cannot always be prevented or avoided. Here are some things you can do that may help prevent or avoid them:\nMost of the time, heart palpitations are harmless and will go away on their own. In these cases, they do not require treatment.\nHowever, heart palpitations can sometimes be a sign of a more serious heart condition. If you have palpitations and are also dizzy or have shortness of breath, seek immediate medical attention.\nIf your heart palpitations are related to a heart condition or other medical problem, your doctor will treat you for that. In these cases, your palpitations will likely go away as a result of treatment.\nIf your heart palpitations are a result of certain foods, beverages (alcohol and caffeine), or medications, try cutting back. Doing so could stop your palpitations.\nIf you can understand what is causing your palpitations, you will likely be able to manage them. You will be able to avoid known triggers, like diet pills, caffeine, and cold/cough medicines.\nPalpitations that are caused by anxiety or stress are sometimes harder to control. The anxiety can cause the palpitations, and the palpitations can create anxiety. These often make up a seemingly endless cycle. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to ease your anxiety.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Heart Palpitations\nLast Updated:August 18, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nDespite its name,\u00a0heartburn\u00a0doesn\u2019t affect the\u00a0heart. Heartburn is a burning feeling in the lower chest, along with a sour or bitter taste in the throat and mouth. It usually occurs after eating a big meal or while lying down. The feeling can last for a few minutes or a few hours.\nHeartburn symptoms vary. They may be slight or extreme. The severity of heartburn may depend on what\u2014and how much\u2014you have eaten. The main symptom of heartburn is a burning feeling in your throat and chest. This happens when the acidic liquid from your food or drink comes back up into your\u00a0esophagus. You may have difficulty swallowing or choke on this acid. It may even make you hoarse or cough.\nWhen you eat, food passes from your mouth down a tube called the esophagus. The esophagus is about 10 inches long in most people. To enter the stomach, the food must pass through an opening between the\u00a0esophagus\u00a0and stomach. This opening acts like a gate to allow food to pass into the stomach. Usually, this opening closes as soon as food passes through. But if it doesn\u2019t close all the way, acid from your stomach can get through the opening and into your esophagus. This is called\u00a0reflux. Stomach acid can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.\nHiatalherniaalso can cause heartburn. Hiatal\u00a0hernia\u00a0is a condition in which part of the stomach is pushed up through the\u00a0diaphragm\u00a0(the\u00a0muscle\u00a0wall between the stomach and chest) and into the chest.\nHeartburn symptoms are easy to recognize. If you think you may have this condition, talk with your doctor. They will likely be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms.\nYou might be able to avoid heartburn by making some lifestyle changes.\nMany things can make heartburn worse. It is most common after overeating, when bending over or when lying down. Pregnancy, stress, and certain foods can also make symptoms worse.\nThings that can make heartburn worse:\nIf taking over-the-counter antacid medicines and lifestyle changes don\u2019t help your symptoms, talk with your doctor. They may want you to take\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicine. Or they may schedule you for some tests. Tests might include:\nSeveral kinds of medicine can be used to treat heartburn. Antacids neutralize the acid that your stomach makes. For most people, antacids that you can get over the counter (without a prescription) give fast, short-term relief. You may need to try different medicines to find one that works best for you. However, if you use antacids too much, they can cause diarrhea orconstipation. Look for antacids that contain both magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. One causes constipation\u00a0while the other causes diarrhea. So they counteract each other.\nSome brands of antacids include Maalox and Mylanta. Follow the directions on the package. H2 blockers (some brand names: Pepcid, Tagamet) reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. Several are available without a prescription. Other medicines, such as omeprazole (brand name: Prilosec) and lansoprazole (brand name: Prevacid), also reduce how much acid the stomach makes. Metoclopramide (brand name: Reglan) reduces acid reflux. To find out what medicine is right for you, talk with your doctor.\nIf you have heartburn only now and then, it\u2019s probably not serious. However, if you have heartburn frequently, it can lead to\u00a0esophagitis\u00a0(an inflamed lining of the esophagus). If esophagitis becomes severe, your esophagus might narrow. This can cause bleeding or trouble swallowing. If you get more than occasional heartburn, it may be a symptom of something more serious.

In extreme cases, heatstroke can kill you.\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion are:\nIn addition to these symptoms, warning signs of heatstroke also include:\nHeat-related illnesses occur when your body can\u2019t keep itself cool.

Small bumps may form, and you may feel some \u201cprickly,\u201d tingling pain.\nThe rash occurs most often in hot, humid weather. Anyone can get it, and it is most common in infants and young children.\nHeat rash usually looks like a cluster of pimples or small blisters.

If your pores cannot clear out the sweat, you may get a rash.\nHeat rash often happens when it is hot and humid outside. Having a high body temperature, being overdressed, or being in a hot environment can also cause it. Babies who are bundled in too much clothing are most likely to get heat rash. People who are not used to hot weather may also get it more easily.\nThere are no tests for heat rash. Your doctor can diagnose it just by looking at it.

It is a version ofpreeclampsia, another pregnancy condition that causeshigh blood pressure. It causes blood and liver problems in the mother. HELLP stands for the 3 indicators of the syndrome:\nThis illness can start quickly. It most often occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy (thethird trimester). It can also start soon after you have your baby. Women who have HELLP syndrome may have bleeding problems, liver problems, and\u00a0blood pressure problems. Any of these can hurt both the mother and the baby.\nThe symptoms of HELLP syndrome include:\nRarely, you may notice bleeding that doesn\u2019t stop easily, including from your nose, gums, or other places. Seizures or convulsions can happen but are also rare.\nMany healthy pregnant women also have some of these symptoms late in pregnancy. It may be hard to know for sure if you have HELLP syndrome. Call your doctor right away if you\u2019re experiencing these symptoms.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes HELLP syndrome. They also can\u2019t predict who will get it. Any pregnant woman may get this illness.\nMost women who will get sick have high blood pressure or preeclampsia before they get HELLP syndrome. You can get HELLP syndrome even if your blood pressure is normal.\nYou\u2019re more likely to get HELLP syndrome if you\u2019re white and older than 34 years of age. You are at higher risk if you\u2019ve had children before or if you had a problem with a past pregnancy.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. They will check for tenderness in your abdomen, especially the upper right side. They will check for an enlarged liver, swollen legs, and high blood pressure. These are all signs that you could have HELLP syndrome.\nYour doctor will likely order blood tests. These will show if your liver enzymes are high or your blood platelet count is low. These are common indicators of HELLP syndrome.\nThere is no way to prevent this illness. The best thing you can do is see your doctor regularly. Tell them about any symptoms you are having at every prenatal visit.\nIf you have HELLP syndrome during one pregnancy, you are more likely have it again during your next pregnancy. The illness is usually less severe the second time. You are also more likely to have HELLP syndrome if you had preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy.\nThe main treatment for HELLP is to deliver your baby as soon as possible. This may have to be done before your due date. This means your baby may be born prematurely.\nComplications from HELLP can develop quickly, putting both you and your baby in danger. If you aren\u2019t too sick, your doctor may wait a few days before delivering your baby. They can give you corticosteroid medicines.

Rarely, the illness can be fatal. Most women who have this illness start to get better a couple of days after their babies are born.\nIf you are diagnosed early, you will likely be fine.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition involving red blood cells and your kidneys. HUS happens after you get an infection in your digestive system. The infection makes toxins that destroy red blood cells. These damaged cells block the kidneys\u2019 filtering system and can cause your kidneys to fail.\nFor you to be diagnosed with HUS, the infection must cause 3 problems:\nMost cases of HUS happen after someone has become infected withE. coli\u00a0bacteria.\u00a0E. coli\u00a0is a common\u00a0bacterium that people normally have in their digestive tract. But certain strains produce the toxins that destroy the red blood cells and damage your kidneys.\nAnyone can get HUS, but it is more common in children and older adults. Many people who get an\u00a0E. coli\u00a0infection do not develop HUS.\nThe first symptoms of HUS are vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea might have blood in it. Around 5 to 10 days after the diarrhea starts, you or your child might develop signs of anemia. Anemia happens when you don\u2019t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your cells. Symptoms include:\nLater, more symptoms may appear, such as:\nCall your doctor right away if you or your child have bloody diarrhea plus decreased urine output, unexplained bruises, unusual bleeding, or extreme fatigue.\nMost cases of HUS occur after an\u00a0E. coli\u00a0infection. You can catch an\u00a0E. coli\u00a0infection by:\nHealthy beef and dairy cattle may carry\u00a0E. coli\u00a0in their intestines. When the animals are slaughtered and the meat is ground, the\u00a0E. coli\u00a0bacteria can mix into the meat. Cooking the meat usually kills the bacteria.\nThe most common cause of an\u00a0E. coli\u00a0infection is from eating undercooked ground beef. You can be infected with\u00a0E. coli\u00a0if you don\u2019t use a high enough temperature to cook your beef, or if you don\u2019t cook it long enough. When you eat undercooked beef, the bacteria go into your stomach and intestines.\nPonds and lakes can become contaminated with\u00a0E. coli. If you come into contact with this water, you can get\u00a0E. coli. Sometimes water that has the bacteria is accidentally used to irrigate crops. This can contaminate fruits and vegetables.\nThe bacteria can also pass from person to person in day care centers and nursing homes. If you have this infection, you should wash your hands well with soap after going to the bathroom. If you don\u2019t, you can give the bacteria to other people when you touch things, especially food.\nOther less common causes of HUS include the use of certain medicines, certain infections, and pregnancy.\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam. They will order lab work, including blood and urine tests. These tests will look for signs of anemia and kidney failure. More advanced tests include a stool culture or a kidney biopsy.\nIf you or your child are infected with\u00a0E. coli, there\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent it from developing into HUS. The key is to avoid the\u00a0E. coli\u00a0infection. To lower your risk of being infected with\u00a0E. coli, follow these rules:\nThose at highest risk of developing HUS are children under 5 and adults over 75.\nMost people who become infected with\u00a0E. coli\u00a0won\u2019t get HUS. If you or your child do, you will need to go to the hospital. Your doctor will want to watch your kidney function and make sure you keep enough fluids in your body.\nSome of the treatment you or your child might need include:\nMost people who are diagnosed with HUS make a full recovery. But it\u2019s a serious illness. If you or your child have significant damage to your kidneys, you may need regular transfusions or dialysis. Left untreated, HUS can cause death.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHemorrhoids are swollen or inflamed veins in your rectum or around your anus. They are very common, especially in people who are pregnant. The type of hemorrhoid you have depends on where it occurs.\nIf you have a hemorrhoid, you may feel a tender lump on the edge of your anus. You may also see blood in the toilet or on toilet paper after a bowel movement. You may feel pain or itchiness in that area. Pain is most likely to occur with bowel movements (especially hard stools) or strenuous activities, like lifting something heavy.\nHemorrhoids are caused by increased pressure in the veins of your anus or rectum. One of the main causes is straining when you\u2019re trying to have a bowel movement. This may happen if you\u2019reconstipatedor havediarrhea. It may also happen if you sit on the toilet too long. Hemorrhoids are also caused by obesity, heavy lifting, or any other activity that causes you to strain.\nIt\u2019s often possible to identify hemorrhoids if you feel or see a lump, especially if outside the anus. A doctor can perform a rectal exam to confirm internal hemorrhoids. They will use a gloved, lubricated finger to feel in and around your rectum. An additional procedure may be needed for a better evaluation. During a sigmoidoscopy, the doctor will insert a small camera to look inside your rectum. During an anoscopy, a small instrument called an anoscope is inserted a few inches into the anus to examine the anal canal.\nIt\u2019s important to see your doctor if you notice bleeding from your rectum. You need to make sure the cause is hemorrhoids and not some other problem. Bleeding from your rectum or anus or bloody stools may be a sign of something more serious such as cancer.\nHemorrhoids are a common problem, but not always preventable. People whose parents had hemorrhoids may be more likely to get them. Pregnant women often get them because of the strain from carrying the baby and giving birth. Being overweight or standing or lifting too much can make hemorrhoids worse.\nMost of the time, symptoms go away on their own after a few days. If not, treatments at home focus on relieving the pain. Talk to your doctor before using hemorrhoid medicine.\nHere are some things you can do to help ease your symptoms:\nPainful hemorrhoids usually stop hurting in 1 to 2 weeks. Talk to your doctor if the pain continues or if the hemorrhoids persist. Rubber band ligation can be used to treat internal hemorrhoids. It involves placing a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. This stops the flow of blood to the area and the hemorrhoid fades away. Internal hemorrhoids can be destroyed by injecting them with a chemical. You may need a hemorrhoidectomy (surgical removal of the hemorrhoid) if internal hemorrhoids are prolapsed or very large.\nHemorrhoid symptoms may come and go.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHenoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) is a rare disease that causes the\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels in your skin to become irritated and swollen. This\u00a0inflammation\u00a0is called\u00a0vasculitis. When the blood vessels bleed, you get a\u00a0rash called\u00a0purpura. HSP can affect blood vessels in the\u00a0bowel and the kidneys as well.\nHSP causes a skin rash called purpura. It looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots. The rash can occur on your buttocks, around your elbows, or on your legs and feet. In addition to the rash, HSP can cause:\nPossible complications include:\nHSP symptoms usually last about 4 to 6 weeks. If the blood vessels in your bowel and the kidneys get inflamed, you may bleed when you have a bowel movement or urinate. Serious kidney problems do not happen often but can occur. If you or your child has symptoms of HSP, see your doctor. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of your bowel calledintussusceptioncan occur. This creates a blockage in your intestines that may need surgery.\nThe exact cause of HSP is unknown. Experts believe a person\u2019s body develops excessive inflammation directed at certain blood vessels in the body. It could be triggered by a bacterial or viral infection, such as an upper respiratory infection. Allergic reactions to medicines, vaccinations, food, or insect bites could cause it. Exposure to chemicals or cold weather is another possible trigger. You may catch an infection from someone that caused HSP, but HSP itself isn\u2019t contagious.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. HSP can be diagnosed if you have two or more symptoms. The doctor may do a skin biopsy and/or blood and urine test. They also can do additional tests to rule out other conditions.\nDoctors do not know how to prevent HSP. The disease is more common in boys than in girls. Children 2 to 11 years of age are more likely to be affected, but adults can get it too.\nThere is no specific treatment for HSP. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help you feel better. Antibiotics can treat a bacterial infection that may have triggered the disease. HSP often goes away without treatment. Anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen help with swelling and joint pain. Steroids, such as prednisone, can help treat severe joint and stomach pain.\nUsually, HSP does not cause lasting problems and gets better on its own. About half of people who have HSP once will get it again. In serious cases, long-term kidney damage is possible. Your doctor may want to do routine urine samples to check for kidney problems. Be sure to see your doctor regularly during this time.\nNational Institutes of Health: MedlinePlus, Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura\nLast Updated:April 19, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

But when the liver is inflamed, it doesn\u2019t do a good job of getting rid of waste products. This causes waste products to build up in your\u00a0blood\u00a0and tissues.\nMany different things can cause hepatitis. The most common cause of hepatitis is infection with one of the 5 hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E). Lack of blood supply to the liver,\u00a0poison, autoimmune disorders, excessive alcohol use, liver injury, and taking certain medicines can also cause hepatitis. Less commonly, viral infections such asmononucleosisorcytomegaloviruscan cause hepatitis.\nThere are 2 main kinds of hepatitis: acute hepatitis and\u00a0chronic\u00a0hepatitis. Most people get over the acute hepatitis in a few days or weeks. Sometimes, however, the inflammation doesn\u2019t go away. When the inflammation doesn\u2019t go away in 6 months, the person has chronic hepatitis.\nHepatitis A (Hep A) is liver inflammation caused by the hepatitis A\u00a0virus. Hepatitis A is different from other types of hepatitis. It isn\u2019t typically as serious ashepatitis Bor C, and it doesn\u2019t usually develop into chronic hepatitis or\u00a0cirrhosis\u00a0(late-stage scarring of the liver).\nHepatitis A is very\u00a0contagious. This means that you can easily catch the\u00a0virus\u00a0from someone or give it to someone else. You are most\u00a0contagious\u00a0soon after you are infected and before symptoms appear. Adults who are otherwise healthy are no longer contagious 2 weeks after the illness begins. Children and people who have a weak\u00a0immune\u00a0system may be contagious for up to 6 months.\nThe hepatitis A virus is usually in your system for 2 to 6 weeks before symptoms appear. Some people never have symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they can appear suddenly and may include:\nYoung children are likely to have mild cases of hepatitis A, while symptoms in older children and adults are more likely to be severe.\nHepatitis A is caused by infection with the hepatitis A virus. You get the virus when you unknowingly eat a small amount of infected\u00a0feces. This can happen through person-to-person contact, or through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\nA person can have and spread hepatitis A, even if that person does not have any symptoms. You are most likely to get hepatitis A from another person when:\nYou can also get infected with hepatitis A by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Contaminated food and water are more common in developing countries. When traveling in areas where hepatitis A is common, avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and untreated water.\nSee your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of hepatitis A. They can do a blood test to see if you have the disease.\nThere is no specific medicine to treat or cure hepatitis A. If you have the virus, your body will eventually get rid of the infection on its own. You probably will feel sick for a few months before you begin to feel better.\nTo help your liver heal, you should get plenty of rest, eat a balanced\u00a0diet\u00a0and avoid alcohol and acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol). Talk with your doctor before you take any\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements. Alcohol, acetaminophen, and certain other medicines, vitamins, and supplements can cause more damage to your liver.\nYou may need to stay in the hospital for a short time if you get dehydrated, have severe pain, suddenly become confused, or develop bleeding problems.\nThe best way to protect yourself against hepatitis A is to get the\u00a0vaccine. The hepatitis A\u00a0vaccination\u00a0is recommended for all children older than age 1. It begins to protect you only 4 weeks after you are vaccinated. A 6- to 12-month booster is required for long-term protection. Ask your doctor if the vaccination is right for you.\nYou should also wash your hands with soap and warm water before and after cooking, after using the bathroom, and after changing diapers.\nWash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating and avoid raw or undercooked meat and fish.\nYou are at higher risk for hepatitis A if you:\nOnce you recover from hepatitis A, you develop antibodies that protect you from the virus for life, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAmerican Liver Foundation: Hepatitis A\nLast Updated:July 1, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The\u00a0virus\u00a0is usually spread from person to person through contact with blood and/or body fluids of someone who has the infection.\nSymptoms of hepatitis B can range from mild to severe. If you have a mild case of hepatitis, you may not even realize that you have it. It may not cause any symptoms, or may only cause symptoms similar to the stomach flu. The symptoms of hepatitis B may include:\nHepatitis B is caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus. You can get the virus if you have unprotected sexual contact with an infected partner. People who use\u00a0intravenous\u00a0(IV) drugs can get hepatitis B when they share needles with someone who has the virus. Health care workers (such as nurses, lab technicians, and doctors) can get hepatitis B if they are accidentally stuck with a needle that was used on an infected patient. The infection can also be passed from a mother to her baby during childbirth. You are also more likely to get hepatitis B if you travel to areas of the world where hepatitis B is common.\nHepatitis B cannot be transmitted through casual contact. For example, you cannot get hepatitis B by hugging or shaking hands with someone who is infected.\nBlood tests are used to\u00a0diagnose\u00a0hepatitis B. Blood tests can tell your doctor whether your liver is working properly, and they can also be used to monitor your condition during treatment.\nYour doctor may want to look at your liver with an ultrasound exam or X-rays. You may also need a liver biopsy. During a liver biopsy, a small piece of the liver is removed and looked at under a microscope. A liver biopsy can help your doctor diagnose your illness and see the condition of your liver directly.\nThe best way to prevent hepatitis B is to always have protected sex (use a condom) and, if you use intravenous (IV) drugs, avoid sharing needles.\nA vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis B. The CDC recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for:\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is safe and administered in either a two-dose or three-dose series, depending on the brand. The three-dose series is given over six months, while the two-dose version is spaced about one month apart. To ensure full protection, it is essential to complete the entire series.\nThis vaccine should be given to people who are at high risk for this illness, such as healthcare workers, all children, people who travel to areas where the infection is widespread, drug users, and those who have multiple sex partners.\nIf you have acute (short-lived) hepatitis B, your body may be able to fight the infection on its own. This means you might not need treatment. Your doctor will help you manage your symptoms and monitor your condition while your body works to clear the hepatitis B from your system.\nIf you have chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B, your family doctor will probably refer you to a gastroenterologist or other subspecialist who treats people who have chronic liver problems. There are a number of medical treatments available that are often successful. These include treatment with antiviral medicines.\nTreatment may take a year or more, depending on the severity of the infection and the response to treatment.\nIn some people, chronic hepatitis can lead tocirrhosisof the liver. Cirrhosis occurs when the liver cells die and are replaced by scar\u00a0tissue\u00a0and fat. The damaged areas of the liver stop working and can\u2019t cleanse the body of wastes. Cirrhosis can lead to liver failure and even liver cancer.\nIf you have hepatitis B, you are also susceptible to hepatitis D (also called delta virus). Hepatitis D can only develop in people who already have hepatitis B. It can make your symptoms of hepatitis B or liver disease worse. It is spread through contact with infected blood or other body fluids of people who have hepatitis D.\nRisk of chronic infection caused by hepatitis B is related to your age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC). \u201cApproximately 90% of infected infants become chronically infected compared with 2%-6% of adult,\u201d reports the CDC.\nChronic hepatitis B infection can lead to serious health issues. If you have it, you should be monitored regularly by a doctor. This means you should check in with your doctor at least once or twice a year. Some people who have chronic hepatitis B infection require medicine, but others do not. Your doctor can discuss treatment options with you.\nIf you have chronic hepatitis B infection, it will likely stay in your blood and liver for a lifetime, according to The Hepatitis B Foundation. This means that you could pass the virus to others, even if you don\u2019t feel sick.\n\u201cThe most important thing to remember is that hepatitis B is a chronic medical condition (such as diabetes and high blood pressure) that can be successfully managed if you take good care of your health and your liver,\u201d reports the Hepatitis B Foundation. \u201cYou should expect to live a long, full life.\u201d\nAmerican Liver Foundation\nThe Hepatitis B Foundation\nLast Updated:May 14, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

If you have hepatitis C, you need to be watched carefully by a doctor because it can lead to\u00a0cirrhosis\u00a0(scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. Cirrhosis from hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver failure and needing a liver transplant.\nMany people don\u2019t feel sick or have symptoms of hepatitis C until they\u2019ve had the\u00a0virus\u00a0for a long time. Some people have mild, flu-like symptoms anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months after they are first infected with the virus.

It can also be transmitted by needles used for tattooing or body piercing. In rare cases, hepatitis C can be passed from a mother to her unborn baby. This virus can be transmitted through sex and sharing razors or toothbrushes. These occurrences are also rare. Many times, the cause of hepatitis C is never found.\nYour doctor will determine if you have hepatitis C by using a blood test. The test is called the Hepatitis C Antibody Test. The test checks your blood for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus. If antibodies are detected, it means you have been exposed to hepatitis C. If your viral load is positive, it means you are currently actively infected with hepatitis C. A negative test means that you do not have hepatitis C antibodies and likely do not have hepatitis C.\nThe only way to prevent hepatitis C is to avoid coming in contact with an infected person\u2019s blood. Always have protected sex (use a condom). Don\u2019t do intravenous (IV) drugs. Don\u2019t share personal care items (such as razors or toothbrushes) with a person who has hepatitis C. If you\u2019re a health care worker, follow your workplace\u2019s standard safety practices.\nNo, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C. (There are vaccines for\u00a0hepatitis A\u00a0and hepatitis B.) If you have hepatitis C, your doctor may want you to get the\u00a0vaccines for hepatitis A and B. If you have hepatitis C, you are more likely to catch hepatitis A or hepatitis B. Catching these viruses would cause more damage to your liver.\nYes, once you have hepatitis C, you can always give it to someone else. If you have hepatitis C, you cannot donate blood. You should avoid sharing personal items like razors and toothbrushes. It is very rare to pass hepatitis C in these ways, but it can happen. Always use a\u00a0condom\u00a0when you have sex. If you have hepatitis C, your sexual partners should be tested to see if they also have it.\nTalk to your doctor first if you want to have children. The virus isn\u2019t spread easily from a mother to her unborn baby. But it is possible, so you need to take precautions. However, if you\u2019re trying to have a baby, do not have sex during your menstrual cycle. The hepatitis C virus spreads more easily in menstrual blood.\nTreatment of hepatitis C has improved over the years. Newer medicines have shorter treatment cycles and fewer side effects. Some of these treatments have the potential to even cure the disease.\nMost recently, the Food & Drug Administration approved a pill that is a combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (brand name: Mavyret). It has one of the shortest treatment cycles. Treatment dosage and length of treatment cycle depends on stage of disease. The shortest treatment cycle (8 weeks) is for people who have hepatitis C but have not been treated for it and do not have cirrhosis of the liver. It can treat all types of hepatitis C.\nThere are a number of other medications approved for treatment of hepatitis C. Talk to your doctor to determine which is best for you.\nYour treatment plan for hepatitis C will depend on many factors. These include what type of hepatitis you have, whether you have cirrhosis of the liver, and your stage of disease. You and your doctor will decide on the best plan.\nGood health habits are essential for those who have hepatitis C. You should especially avoid alcohol and medicines and drugs that can put\u00a0stress\u00a0on the liver. You should eat a\u00a0healthy diet\u00a0and start\u00a0exercising regularly. Your family doctor can help you plan a\u00a0diet\u00a0that is healthy and practical.\nTalk to your doctor about any medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicine. Many medicines, including acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), are broken down by the liver. Because of this, they may increase the speed of liver damage. You should also limit alcohol use. It speeds the progression of liver diseases like hepatitis C. An occasional alcoholic drink may be okay, but check with your doctor first.\nCommon side effects for some treatments for hepatitis C may include the following:\nSide effects are usually worst during the first few weeks of treatment. They become less severe over time. If you are having trouble dealing with the side effects of your medicine, talk to your doctor. He or she can suggest ways to relieve some of the side effects. For example, if your medicine makes you feel nauseated, it may help to take it right before you go to sleep.\nThe choice is up to you and your doctor. The decision to use drug therapy can be hard to make because of the potential side effects. Your doctor will closely monitor your symptoms and the amount of the virus in your body. He or she will also consider your overall health. This includes looking at blood test results. All are important factors to consider before you and your doctor start drug treatment for your hepatitis C.\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of the hepatitis C virus in your blood to levels that can\u2019t be detected after 24 weeks of therapy. The amount of the virus in your blood is called your viral load. At the end of your treatment, your doctor will need to measure your viral load and find out how healthy your liver is. He or she may repeat many of the same tests that were done when you were first diagnosed with hepatitis C.\nIf your blood has so few copies of the virus that tests can\u2019t measure them, the virus is said to be undetectable. If it stays undetectable for at least 6 months after your treatment is finished, you have what is called a sustained virologic response (SVR). People who have an SVR have a good chance of avoiding serious liver problems in the future.\nTreatment may not reduce your viral load. You may not have an SVR after treatment. If that\u2019s true, your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you. For example, if 1 round of treatment did not decrease your viral load enough, your doctor may recommend a second round. Even if treatment doesn\u2019t keep you from having active liver disease, lowering your viral load and controlling chronic liver inflammation may help you feel better for a longer time.\nCoping with hepatitis C isn\u2019t easy. You may feel sad, scared, or angry. You may not believe you have the disease. These feelings are normal, but they shouldn\u2019t keep you from living your daily life. If they do \u2014 or if they last a long time \u2014 you may be suffering from depression. People who are depressed have most or all of the following symptoms nearly every day, all day, for 2 weeks or longer:\nTalk to your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms. Your doctor can help by recommending a support group or a therapist. He or she may also prescribe a medicine for you to take.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Viral Hepatitis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hepatitis C\nLast Updated:June 4, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHereditary hemochromatosis is a disease in which your body has high levels of iron. That means you have too much iron. It\u2019s often called \u201ciron overload.\u201d Your body can\u2019t get rid of the extra iron, and it ends up damaging your tissues and organs. It can lead to liver damage, arthritis, heart problems, anddiabetes.\nThere are four types of hereditary hemochromatosis:\nSymptoms are different for every person. And some people with the disease don\u2019t have symptoms at all. Men have symptoms more often than women. Most people don\u2019t have symptoms until they are older. Symptoms can change depending on the amount of iron you get from your food, iron pills, alcohol, and infections.\nYou may feel tired. You may have stomach and joint pain. Your sex drive may be reduced. Women may have abnormal periods or early menopause. Your skin may turn bronze or gray. It can cause cirrhosis (permanent liver damage),diabetes, and heart problems.\nHereditary hemochromatosis is genetic. It\u2019s caused by genes, usually the HFE gene. If you have a relative with the disease, talk with your doctor about getting a blood test to see if you have high levels of iron or if you have the disease. If your lab results are normal, you may need to repeat the blood test every few years.\nHereditary hemochromatosis can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms look like other diseases. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, do a physical exam, and order blood tests to check the amount of iron in your blood and liver. Tell your doctor if you have a relative with the disease.\nA blood test also can tell if you have the HFE gene. There are benefits of knowing if you have the HFE gene. However, there are risks, too. It may affect your opportunity to get health insurance. That\u2019s why HFE gene testing isn\u2019t usually recommended for children younger than 18.\nHereditary hemochromatosis can\u2019t be prevented. But early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms. It also can reduce the chance of you getting more serious health conditions. For example, if you\u2019re diagnosed and treated before you get cirrhosis or diabetes, your life expectancy should be normal.\nOther things you can do to improve reduce symptoms include:\nTreatment involves reducing your iron levels. Usually, this is accomplished by removing blood from your body. It involves inserting a needle into a vein to remove extra red blood cells from your blood. This is called phlebotomy and is just like donating blood. You will likely need to have this done on a regular basis. Your doctor will tell you how often, though it\u2019s usually once or twice a week until your iron levels return to normal.\nIn some cases, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to lower your iron levels. Your doctor will decide which treatment is best for you.\nIf you have hereditary hemochromatosis, you might need further tests to check for other conditions. For example, you may need a liver biopsy to see if your liver is damaged. Liver damage is called cirrhosis. A liver biopsy involves a doctor removing a small piece of your liver and looking at it under a microscope. If you have cirrhosis, you have a higher risk for getting liver cancer. If the cirrhosis is serious, it may require a liver transplant.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hereditary Hemochromatosis\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nA hernia is a tear in your muscle or tissue that allows part of your insides to bulge out. It can be a bulge of an internal organ or your intestines. Sometimes you can see the hernia, depending on its location and size. Certain activities can worsen the condition, like bending over or lifting heavy objects.\nHernias usually occur in your groin.Inguinal herniasare in the groin and are mostly found in men.Femoral herniasare in the upper thigh near the groin. These are much less common and are mostly found in women. The abdomen is another frequent hernia location. If hernias occur in the midline of the abdomen, they are calledventral hernias. If they occur at the site of a previous surgical scar, they areincisional hernias.\u00a0Umbilical herniasoccur in association with your belly button and are found more commonly in babies.\nIn ahiatal hernia, part of the upper stomach comes through an opening in your diaphragm, or chest wall. This hernia can cause acid to leak from your stomach into your esophagus. The esophagus is a tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Effects of hiatal hernias include heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux.\nHernias also can be birth defects. Acongenital diaphragmatic herniaoccurs when your diaphragm doesn\u2019t form right. This can create space for your stomach to move into your chest. Sometimes doctors find the defect when you\u2019re a baby. Other times, they may not find it until later in life. In severe cases, your stomach can crowd your chest organs, like your lungs and heart. Surgery can help repair your diaphragm so that you don\u2019t develop other problems, such as breathing difficulties.\nYou might not have symptoms, depending on the type of hernia you have. One common sign of a hernia is the visible bulge in the affected area. Other reported symptoms include pressure, a cough,heartburn, and difficulty swallowing. Severe hernia symptoms are shooting pain, vomiting, andconstipation. If your hernia becomes soft or you can\u2019t push it in, go to the emergency room. Hernias can cause your organs or tissue to become infected, blocked, or strangled.\nThe various types of hernias can have different causes. In general, a hernia starts with pressure on an organ or your intestines. A hernia forms when this pressure happens in the same area as a weakened muscle or tissue. Some people are born with weak muscles or tissue that isn\u2019t fully developed. However, most people get hernias as their bodies age and their muscles weaken.\nYou also can get a hernia, or worsen an existing one, from certain movements and habits. These include:\nYour doctor usually can detect a hernia in a physical exam. They also might order tests to further assess your condition and the cause. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to scan your body. A barium X-ray takes images of your digestive area and intestines. A computed tomography (CT) scan also uses X-rays to get pictures. An endoscopy studies your esophagus and stomach using a small camera at the end of a flexible tube.\nYou can\u2019t always prevent hernias. Some are caused by genetics that you can\u2019t avoid. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect. You also can be born with weak muscles that make it easier to get a hernia later in life.\nYou can reduce your chance of getting some types of hernias by:\nTreatment options depend on the type of hernia you have and your state of health. At first, your doctor may suggest monitoring your condition for changes. This may also include making changes to your diet, activity, and habits. Medicines may help lessen hernia symptoms.\nIf the hernia doesn\u2019t improve or worsens, your doctor will discuss surgery. There are two types of surgical treatment. Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive. Your doctor or a surgeon will make small cuts in the affected area to fix the hernia. Open repair surgery requires a larger cut to make the repair.\nAs part of surgery, your doctor might use surgical mesh. This is considered a medical device. The purpose of surgical mesh is to act as a support for your weakened muscle or tissue. Mesh products can be synthetic or made from animal tissue. Surgical mesh comes in two forms. Temporary mesh is one that your body will absorb. It works with your muscles and tissue to strengthen over time. Permanent mesh is meant to provide long-term muscle support.\nMost types of hernias can be treated and corrected. However, it\u2019s common for hernias to come back. In some cases, surgical mesh can help reduce this chance. Talk to your doctor or surgeon about the best treatment option for you and how to prevent recurring hernias.\nPeople who have a congenital diaphragmatic hernia may have other health issues.

    "article_title": "What is a herniated disc?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nA herniated disc is a painful medical condition that occurs in your spine (backbone). Your spine is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between each of these vertebrae are soft discs. These discs act like cushions and keep the bones of the spine in place. They also let your backbone move so you can bend and stretch.\nThese discs can weaken over time. Sometimes, they even rupture. The soft, jelly-like center of the disc pushes outward. When this happens, it\u2019s called a herniated disc. (The word \u201cherniate\u201d means to bulge or to stick out.) This is also called a ruptured disc, a slipped\u00a0disc, or a bulging disc. These discs become a problem when the center of the disc pushes against a nerve or the spinal cord. This causes mild to severe pain.\nHerniated discs are most common in the\u00a0lumbar\u00a0spine\u2014the lower part of your backbone, between the bottom of your ribs and your hips. They can also happen in your cervical area (your neck). The discs in your upper-to-mid back (thoracic area) are rarely involved.\nWhen part of a disc presses on a\u00a0nerve, it can cause pain. Often the pain occurs on one side of your body. Where the pain is located depends on where the herniated disc is located.\nA slipped disc in the cervical section of your spine can cause pain in your neck and arms. You could experience:\nA slipped disc in the lumbar part of your spine can cause pain in the back and legs. It is often referred to as sciatica. This is because the disc pushes on the sciatic nerve, which runs down your leg. Symptoms include:\nHow bad the symptoms are depends on how much of the disc is pressing on the nerve. The pain from a herniated disc is usually worse when you\u2019re active and gets better when you\u2019re resting. Coughing, sneezing, sitting, driving, and bending forward may make the pain worse. These movements put more pressure on the nerve. People who have painful herniated discs often try to change positions to reduce the pain.\nAs you age, the discs in your spine weaken and become flatter (less cushiony). If a disc becomes too weak, the outer part may tear. The inside part of the disc then pushes through the tear and presses on the nerves beside it. You could be at higher risk of getting a herniated disc if you:\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and give you an exam. He or she will check you for numbness, weakness, reflexes changes, and pain. They will probably order X-rays or other pictures to see if you have a herniated disc. These could include a CT scan or an MRI. There are also nerve tests your doctor can order. These can determine what nerves are involved, if there is nerve damage, and how well your nerves are conducting feelings.\nThere\u2019s not much you can do to prevent a herniated disc. It is often caused by natural aging and deterioration. To keep your discs and back in good working order, follow a healthy lifestyle:\nThere are several steps that can be taken to treat a herniated disc.\nMedicine\u2013\u00a0Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) or prescribe a pain medicine. They may also give you muscle relaxants to relieve muscle spasms that can increase pain.\nPhysical therapy\u2013\u00a0Certain exercises can be helpful for a herniated disc. Exercise can make your back and stomach muscles stronger. This will ease the pressure on your disc and make you hurt less. Ask your doctor about exercises for your back. Your doctor may want you to see a physical therapist to learn about safe back exercises.\nEpidural steroid injections\u2013\u00a0If medicine and physical therapy aren\u2019t helping, your doctor may suggest steroid injections. These are shots of steroids that are injected directly into your spine. The steroids reduce the swelling around the disc and can lessen the pain. Sometimes 1 injection is enough. Often, they are given in a series of shots over a few weeks. These injections can bring relief for weeks or months at a time.\nSurgery\u2013\u00a0If nothing else is helping your pain, your doctor may suggest surgery. He or she will remove all or part of the damaged disc so it no longer presses on the nerve.\nHome treatment\u2013\u00a0You can practice good home care to treat your disc, as well. Good posture can help your back by reducing the pressure on your disc. Focus on standing up straight, sitting straight, and lifting with your back straight. Follow these tips to do what you can on your own to ease your symptoms:\nYour chances of getting better are good. Most people who have a herniated disc are better in about 4 weeks. Sometimes it takes longer. If you still have pain or numbness after 4 to 6 weeks, or if you feel worse, talk with your doctor. Sometimes it takes surgery to relieve pain.\nCall your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:\nThese could be signs of complications or a more serious problem.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Herniated Disc\nLast Updated:June 23, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The most common viruses are:\nGenital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Once you\u2019re infected, you have the virus for the rest of your life.\nMany people who get herpes never have symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms are mild and are mistaken for another skin condition. Symptoms of genital herpes may include:\nDuring the first outbreak (called primary herpes), you may experience flu-like symptoms. These include body aches,\u00a0fever, and headache. Many people who have a herpes infection will have outbreaks of sores and symptoms from time to time. Symptoms are usually less severe than the primary outbreak. The frequency of outbreaks also tends to decrease over time.\nOnce you have been infected with the virus, you\u2019ll go through different stages of infection.\nMany people have blisters and sores that come back after the first herpes attack goes away. This is called a recurrence. Usually, the symptoms aren\u2019t as bad as they were during the first attack.\nStress, being sick, or being tired may start a recurrence. Being in the sun or having your menstrual period may also cause a recurrence. Another way you may know a recurrence is about to happen is if you feel itching, tingling, or pain in the places where you were first infected.\nThe virus that causes genital herpes is usually spread from one person to another during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. The virus can enter your body through a break in your skin. It can also enter through the skin of your mouth, penis, vagina, urinary tract opening,\u00a0or anus.\nHerpes is most easily spread when blisters or sores can be seen on the infected person. But it can be spread at any time, even when the person who has herpes isn\u2019t experiencing any symptoms. Herpes can also be spread from one place on your body to another. If you touch sores on your genitals, you can carry the virus on your fingers. Then you can pass it onto other parts of your body, including your mouth or eyes.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and look at the sores. He or she can do a culture of the fluid from a sore and test it for herpes. Blood tests or other tests on the fluid from a blister can also be done.\nThe best way to prevent getting herpes is to not have sex with anyone who has the virus. It can be spread even when the person who has it isn\u2019t showing any symptoms. If your partner has herpes, there is no way of knowing for sure that you won\u2019t get it.\nIf you are infected, there is no time that is completely safe to have sex and not spread herpes. Youmusttell your sex partner if you have herpes. You should avoid having sex if you have any sores. Herpes can spread from one person to another very easily when sores are present.\nYou should use condoms every time you have sex. They can help reduce the risk of spreading herpes, but it\u2019s still possible to spread or get herpes if you\u2019re using a condom.\nIf you think you have herpes, see your doctor as soon as possible. It\u2019s easier to diagnose when there are sores. You can start treatment sooner and perhaps have less pain with the infection.\nThere\u2019s no cure for herpes. But medicines can help. They may be provided as a pill, cream, or a shot. Medicines such as acyclovir and valacyclovir fight the herpes virus. They can speed up healing and lessen the pain of herpes for many people. They can be used to treat a primary outbreak or a recurrent one.\nIf the medicines are being used to treat a recurrence, they should be started as soon as you feel tingling, burning, or itching. They can also be taken every day to prevent recurrences.\nIt\u2019s important to avoid getting herpes during pregnancy. If your partner has herpes and you don\u2019t have it, be sure to always use condoms during sexual\u00a0intercourse. Your partner could pass the infection to you even if they are not currently experiencing an outbreak. If there are visible sores, avoid having sex completely until the sores have healed.\nIf you\u2019re pregnant and have genital herpes, or if you have ever had sex with someone who had it, tell your doctor. The doctor will give you an antiviral medicine to start taking toward the end of your pregnancy. This will make it less likely that you will have an outbreak at or near the time you deliver your baby.\nUnderstand that you can pass herpes to your baby if you have an active genital herpes infection at or near the time of delivery. When the baby passes through the birth canal, it may come in contact with sores and become infected with the virus. This can cause brain damage, blindness, or even death in newborns.\nYour doctor will most likely deliver your baby by C-section if you do have an outbreak of genital herpes at the time of delivery. With a C-section, the baby won\u2019t go through the birth canal and be exposed to the virus. This lessens the risk of giving herpes to your baby.\nIt\u2019s common to feel guilty or ashamed when you are diagnosed with herpes. You may feel your sex life is ruined or that someone you thought you could trust has hurt you. You may feel sad or upset. Talk to your family doctor about how you\u2019re feeling.\nKeep in mind that herpes is very common. About 1 in 6 adults have it. Herpes may get less severe as time goes by. You can help protect your sex partner by not having sex during outbreaks and by using condoms at other times.\nCenters for Disease Control: Genital Herpes\u2013CDC Fact Sheet\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Genital Herpes\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women\u2019s Health: Genital Herpes\nLast Updated:September 6, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated December 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic (long-term) skin disease. HS is considered a severe form of acne. People who have it develop painful red bumps or sores in places where they grow hair. This includes the armpits, groin, genitals, and anal area. They also can occur in places where the skin rubs together. This includes between the thighs or under the breasts for women.\nThe main symptom of HS is painful red bumps. The bumps get bigger, become inflamed, and leak pus. They form large sores and blisters. HS can itch and cause a foul odor in the affected area.\nHS occurs when sweat glands and hair follicle openings become blocked. Doctors don\u2019t know why this happens. Poor hygiene does not cause this condition. It is not contagious. You cannot get it from or pass it to anyone.\nHS is more common in women than men. People who have a history of acne are at a greater risk. HS may run in families.\nIf you have any of the symptoms mentioned above, see your doctor. They can tell if you have HS by looking at the affected skin. The doctor may test a sample of your skin cells (biopsy) or pus from the bumps. This can rule out other issues and confirm the diagnosis.\nIt is difficult to prevent HS or flare-ups caused by the disease. However, obesity and smoking are related to this condition. Quitting smoking and healthy eating and exercise may help to prevent the likelihood of HS and limit flare-ups in those that have it.\nThere is no cure for HS. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. The type of treatment you receive depends on how severe your condition is. For mild cases, apply a warm compress to the affected area. Wash the area with anti-bacterial soap. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce swelling and relieve pain.\nMore severe cases may require antibiotics. These can be topical (applied to your skin) or oral (taken by mouth). Antibiotics help prevent or treat infection. For some people, HS gets worse over time. Scarring can occur in the affected area. These people may need surgery to remove the sores and scars. People who have surgery to remove HS may get it again.\nTreatment can help manage the symptoms of HS. It may help to avoid:\nTry to lose weight if you are overweight.

    "article_title": "What is high blood pressure?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nBlood pressure is the force of your blood as it flows through the arteries in your body. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, it pushes blood through your arteries. As the blood flows, it puts pressure on your artery walls. This is called blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure (also called hypertension) happens when your blood moves through your arteries at a higher pressure than normal. Many different things can cause hypertension. If your blood pressure gets too high or stays high for a long time, it can cause health problems. Uncontrolled hypertension puts you at a higher risk forstroke,heart disease,heart attack, and kidney failure.\nThere are 2 types of hypertension.\nPrimary hypertension.This is also called essential hypertension. It has no known cause, and it is the most common type of hypertension. This type of blood pressure usually takes many years to develop. It probably is a result of your lifestyle, environment, and how your body changes as you age.\nSecondary hypertension.This is when a health problem or medicine is causing your high blood pressure. Things that can cause secondary hypertension include:\nMost people who have hypertension do not have symptoms. This is why it\u2019s sometimes called \u201cthe silent killer.\u201d It is very important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.\nSome people experience headaches, nosebleeds, or shortness of breath with hypertension. However, those symptoms can mimic many other things (serious or non-serious). Usually, these symptoms occur once blood pressure has reached a dangerously high level over a period of time.\nFood, medicine, lifestyle, age, and genetics can cause hypertension. Your doctor can help you find out what might be causing yours. Common factors that can lead to hypertension include:\nHypertension is diagnosed with a blood pressure monitor. This is a common test for all doctor visits. A nurse will place a band (cuff) around your arm. The band attaches to a small pump and a meter. They will squeeze the pump. It will feel tight around your arm. Then they will stop and watch the meter. This provides the nurse with 2 numbers that make up your blood pressure. The top number is your systolic reading (the peak blood pressure when your heart is squeezing blood out). The bottom number is your diastolic reading (the pressure when your heart is filling with blood\u00ad). You may also hear the doctor or nurse say a blood pressure is \u201c120 over 80.\u201d\nThe higher your blood pressure is, the more often you need to have it checked. After age 18, have your blood pressure checked at least once every two years. Do it more often if you have had high blood pressure in the past.\nIf lifestyle factors are causing your hypertension, you can take steps to reduce your risk:\nIf your hypertension is caused by disease or the medicine you take, talk to your doctor. They may be able to prescribe a different medicine. Additionally, treating any underlying disease (such as controlling your diabetes) can help reduce your high blood pressure.\nThe best way to lower blood pressure begins with changes you can make to your lifestyle to help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease. Additionally, your doctor may prescribe medicine to lower your blood pressure. These are called antihypertensive medicines.\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure to normal levels. If changes to your lifestyle aren\u2019t enough to reduce your blood pressure to a normal level, your doctor will prescribe medicine. Medicine for treatment is often highly successful. If your blood pressure can only be controlled with medicine, you\u2019ll likely need to take the medicine for the rest of your life. It is common to need more than one medicine to help control your blood pressure. Don\u2019t stop taking the medicine without talking with your doctor. Otherwise, you may increase your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.\nControlling your hypertension is a lifelong commitment. You will always need to monitor your weight, make healthy food choices, exercise, learn to cope with stress, avoid smoking, and limit your alcohol intake. If you need medicine to control your high blood pressure, you will likely need it all your life.\nAdditionally, you will need to get used to regular blood pressure checks. Your doctor may want you to come to the office regularly. Or your doctor may ask you to check your blood pressure at home and keep track of your numbers. Some pharmacies and retail clinics have blood pressure machines on site. You can buy your own, automated arm blood pressure cuff for use at home. Your doctor may want you to check your blood pressure several times a day. Another option is to use an ambulatory (wear as you are moving about) blood pressure monitor.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: High Blood Pressure\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: High Blood Pressure\nLast Updated:August 27, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nA small percentage of pregnant women in the U.S. havehigh blood pressureat some point during their pregnancy. Some cases are mild; other cases are severe. Treatment varies depending on the type you have and how far along you are in your pregnancy.\nThere are three main types of high blood pressure during pregnancy:\nIn some cases, high blood pressure during pregnancy can cause harm to you and your baby. You may develop gestationaldiabetes. You may also experience problems with your heart or kidneys. You\u2019re also at greater risk for a stroke.\nHigh blood pressure may prevent the placenta from getting enough blood. If the placenta doesn\u2019t get enough blood, your baby doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen and food. This can cause low birth weight and premature birth.\nHigh blood pressure can also lead to placental abruption. This is when the placenta becomes unattached to the uterus. This can be a life-threatening situation to both you and your baby.\nKeep in mind that some of these symptoms are common among pregnant women and don\u2019t necessarily mean you have a problem. Talk with your doctor if you have any of the following:\nSome women have a greater risk of getting high blood pressure while they\u2019re pregnant. These include women who:\nNo one test diagnoses high blood pressure while pregnant. Instead, your doctor will take your blood pressure at each of your prenatal appointments. They will keep track of your blood pressure readings during your pregnancy and be able to spot any changes that could indicate an overall problem. They will also use urine and blood tests to watch for possible issues.\nIt can\u2019t be prevented. However, you can lower your chances of getting it by making necessary adjustments before getting pregnant. These include getting or maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.\nIf you have chronic hypertension before you get pregnant, talk with your doctor. They will look at how well your hypertension is being managed and let you know if you need to make any changes before getting pregnant.\nIf you have chronic hypertension, you may have been taking medicine for it before you became pregnant. Tell your doctor which medicine you\u2019re taking. He or she may say it\u2019s okay to continue that medicine. But if the medicine isn\u2019t safe for your baby, you may need to switch to another medicine during your pregnancy. Like with all pregnancies, your doctor will check your blood pressure and urine during your regular appointments.\nIf you have gestational hypertension, your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and urine more closely. They will do this to watch for signs of preeclampsia. Your doctor may also monitor your baby. One way to do that is with anultrasound. This is a painless test that lets your doctor see your baby inside your body.\nIf you have preeclampsia, treatment depends on where you are in relation to your due date. That\u2019s because preeclampsia often goes away after you have your baby. If you\u2019re 37 weeks or more pregnant, your doctor may suggest having the baby as soon as possible. However, if you\u2019re less than 37 weeks pregnant, your doctor may choose to monitor you even more closely than before.\nAlong with the regular urine and blood tests, you may need to take medicine to help your blood pressure. You may also need to take medicine that help prevent seizures, which can happen with preeclampsia. You may be told to stay in bed until your baby is born. You may be given a steroid shot of a medicine that will help your baby\u2019s lungs develop quicker in case your baby needs to be born early. Your baby will continue to be watched with ultrasound. Your doctor may also watch your baby\u2019s health through a heart monitor. If your preeclampsia is extremely severe, your doctor may say you need to deliver your baby right away, regardless of how close you are to your due date.\nGo to each of your prenatal visits with your doctor. This will allow them to monitor your blood pressure. Your doctor may ask you to record your blood pressure at home. They can give advice on how to do that. Your doctor will check your urine at each visit. High levels of protein in urine can be a symptom of preeclampsia.\nDiscuss all your medicines with your doctor. Also, don\u2019t start or stop taking any medicines, including over-the-counter medicines, without talking to your doctor. Some of these may affect your blood pressure.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy\nMarch of Dimes: High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy\nLast Updated:February 28, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Your body also gets cholesterol from the food you eat. This includes eggs, meats, and dairy. There is \u201cgood\u201d (HDL) cholesterol and \u201cbad\u201d (LDL) cholesterol. Too much bad cholesterol (LDL) can be bad for your health.\nGood cholesterol is known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). It removes cholesterol from the bloodstream. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol.\nIf your total cholesterol level is high because of a high LDL level, you may be at higher risk ofheart diseaseorstroke. But, if your total cholesterol level is high only because of a high HDL level, you\u2019re probably not at higher risk.\nTriglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. When you eat more calories than your body can use, it turns the extra calories into triglycerides.\nChanging your lifestyle (diet and exercise) can improve your cholesterol levels, lower LDL and triglycerides, and raise HDL.\nYour ideal cholesterol level will depend on your risk for heart disease.\nOften, there are no specific symptoms of high cholesterol. You could have high cholesterol and not know it.\nIf you have high cholesterol, your body may store the extra cholesterol in your arteries. These are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the rest of your body. A buildup of cholesterol in your arteries is known as plaque. Over time, plaque can become hard and make your arteries narrow. Large deposits of plaque can completely block an artery. Cholesterol plaques can also break apart, leading to formation of a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood.\nA blocked artery to the heart can cause a heart attack. A blocked artery to your brain can cause a stroke.\nMany people don\u2019t discover that they have high cholesterol until they suffer one of these life-threatening events. Some people find out through routine check-ups that include blood tests.\nYour liver produces cholesterol, but you also get cholesterol from food. Eating too many foods that are high in fat can increase your cholesterol level.\nBeing overweight and inactive also causes high cholesterol. If you are overweight, you most likely have a higher level of triglycerides. If you never exercise and aren\u2019t active in general, it can lower your HDL (good cholesterol).\nYour family history also affects your cholesterol level. Research has shown that high cholesterol tends to run in families. If you have an immediate family member who has it, you could have it, too.\nSmoking also causes high cholesterol. It lowers your HDL (good cholesterol).\nYou can\u2019t tell if you have high cholesterol without having it checked. A simple blood test will reveal your cholesterol level.\nMen 35 years of age and older and women 45 years of age and older should have their cholesterol checked. Men and women 20 years of age and older who have\u00a0risk factors for heart disease\u00a0should have their cholesterol checked. Teens may need to be checked if they are taking certain medicines or have a strong family history of high cholesterol. Ask your doctor how often you should have your cholesterol checked.\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\nMaking healthy food choices and exercising are two ways to reduce your risk of developing high cholesterol.\nEat fewer foods with saturated fats (such as red meat and most dairy products). Choose healthier fats. This includes lean meats, avocados, nuts, and low-fat dairy items. Avoid foods that contain trans fat (such as fried and packaged foods). Look for foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These foods include salmon, herring, walnuts, and almonds. Some egg brands contain omega-3.\nExercise can be simple. Go for a walk. Take a yoga class. Ride your bike to work. You could even participate in a team sport. Aim to get 30 minutes of activity every day.\nIf you have high cholesterol, you may need to make some lifestyle changes. If you smoke, quit. Exercise regularly. If you\u2019re overweight, losing just five to 10 pounds can improve your cholesterol levels and your risk for heart disease. Make sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish.\nDepending on your risk factors, your doctor may prescribe medicine and lifestyle changes.\nIf you have high cholesterol, you are twice as likely to develop heart disease. That is why it is important to have your cholesterol levels checked, especially if you have a family history of heart disease.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHigh-altitude illness, or sickness, is a condition that can occur when you travel to a high altitude, such as the mountains. It\u2019s also called mountain sickness. It usually happens at altitudes higher than 8,000 feet. At this altitude, there\u2019s less oxygen. When you go from low to high altitudes, your body needs time to adjust to the change in oxygen levels. Therefore, high-altitude illness happens when your body doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen.\nTalk to your doctor if you plan to travel to altitudes.\nSymptoms of high-altitude illness usually begin 12 to 24 hours after you reach a high altitude. Early symptoms include:\nIf you have these symptoms, stop, rest, and drink water. You may need to go back down to a lower altitude until your symptoms go away.\nMore severe symptoms include:\nIf you have these symptoms, go to a lower altitude right away and get medical help. Symptoms that are ignored or left untreated can be life threatening.\nYou may have heard that the air is \u201cthinner\u201d at higher altitudes. This means that your body can\u2019t get as much oxygen. High-altitude illness most often occurs at altitudes higher than 8,000 feet. It can cause problems for people whose bodies aren\u2019t used to working on so little oxygen.\nThere are 3 main types of high-altitude illness.\nEveryone is at risk for high-altitude illness. Children and older adults are at an increased risk because it takes their bodies longer to adjust. You also may be at a greater risk if you:\nPeople who have symptoms of high-altitude illness should see a doctor. Be sure to tell him or her about the conditions you were in when you had the symptoms. Your doctor will do a physical exam. Based on the severity of your symptoms, he or she may order tests. Tests may include a chest X-ray, brain scan, or electrocardiogram (ECG). These help diagnose the type of illness and decide on a treatment plan.\nThere are 3 important things you can do to prevent high-altitude illness.\nIt\u2019s important to treat high-altitude illness as soon as symptoms begin. The first thing you should do is to safely go down to a lower altitude right away. If your symptoms are mild, you may be able to stay at that altitude and let your body adjust. If you do this, don\u2019t exercise. Rest and drink water until you feel better. It may help to use a device that provides extra oxygen.\nIf needed, your doctor may prescribe medicine to prevent or treat symptoms. One example is acetazolamide. When taking this medicine, drink a lot of water and avoid alcohol.\nIf your symptoms are severe, continue to go down to a lower altitude until you\u2019re no longer sick. If your symptoms don\u2019t improve or get worse, call a doctor or go to the nearest hospital. You will need medical treatment.\nDon\u2019t ignore signs of high-altitude illness. Symptoms that are ignored or left untreated can be life threatening. Don\u2019t go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. Once your body adjusts, it should eventually get used to the low oxygen level. Over time, you shouldn\u2019t get sick anymore. This is helpful for people who move to a higher altitude to live.\nIf you have a chronic illness, talk to your doctor before you travel to a high altitude. Depending on the type and severity of your chronic illness, your doctor can let you know if it\u2019s safe for you to travel there.\nMost people who have heart or lung disease can safely spend time at a high altitude if their condition is under control. Likewise, it\u2019s usually safe for people who have coronary artery disease, mild emphysema, or high blood pressure to travel to a high-altitude. You won\u2019t make those diseases worse by being there. Being overweight also doesn\u2019t increase your risk.\nHowever, high altitudes can be very dangerous for people who have:\nThere is little information about the risk of high-altitude illness during pregnancy. Some experts recommend that pregnant women not travel to an altitude higher than 8,000 feet. If you\u2019re pregnant, ask your doctor for advice before you travel to a high altitude.\nGenerally, it\u2019s safe for children to go to high altitudes. However, they\u2019re more likely to get high-altitude illness because their bodies have a hard time adjusting to the low oxygen level. Kids also may not be able to recognize the symptoms of high-altitude illness.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nA hip fracture is a break in your thigh bone (femur) where it connects to your pelvic bone. Hip fractures can happen at any age. In younger people, it typically happens with car accidents or other significant injuries. However, hip fractures are more common in people 65 and older. It also is more common in women. That\u2019s because women often have a disease that weakens bones. This is calledosteoporosis. Hip fractures in older individuals are serious and require immediate medical attention. It can be difficult to fully recover from a hip fracture at an older age and can affect your ability to live independently. As the U.S. population grows older, there will be an increase in hip fracture cases.\nIf you fracture your hip, you may have the following symptoms:\nMost hip fractures are caused by a fall. Other causes include cancer and injury. Women break their hip more often than men. That\u2019s because women often have a condition that weakens bones. It is called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is caused by not having enough calcium to maintain healthy bones. As you get older, balance becomes more of a challenge and your risk for a hip fracture will increase. As men and women get older, they lose bone mass. Bones become brittle and break easily.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms, pain and if you\u2019ve fallen or been injured. They will order an X-ray to check for hip fracture.\nSeveral things can help reduce or prevent a hip fracture, including:\nMost people who have hip fractures will need hip surgery. This will involve anesthesia and a hospital stay. The length of the stay depends on your health and the severity of the break. Some people are unable to have hip surgery because of illness or poor health. When this happens, your doctor may consider putting you into traction. Traction uses a medical device to keep you from moving and walking. The length of time you are in traction depends on the severity of your break.\nAfter surgery, you may have a long recovery. Your doctor will tell you when you should try to stand or walk. It may be painful to walk at first. You may need a walker or cane for several months.\nYou may need to see a physical therapist after surgery. This is a medical provider who will teach you how to properly sit, stand and walk without reinjuring your hip. You\u2019ll receive exercises to do at home. You also may need some home care for daily tasks. This includes bathing, dressing, cooking, errands, etc.\nYour doctor will discuss hip replacement if your fracture was severe and permanent.\nComplications from a hip fracture can be severe and life-threatening. While you are immobile, you are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\u00a0DVT is a blood clot in a vein deep inside your body. These clots usually occur in your leg veins.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nA hip problem in infants is known as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). It is when the ball of the hip joint isn\u2019t formed properly and does not fit well in the socket. Often, this means that the hip joint is loose and prone to injury. DDH can lead to dislocation of the hip or other health issues.\nHip problems may not be easy to see at first. Most babies do not show symptoms. One sign to look for is if their hips don\u2019t open well when you change their diaper. Once your child is walking, a limp may be a sign of DDH.\nThe exact cause of DDH is unknown. It is more common in:\nUsually, the doctor can feel if something is wrong. The doctor first checks your baby\u2019s hips in the hospital after birth. They do this by gently pushing and pulling the baby\u2019s thigh bones to see if they are loose in the hip socket. An ultrasound may be needed to get a picture of the hip. X-rays can be taken once your baby is 4 months old.\nHip problems may not be present at birth. They may become an issue as your baby\u2019s body develops. The doctor will check your baby\u2019s hips at each well-baby check-up. As your child grows, the doctor checks to see if your baby\u2019s thighs spread apart easily.\nYour doctor may recommend an ultrasound even if the physical exam of your baby is normal. Most doctors follow the recommendation to do this for infants who are breech or when there is a family history of DDH.\nDDH cannot be avoided since the cause is unknown. However, there are some things you can do to keep it from getting worse:\nTreatment may not be needed right away. Instead, the doctor will continue to check your baby\u2019s hips to make sure they grow correctly. If the problem does not go away, gets worse, or is severe, the doctor likely will decide to treat the issue.\nA soft brace, called a \u201cPavlik harness,\u201d can treat most hip problems. This brace keeps your baby\u2019s knees spread apart and bent up toward the chest. The doctor should check your baby\u2019s hips the first few weeks to see if the hip is going into place and staying there. Once the hip is in place, your baby keeps wearing the brace for another 2 or 3 months. Your baby wears the brace day and night for about 3 to 6 months total.\nAbout 1 in 20 babies needs more than a brace to fix a hip problem. Surgery is needed in more severe cases. A closed reduction surgery involves moving the hip joint back into place. An open reduction surgery involves removing or dislocating the hip joint. This allows the doctor to clean out the socket then align and reattach the hip joint correctly. After surgery, your baby may wear a cast and/or brace for several months to keep the hip in place.\nTreatment and ongoing monitoring should fix DDH. There is a chance of future recurring problems, such as dislocation. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as possible related issues.

This condition occurs while a baby is in the womb. It is caused by missing nerve cells in the intestine. These nerve cells tell your intestine to push stools through your bowel. Cells may be missing from a small part of the intestine near the bottom (anus). Or cells may be missing from a large part of the intestine. This causes stools to back up in the intestine. It causes severe constipation, blockage, and colon infections.\nThe earliest sign of Hirschsprung disease is when your newborn baby does not have a bowel movement. This should occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. Other symptoms include:\nSometimes, symptoms are not present at birth. This may mean your child has a milder case. Symptoms in older children may include:\nAs a baby grows in the womb, their nerve cells may not grow from the top of the intestine to the anus. Doctors do not know what causes the nerve cells to stop growing.\nHirschsprung disease can be genetic. This means a parent could pass it on to their child. The rare disease is 5 times more frequent in males than in females. Children who have inherited or congenital conditions are at a higher risk as well. This includes Down syndrome.\nTalk to your doctor if your child has any of the symptoms listed above. Most cases are found shortly after birth. Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your family history. If your doctor suspects Hirschsprung disease, they will order imaging tests, such as an X-Ray of your child\u2019s abdomen. Your doctor may take a sample of tissue (biopsy) from inside your child\u2019s bottom. A baby cannot be tested for the condition while in the womb.\nSince the cause of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease is unknown, you cannot prevent or avoid it. However, parents who have the disease can unknowingly pass it on to their children.\nSurgery is the only way to treat Hirschsprung\u2019s disease. It should be done as soon as it is diagnosed. The type of surgery your child has depends on the severity of the disease.\nThe most common type is apull-through surgery. The surgeon will remove the part of the intestine that is missing nerve cells. They reattach the healthy part of the intestine to the anus. During surgery, the surgeon may need to remove all or part of the colon as well. Once your child heals, they will have a functioning intestine.\nChildren who have more severe cases of Hirschsprung disease may need anostomy surgery. The surgeon brings the end of the intestine through an opening in the stomach, called a stoma. They attach it to a pouch called an ostomy. The pouch sits outside the body to collect stool. This creates an alternate way to remove stool from your child\u2019s body. The pouch should be emptied regularly to dispose of the stool. When the surgeon attaches part of the large intestine to the stoma it is called a colostomy. When the surgeon attaches part of the small intestine to the stoma it is called an ileostomy.\nYour child may have this surgery prior to the pull-through procedure. It allows their intestine to heal. In this case, the ostomy is a temporary solution. If nerve cells are missing from too much of the intestine, the ostomy may be permanent.\nDuring either surgery, your child may need a feeding tube. This helps them receive the nutrients they need. Feeding tubes can be inserted through the nose or the stomach.\nHirschsprung\u2019s disease cannot be cured on its own. It can be fatal for children who do not have surgery.\nAfter surgery, most children lead normal lives. They may have minor health problems because of the disease. These include diarrhea, constipation, or other problems passing stool. Some children develop an infection called enterocolitis (digestive tract inflammation). This can be serious, so call your doctor right away if your child has the following symptoms:\nSome problems can occur after pull-through, including:\nChildren may need to make some lifestyle changes to help manage their condition. For instance, eating foods that are high in fiber can help reduce constipation. The large intestine absorbs water and salt that the body needs. If your child has a large portion of the intestine removed, it will absorb less. Make sure your child gets plenty of fluids and salt to make up for this.\nYour baby and older children will feel better after ostomy surgery because they will be able to pass stool easily. Adjusting to life with an ostomy pouch will take time and may make your child feel different. Your child will need to learn how to care for the stoma and how to change the ostomy pouch. With a few lifestyle changes, children with ostomies can lead normal lives. An ostomy nurse can answer questions and show your child how to care for an ostomy.\nNational Institutes of Health, Genetics Home Reference: Hirschsprung disease\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hirschsprung disease\nLast Updated:August 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

A healthy immune system is what keeps you from getting sick.\nWhen HIV damages your immune system, you are more likely to get sick from bacteria and viruses. It is also harder for your body to fight off these infections when you do get them, so you may have trouble getting better.\nAIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the term used when persons have advanced HIV disease. This increases your risk for infections and other serious HIV-associated conditions. With treatment, most Americans who have HIV are unlikely to develop AIDS.\nWhen first infected with HIV, you may not experience any symptoms. More often, though, you\u2019ll have flu-like symptoms, including:\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms may appear and/or get worse. This may take time. Some people who have HIV do not begin experiencing symptoms for up to 10 years. When HIV symptoms do appear, they can include:\nHIV can only be passed from person to person through infectious body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluid.\nChildren born to people with HIV can also acquire HIV during pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding. However, this happens less often now. It can be prevented by giving medicines to the pregnant person and to their newborn baby.\nThe most common ways HIV is passed are:\nYou are more at risk for HIV if you:\nThe best way to prevent HIV is to not have sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a person who has HIV, or share a needle with a person who has HIV. However, there is also a medicine called PrEP that people can take before coming into contact with HIV that can prevent them from getting an HIV infection.\nPrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is for people who are at long-term risk of getting HIV either through sexual activity or by injecting drugs. If you\u2019re taking PrEP and come into contact with HIV, the medicine makes it difficult for HIV to develop inside your body.\nOther ways to prevent HIV include:\nEven though there is no cure for HIV, there are many medicines available to help combat it. These medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) will often prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. Even when HIV does progress to AIDS, antiretroviral therapy is often still effective. However, it is most effective the earlier you begin treatment.\nBetter ART has changed HIV disease from the leading killer of young adults to a chronic disease that can be controlled for decades. However, even though you can take HIV medicines and feel okay, you could still give the virus to others through unsafe sex (without using a condom) or blood exchanges. The medicines don\u2019t kill the virus \u2014 they just keep your immune system strong enough to prevent AIDS or slow it down.\nWith treatment, the survival rate for HIV is very good. In the United States, people with HIV who are diagnosed early can have a life span that is about the same as someone like them who does not have HIV, according to HIV.gov.\nIf you are living with HIV, you need to take very good care of yourself. Be sure to eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get plenty of rest. Make sure you follow your doctor\u2019s instructions and take all of your medicines exactly as directed. You can also take steps to keep yourself from getting other infections or diseases that are more common in people who have HIV.\nIt is also important to see your doctor regularly so that he or she can monitor your treatment. Your doctor will probably want to see you every 6 months as long as your CD4 cell count is good. If it drops below 500, your doctor may want to see you every 3 months. Your doctor also may want to see you more often if you are trying a new medicine to see how you\u2019re responding to it. It is important to make sure your HIV infection is not getting worse.\nSome of the things that might tell your doctor that your HIV infection has gotten worse since your last visit are:\nYou should also proactively try to prevent other infections and complications. HIV can increase your risk for other diseases and conditions because it weakens your immune system.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted virus. It is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. There are more than 200 types of HPV. Some types don\u2019t cause any symptoms. Other types causegenital warts. More aggressive kinds of HPV can causecancerin both women and men. This includes cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and throat.\nHPV is passed between people through genital or skin-to-skin contact. Both men and women can get HPV and pass it on. Often, they don\u2019t know they have it, so they don\u2019t realize they are passing it to other people. Nearly all people who have had sex will get HPV at some point in their lives.\nIn most cases, HPV\u2014including the kinds that cause cancer\u2014does not have symptoms. The main symptom people see with some types of HPV infection is genital warts. Genital warts can be small or large, flat or raised. Sometimes they are described as looking like cauliflower. There can be just one, or they can appear in groups. They can appear on the anus, cervix, scrotum, penis, groin, or thigh.\nAnother type of HPV can cause warts to develop on other parts of your body, such as your hands and feet. The types of HPV that cause warts generally do not cause cancer.\nInfection from HPV happens when the virus gets into your body. This most often happens during vaginal, anal, or oral sex with a person who is already infected. HPV is spread through skin-to-skin contact, not through bodily fluids.\nIf you think you have warts in your genital area, call your family doctor. They will be able to diagnose it with an examination.\nFor women, diagnosis of HPV often starts with abnormal results from a routine Pap test. When you have a Pap test (or \u201csmear\u201d), the doctor will take a sample of cells from your cervix. The sample is sent to a lab and looked at under a microscope. If abnormal cells are found, your doctor may do another Pap test and include a cervical HPV test. This test can identify many of the HPV types that can cause cervical cancer. This is the only HPV test approved by the FDA.\nIf you have a type of HPV that can cause cancer, your doctor may want to perform a colposcopy. In this test, he or she will use a special magnifying lens to get a closer look at your cervix. If the tissue looks abnormal, they will cut out a small bit to perform a biopsy. This test will check for signs of cancer.\nThere is no FDA-approved test for HPV for men. Men who have sex with other men or are HIV-positive might be a candidate for an anal Pap test. This test will not confirm HPV, but it can find abnormal skin cells.\nBecause HPV is such a common virus, it is hard to avoid it completely. But there are steps you can take to lower your risk.\nHPV often shows no symptoms. Sometimes symptoms show up weeks or months after you\u2019ve been infected. This makes it harder for you to not spread the infection. It is less common for men to develop complications from HPV. But they can spread the virus to women, where cancer from the virus is more common. Therefore, it is important to do your best to avoid HPV.\nThere is an HPV vaccine available that can protect against diseases caused by HPV, including cancers. It is approved by the FDA.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 12 should get the vaccine. It is most effective when the person is vaccinated before becoming sexually active. Teenagers and young adults can get the vaccine, too. It is approved for anyone between 9 years and 26 years of age.\nThe CDC also recommends the vaccine for men 26 and under who have sex with other men or are HIV-positive.\nThe vaccine is given in multiple doses (shots) over 6 to 12 months. Children ages 9 to 14 receive 2 doses. Those 15 or older receive 3 doses. It\u2019s important to get all of the doses to make sure you or your child are getting the most protection from HPV infection.\nWithout health insurance, vaccines can be expensive. The CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children (VFC) program provides free vaccines for some families. If you have low income and don\u2019t have insurance for vaccinations, you might qualify.\nThere is no cure or treatment for the virus itself. In many men and women, HPV goes away on its own without causing any health problems. There are treatments for the conditions the virus causes. These include genital warts, precancerous cells, and cancer.\nGenital warts must be treated by your doctor. Do not try to treat the warts yourself. Don\u2019t use over-the-counter wart-removal products. These chemicals are not supposed to be used for genital warts. They can irritate the skin.\nIf precancerous cells are found, your doctor may want to monitor the area to make sure it doesn\u2019t grow. Your doctor may recommend to remove the abnormal tissue so it doesn\u2019t turn into cancer. If cancer is found, treatment will vary. It will depend on the type of cancer, the stage, and the patient\u2019s age.\nYou may test positive for HPV without having signs of cancer or genital warts. Your doctor will likely want you to get a repeat Pap test to monitor things until the infection is gone. This could take up to 2 years.\nMost women who get their routine Pap tests and follow their doctor\u2019s advice will not get cervical cancer. It takes a long time to develop, and regular check-ups help find issues early, before they get more serious.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: HPV Vaccination: What Everyone Should Know\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Vaccines for Children Program\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: HPV\nLast Updated:April 26, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It gradually kills nerve cells in the brain. This slowly deteriorates a person\u2019s physical and mental abilities. The disease is genetic, which means it is inherited from your parents. There is no cure, and it is fatal.\nPeople are born with the defective gene that causes the disease. But symptoms usually don\u2019t appear until middle age. Most cases of Huntington\u2019s disease are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 50. There is also an early-onset form of the disease called juvenile Huntington\u2019s disease. It affects people under age 20.\nThere are many symptoms of Huntington\u2019s disease. Early signs include:\nAs the disease progresses and gets worse, you may experience:\nIn young people, symptoms include being unsteady on your feet, rigid muscles, slurred speech, and seizures. As thinking and reasoning abilities get worse, school performance also gets worse. Juvenile Huntington\u2019s disease tends to progress faster than the adult-onset form of the disease.\nA single gene is to blame for Huntington\u2019s disease. It is passed on from parent to child at the time the child is conceived. If one parent carries the defective gene, the child has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and developing the disease. If the child does not inherit the defective gene, he or she will not develop the disease.\nDoctors use a variety of tools to diagnose Huntington\u2019s disease. They will start with a physical exam to observe your symptoms. They will ask questions about symptoms and your family medical history. A brain imaging test, such as CT or MRI, can show abnormalities in the brain. A lab can detect the Huntington\u2019s disease gene with a simple blood test.\nHuntington\u2019s disease is a genetic disorder. It cannot be prevented or avoided.\nThere is no cure for Huntington\u2019s disease. Nothing can stop or reverse the disease\u2019s course. The goal of treatment is to help relieve symptoms. This will help you function for as long as possible.\nThere is no single treatment for the disorder. Medicines can be used to treat some symptoms. For example, some \u201cantipsychotic\u201d medicines can help with uncontrollable body movements.\nMedicines used for treating uncontrolled body movement generally have side effects. They may make you nauseated, sleepy, or restless.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nWhen you get a cut, your body forms a thickened mass of blood tissue called a\u00a0blood\u00a0clot. This mass stops the bleeding. Proteins in your blood help form the clot. This process is called coagulation.\nSometimes your blood clots too much. This is called hypercoagulation. A blood clot can then travel through your body in your blood. This can be very dangerous. Blood clots can form in vital organs or travel to them, including the heart and brain. This can cause serious health problems, even death.\nThe symptoms you may experience depend on where the blood clot forms and where it travels. It can travel to many places, including the heart, lungs, brain, legs, and kidneys.\nA blood clot in the heart or lungs can cause a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism (a name for blood clot in the lungs). Symptoms include:\nA blood clot in the brain can cause a stroke. Symptoms include:\nA blood clot in the lower body may cause deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot deep inside your leg) or peripheral artery disease (when your arteries become narrow). Symptoms may appear in your leg and include:\nA blood clot in the vein to one of your kidneys may cause kidney failure. Symptoms include:\nSome people may not have enough of the proteins that regulate blood clotting. This causes their blood to clot too often. Others may have the proteins but have issues with them not working right. Still others are born with a tendency to develop clots. This means they run in the family.\nCertain situations or risk factors can make it more likely for your blood to clot too much. These situations include:\nIn addition to these situations, you may be at risk of hypercoagulation if:\nIf your doctor suspects you have hypercoagulation, he or she will do a physical exam. Your doctor will ask if anyone in your family has or had problems with clotting. He or she also can order blood tests to check the\u00a0protein and platelet\u00a0levels in your blood. The tests also can show if your proteins are working the way they should.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent hypercoagulation if it\u2019s inherited (runs in your family). However, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk if it isn\u2019t inherited.\nHypercoagulation is usually treated with medicine. Most of the time, this medicine is called an anticoagulant. This is sometimes called a blood thinner. Some drug names you may hear are heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivoraxaban, and aspirin. This medicine makes it hard for blood clots to form. It also can keep existing clots from growing bigger.\nSome people only need to take this medicine when they\u2019re in situations that make them more likely to form clots. This can include during long car or airplane trips, when they\u2019re pregnant, or when they\u2019re recovering from surgery in the hospital. Other people need to take this medicine on a regular basis for the rest of their lives. Your doctor will decide what treatment is right for you.\nIf your doctor prescribes an anticoagulant, you should:\nAnticoagulants can have side effects. Some can cause you to bleed easily. For example, if you cut yourself, it might take your blood longer than usual to clot. You might also\u00a0bruise\u00a0more easily. Call your doctor right away if you have bleeding that\u2019s unusual or heavy.\nHypercoagulation can be extremely dangerous. A blood clot inside a blood vessel can travel through your bloodstream. It can get stuck inside one of your body\u2019s organs. A clot that gets stuck in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) blocks blood from getting to your lungs. A clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain can cause a stroke. A clot in a blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack. Blood clots can cause some women to have miscarriages. All of these conditions can be life-threatening.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHyperhidrosis is excessive sweating. Everyone sweats when they\u2019re hot, exercising, or feeling stress. But people who have hyperhidrosis sweat most of the time and sweat heavily without the usual triggers.\nIf you have hyperhidrosis, you may sweat all over your body. Or you may sweat mainly on your hands, feet, armpits, face, and genital area. Your clothes may be soaked with sweat. Your skin may become white and wrinkled or red and irritated from the moisture.\nDampness from the sweat is accompanied by odor. Sweat by itself doesn\u2019t usually have an odor. But once it is on your skin,\u00a0bacteria\u00a0and other germs begin to break it down. This causes it to smell.\nHyperhidrosis can have an unpleasant effect on your life. You may feel awkward and uncomfortable in social situations. You may be self-conscious because of dampness and odor. You may also be afraid to touch or shake hands with people or raise your arm to reach for something. You may feel embarrassed about being in public, spending time with your friends, and going to work or school. These are very normal reactions to having hyperhidrosis.\nToo often, people suffer with hyperhidrosis without seeking help. Perhaps you may think it is silly or embarrassing. But hyperhidrosis can have a negative impact on your life. It can cause social isolation,\u00a0depression,\u00a0and anxiety. Plus, it can be a sign of a serious health problem. You are wise to seek your doctor\u2019s advice. Contact your doctor if:\nThere are 2 types of hyperhidrosis.\nPrimary hyperhidrosis:This is called focal hyperhidrosis. It tends to affect both sides of the body. It occurs on the feet, hands, underarms, head, and face. Sometimes, it affects larger areas of the body. It seems to run in families, often begins in childhood, and occurs during waking hours. It is usually very hard to determine the cause of primary hyperhidrosis.\nMore often, hyperhidrosis is caused by something else. This is calledsecondary hyperhidrosisor generalized hyperhidrosis. It tends to involve large areas of the body and may happen both during the day and at night. Secondary hyperhidrosis may be caused by:\nYour doctor will probably ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. The signs of hyperhidrosis may be obvious to your doctor and no testing may be needed. You may also be checked for other problems that could be causing your symptoms. For example, your doctor may order\u00a0urine\u00a0and blood tests to check for conditions such as an overactive thyroid or low blood sugar. Additional testing for hyperhidrosis measures the level of moisture on your skin.\nYou cannot prevent primary hyperhidrosis. Often, you cannot prevent secondary hyperhidrosis. Much depends on what is causing your symptoms. If your symptoms are caused by blood pressure medicine, it may be possible to change medicines. If your symptoms are caused by caffeine, they may go away when you stop drinking caffeinated drinks. But if your symptoms are caused by heart disease or cancer, it may be impossible to prevent hyperhidrosis.\nA number of things can help you deal with hyperhidrosis day to day.\nInternational Hyperhidrosis Society\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hyperhidrosis\nLast Updated:September 2, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHyperparathyroidism occurs in your\u00a0parathyroid glands. These are the 4 pea-sized glands behind your thyroid gland\u00a0at the front of your neck. The glands make a\u00a0hormone\u00a0called parathyroid hormone (PTH). The hormone manages the levels of calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus in your body. PTH helps you absorb calcium from your food and keeps you from losing too much calcium through your urine.\nPeople who have hyperparathyroidism produce too much PTH. This causes them to have too much calcium in their bloodstream and not enough in their bones. In general, hyperparathyroidism affects the health of your bones and kidneys, but has the potential to affect your overall health.\nHyperparathyroidism\u00a0does not always produce early symptoms. Some people may have one or more of the following symptoms:\nA number of things can cause your parathyroid glands to make too much PTH. These include:\nHyperparathyroidism also can be hereditary, which means it runs in families. More women have hyperparathyroidism than men. It is more likely to occur in older adults and women who have gone through menopause. People who lack vitamin D are at an increased risk. This is because vitamin D helps your body absorb the calcium in your bloodstream. In rare instances, people exposed to chronic lithium therapy (typically prescribed to treat bipolar disorder) also are at an increased risk.\nMost cases of hyperparathyroidism are found during routine blood tests. This is because most people do not have or recognize symptoms. When the doctor does a blood test, they will check your calcium level. If it is high, they will look at the amount of PTH in your blood.\nOnce the doctor confirms the diagnosis, they may run more tests. These can help find the cause of the condition. A CT scan or ultrasound checks for growths on your parathyroid glands. Those test in different body areas also can check for calcium deposits in your kidneys and urinary tract. Other causes of increased calcium, such as some medicines or cancer, must be considered as well.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid hyperparathyroidism.\nTreatment for hyperparathyroidism depends on the cause. If you have a growth on your parathyroid gland, you likely will need surgery. Once the doctor removes the growth, it shouldn\u2019t come back. Your symptoms should stop in the first month after surgery. Your blood calcium level may be too low at first. This can be treated with medicine. Surgery also may be recommended for people who have moderate to severe symptoms. The doctor will remove the glands that are overactive.\nIf you have minor or no symptoms, medicine may be the best form of treatment. Medicines can treat some but not all of the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.\nIf a medical condition is the cause, treatment is aimed at managing the underlying condition.\nTalk to your doctor about treatment options if you are pregnant. You do not want your baby to be calcium deficient. This is very harmful to their development.\nMost people feel much better after treatment once the symptoms have gone away. Your doctor will want to continue routine testing. A blood test checks your calcium and PTH levels. A bone X-ray or bone mineral density (DXA) test can check for bone loss. Other tests may be done as needed based on the cause.\nIt is very important to maintain your blood calcium level as much as possible. Normally, the amount of calcium going into your bones matches the amount of calcium passing out of your bones. If you have hyperparathyroidism, more calcium is coming out of your bones than is going back in. This can lead to decreased bone mass. Weak bones break more easily and heal slower than normal bones.\nThe calcium from your bones enters your bloodstream and causes too much calcium in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. You also can get kidney stones, because your kidneys are trying to filter out the extra calcium in your blood.\nIf you have hyperparathyroidism, you should not have too much or too little calcium in your diet. Aim for about 800-1,000 mg each day. You also should limit your intake of vitamin D to less than 600 IU each day. Your doctor can give you more information about your intake of these nutrients. Drink plenty of water to help prevent kidney stones. Regular exercise helps to build bone strength. Do not smoke. It increases your risk for certain problems, including bone loss.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Primary Hyperparathyroidism\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hyperparathyroidism\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHyperthyroidism\u00a0is known as overactive thyroid. It occurs when your thyroid gland makes and releases too much thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly. It is in the front of your neck, below your Adam\u2019s apple. The thyroid makes hormones that control your body\u2019s metabolism. It affects your heart rate and the function of your other organs. It also affects your muscles, bones, and menstrual cycles (for women).\nHyperthyroidism can be related toGraves\u2019 disease. This is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland.\nHyperthyroidism often begins slowly. Its symptoms can be mistaken for stress or other health problems. Common symptoms include:\nSymptoms in older adults may be subtle. Examples are increased heart rate, fatigue during normal activities, and withdrawal. Doctors may mistake hyperthyroidism for depression or dementia.\nPeople who have Graves\u2019 disease may have additional symptoms. One of the most common symptoms is swollen or bulging eyes. This can cause your eyes to be dry and red. You may also have:\nIn more than 70% of cases, hyperthyroidism is caused by Graves\u2019 disease. Normally, the immune system helps protect your body against viruses, bacteria, and other substances. An autoimmune disease causes it to attack your body\u2019s tissues and/or organs. With Graves\u2019 disease, the immune system stimulates your thyroid, making it produce too much hormone. Doctors think Graves\u2019 disease may run in families. It is most common among young women.\nTwo other common causes for hyperthyroidism are:\nConsuming foods or medicines that contain high levels of iodine can also lead to hyperthyroidism. In rare cases, the cause could be a benign (noncancerous) tumor on the pituitary gland.\nContact your doctor if you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid. He or she will check for an enlarged thyroid gland, rapid pulse, moist skin, eye changes, and a slight tremor in your fingers or hand. Your doctor also will do a blood test to measure the amount of thyroid hormone in your blood. This confirms the diagnosis.\nYour doctor may do a thyroid scan to find the cause. If your entire thyroid is affected, you have Graves\u2019 disease. Or the doctor will look for thyroid nodules or an inflammation.\nYour doctor also may do a radioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures your thyroid\u2019s ability to take up iodine. A high uptake of iodine means your thyroid gland may be producing too much hormone. This indicates Graves\u2019 disease or a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule. A low uptake of iodine indicates thyroiditis as the cause.\nYou cannot prevent hyperthyroidism. However, some people are more at risk for the condition. This includes people who:\nThere are several treatments for hyperthyroidism. The best one for you depends on your age, health, cause, and the severity of your condition. The goal is to control your thyroid levels and make them normal. Doing this relieves symptoms and prevents future health problems. Treatments include:\nIf it is not treated, hyperthyroidism can lead to other health problems. These include:\nPeople who have Graves\u2019 disease may develop red, swollen skin on their shins and feet. Try using over-the-counter creams with hydrocortisone for relief.

The\u00a0pituitary gland\u00a0is a small, bean-shaped\u00a0gland\u00a0at the base of your brain. It plays a role in controlling your body\u2019s endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands that produce and secrete hormones to regulate your body\u2019s processes.\nIn hypopituitarism, the pituitary gland fails to produce or doesn\u2019t produce enough of one or more of its hormones. When your pituitary gland doesn\u2019t produce enough hormones, your body functions are affected.\nThe pituitary gland is responsible for releasing:\nIt\u2019s possible for the symptoms of hypopituitarism to appear suddenly.

Because of this, they\u2019re often overlooked for months or years.\nPossible symptoms include:\nMen may also experience:\nWomen may also experience:\nChildren may also experience:\nYou should see a doctor immediately if certain symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly. These include:\nSudden onset of these symptoms could be a sign of sudden bleeding into the pituitary. This is called pituitary apoplexy, which is a serious condition.\nHypopituitarism is commonly caused by a\u00a0tumor\u00a0in the pituitary gland. A tumor can squeeze the pituitary gland as it grows, which can cause damage. A pituitary tumor can also put pressure on the optic nerves in the eyes and cause visual problems.\nOther causes of hypopituitarism are:\nHypopituitarism can also be caused by diseases of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain located just above the pituitary gland. It\u2019s responsible for producing hormones that help the pituitary gland function normally.\nIn other cases, the cause of hypopituitarism may be unknown.\nIf you have symptoms of hypopituitarism, your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. Or you doctor may want to check for pituitary tumors or defects. This is done using a computerized tomography (CT) scan or for more detail and smaller concerns, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. Your doctor may do several\u00a0vision\u00a0tests to see if your sight is being affected. In children, X-rays can measure whether bones are growing normally.\nYour doctor may also want you to see an endocrinologist. This is a doctor who studies the endocrine system. You may need to go to a special endocrine clinic for other tests.\nIn most cases, you can\u2019t prevent this disorder. Some medicines can suppress pituitary function. This can cause hypopituitarism. Ask your doctor about these risks if you\u2019re taking glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone).\nYour doctor will treat the condition that\u2019s causing your hypopituitarism first. This can help restore your pituitary gland\u2019s ability to produce hormones.\nIf a tumor on your pituitary gland is causing your hypopituitarism, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove it. Or they may recommend radiation therapy to shrink it.\nSometimes, even after treatment, your body doesn\u2019t produce enough of one or more pituitary hormones. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a hormone replacement medicine to add to your body\u2019s hormone production.\nHormone replacement medicines include:\nIf you\u2019re taking hormone replacement medicine, your doctor may want to regularly monitor your hormone level. Doing so will make sure you\u2019re getting the right amount of replacement hormones.\nIf you become very sick (such as with the flu) or go through a stressful time, your doctor may adjust the dose of replacement hormone you take (just as a normally functioning pituitary gland would do). You might also need a dose adjustment if you become pregnant or have a significant change in weight.\nYou should carry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. This way, emergency medical workers know what kind of care you need in case of emergency.\nManaging hypopituitarism using hormone replacement therapy is often successful.

It occurs when you are exposed to bitter cold for a long time. Normal body temperature is 98.6\u00b0F. You have hypothermia if your body temperature drops below 95\u00b0F. Hypothermia also can occur in temperatures that are not bitterly cold, like those above 40\u00b0F. This is usually due to a person being wet, sweaty, or trapped in cold water. It is dangerous and can be life threatening. Most people don\u2019t know they have it until it\u2019s too late. If left untreated, hypothermia can cause aheart attack, liver damage, kidney failure, or death.\nHypothermia is different from frostbite. You can have frostbite by itself or with hypothermia. It depends on the type. Frostbite is an injury you get when a part of your body freezes. Common locations of frostbite are your nose, ears, fingers, and toes. With frostbite, your body parts can be numb, stiff, and/or white or grayish-yellow. The effects can be long-term for severe injuries. It may require amputation.\nHowever, hypothermia is more serious and requires urgent medical care.\nSymptoms are difficult to spot in babies and older people. Warning signs include:\nHypothermia is caused by a drop in your body temperature. When your temperature drops, your body uses stored energy to stay warm. Hypothermia begins when the stored energy is used up. Your body can no longer produce heat. There are a few types of this condition with varying causes.\nAcute hypothermia\nThis occurs when your body temperature drops suddenly. This can happen if you fall into cold water. It also can happen if you are wet and in the cold. Hikers, hunters, and people who are without housing are at risk. People who are stranded outside in the cold for too long are at risk.\nChronic hypothermia\nThis occurs when your body temperature drops over a period of time. Elderly people and babies have a harder time controlling their body temperature. They are at risk of getting hypothermia over time. People of low incomes who don\u2019t have access to heat or proper clothing are at risk.\nExhaustion hypothermia\nThis occurs when your body temperature drops because it is too tired to produce heat. People who are sick, have certain health conditions, or have substance use disorders are at risk.\nPerioperative hypothermia\nThis occurs when your body temperature drops after surgery in a hospital. It can be hard to maintain heat after receiving anesthesia.\nIf you suspect a person has hypothermia, take their temperature. A reading of less than 95\u00b0F means they could have hypothermia. You should get medical care immediately. A doctor will perform a physical exam. He or she will want to know the person\u2019s lifestyle to determine what may have caused or contributed to the hypothermia. Additional tests include:\nYou can prevent or avoid most cases of hypothermia. To reduce your risk:\nSee a doctor immediately if you suspect you or someone else has hypothermia. Additionally:\nIf the person is not breathing, beginCPRright away. Stay with the person until help arrives.\nA hospital may provide other treatment. One example is infusing warm fluids into the body or providing oxygen. Another example is to flow the person\u2019s blood through an external device to warm it up.\nHypothermia can be cured with little to no lasting effects. Severe cases may require ongoing treatment.

Symptoms can be mistaken for stress, depression, or other health problems. Common symptoms include:\nAnyone can have an underactive thyroid. This includes infants and teenagers. Babies who are born without a thyroid gland or with a thyroid that doesn\u2019t work may not have many symptoms at first. They may have yellowing of the skin and yellowing of the whites of their eyes (jaundice). Their face could be puffy and their tongue may be enlarged causing choking. As the disease progresses, infants can have trouble feeding and may not grow and develop normally. They also may be constipated, sleepy, and have poor\u00a0muscle\u00a0tone.

(Platelets are also called thrombocytes.) \u201cPurpura\u201d means a person has excessive bruising.\nWhen you have ITP, your immune system destroys the platelets in your blood. Platelets are the tiny cells that form blood clots. They seal minor cuts and wounds. A person who doesn\u2019t have enough platelets bruises very easily. They can bleed for a long time after being injured. A person who has ITP might have nosebleeds that are hard to stop. Rarely, they might have bleeding in the intestines, or even bleeding in the brain with minor trauma.\nITP is also sometimes called \u201cimmune thrombocytopenic purpura\u201d or \u201cimmune thrombocytopenia.\u201d It can happen in adults or children. In children, the condition usually resolves on its own without treatment. For adults, it is often a long-term condition.\nThe symptoms of ITP include:\nIn most adults, ITP lasts much longer than it does in children. At the time of diagnosis, many adults have noticed symptoms for several weeks or months. At the same time, many adults have only mild thrombocytopenia. Some have no bleeding symptoms at all.\nThe cause of ITP is not known. People who have ITP form antibodies that destroy their blood platelets. Normally, antibodies are a healthy response. They attack and destroy bacteria or viruses. But in people who have ITP, the antibodies attack the body\u2019s own cells. Doctor\u2019s aren\u2019t sure exactly why this happens.\nThere are 2 types of ITP\u2014acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term). Acute ITP mainly affects children. They often get the condition after a viral illness, such as the flu. The usual age for a child getting ITP is 2 to 4 years of age. Chronic ITP typically affects adults. Most adults with ITP are young women, but it can occur in anyone. ITP does not seem to be hereditary (run in families). ITP is not contagious (you can\u2019t \u201ccatch it\u201d from someone else).\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your health. He or she will do a physical exam. They may take a blood sample for testing. The test counts blood cells and platelets. Or they may look at the sample under a microscope. Your doctor may also want you to get a bone marrow exam. This can help rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\nMany adults find out they have ITP by accident. Their blood is checked for another reason and a low blood platelet count is found.\nSince there is no known cause, there is nothing that can prevent or avoid the condition.\nMild cases of ITP may not require treatment, just regular monitoring of platelet levels. More serious cases will require treatment.\nTreatment of ITP in adults does not cure the disease. It is aimed at increasing the blood platelet count. Your doctor may recommend that you take prednisone for several weeks or months. Prednisone is a steroid that raises the level of your platelet count. As your count rises and reaches a safe level, your doctor may gradually decrease your medicine. However, when the medicine is stopped, your platelet count may decrease again.\nOther treatments for ITP include other medicines. These include:\nIf medicines don\u2019t help enough, your doctor may recommend that your spleen be removed. The spleen makes most of the antibodies that destroy the blood platelets. It also destroys old or damaged blood cells. But removing the spleen permanently reduces your body\u2019s ability to fight infection. Some people can have the ITP come back even after the spleen is removed. So this treatment is not done as often as it used to be.\nITP in children is usually mild. It runs its course without the need for treatment. About 80% of children recover completely from ITP within about 6 months. When a child is diagnosed, many doctors recommend just watching the child carefully. However, some doctors recommend a short treatment with prednisone pills or gamma globulin infusions. These treatments will increase the platelet count more quickly. Both medicines have some side effects.\nIf you have ITP, you should avoid medicines that increase risks for bleeding. Some of these include warfarin, aspirin, or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). You should also limit alcohol. It can decrease the ability of your blood to clot.\nMany of the medicines used to treat ITP should not be taken by women who are pregnant. Talk to your doctor if you are taking medicine for ITP and want to become pregnant.\nDiagnosing ITP during pregnancy can be difficult. Platelet counts may be low for other reasons. About 5% of women have mildly low platelet counts at the end of a normal pregnancy. The cause of this is unknown. The platelet count goes back to normal right after delivery.\nA baby born to a mother who has ITP may have a low blood platelet count a few days to a few weeks after birth. These babies usually are kept in the hospital for several days. That way, doctors can make sure they are okay before sending them home. If the baby\u2019s platelet count is very low, treatment is available to speed recovery.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Immune Thrombocytopenia\nLast Updated:June 17, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can happen when your body has trouble digesting food. It occurs in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a group of organs that plays a part in digestion. Anyone can get indigestion. You can get it on occasion, or it can be an ongoing problem. The symptoms and causes vary by case. If there is no known cause for indigestion, it is referred to as functional dyspepsia.\nIndigestion can feel like a stomachache. You can have a range of symptoms including:\nTalk to your doctor if symptoms continue for more than two weeks. Seek medical care right away if your symptoms are severe, such as:\nA lot of factors can cause indigestion. These include:\nCertain health issues, like problems in your GI tract, also can cause indigestion. These include:\nYour doctor will review your symptoms and perform a physical exam to diagnose indigestion. They also may order tests to determine the cause. Those tests can include blood work, urine/stool tests, or an X-ray or ultrasound. Sometimes your doctor may perform an upper endoscopy to see inside your stomach. Your doctor will insert a thin tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus. This will be done after you\u2019re given medicines to go to sleep.\nThere are ways to prevent indigestion. To start, you need to know your body and how it reacts to different food and drinks. Spicy and acidic foods and carbonated drinks can trigger indigestion. Try to avoid those things when possible. Eat smaller meals throughout the day, and don\u2019t eat too late at night. Don\u2019t lie down too soon after eating. Limit the use of alcohol. If you use tobacco, try to quit. Stress and lack of sleep also can worsen symptoms.\nYour treatment will depend on the cause of your indigestion. Your doctor can help you decide which treatment is best for you.\nSome over-the-counter medicines may help your symptoms. Check with your doctor before starting something new.\nDo not take pain and anti-inflammatory medicines (some brand names: Advil, Aleve, Motrin) for your symptoms. They do not help and can worsen your condition, especially if used often.\nIf you have a stomach ulcer, you may need to take an acid-blocking medicine. But your ulcer can be cured. If you have an infection in your stomach, you also may need to take an antibiotic.\nPrevention methods for indigestion also are forms of treatment. These include changing your diet, getting more sleep, and reducing your level of stress.\nMost people who have indigestion lead a normal life. You may need to make some lifestyle changes or take medicine to treat your symptoms.

    "article_title": "What is infant jaundice?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2020 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nInfant jaundice is common during the first few days of a baby\u2019s life. It\u2019s caused by high levels of bilirubin. This can make your baby\u2019s skin, eyes, and mouth (under the tongue) turn a yellow color. While the color can look odd, infant jaundice usually isn\u2019t serious.\nThe main symptom of jaundice is a yellowing of your baby\u2019s skin. Look for color changes in the skin, the whites of your baby\u2019s eyes, and the pink skin inside your baby\u2019s mouth. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow when you press it, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to see yellowing. But you should still be able to tell by the coloring of your baby\u2019s eyes and under your baby\u2019s tongue. If any of these three areas appear to be a yellowish color, call your baby\u2019s doctor.\nInfant jaundice usually appears between 2 and 7 days after birth. As the amount of bilirubin in the blood builds up, your baby\u2019s body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby\u2019s head down to the chest and even down to the toes. These are signs that your baby may have more severe jaundice. If this happens, you should call your baby\u2019s doctor right away.\nArtificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that isn\u2019t really there. Try to check your baby in natural daylight in a sunny room.\nJaundice is caused when too much bilirubin builds up in your baby\u2019s body. Bilirubin\u00a0is a yellow substance made when the body breaks down old red\u00a0blood\u00a0cells. The\u00a0liver\u00a0filters it from the blood, and it leaves the body through the stool (poop). This is a normal process that happens all through life. However, babies sometimes get a buildup of bilirubin in their bodies. Your baby\u2019s liver might not yet be developed enough to filter out the bilirubin. Or your baby may have a condition that increases the number of red blood cells that need to be replaced. These can cause the bilirubin to build up in your baby\u2019s body, causing jaundice.\nThere are several common types of jaundice:\nIn some cases, jaundice is caused by an underlying problem. This could include bleeding, infection, or a liver condition.\nYour baby is more likely to have jaundice if he or she is:\nYour baby\u2019s doctor will watch for signs of jaundice while you and your baby are still in the hospital. Your baby\u2019s bilirubin levels can be checked 24 hours after birth. A probe may be used that estimates the bilirubin level just by touching the skin. If the level is high, it will be confirmed by a blood test.\nIf you\u2019re at home and your baby\u2019s skin becomes yellow, call your baby\u2019s doctor right away. He or she will measure the amount of your baby\u2019s bilirubin through a blood test. The doctor will probably measure your baby\u2019s bilirubin level several times. If necessary, your baby will be treated for infant jaundice. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.\nIn most cases, jaundice can\u2019t be prevented. However, you can reduce the risk that your baby will develop jaundice by feeding him or her at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first several days. This will help your baby have regular bowel movements, which will remove bilirubin from his or her body.\nMost of the time, treatment for jaundice isn\u2019t needed. Mild jaundice usually goes away on its own in 1 to 2 weeks.\nFor more serious cases of jaundice, your baby might need treatment at the hospital. Most babies who need treatment for jaundice get light therapy (also called phototherapy).\nDuring phototherapy, your baby is placed under special lights or on a special light-producing blanket. He or she will wear only a diaper and a mask to protect his or her eyes. The light helps your baby\u2019s body get rid of the excess bilirubin. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days. Sometimes, if the bilirubin levels aren\u2019t too high, you may be able to use phototherapy at home.\nIn rare cases, phototherapy doesn\u2019t work. If your baby\u2019s bilirubin level continues to rise, your baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby\u2019s blood is taken out and replaced with fresh blood.\nIf an underlying condition is causing the jaundice, your doctor will treat the underlying condition.\nHow long jaundice lasts differs from baby to baby. Often, a baby\u2019s bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is fed formula.\nJaundice isn\u2019t a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, and even cause brain damage. The risk of serious injury to your baby from high bilirubin levels is increased if your baby is premature. But jaundice is almost always diagnosed before the bilirubin level gets high enough to cause this kind of damage.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Jaundice\nLast Updated:October 5, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

For women, treatment may include medicine or surgery. The most common medicines used to treat female infertility stimulate the ovaries.

It also is used to remove areas of endometriosis, fibroids, polyps, or scarring, which all can affect fertility.\nMen can be treated with medicine and surgery.

    "article_title": "What is inflammatory bowel disease?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the name of a group of disorders that cause the intestines to become inflamed (red and swollen). The inflammation lasts a long time before subsiding, but it usually comes back over and over again. Approximately 1.6 million Americans have some kind of inflammatory bowel disease.\nThe two primary types of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis.\nCrohn\u2019s disease is an IBD that causes ulcers to form in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus. Crohn\u2019s disease can have \u201cskip\u201d areas that are normal. These normal areas lie in between areas that are affected. Some people who have Crohn\u2019s disease have severe symptoms. Others have symptoms that are not as severe. Some people who have the disease have long periods without symptoms, even without getting treatment. Others who have more severe symptoms will need long-term treatment or even surgery.\nUlcerative colitis is an IBD that causes your colon (large intestine) to become red and swollen. The redness and swelling can last for a few weeks or for several months. Ulcerative colitis always involves the last part of the colon (the rectum). It can go higher up in the colon, up to involving the whole colon. Ulcerative colitis never has the \u201cskip\u201d areas typical of Crohn\u2019s disease. Symptoms may come and go. These occurrences are called flare-ups. Flare-ups can last many months and may come back at different times throughout your life.\nThe symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease vary, depending on which part or parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is/are affected. Common symptoms include:\nOther less common symptoms may include fever, joint pain, eye problems, skin problems, and feeling tired (called fatigue). The symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease may be mild or severe. Symptoms may also come and go. They can start suddenly or gradually.\nSymptoms of ulcerative colitis vary. Symptoms depend on how severe your case is and how much of your large intestine is affected. Common symptoms include:\nIn most people who have ulcerative colitis, these symptoms tend to come and go. You may have periods where you have no symptoms, followed by periods where you do have symptoms.\nIt is not yet known exactly what causes Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. These diseases seem to run in families, which means that genetics play a role. Many researchers believe that inflammatory bowel diseases are caused by a problem with the immune system. Normally, the immune system protects your body from infection. In people who have an inflammatory bowel disease, the immune system mistakes food, healthy bacteria, and other substances for an infection. This causes the immune system to attack the cells of the intestine, which leads to inflammation.\nYour doctor will give you a physical exam and listen to you describe your symptoms. To help diagnose the problem your doctor may order a number of tests, including blood tests and stool samples. Your doctor may also order one or more procedures to help them view your colon. Lower GI endoscopy procedures include colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. During these procedures, your doctor uses a narrow, flexible tube to look directly inside your large intestine. Upper GI endoscopy allows a look at your stomach and small intestine for ulcers. For this type of endoscopy, you may swallow a small camera (called capsule endoscopy). If not, your doctor inserts a scope into your GI tract through your mouth.\nYour doctor may also order other imaging tests such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI.\nIBD cannot be prevented, but there are lifestyle changes you can make to minimize symptoms. The best thing you can do is to take good care of yourself. It\u2019s important to eat a healthy diet. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may ask you to reduce the amount of fiber or dairy products in your diet. It also may be necessary to limit or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. In addition to eating well, you need to get enough rest and exercise regularly. It\u2019s also important that you learn to manage the stress in your life. When you become overly upset by things that happen at home or at work, your intestinal problems can get worse.\nThe goal of treatment is to get rid of the inflammation that causes your symptoms. Many types of medicine can help reduce inflammation.\u00a0 Talk to your doctor about anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs that suppress the immune system. Some medicines are needed only during flare-ups. You may need long-term medicines to suppress your immune system. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend these medicines and supplements:\nIn severe cases of inflammatory bowel disease, you may need to go to the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids or surgery.\nDuring your treatment, you will most likely be treated by a team of doctors. This team may include your family physician, a gastroenterologist (a specialist in stomach and intestinal disorders), and, possibly, a surgeon.\nIf you have inflammatory bowel disease, you are at an increased risk of colon cancer. Talk to your doctor about when to start screening for colon cancer and how often to have screening.\nCrohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis keep coming back and their symptoms can be unpredictable. This can cause patients who have these illnesses to become depressed. If you feel depressed, talk with your family doctor. An antidepressant medicine could help you feel better.\nAsk questions. Read about IBD. Discuss treatments with your doctor. You\u2019ll be able to understand your illness and manage it better. Patient support groups are helpful, especially if you have severe symptoms.\nCrohn\u2019s and Colitis Foundation of America\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Digestive Diseases\nLast Updated:January 21, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated March 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nAn ingrown toenail occurs when the side or corner of the nail curls down and digs into the skin of your toe. It is most common for the big toenail to become ingrown, but it can happen to any toenail.\nSymptoms of an ingrown toenail include redness, swelling, and pain on your toe around the nail.\nMany things can cause ingrown toenails. One main cause is wearing shoes that do not fit well. Shoes that are too tight or too small can press on your toenail in unnatural ways. Improperly trimmed toenails are another main cause. Toenails that are peeled off at the edge or trimmed down at the corners are more likely to become ingrown.\nAn injury to your toe also can cause an ingrown toenail. People who have deformed or misshaped toenails have a higher risk of ingrown toenails.\nYour doctor can examine your toe and toenail. If your doctor determines that you have an ingrown toenail, they may order treatment. Be sure to tell your doctor if you get ingrown toenails often. People who havediabetesare at risk of complications from an ingrown toenail.\nTo avoid ingrown toenails, you should cut your nails straight across. The top of your nail should make a straight line. Do not pick at your nails or tear them at the corners. Wear shoes that fit correctly. Avoid high heels and tight-fitting shoes.\nMild ingrown toenails can be treated at home. Soak your foot in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Dry your foot, then place part of a cotton ball under the corner of your nail. You can wet the cotton with water or a disinfectant. This should be changed at least once a day. Try to wear shoes, such as sandals, that do not rub the toenail. This can delay healing or cause irritation.\nContact your doctor if your ingrown toenail does not improve or gets worse. Watch for signs, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, and drainage. You may have an infection. The doctor may prescribe an antibiotic either in pill or cream form.\nSevere cases of an ingrown toenail may require surgery. This is a minor procedure that involves removing the part of the nail that is ingrown. Before surgery, the doctor will numb your toe by injecting it with medicine. First, they cut your toenail along the edge that is growing into your skin. Then, they pull out the piece of nail. The doctor may apply a small electrical charge or liquid solution to the exposed part of your nail bed. This is called ablation. It should keep the toenail from growing into your skin again. Not all people need ablation.\nFollow these instructions after surgery to care for your toe. Call your doctor if the toenail is not healing.\nIt is important to get treatment if you have an infection. If you don\u2019t, the infection can spread to the rest of your toe or into your bone.\nTreatment\u2014at home or from your doctor\u2014helps treat symptoms and heal the nail. Once the nail is healed, practice guidelines to prevent future problems. If you do not practice good foot care, the problem is more likely to reoccur. If you have surgery, it can take 2 to 4 months for your nail to grow back.\nLast Updated:March 18, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Be honest and open. Tell them how dangerous it is. Let your child know that you are concerned and want to help.\nIf you find your child using inhalants, get them medical help right away. If they lose consciousness, call 911.\nThe best way to help prevent inhalant use is to talk to your child about it early on. Do not assume that your child knows what it is or that it\u2019s wrong. Talk to your child about the dangers and risks of trying inhalants and drugs. It can help them make the right decision. Minimize or avoid excess storage of things like paint thinners, gasoline, oven cleaner, spray paints, and other things you don\u2019t need on a regular basis.\nMinor symptoms of inhalant use can be treated with over-the-counter medicines. Major symptoms, such as heart arrhythmias, require proper medical action.\nThe most important part of treatment is to stop the abuse. This requires your child to abstain from using inhalants. Your child may need to see a counselor or attend a support or rehab program.\nInhalant use can put your child at greater risk of being injured or in an accident. This is especially true if your child tries to drive while high on an inhalant. People who abuse inhalants are more likely to use alcohol and other drugs.\nInhaling solvents can cause your heart to beat irregularly, too fast, or too hard. In some cases, it can lead to a heart arrhythmia. In severe cases, it can cause sudden death. Inhalants can cause brain damage by blocking oxygen flow to your brain and other organs. Continued abuse can seriously harm or kill your child.\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse: Inhalants\nPartnership to End Addiction: What are Inhalants?\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: A Parent\u2019s Guide to Preventing Inhalant Abuse\nLast Updated:February 1, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nInsect-borne diseases are viral and bacterial illnesses from insect (bug) bites. The most common insects that pass on disease are mosquitoes, sand flies, ticks, and fleas. For example, mosquitoes are known for spreading theZika virus, Yellow Fever, andMalaria. Ticks are known to spreadLyme diseaseand Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\nSymptoms will vary depending upon the type of insect that bit you. Common symptoms of insect-borne diseases can include:\nMore serious symptoms can include:\nThe diseases are caused by blood-sucking insects that infect humans when they bite. You increase your risk of being infected by an insect when you are in areas where they gather. This would include tall grass, bushes, spots near still water (ponds), sand, forests, and places around the globe with heavy outbreaks.\nYour doctor can typically diagnose an insect-borne disease with a physical exam, a review of your symptoms, and a look at your recent travel. Lab tests (blood and urine) can help diagnose certain insect-borne diseases.\nThere are many actions you can take to reduce the threat of being infected by an insect. You should:\nAs soon as you recognize a bite, clean it with soap and water. Pat it dry and apply rubbing alcohol.\nIf you were bitten by a tick, remove the tick right away before cleaning the area. Use tweezers to slowly pull it off your skin. Be careful not to leave any part of the tick on your skin. Dispose of the tick. Wash your hands and the bite area with soap and water and wipe with alcohol. Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic cream to the bite area.\nIf you have any of the symptoms listed, see your doctor. Your doctor may give you a prescription for antibiotic medicine. Take the entire prescription. Your doctor may suggest other treatments to ease the symptoms. For example, over-the-counter pain medicine can relieve sore muscles and a fever.\nSome insect-borne diseases cause long-term symptoms that affect your quality of life. Lyme disease, for example, can leave you with sore muscles and fatigue. Zika virus can be passed on to a baby and cause microcephaly (a condition that causes the head to be abnormally small) and intellectual disability.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Tick Removal\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Division of Vector-Borne Diseases\nWorld Health Organization: Vector-borne Diseases\nLast Updated:September 23, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nInsomnia is a sleep disorder that happens when you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. Acute insomnia is short-term trouble sleeping. It may last a few weeks then go away. Chronic insomnia is when your sleeping problem happens several nights a week and lasts for more than a few months. Many people have insomnia. However, it\u2019s more common in older adults, and more women than men have it.\nGetting enough sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Insomnia can affect you mentally and physically. It can make you feel tired, depressed, and irritable. It can also make it hard for you to concentrate or perform tasks during the day. If you have insomnia, you may worry about being able to sleep. Sometimes this can make sleeping harder.\nIf you don\u2019t get enough sleep on a regular basis, you\u2019re at increased risk of diseases. These includehigh blood pressure,heart disease, anddiabetes.\nMost adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. You know you\u2019re getting enough sleep if you don\u2019t feel sleepy during the day. The amount of sleep you need stays about the same throughout adulthood. However, sleep patterns may change as you age, and become less deep and restful. That is why older people may sleep less at night and take naps during the day.\nSymptoms of insomnia include\nPrimary insomnia is a distinct disorder. It usually lasts at least a month. It isn\u2019t well understood. Things that can cause this kind of insomnia include:\nSome cases of insomnia are a symptom or side effect of another problem. This is called secondary insomnia. Many different disorders can cause insomnia. They include:\nSecondary insomnia also can be caused by some medicines. These include asthma medicines, allergy or cold medicines, and certain heart and blood pressure medicines. Additionally, the use of some substances can cause insomnia. These include caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol.\nInsomnia can sometimes run in families.\nInsomnia is diagnosed primarily based on your medical and sleep history. Your doctor may ask you:\nIf you have a bed partner, your doctor may ask them if you snore while you sleep\nIf the cause of your insomnia isn\u2019t clear, your doctor may order a blood test. They also may ask you to wear a small monitor while you sleep. The information may help your doctor determine the cause of your insomnia\nYour doctor may suggest you keep a sleep diary. For a sleep diary, you record:\nTake your sleep diary to your next doctor\u2019s appointment. A sleep diary may help you and your doctor identify patterns and conditions that are affecting your sleep. Your doctor may also do a physical exam. This will help them rule out other medical problems that could be causing your insomnia.\nIf your doctor thinks another sleep disorder is causing your insomnia, they may order a sleep study. This is when you sleep in a lab overnight. Lab technicians monitor your brain activity, eye movements, oxygen levels, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. Or your doctor may order a type of sleep study that is done at home.\nThe best way to prevent insomnia is to develop a good sleep routine. In some cases, it can\u2019t be prevented or avoided.\nThere are several ways to treat insomnia. Treatment usually depends on your health and sleep history. It also may depend on what kind of insomnia you have.\nBehavioral therapy for insomnia can teach you about good sleep habits. It usually includes learning ways to relax and not worry as much about sleep. You can also learn muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises to help you relax. These are often just as effective as prescription sleeping medicines.\nYou don\u2019t need a doctor\u2019s prescription to get an over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aid. But it\u2019s a good idea to check with your doctor before you try one. OTC sleep aids are not meant to be used for a long time. Be sure to follow the directions on the label carefully. Don\u2019t drink alcohol while you are taking an OTC sleep aid.\nCertain supplements are advertised as treatments for insomnia. Some examples are melatonin and valerian. There isn\u2019t much evidence about how well these products work. Researchers don\u2019t know what the long-term effects of using them are. Talk to your doctor before you try one of these products.\nIn some cases, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help you fall asleep and stay asleep. Prescription sleeping pills may help you sleep better. Common ones include eszopiclone (brand name: Lunesta), zolpidem (brand name: Ambien), and zaleplon (brand name: Sonata)\nThese medicines can have side effects. Some may be serious. Side effects of prescription sleeping pills can include:\nRare but serious side effects include:\nDoctors generally don\u2019t recommend using prescription sleep medicines for long periods of time. They\u2019re not a cure for insomnia. Although they can help in some cases, they\u2019re only a temporary form of relief. Regular use may lead to rebound insomnia. This happens when you quit taking sleeping pills and your insomnia comes back even worse than before.\nSleeping pills can be unsafe to use if you have certain health problems. Ask your doctor if sleeping pills are right for you.\nKeep in mind that you may need less sleep as you age. Some people need only 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night, but most people do better with between 7 and 9 hours. Sleep usually occurs in 3-hour cycles, so it\u2019s important to get at least 3 uninterrupted hours of sleep.\nThese tips can help you develop better sleep habits:\nAnother good way to relax is to focus on your breathing by taking slow, deep breaths while counting to 5. Then listen to the sound of your breath as you breathe out. You can also try to tighten and relax the muscle groups in your body. Begin at your feet and work your way up to your face and head. A trained therapist can teach you other ways to relax. Listening to relaxation music may also help.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Insomnia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Insomnia\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nInsulin resistance is a condition linked toprediabetesand type 2 diabetes. It means your body is unable to respond to the amount of the hormone insulin it is producing. Insulin is made by your pancreas, one of your body\u2019s organs. It helps protect your body from getting too much sugar (glucose). Glucose gives you energy. However, too much sugar is harmful to your health.\nMost people don\u2019t realize they have insulin resistance until they have a blood test. Everyone has high blood sugar levels from time to time. However, when your body\u2019s sugar level is consistently high, you may notice you are thirstier than usual, urinate more, are more tired, have blurred vision, and have some tingling on the bottom of your feet.\nObesity(being significantly overweight and belly fat), an inactive lifestyle, and a diet high in carbohydrates are the primary causes of insulin resistance. Some women develop insulin resistance while they are pregnant. This is calledgestational diabetes. Certain diseases are associated with insulin resistance. That includes heart disease,nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, andpolycystic ovary syndrome.\nCertain risk factors are associated with insulin resistance, including:\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, your personal and family medical history, evaluate your weight, and take your blood pressure. Diagnosing insulin resistance requires a blood test. This might be done through a small finger prick or by having a small needle inserted into a vein to take a sample of blood. You will often be required to fast (avoid eating or drinking anything except water) 8 hours before the test. The blood sample will be sent to a lab for testing. It will test your fasting blood sugar. Anything more than 100 mg/dL is an indication of insulin resistance. Your doctor also may have the lab check your cholesterol levels (from the same blood sample). People with insulin resistance often have high cholesterol.\nYour doctor will also test your hemoglobin A1C level as part of the diagnostic workup. This is a similar blood test that offers the doctor a look at how your sugar levels have been during the past 3 months.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends blood glucose screening of all pregnant women for gestational diabetes after the 24th week of pregnancy. Also, the AAFP recommends blood glucose screening for adults age 40 to 70 years who are overweight or have obesity and may be at risk of heart disease.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid risk factors such as race, age, and a family medical history. You can take steps to reduce your insulin resistance by losing weight (even 10% can make a difference), exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Choose healthy carbohydrates. For example, eat whole grain bread instead of white bread, drink water instead of soda, and reduce your intake of sugary foods.\nIf you have or have had gestational diabetes, insulin resistance typically goes away after you give birth. However, you are at greater risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when you are older. That should be a warning to change your diet and lifestyle early so that you can delay it for as long as possible.\nDiet, weight loss, and exercise can improve insulin resistance. However, most people need medicine as well. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine that works best for your health and lifestyle needs. If your insulin resistance leads to uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, you may need insulin (given through a pump or daily injection).\nLiving with insulin resistance requires lifestyle changes as well as regular use of prescription medicine. You will have to be more careful in making meal and snack choices, reading labels, and maintaining a lower weight. You also will have to commit to regular exercise and take your medicines as prescribed.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Diabetes: Insulin Resistance and Diabetes\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Prediabetes\nNational Institutes of Health, National institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Insulin Resistance & Prediabetes\nLast Updated:September 9, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

People who have the condition have a bladder wall that is irritated and inflamed (sore and red). This inflammation can scar the bladder or make it stiff. A stiff bladder can\u2019t expand as urine fills it. In some cases, the walls of the bladder may bleed slightly. Some people get sores in the bladder lining. More than 3 million American women and 1 million men have interstitial cystitis.\nPeople who have interstitial cystitis may have the following symptoms:\nFor many women, the symptoms get worse before their menstrual period.

However, they do know that it isn\u2019t caused by bacterial or viral infections that can be tracked through standard tests.\nA defect in the lining of the bladder might cause the condition. Normally, the lining protects the bladder wall from the toxic effects of urine. In about 70% of the people who have interstitial cystitis, the protective layer of the bladder is \u201cleaky.\u201d This may let urine irritate the bladder wall, causing interstitial cystitis. If the urine contains an abnormal substance, it can be even more irritating.\nOther possible causes may be an increase of histamine-producing cells in the bladder wall (allergy). Or it could be caused by an autoimmune response. This is when your body mistakenly fights something healthy elsewhere in your body.\nIt\u2019s difficult to diagnose cystitis, so your doctor may have to rule out other conditions first.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMost people\u2019s feet point straight ahead or outward. Some people, however, have feet that point inward. This is called intoeing. It is also called \u201cpigeon toes.\u201d Intoeing is very common in young children. Most of the time, intoeing goes away without treatment. In a few children, it doesn\u2019t get better on its own and must be treated.\nWhen your child has intoeing, their feet point inward toward each other. The condition usually does not cause pain or any other symptoms.\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear why some children develop intoeing. Family history could play a role. A lack of space in the womb can also cause some bones to rotate.\nThere are three causes of intoeing in healthy children.\nInternal tibial torsion.This is the most common cause of intoeing. Internal tibial torsion is a twist in the\u00a0tibia\u00a0(the leg bone between the\u00a0knee\u00a0and the ankle). Some inward twist of the tibia is normal in babies. Usually this twist straightens out during the baby\u2019s first year. In some children, the twist doesn\u2019t straighten enough for the feet to point straight ahead or outward. These are the children who intoe when they begin walking. Leg bones usually continue to grow straighter until the child is 6 to 8 years old.\nExcess\u00a0femoral\u00a0anteversion.Excess femoral anteversion is an inward twist in the\u00a0femur\u00a0(thigh bone). All babies are born with some inward twist of the thigh bone. This cause of intoeing usually shows up in children between 2 and 4 years of age. It can get worse during early childhood.\nMetatarsus adductus.Metatarsus adductus is a curve in the foot. It causes the toe to point inward. It is commonly seen in newborns and infants. The curve in the foot is probably caused before the baby is born. The feet are pressed into this position inside the\u00a0uterus. In 9 out of 10 children with this problem, the feet straighten as the child grows up.\nYour doctor will look at your child\u2019s foot. They will watch the way your child walks. They may order tests, such as X-rays. This will help them determine if any bones are rotated.\nThere is nothing that can be done to prevent intoeing in your child.\nTreatment for your child\u2019s intoeing depends on\u00a0the cause. In most cases, treatment is not necessary. The problems resolve over time.\nMost doctors don\u2019t give any treatment for internal tibial torsion in young children. Braces and special shoes are not helpful. They are expensive. Children often don\u2019t like to wear them, so they are seldom used. In a small number of children, the twist in the tibia doesn\u2019t go away. Even if the twist remains, it hasn\u2019t been shown to cause\u00a0joint damage, arthritis,\u00a0or problems with running and jumping.\nSometimes appearance is a problem. In this case, the treatment is surgery to cut the bones and turn (rotate) them outward, so the feet point straight. Very few children have to have this surgery. This is something that must be carefully discussed with your child\u2019s doctor.\nExcess femoral anteversion usually gets better by itself. In most children, the feet will point straight ahead or outward by the time they are 6 to 8 years old. Braces or shoe modifications typically won\u2019t help. A few children with a very strong inward twist of the thigh bone may need to have surgery. The bone is cut and twisted outward, so the feet will point straight ahead. Surgery is only considered in very severe cases.\nYour doctor may show you how to stretch the baby\u2019s foot to help the foot get straighter. If the foot shape is very curved or the curve doesn\u2019t go away, your doctor may treat your baby by putting casts or braces on their feet. This will help stretch them into a straight position. If the feet still have some curve after treatment, it will not cause any problems with running and playing. It is not painful.\nIntoeing usually doesn\u2019t cause serious problems, even if it doesn\u2019t go away by itself. Sometimes children have problems getting shoes that fit, because of the curve of their feet. This fitting problem might make parents consider treatment for their child. Intoeing doesn\u2019t cause arthritis or clumsiness.\nLast Updated:March 18, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nIntussusception is a serious problem with the intestine. It occurs when one part of the\u00a0intestine\u00a0slides into another section. This causes the intestine to fold and become blocked. This prevents the passage of food through the intestine.\nIntussusception can occur in adults. However, it is more common in infants and young children. It is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it may cause severe complications. These could include\u00a0infection\u00a0or even death.\nThe first sign of intussusception is severe abdominal pain. It could last for 15 to 20 minutes. It often gets worse as time goes on. Other signs your child may have intussusception include:\nThere is no known cause for most cases of intussusception. Rarely, some conditions could lead to intussusception. These include:\nIntussusception is the most common cause of intestinal blockage in children between 3 months and 3 years of age. Most cases of intussusception occur in babies younger than 1 year of age. For unknown reasons, boys are affected more often than girls. Intussusception also occurs in older children and adults. However, there are fewer cases in these groups.\nYour doctor will ask questions about your child\u2019s symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may be able to feel the part of the intestine that is tender. Your doctor might order an ultrasound of the intestine. This imaging test uses sounds waves to create pictures to see if intussusception is causing your child\u2019s symptoms. Your doctor may also order an abdominal X-ray.\nSince the there is no known cause, there is no way to prevent or avoid intussusception.\nIn many cases, intussusception is corrected with an air enema. Your doctor will use a small tube to fill your child\u2019s\u00a0rectum with air. The air pushes the folded intestine back into place. This clears the blockage. Your doctor may also want to get an X-ray of your child\u2019s abdomen to see if the procedure was effective. Antibiotics can be used to treat an infection but are usually not needed. Sometimes the intestine doesn\u2019t stop collapsing or it is caused by a\u00a0tumor\u00a0or polyp. In those cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the problem. Your child may need intravenous fluid to stay hydrated until treatment is complete.\nBecause intussusception is a medical emergency, seek medical help immediately if your child has symptoms of intussusception. When left untreated, intussusception may cause severe complications.\nWith prompt treatment, most children recover completely from intussusception. Occasionally, complications such as infection can occur if the intussusception is not treated quickly. If this happens, part of the\u00a0bowel\u00a0must be surgically removed. It is important to see your doctor right away if your child has symptoms of intussusception.\nIntussusception sometimes returns, usually within 3 days. Keep close watch for returning symptoms.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Intussusception \u2013 children\nLast Updated:August 18, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Jock itch appears as a skin rash around the groin, but can appear on your upper thigh, scrotum, penis, and anus. It is not serious. However, the itching can be extremely uncomfortable, even painful.\nJock itch rash appears red, purple, gray, tan, or white. It is usually raised and scaly around the edges. The rash itches. Like a blister, the rash can ooze fluid. The center of the rash is reddish-brown.\nJock itch is caused by exposure to the fungus. This can happen through direct skin-to-skin contact. In some cases, it happens if you have athlete\u2019s foot (anotherfungal infection) when you have touched your feet and then your groin area. It also can be spread through infected clothing. The jock itch fungus grows in moist conditions, such as steamy public shower facilities and locker rooms, and in damp towels and clothing.\nYour doctor can usually tell whether the rash is jock itch by the way it looks. They also will ask you questions about your exposure to places where the rash is spread. If your doctor is uncertain, they may scrape a sample of the rash off your body to send to the lab.\nThe best way to avoid or prevent jock itch is to carefully dry off and wear clean, dry clothes after using a public shower facility or locker room. Don\u2019t share towels with others. Be sure to wash your clothing and towel after each exposure. Don\u2019t leave sweaty or damp clothing stuffed into a bag.

It causes joint pain and swelling. It typically starts before the age of 16 and is long-term. The disease is sometimes called juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\nIf you\u2019re having joint pain, tell your family doctor. Treating early can help prevent or reduce lifelong disability.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Shweta Akhouri\nSymptoms are different among children. Typically, joints become swollen, stiff, painful, and warm to the touch. They may start as early as 6 months of age. Your child may limp, especially in the morning when stiffness is the worst. They may have lower back pain and avoid normal activities. Symptoms may come and go. They may be mild or intense. Symptoms can last for a short time or for years. There are four types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms depend on the type:\nSerious cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can affect a child\u2019s growth. See your doctor if your child has symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe cause of the disease is not known. Doctors suspect it is caused by an autoimmune illness. This is when your body attacks and destroys its own healthy tissue.\nYour child\u2019s doctor will ask about your child\u2019s symptoms and do a physical exam. It can be hard to diagnose. You doctor may do an X-ray or blood test to rule out other illnesses. X-rays also can show more severe damage or deformities. Your child\u2019s doctor may want to take a sample of fluid from an actively inflamed joint or spinal fluid. It may take a few months before your doctor makes a diagnosis. This is so they can watch your child\u2019s symptoms over time.\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis cannot be prevented or avoided. Certain lifestyle changes can lessen your child\u2019s discomfort. This includes exercise (walking, biking, and swimming). Warm up before exercising. A physical therapist can offer your child a plan for home exercises. Ask your doctor about seeing a physical therapist for home exercise to reduce pain.\nYour doctor may recommend medicine for pain and swelling. This includes both prescription and over-the-counter medicine. Over-the-counter medicine includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID.) This includes ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin). It reduces joint swelling.\nIf this does not help, your child\u2019s doctor may suggest more powerful NSAIDs. This would be a prescription. For severe symptoms, your child\u2019s doctor may need steroid treatments to reduce swelling. Your child\u2019s doctor may prescribe medicine to treat an autoimmune illness. These medicines slow your child\u2019s immune system to reduce further joint damage.\nChildren rarely need surgery to treat the disease. Badly damaged joints may require soft tissue surgery. This is if the joints are bent or deformed. Joint replacement surgery can help badly damaged joints. With proper treatment, many children lead full, normal, and symptom-free lives.\nWhether your child\u2019s symptoms come and go or are long-lasting some things can help. This includes:\nBeing active is important in managing the disease. Children who have the disease may need emotional support.

They can range in size from smaller than an inch to 12 inches or more.\nAfter your skin is injured, your cells try to repair it by forming a scar.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nThe kidneys remove waste from your blood. They do this by filtering the blood and making urine. As people get older, sacs filled with fluid can form in the kidneys. These sacs are called \u201ccysts.\u201d They are usually small, oval or round thin-walled sacs with watery fluid in them.\nKidney cysts are almost always benign (not cancerous). Usually, the cysts don\u2019t cause any problems. In fact, people can go through life without even knowing that they have them.\nSome people have kidney cysts caused by an inherited disease calledpolycystic kidney disease (PKD). This disease can cause symptoms such as high blood pressure, pain in the back and side, blood in the urine, or frequent kidney infections. Not all people who have PKD will have these symptoms.\nUp to 50 percent of people older than 50 years of age have kidney cysts.\nIf you have kidney cysts, you may have these symptoms:\nIf you\u2019re having any of these symptoms, you should contact your doctor.\nIf your kidney cysts are caused by PKD, then they are inherited. This means you have them because they run in your family. For most people, though, this is not the case. Doctors aren\u2019t sure why the cysts form for them. It could be that the kidney surface weakens over time. This could explain why cysts on the kidneys are most common in people who are age 50 and older.\nAlmost all kidney cysts are found on imaging tests that create a picture of your internal organs. These tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Sometimes kidney cysts are found when one of these tests is performed for another reason.\nBecause doctors aren\u2019t sure what causes them, kidney cysts cannot be prevented or avoided.\nIf you\u2019re not having any of the symptoms listed in the \u201cSymptoms\u201d section, and your kidney cyst is small, you may not need any treatment. Your doctor might want to check the cyst again with a CT scan in 6 to 12 months.\nIf you start having problems, your doctor might want you to have a CT or MRI scan of your kidney to see if the cyst is growing.\nIf the cyst on your kidney is large or if it contains calcifications (hard, stony pieces) or dense tissue, you might need to have CT scans every so often. This allows your doctor to watch for changes in the cyst.\nIf your cyst is blocking blood flow or urine flow, your doctor may have to treat it. He or she may use a procedure called sclerotherapy. During sclerotherapy, your doctor will use a long needle to drain the cyst. He or she will then fill the cyst with an alcohol solution to harden kidney tissue.\nIf your cyst isn\u2019t causing any problems, it probably won\u2019t need to be removed. If it is getting larger or if it\u2019s causing problems, your doctor may send you to a urologist (a doctor who has special training in kidney problems).\nIf you are over 50 years old, there is a good chance you have cysts on your kidneys and don\u2019t realize it. You may never realize it because you may never have symptoms. And most kidney cysts do not cause any problems.\nIf you do have symptoms (back or belly pain, blood in your urine, etc.), see your doctor.

This bacterium can travel to your kidney(s) from somewhere else in your urinary tract, such as your bladder. It\u2019s very common to get a kidney infection if you already have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Women tend to get kidney infections and UTIs more often than men.

These waste products leave your body in the urine your kidneys make. When the waste products don\u2019t properly leave your kidneys, it can result in kidney stones.\nA kidney stone is a hard, solid lump that forms in your kidney. The lump can be as small as a tiny pebble or it can be much bigger. It\u2019s made from the waste products in your urine.\nA kidney stone may stay in your kidney. It also may travel from your kidneys down the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the ureters, bladder, and the urethra. If the stone is big enough, it can get stuck in your kidney or urinary tract. This can be very painful.\nKidney stones can cause a severe cramping pain in your lower back or side. The pain usually moves down toward your abdomen, groin, or genitals as the stone moves down the urinary tract. Other symptoms may include:\nThere are four types of kidney stones. Thecalcium stoneis the most common type. Calcium that isn\u2019t used by your bones and muscles goes to your kidneys. Usually, the kidneys will get rid of the extra calcium through the urine. Calcium stones occur when some of the calcium remains in the kidneys and collects over time.\nAstruvite stoneis more common in women. It usually forms after a chronic urinary tract infection. These stones are usually made of ammonia.\nAuric acid stoneforms when there is too much uric acid in the urine. You may be at risk for this type of stone if you eat a high-protein diet or if you\u2019ve received chemotherapy.\nAcystine stoneisn\u2019t very common. The disease that causes cystine stones to form runs in families and is called cystinuria.\nMost of the time, you\u2019ll be able to pass your kidney stone without the help of a doctor. If your kidney stone gets stuck in the urinary tract, you may need your doctor\u2019s help.\nTo determine if you have a kidney stone, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. He or she will take a sample of your urine. Your doctor will order images of your kidneys and urinary tract.\nMost people who have kidney stones have a 50% chance of developing another kidney stone within 10 years. But there are things you can do to lower your risk:\nThere are several risk factors for kidney stones, including:\nIf the stone is small enough, you might be able to pass it in your urine. Your doctor can give you medicine to help with the pain. Your doctor may also suggest you filter your urine and submit any stones for further testing or analysis.\nIf the stone is too big or is causing an infection, your doctor may intervene. They may suggest a procedure or refer you to a urologist. They may use a special machine that uses shock waves to break up the stone into smaller pieces. This is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, or SSWL.\nA urologist (urinary tract surgical specialist) can put a very thin instrument through your urethra and into your bladder and ureters to find the stone. He or she can then pull it out or break it into smaller pieces. If a doctor does this, you will be given medicine to numb the area first.\nSurgery is also an option and is sometimes the only way to get rid of a kidney stone.\nIf you have had more than one kidney stone, your doctor might send you to a specialist to find the exact cause of your stones.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nLabyrinthitis (say: \u201clab-uh-rinth-eye-tus\u201d) is a condition that affects a part of the inner ear called the labyrinth. Normally, the labyrinth helps you keep your balance. When it gets swollen, the labyrinth doesn\u2019t work properly. This makes it so that your brain doesn\u2019t get the right balance signals. Labyrinthitis can make you feel like you are falling or spinning, even though you aren\u2019t.\nSymptoms of labyrinthitis can range from mild to severe. You may have symptoms as soon as you wake up in the morning, or they may occur suddenly throughout the day. Common symptoms include the following:\nIf you have symptoms of labyrinthitis, talk to your doctor. Other conditions can cause similar symptoms. Get medical care right away if you experience vertigo with a fever above 101\u02daF, fainting, convulsions, slurred speech, paralysis, double vision, or severe vomiting.\nThe swelling in the inner ear that causes labyrinthitis often results from an infection. For example, people often develop labyrinthitis after having an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold.\nYour doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and examine you. Your doctor may do some tests to be sure that another condition isn\u2019t causing your labyrinthitis.\nBecause labyrinthitis is caused by an underlying condition, you can reduce your risk of getting it. For example, wash your hands regularly and try to avoid germs during cold and flu season. Limiting your exposure to these illnesses will reduce your risk of labyrinthitis.\nYou may also reduce your risk by not drinking large amounts of alcohol or smoking.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also called NSAIDs) are sometimes used to reduce swelling. These include ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Steroid medicines are another option to reduce swelling. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to relieve nausea, vomiting and dizziness. However, even without treatment, the symptoms of labyrinthitis will usually go away after several weeks.\nIf you have vomiting that is severe and uncontrollable, you may need to spend a short time in the hospital to prevent dehydration.\nYou will probably need to take it easy for at least a week or two. During this time, avoid activities like driving, climbing or operating heavy equipment. Sudden dizziness can make these activities dangerous. Tips to help you feel better include the following:\nYour most severe symptoms will probably get better after the first week. Most people are completely better within 2 to 3 months. Sensitivity to motion may be a problem for several years, especially for older adults. In rare cases, people may have permanent hearing loss. This is less likely if labyrinthitis is treated promptly.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Labyrinthitis\nLast Updated:June 17, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

This liquid is processed to make many of the following rubber products used at home and at work:\nIn addition, many medical and dental supplies contain latex, including:\nYou can find non-latex substitutes for all of these latex-containing items.\nThe protein in rubber can cause an allergic reaction in some people. This reaction can range from sneezing to anaphylactic shock. This type of shock is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\nThe thin, stretchy latex rubber in gloves, condoms, and balloons is high in this protein. It causes more allergic reactions than products made of hard latex rubber (such as tires). Some latex gloves are coated with cornstarch powder. Latex protein particles can stick to the cornstarch and fly into the air when the gloves are taken off. In places where gloves are being put on and removed frequently, the air may contain many latex particles.\nLatex allergy can be mild or severe, with symptoms such as:\nSome people who wear latex gloves get bumps, sores, cracks, or red, raised areas on their hands. These symptoms usually appear 12 to 36 hours after contact with latex. Changing to non-latex gloves, using glove liners, and paying more attention to hand care can help relieve these symptoms.\nA person who is highly allergic to latex can also have a life-threatening allergic reaction, called anaphylactic shock. Symptoms include:\nSomeone having an anaphylactic reaction needs immediate medical attention.\nLatex products are everywhere. Anyone can develop a latex allergy. Health care workers and rubber industry workers seem to have the highest risk for latex allergy. Health care workers who have hay fever have an especially high chance of developing a latex allergy. This is because 25% of all health care workers who have hay fever show signs of being sensitive to latex.\nOther people at higher risk for latex allergy are:\nSome rubber proteins are similar to food proteins. Therefore, some foods may also cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to latex. The most common of these foods are banana, avocado, chestnut, kiwi fruit, and passion fruit. Although many other foods can cause an allergic reaction, avoiding all of them might cause nutrition problems. Therefore, it\u2019s recommended that you avoid only the foods that have already given you an allergic reaction.\nIf you think you have a latex allergy, see a doctor. You should preferably see one with experience in treating latex allergy. Your doctor will take a detailed history and may confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. Skin testing is usually not used to test for latex allergy, except in some specialized centers. It can cause severe reactions if it isn\u2019t done by an experienced person.\nIf you are a health care worker or a patient, everyone around you should wear powder-free latex gloves or non-latex gloves. If you are a health care worker, compare different kinds of non-latex gloves to find the ones that are best for you.\nAlways wear or carry a medical alert bracelet, necklace, or keychain. This will warn emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and doctors that you are allergic to latex. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for an epinephrine self-injection pen. You will use this pen in case of a serious reaction. You may wish to carry non-latex gloves with you all the time. Emergency personnel can use these if you need medical attention.\nIf you are exposed to latex at your job, tell your employer and co-workers about your latex allergy. Avoid latex gloves completely if you\u2019re not at risk for blood and body fluid contamination. Use powder-free gloves if latex gloves are preferable. These measures will help keep others from becoming allergic to latex.\nAlthough there is no treatment for latex allergy, you can reduce your risk of reaction by avoiding direct contact with latex. Take steps to find out which products in your environment contain latex. Then, find substitutes you can use for those products. It\u2019s also important to avoid breathing in latex particles from powdered gloves or other sources.\nTake steps to educate yourself and others about latex allergy.

It can affect the skin and the nerves of the hands and feet as well as the eyes and the lining of the nose. In some cases, leprosy can also affect other organs, such as the kidneys and testicles in men. If left untreated, leprosy can cause deformities of the hands and feet,\u00a0blindness, and\u00a0kidney\u00a0failure.\nLeprosy is also called Hansen\u2019s disease.\nLeprosy progresses very slowly. Most people who have leprosy do not develop symptoms for at least a year after being infected by the bacteria. In most cases, it takes 5 to 7 years for symptoms to develop.\nLeprosy damages the nerves and muscles. It may cause sores, lesions, lumps, and bumps to appear on the skin. There are 2 types of leprosy: tuberculoid leprosy and lepromatous leprosy. Tuberculoid leprosy is the less severe and less\u00a0contagious\u00a0form of the disease. Lepromatous leprosy is more severe and generalized. It is also more contagious. This type of leprosy may affect organs such as the kidneys, testicles (in men), eyes, and nose.\nDepending on the type of leprosy, symptoms may include:\nDoctors aren\u2019t exactly sure how leprosy spreads. Leprosy is not very contagious. You can\u2019t catch it by touching someone who has the disease. Most cases of leprosy are from repeated and long-term contact with someone who has the disease. Doctors believe that leprosy might be passed from person to person. This happens by breathing in droplets that get into the air when infected people cough or\u00a0sneeze. Most people who come in contact withM. lepraedo not develop leprosy. However, people whose\u00a0immune\u00a0systems are weakened from chronic disease (such asdiabetes,HIV,AIDS, or\u00a0heart\u00a0disease) may be more likely to develop leprosy. This is because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the bacteria.\nChildren are more likely to develop leprosy than adults.\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your medical history and the symptoms you are experiencing. They will probably want to remove a tiny piece of the affected skin (called a\u00a0biopsy) to check for theM. lepraebacteria.\nEven though the risk of catching leprosy is very low, you can still reduce your risk. The best way to prevent leprosy is to avoid contact with body fluids and the rashes of people who have leprosy.\nLeprosy is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics can kill all theM. lepraebacteria in your body, but they can\u2019t reverse\u00a0nerve\u00a0damage or deformities caused by leprosy. This is why early treatment is important. You may need to take antibiotics for 6 months or longer, depending on the severity of your infection.\nIf left untreated, leprosy can cause permanent damage to the nerves in the fingers, toes, hands, and feet. This may affect a person\u2019s ability to feel pain and temperature in these areas of the body. When you can\u2019t feel your fingers or toes, you may accidentally burn, cut, or hurt yourself. Repeated injuries and nerve damage can cause muscle weakness, deformities, and even the loss of fingers and toes. Untreated leprosy can also cause swelling, and skin sores and lesions that are more severe.\nIf leprosy damages the lining of the nose, it can cause frequentnosebleedsand constant stuffiness. If leprosy damages your eyes, it can lead toglaucomaand even blindness. Lepromatous leprosy can reduce the amount of the male hormone testosterone and sperm counts in men. This can lead toerectile dysfunctionandinfertility.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nLeukemia is cancer of the white blood cells. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Inside your bones is a substance called bone marrow. This is where the blood cells are made. When you have leukemia, the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells. The abnormal cells build up and crowd out healthy blood cells. This makes it hard for your blood to do what it is supposed to do.\nThere are 4 main types of leukemia:\nAcute types develop and grow quickly. Chronic types grow slowly. Lymphocytic or myeloid refers to which kind of white blood cells are abnormal. Each type of leukemia has different symptoms and is treated differently.\nLeukemia is most common in adults over age 60. But it also happens to children. It is among the most common forms of cancer in children under age 15.\nThe symptoms of leukemia depend on which kind it is. Symptoms of chronic leukemia tend to come on slowly over time. They include:\nSome people with chronic leukemia don\u2019t have any symptoms. They don\u2019t know they have it until they get a blood test incidentally.\nSymptoms of acute leukemia include:\nTiny red spots under the skin\nIn many cases, the cause of leukemia is not known. There are some factors that can increase your risk of developing one or more of the types. These include:\nYour doctor will ask you a lot of questions about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam to look for signs of leukemia. These signs might include pale skin or swollen lymph nodes. They will likely order blood tests. These tests can look for abnormal levels in your blood that could indicate leukemia. They may also order a test of your bone marrow. In this test, a sample of bone marrow is removed and looked at under a microscope.\nIf your doctor thinks you have leukemia, they will probably order further tests. These can confirm the diagnosis. They can also determine what kind of leukemia you have, and how far it has spread in your body.\nIn most cases, there is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid leukemia. Most people who have the risk factors don\u2019t get leukemia. Most people who get leukemia don\u2019t have the risk factors.\nThere are several treatment options for leukemia. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:\nCommon available treatments include:\nChemotherapy \u2013Powerful medicines are used to kill cancer cells. They are given through an IV (directly into the vein) or in pill form. This is the primary treatment for leukemia. Chemotherapy can cause unpleasant side effects. These include weakness, exhaustion, and hair loss.\nRadiation therapy \u2013High-energy rays are used to kill cancer cells. You lie on a table while a large machine moves around you. It directs the radiation into your body. It is a painless procedure. Radiation can cause some side effects as well, including fatigue, skin problems, and a low blood count.\nTargeted therapy \u2013Special medicines block the growth and spread of specific cancer cells. They can be given in an IV or as a pill. Common side effects of targeted therapy includediarrheaand liver problems. Other side effects might include problems with blood clotting and wound healing, high blood pressure,fatigue, mouth sores, nail changes, the loss of hair color, and skin problems, such as rash or dry skin.\nStem cell transplant \u2013This procedure removes your cancerous bone marrow and replaces it with healthy bone marrow. You may be able to use your own stem cells. You may need a donor. It is very similar to a bone marrow transplant. It normally follows chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Side effects can include mouth and throat pain, nausea and vomiting, and infection.\nWith treatment, leukemia can go into remission. How well you do after treatment depends on many things. This includes how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated or undetected, cancer can spread to other parts of the body. This could cause serious health problems or be fatal. It is important to get treatment as soon as possible.\nLiving with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active. Living with leukemia can affect your emotions. Get support where you need it. Family, friends, counselors, or support groups can all help you emotionally.\nEven after your cancer is gone, you are at higher risk of cancer returning. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Leukemia\nNational Cancer Institute: Leukemia \u2014 Patient Version\nLast Updated:August 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is marked by purple bumps that are flat and uneven in size. The bumps may have white scales or flakes on them. Often, the rash is itchy.\nLichen planus commonly occurs on your wrists, ankles, and chest. You also can get it on your scalp, nails, genitals, or the inside of your mouth. On the scalp, lichen planus may cause hair loss. Lichen planus of the nails can cause brittle or split nails. In the mouth, the rash looks like lacy white patches on the cheeks or tongue. Lichen planus of the mouth, genitals, or anus can cause soreness and a burning sensation. Sometimes lichen planus affects areas of skin where you had a cut or burn.\nMen and women can get lichen planus. It can affect people of any age but is more common in middle-aged adults.\nThe prime symptom of lichen planus is itching. It can be mild or severe. The rash may consist of a few bumps or large patches. These can last for weeks or months and can return once they\u2019ve gone away. Sometimes, the bumps leave dark brown spots on the skin. This is more common in people who are Asian, Hispanic, and Black. The brown spots are not scars and fade over time.\nLichen planus inside the mouth can cause painful sores that make it hard to eat.\nIn most cases, the cause of lichen planus is unknown. Doctors think it could be caused by an allergic reaction or immune disease. The rash breaks out when your body\u2019s immune system attacks the skin or mucous cells. Some cases may be linked to thehepatitis Cvirus. Some medications also can cause it.\nLichen planus is not contagious. You cannot catch it from or give it to someone else. It is not caused bystress, but sometimes stress makes it worse.\nContact your doctor if you have the symptoms listed above. They can tell if you have lichen planus by looking at your rash. The doctor may do a blood test or skin biopsy. These tests help rule out other issues. For biopsy, the doctor takes skin cells from one or more of the bumps. The cells are sent to a lab to confirm the diagnosis.\nYou cannot prevent lichen planus because the exact cause is unknown.\nThere is no cure for lichen planus. Most of the time, the bumps caused by lichen planus go away without any treatment after about a year. However, treatment can help improve the rash and reduce symptoms.\nTypes of treatment include:\nLichen planus of the scalp must be treated right away or the hair may not grow back.\nTreatment can help symptoms of lichen planus but does not cure it. Once the rash goes away, there is a chance it can come back. If your doctor prescribes medicine, follow the instructions. Try to avoid itching the bumps too much.

It can cause a rash, itching, pain, and scarring. Lichen sclerosus is most common in women after menopause. However, men and children can get it too.\nSome people who have lichen sclerosus do not have any symptoms. Others may have the following symptoms or signs:\nDoctors do not know the exact cause of lichen sclerosus. Possible causes are:\nA family history of the condition may increase your risk of getting it. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. You cannot catch it from or pass it to someone else.\nContact your doctor if you have symptoms of lichen sclerosus. Your doctor will perform a physical exam. They will want to know your health history and how long you have had the symptoms. Your doctor may do a skin biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of skin from the affected area to look at in the lab.\nThere is no way to avoid lichen sclerosus because the cause is unknown.\nNot all cases of lichen sclerosus can be cured. However, there are treatment options to manage or relieve symptoms. Your doctor will probably prescribe a strong cortisone cream. Apply this to the affected area according to the instructions. This can help relieve pain and itching but cannot repair scars.\nRepeated use of cortisone cream often is effective. Continue to follow up with your doctor during this treatment. Cortisone cream can have side effects over time. These include thinning or redness of the skin, stretch marks, and genital yeast infections.\nMedicines are available if you have an infection or are allergic to cortisone. Options include:\nOver-the-counter antihistamine skin creams may help with the pain and itching. A sitz bath also can help with pain, itching, and scratching. This is where you sit in a few inches of warm water.\nThere are other things you can do to help relieve discomfort:\nLichen sclerosus often can be managed with treatment. If left untreated, the conditions can have serious effects. Severe cases may cause severe pain during sex.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nLipomas are benign (not cancerous), slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells. They are usually round, moveable lumps under the skin. They feel soft and doughy or rubbery. Lipomas usually grow in the neck, shoulders, back, or arms. They are the most common noncancerous tumor in adults. Most lipomas do not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.\nOften, a lipoma has been growing for years before it is noticeable. It is fairly common to have more than one lipoma. If you notice a lump or swelling anywhere on your body, you should have it checked by your family doctor. In some cases, a lump can be a sign of a more serious problem.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes lipomas to grow. They can occur at any age, but they often appear when you\u2019re between 40 and 60 years of age. Sometimes they run in families. Sometimes they are caused by an injury. Lipomas are not caused by being overweight.\nTests are usually not needed to diagnose a lipoma. Your doctor can usually diagnose it just by looking at it and feeling the firmness of the lump. They may order an ultrasound to get an image of the growth to confirm the diagnosis.\nThere is no proven method for preventing lipomas from forming.\nLipomas are almost always benign. They usually do not need treatment. If they are painful or are growing quickly, you may want to have treatment. Treatment options include steroid shots, liposuction, or surgery to remove the lipoma. This can even be done in your doctor\u2019s office. Your doctor can help you decide what is right for you.\nOnce your doctor confirms that you have a lipoma, you can choose your next step.

    "list_title": "Long COVID: Symptoms and Treatment",
    "article_title": "Long COVID symptoms",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nMost people who get sick with COVID-19 will recover within a week or even a few days. But for some, the symptoms of the disease can linger for weeks, months, or sometimes longer. This is known as long COVID. Long COVID can also refer to any medical condition that is linked to a COVID-19 infection that lasts for more than 3 months after your symptoms first appear.\nThe symptoms of long COVID are similar to those of COVID-19 itself. They can also include additional symptoms. People with long COVID may have problems from different combinations of symptoms that may come and go over time.\nThe most common symptoms include:\nOther symptoms can include joint or muscle pain, a rash, or changes in menstrual cycles. Some symptoms may get worse after physical or mental effort.\nSome people with long COVID may also have symptoms that don\u2019t show up on tests and are hard to explain. If you think you have long COVID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends you reviewthese tipsbefore visiting your doctor.\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure yet why some people get long COVID while others don\u2019t. There are many potential factors, but no one cause has been determined. Some potential factors include:\nYour doctor will diagnose long COVID by listening to your symptoms and your health history. If you have already been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, your doctor may order more tests to learn more about your symptoms and how to treat them.\nThis could include blood tests, chest x-rays or other imaging and lung function tests, which will tell your doctor how well your lungs are working.\nYour doctor may also order other screenings including CT scans, which can measure how inflamed your lungs are; and electrocardiograms, which can help find issues with your heart.\nWhile there is no 100% surefire way to prevent yourself from getting long COVID, you can take precautions that can dramatically lower your risk. Because you can\u2019t get long COVID without getting COVID-19 first, the prevention steps for both are the same. They include:\nIf you believe you have COVID-19, the first step is to get a test. You can test at home. If you cannot afford to purchase an at-home test at your local retail store, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will provide residential households in the U.S. withfour, free at-home testsfrom the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).\nIn general, testing availability may differ depending on where you live. There are someno-cost testing centers. Check yourlocal health departmentto see what locations near you are doing testing and if there is a fee to test. This may include hospitals and pharmacies that offer drive-thru testing during high COVID-19 infection periods in your local community. This will allow you to stay in your car to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. Depending on the location, someone may approach your car to collect a sample, or they may ask you to collect it yourself. Samples for COVID-19 viral tests are collected through nasal swabs. Depending on where you get your test, you may get your results the same day or you may have to wait a few days. Find out more aboutCOVID-19 testing.\nWhere you live or work can increase your chances of getting COVID-19 and long COVID, as can your access to health care. If you have underlying health conditions or have not been vaccinated, you should seek treatment as soon as symptoms appear.\nThere is some evidence that taking antiviral medications within five days of a positive COVID test can reduce your risk of long COVID. Talk to your doctor if you have a positive test result.\nBecause it can include so many different symptoms, there is not just one treatment for long COVID. Your doctor may try a variety of approaches to find one that works best for you.\nThe most common treatments include:\nAs the name implies, long COVID can mean that symptoms will occur for weeks, months and in some cases more than a year. You should see your doctor if you have symptoms that recur after your first COVID symptoms have gone away or if they disrupt your daily life.\nWhile doctors are learning more every day about long COVID, there is still much that is unknown. Long COVID symptoms can also vary from person to person. It may take some trial and error to properly treat your symptoms.\nIf you had COVID-19 and were hospitalized or needed intensive care, your risk for having long COVID increases. There is also new evidence that repeated COVID-19 infections could increase the likelihood of developing long COVID. That is why it is important to get the vaccine. Even if you do get COVID-19, the vaccine will reduce your chances of getting severely ill.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions\nThe Cleveland Clinic: Long COVID\nFamilydoctor.org: COVID-19\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nEsta informaci\u00f3n proporciona una visi\u00f3n general y puede que no se aplique a todos.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nLow back pain is a common problem for many people. Different things can cause it, including injuries and certain conditions. You can help prevent pain in your lower back by learning how to sit, stand, lift, and exercise correctly.\nLow back pain varies by person. It may be a dull ache or a sharp, stabbing pain. It could be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). You may have pain in other parts of your body as well as your back.\nCall your doctor if:\nInjuries are a common cause of low back pain. Examples include a muscle strain or spasm, ligament sprain, joint problem, or a \u201cslipped disk.\u201d A slipped disk, orherniated disk, has to do with your spine. It occurs when a disk between the bones of your spine swells or bulges and presses on your nerves. Twisting while lifting often causes this. Many people who have a slipped disk do not know what caused it. Often, the exact cause of back pain may not be clear.\nYou may have pain in your lower back after doing an activity you aren\u2019t used to, such as lifting heavy furniture or doing yard work. Sudden events, such as a fall or a car wreck, can cause back pain. You also may have pain from an injury to another part of your body.\nVisit your doctor if you have pain in your lower back. They will review your symptoms and health history and do a physical exam. Based on this information, your doctor may perform tests. These include an X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tests may help to diagnose the cause but more often can help rule out other causes.\nThere are several things you can do to prevent or avoid low back pain. These include learning correct posture and strengthening your muscles.\nSit in chairs with straight backs or low-back support. Keep your knees a little higher than your hips. Adjust the seat or use a low stool to prop up your feet. To turn in your chair, move your whole body rather than twist at your waist.\nWhen driving, sit straight and move the seat forward. This helps you not have to lean to reach the controls. You may want to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind your lower back if you must drive or sit for a long time.\nMaintain good posture while you stand. Keep your ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line, with your head up and your stomach pulled in. Try not to slouch or arch your back. These put added pressure on your lower back. Wear shoes that are comfortable and provide support. If you stand for long periods, rest 1 foot on a low stool to relieve pressure on your lower back. Every 5 to 15 minutes, switch the foot you\u2019re resting on the stool.\nThe best way to sleep is on your side with your knees bent. You may put a pillow under your head to support your neck. You also may put a pillow between your knees for added comfort. If you sleep on your back, put pillows under your knees and a small pillow under your lower back. Don\u2019t sleep on your stomach unless you put a pillow under your hips.\nUse a firm mattress. If your mattress is too soft, put a 1/2-inch plywood board under the mattress to add support.\nAlways stretch your back and body before you exercise. For a gentle stretch, lay on your back with your knees bent. Slowly raise your left knee to your chest and press your lower back into the floor. Hold for 5 seconds. Relax and repeat the exercise with your right knee. Do 10 of these exercises for each leg.\nIn addition to back exercises, it\u2019s important to stay active in general. Swimming and walking are good exercises to improve your overall fitness.\nMost people who have pain in their lower back can treat it on their own. Often the pain goes away in a few days or weeks. You may need 1 to 2 days of rest for a hurt back. However, too much rest can cause your muscles to weaken. This can slow your recovery. Even if it hurts, try to walk around for a few minutes each hour. This helps keep your back muscles strong.\nThere are a few positions that provide relief when your back hurts. These help to take the pressure and weight off your back. Lay on your back on the floor:\nHeating pads can help to relax painful muscle spasms. Use heat for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Ice packs (use for less than 15 minutes every 30 minutes) and massages may give relief as well. Over-the-counter medicines can reduce pain and swelling. These include aspirin, acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol), naproxen (brand name: Aleve), and ibuprofen (brand names: Advil and Motrin).\nPeople who have ongoing back problems need treatment to manage the cause. Being overweight can make back pain worse. If you are overweight, you may need to lose weight. You may need to exercise or improve your posture when you are sitting, standing, sleeping, or lifting.\nSevere cases of lower back pain could require physical therapy or wearing a brace to support your back. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers or injections for severe pain. These prescriptions can be addictive, so it\u2019s best to seek other treatment methods, if available.\nWork with your doctor to create a treatment plan for the pain in your lower back. It will depend on the cause of your pain and if it is acute or chronic.

    "article_title": "What is lumbar spinal canal stenosis?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated December 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nThe lumbar spinal canal is the space inside the lower spine that carries nerves to your legs. It is very narrow. Over the course of many years, the bone and tissue around the canal grow, causing the canal to become even more narrow. This narrowing is called stenosis. As this happens, the nerves that go through it are squeezed. This squeezing may cause back pain, leg pain, weakness, and numbness.\nLumbar spinal canal stenosis is not the same as a ruptured disk. A ruptured or herniated disk usually pinches 1 or 2 nerves at a time. The pain caused by a ruptured disk in the lumbar spine is easy to diagnose and is known as sciatica. Sciatica causes back pain that shoots down one leg along the path of the sciatic nerve. It can happen any time, not just when you stand up or start walking like it does with stenosis.\nPeople who have lumbar spinal canal stenosis may have back or leg pain or numbness. Your legs might also feel cramped, tired, or weak. These symptoms usually start when you are standing or walking.\nMany people notice the pain is better climbing stairs or leaning over a shopping cart and worse walking down stairs. Often, the symptoms get better if you sit, crouch, or lie in the fetal position (with your knees tucked up to your chest). It\u2019s thought that these positions open the lumbar canal and take the pressure off the nerves that go to the legs. In severe cases, stenosis can cause partial or complete bowel or bladder incontinence.\nLumbar spinal canal stenosis may happen on its own over time. This is because your bones and other tissues continue to grow around the canal. This growth makes the canal narrow over the course of your life. Other causes of lumbar spinal canal stenosis include:\nSometimes your doctor can tell if you have stenosis by asking you about your symptoms. Doctors may also order special tests and X-rays of the spine to make the diagnosis.\nLumbar spinal canal stenosis cannot really be prevented because it seems to be a part of getting older. Doctors don\u2019t know why certain people develop it. But you may be able to reduce your risk by exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and using good posture.\nYour treatment will depend on how bad your symptoms are. If your pain is mild and you haven\u2019t had it long, you can try an exercise program or a physical therapy program. This can strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture.\nYour doctor may also prescribe medicine to help reduce inflammation (soreness and swelling) in your spine. If you have more severe symptoms, you may need to see a spine surgeon. The surgeon may recommend an operation to take the pressure off the nerves in your lower spine. This surgery works well for many people.\nLumbar spinal canal stenosis symptoms may come and go, especially at first. If you\u2019ve noticed discomfort in your back and legs, talk to your doctor. These early symptoms are often easily managed through exercise.\nThe longer you have lumbar spinal canal stenosis, the more likely you\u2019ll have symptoms that are more noticeable. You may be able to manage the symptoms by taking medicine or you may need only a heating pad. Work with your doctor to decide which strategy is best for you.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Spinal Stenosis\nLast Updated:December 14, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is one of the most common forms of cancer in the world. More people in the United States die from lung cancer than any other cancer. Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking.\nThere are 2 types of lung cancer:Non-small cell\u2013 This is the most common form of lung cancer. More than 85% of people with lung cancer have non-small cell.Small cell\u2013 The cells of this form of cancer are small. The cells grow and spread faster than in non-small cell lung cancer. It is treated differently.\nSymptoms of lung cancer can differ from person to person. Common symptoms include:\nSome people report just not feeling well. If the cancer has spread, you might feel pain or have problems with the part of the body it has spread to. Many people with lung cancer don\u2019t experience symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage. That is one of the reasons more people die from it.\nThere are several known causes of lung cancer.SmokingIn most cases (80% to 90%), smoking causes lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals. Many of these are known to cause cancer. Smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. People who use other tobacco products are also at increased risk of getting lung cancer. These products include cigars, pipes, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes or vape).\nYour risk of getting lung cancer is higher the earlier you started smoking, and the more cigarettes you smoked per day. If you used to smoke but don\u2019t anymore, your risk of lung cancer decreases. But it is still higher than if you never smoked at all.Secondhand smokeSecondhand smoke is the smoke that other people make when they are smoking tobacco products. When you breathe it in, you are still getting the harmful effects from the smoke. Thousands of people who never smoked die every year from lung cancer because they\u2019ve been around secondhand smoke.\nRadonRadon is a gas that occurs naturally in the earth. It gets trapped in houses and buildings. There, it can reach high levels that can cause cancer. Exposure to radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S.Other substancesA variety of other substances have been linked to lung cancer. These include asbestos, arsenic, diesel exhaust, and certain forms of silica and chromium.\nLung cancer is often found on an X-ray or CT scan being done for another reason. If you have symptoms of lung cancer, your doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will listen to your chest. If they hear fluid around your lungs, they may suspect lung cancer. They will ask you about your medical history, and if you smoke. They will also ask if you\u2019ve been exposed to other things that can cause cancer, such as asbestos.\nYour doctor will probably order tests that can look for lung cancer. Some of these tests may include:\nIf any of these tests indicate cancer may be present, your doctor will probably order a biopsy. They will remove a piece of tissue from your lung. They will look at the tissue under a microscope and look for cancer cells.\nIf cancer cells are found in a biopsy, your doctor will do more testing. This will help them find out how quickly the cancer may grow, how likely it will or has spread, and how certain treatments might work.\nIn most cases, lung cancer can be prevented.\nIf you smoke and are between 55 and 80 years old, you can get a screening for lung cancer. This is done through a low-dose CT scan. Screening helps find cancer earlier or before it spreads. This improves your chances of successful treatment.\nThere are several treatment options for lung cancer. Your doctor may recommend more than one type of treatment. What is best for one person may not be the best treatment for you. Your doctor will make the decision based on several things, including:\nCommon available treatments include:\nPeople with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with any of these therapies, or a combination. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Other therapies are also available. Ask your doctor which is the right treatment for you.\nWith treatment, your lung cancer can go into remission. How well you do after treatment depends on many things. This includes how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated or undetected, lung cancer can spread to other parts of the body. This includes lymph nodes and other organs. For many people, their cancer isn\u2019t diagnosed until it has already spread. This could cause serious health problems or be fatal. It is very important to get treatment as soon as possible.\nLiving with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Treatments can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying mildly active. Living with lung cancer also can affect your emotions. Get support where you need it. Family, friends, counselors, or support groups can all help you emotionally.\nEven after your cancer is gone, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body. You will need to get regular follow-up care and check-ups for years after your treatment.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Lung Cancer\nNational Cancer Institute: Lung Cancer\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Lung Cancer\nLast Updated:August 5, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nLupus is a disease that affects your immune system. An immune system that is functioning well has antibodies that fight off viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. In people who have lupus, an autoimmune disease, their immune system becomes overactive and attacks healthy cells and tissue.\nThere are several kinds of lupus. Each type has its own symptoms and affects your body in different ways.\nLupus can affect many parts of the body, including your joints, skin, and organs. It depends on the kind of lupus you have. Symptoms can develop quickly or slowly. They also can come and go and be mild or severe.\nNot everyone who has lupus has the same symptoms. Common symptoms of lupus may include:\nMany people also have symptoms that affect their skin and hair, such as:\nLupus may also cause symptoms that affect the blood and blood vessels:\nLess common symptoms include:\nChildren can have the same symptoms of lupus as adults. The most common symptoms in children are:\nIt is common for lupus symptoms to come and go. Often, they may disappear for a period of time called remission. You may get new symptoms all of a sudden. When symptoms appear or get worse, it\u2019s called a \u201cflare.\u201d You may have swollen joints and muscle pain one week and then no symptoms at all the next week.\nThe cause of lupus is unknown. Lupus can affect anyone, but it is most common in women between the ages of 15 and 44. African American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women are more likely to have lupus than people of other races.\nLupus is a disease that is known for being difficult to diagnose.The symptomsare different from person to person. Sometimes, the symptoms may mimic those of another disease. Often, lupus symptoms come and go. It can sometimes take several years to receive an official diagnosis.\nGetting an early, accurate lupus diagnosis can reduce its long-term effects.\nThere is not just one test doctors can use to tell if you have lupus. Doctors must consider many different sources of information. Your doctor will look at:\nYour doctor may also order blood and urine tests, such as:\nBlood tests can also show how well your kidneys and liver are working, and if these organs have been affected by lupus. Your doctor may recommend a chest x-ray because lupus can sometimes cause swelling in the lungs and heart. An electrocardiogram test (ECG) checks for an abnormal heartbeat or damage to the heart that may be caused by lupus.\nDepending on your symptoms and test results, your doctor also may order a skin or kidney biopsy.\nYou cannot avoid lupus since the cause of it is unknown. However, you may be able to help prevent flares. Common triggers include:\nIf you take medicines to help manage lupus, do not stop taking them without your doctor\u2019s approval. This can cause flares as well.\nKnowing the things that cause flares can help you better cope with your symptoms.\nThere is no cure for lupus, but treatments have improved in recent years. Treatment options vary depending on the kind of lupus you have, as well as your symptoms and the severity. Your treatment approach may change depending on if your symptoms are active or in remission.\nIf you have joint pain, sore muscles, or skin problems, such as a rash, your doctor may recommend that you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Medicine that is used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine, can be helpful in treating lupus symptoms and preventing flares. Some people have side effects from this kind of medicine, including problems with vision and muscle strength. Corticosteroids are another type of medicine that your doctor may prescribe. They can help reduce swelling, but often have worse side effects.\nYou will likely need stronger medicines if lupus has caused problems in your vital organs or the central nervous system (heart, brain, and blood vessels). Stronger drugs have the potential for more severe side effects, and your doctor will want to closely monitor you. High-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be given by mouth or through a vein in your arm. Another option is medicine that suppresses the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine. Both types of medicine can help control dangerous symptoms quickly and prevent permanent damage. Sometimes, these medicines are used together at a lower dosage to lessen the risk of side effects.\nYour doctor may want you to stop taking certain drugs if your lupus symptoms go away for a time (in remission). This is because medicines used to treat lupus carry a high risk of side effects. However, even if you don\u2019t have active symptoms, your lupus can return and cause future problems. These may include kidney disease and kidney failure, or atherosclerosis (build-up in the arteries), which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. It is important to see your doctor regularly for check-ups and maintain good health.\nThe following lifestyle changes may help relieve symptoms and/or prevent flares.\nWhen you are first diagnosed with lupus, you may have conflicting feelings. You may be relieved to finally know what is causing your symptoms. You may also have feelings of sadness, fear, confusion, and anger. Some people who have lupus have bouts of\u00a0depression\u00a0because of the challenges of living with this disease. Learning all you can about your illness can help you better cope with your symptoms, prevent flares, and deal with side effects and complications.\nLupus can affect and damage different parts of your body.\nKidneys\nYour kidneys get rid of waste and other toxins from the body. Lupus can affect the kidneys and cause the structures that filter the blood to swell. Without treatment, lupus can lead to permanent kidney damage. If lupus affects your kidneys, you will probably need medicine to prevent serious damage. The most common symptom of kidney problems is swelling in your feet, legs, hands, or eyelids.\nHeart\nLupus can inflame the sac around your heart and cause chest pain. Though less common, but more serious, it can harden the walls of your coronary arteries. This can lead to angina (chest pain) and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Lupus can also cause inflammation of the heart itself, which can lead to scarring and possible heart failure.\nLungs\nInflammation can also occur in the lining of your lungs. This can cause chest pain, which is often felt with deep breathing. People who have lupus are at risk of getting pneumonia.\nJoints\nMost people who have lupus have swollen and painful joints. These symptoms can come and go and may affect several joints at once. Usually, there is no long-term damage.\nSkin\nPeople who have lupus often get a butterfly-shaped, red rash across their nose and cheeks. This is called a malar rash. Other parts of the skin may be affected. You could have raised bumps or dry patches, often on areas that are exposed to the sun. You could get sores inside your mouth or nose. Hair loss (alopecia) is common during flares. You may notice a blotchy purple color on your hands, fingers, or toes. This happens when blood does not flow well to the skin\u2019s surface. It is called Raynaud\u2019s Disease.\nCentral Nervous System\nLupus can affect your brain and the nerves in your spinal cord. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, mild confusion or memory problems, vision problems, and changes in your mood. It can lead to more serious health issues, such as seizures or a stroke.\nBlood\nLupus can cause the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets to decrease. Fewer red blood cells can lead to anemia, which is common in people who have lupus. White blood cells help the body fight infection. Rarely, do white blood cells get low enough to cause infection. Platelets help your blood to clot. A low platelet count can lead to easy bruising, nosebleeds, and other bleeding. It can also cause your blood to clot too easily or in unneeded places. If the blood clot breaks away and travels through the bloodstream, it can block blood vessels and cause serious problems, such as a stroke, blood clots in the lungs (thrombosis), or repeated miscarriages.\nOthers won\u2019t be able to see most of the symptoms caused by your lupus. When symptoms like pain, fatigue, depression, or joint stiffness make your regular tasks more difficult, it\u2019s important to know how to talk to those around you.\nIt may help to start by explaining what lupus is not. Let people know that is not contagious, nor is it like cancer or HIV or AIDS. Then explain what lupus is. Let them know that it is chronic, which means you will have it forever, and that it affects each person differently.\nYour conversations with others about lupus may change depending on who you are talking to.\nIf you don\u2019t feel that you have anyone you can talk to about your lupus, or if you\u2019d like more resources, it may be helpful to seek out a therapist or an online support group.\nIt may take time to find the right combination of treatment options for your lupus. Work with your doctor to take an active role in managing your lupus. You can do this by:\nTalking with your doctor about all of your symptoms and getting the right lab tests are important steps to arriving at an accurate diagnosis.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure where to begin, the Lupus Foundation of America can help you to find the resources and support you need.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nLyme disease is a bacterial\u00a0infection\u00a0that is caused by a tick bite. It was first recognized in 1975 when large numbers of children around the town of Lyme, Connecticut, were being diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers investigated and found that tick bites were causing the illnesses.\nLyme disease is carried by black-legged ticks (sometimes called deer ticks). These ticks are typically about the size of a sesame seed. They live mostly in certain areas of the country:\nHowever, Lyme disease also occurs in other parts of the United States. Although you\u2019re more likely to get it in the regions mentioned above, nearly every state reported cases of Lyme disease in 2017. The disease also exists in Europe, Asia, and Australia.\nThe rash is a telltale sign of Lyme disease. It usually starts at the site of the tick bite and expands gradually over a few days. It can reach up to 12 inches across or more. The center may fade, creating a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d or target appearance. The rash may feel warm to the touch.\nSome people with Lyme disease do not get the bull\u2019s-eye rash. They may have many red spots instead. Others don\u2019t get a rash at all. Around 75% of people with Lyme disease get a rash.\nIf Lyme disease isn\u2019t treated, it can spread to other parts of the body. Late-stage symptoms include:\nIt is normal to have a small bump or red spot where a tick bit you. This does not mean you have Lyme disease. It usually goes away in a day or two.\nPeople get Lyme disease when they are bitten by an infected tick. Ticks live in areas with a lot of plant life, such as wooded areas or fields. They sit near the top of grassy plants and low bushes. They wait there for people or animals to brush up against them. Ticks can crawl on your clothes or body for up to several hours or more before attaching to the skin.\nTicks can attach to any part of your body. They usually hide in hard-to-see areas like the armpits, groin, or scalp. An infected tick must stay attached to your skin for 36 to 48 hours to pass the bacteria to you.\nPeople who spend time in outdoor areas where ticks are common are at higher risk of getting tick-borne diseases.\nIt can be difficult to diagnose Lyme disease. The ticks that carry it are very small and the bites don\u2019t hurt. Many patients don\u2019t remember being bitten. In addition, most of the symptoms are common with other illnesses.\nIf you find a tick in your skin, use tweezers to remove it immediately. Then wait a few days to see if you develop any symptoms. If you do, call your family doctor. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They will look at the bite and check for a rash. They may order a blood test. But those aren\u2019t always necessary to make the diagnosis. They can often give false results, especially in early-stage Lyme disease.\nPeople who have joint swelling or nervous system problems may need to have special tests. Your doctor may need to take some fluid from the swollen joint or the spine to check for clues to your condition.\nIf you have been sick for 4 weeks or more, call your doctor. They can give you a blood test at this stage. It will tell you if you have Lyme disease.\nThe best way to prevent Lyme disease is to avoid being bitten by ticks. When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:\nAfter you get home, check everything and everyone for ticks.\nTumble dry clothes or blankets on high heat in the dryer for 10 to 15 minutes. This should kill any ticks. If clothes are dirty, wash them in hot water and dry on high heat for 60 minutes.\nDon\u2019t\u00a0panic. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick \u201cback out\u201d on its own. These methods are not effective.\nWash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Keep an eye on the area for a few weeks and note any changes. Call your doctor if you develop a rash around the area where the tick was attached. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened.\nLyme disease is treated with antibiotics. In most cases, people bitten by a tick are given antibiotics only if they are sick or have a rash. If you are bitten by a tick but don\u2019t get sick or get a rash, you don\u2019t need antibiotics.\nEarly-stage Lyme disease responds very well to treatment. In most cases, taking an antibiotic for 2 to 4 weeks kills the\u00a0bacteria and clears up the infection. Your doctor will tell you how long to take the antibiotic. It\u2019s important to take all the medicine your doctor prescribes. This will prevent the spread of Lyme disease to your joints, nervous system, or heart. If you have problems with the medicine, do not quit taking it. Call your doctor and talk to them about your side effects.\nLate-stage Lyme disease is also treated with antibiotics. It may be necessary to give the antibiotics intravenously (through an\u00a0IV) at this stage. Medicine that reduces swelling and pain can ease arthritis associated with late-stage Lyme disease. If necessary, excess fluid can be drained from any affected joints.\nMost people treated in the early stages of Lyme disease make a quick and complete recovery. Some may experience symptoms for a few weeks after treatment. If you were treated for Lyme disease but you still don\u2019t feel well, call your family doctor. They can make sure there isn\u2019t something else wrong. They can help you find ways to ease your symptoms. Some patients have found relief with treatments typically used forchronic fatigue syndromeorfibromyalgia.\nOther things you can do to help manage Lyme disease include:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Lyme Disease\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: Lyme Disease\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Lyme Disease\nLast Updated:April 17, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is lymphedema?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nLymphedema is excess fluid inside your body. It causes swelling in your arms, legs, fingers, and toes. Lymphedema occurs when something blocks the flow of fluid away from your arm or leg, such as when lymph nodes (small glands) are removed. This happens during cancer surgery. Also, it can be caused by abnormal development of your lymph system (primary lymphedema). Or it can result from a disease or surgery (secondary lymphedema).\nLymphedema symptoms can include:\nCancerand cancer treatment cause secondary lymphedema. It\u2019s a common side effect of breast cancer surgery. That\u2019s when doctors remove all or part of the breast(s) or lymph nodes under the arm. Also, it can occur in the legs after surgery for uterine, prostate, vulvar, or ovarian cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma. Removing lymph nodes from the groin, pelvis, or neck can cause lymphedema. The risk increases with the number of lymph nodes that are removed or damaged. Radiation treatments can cause lymphedema.\nOther factors can raise the risk of this condition. This includes being overweight or having obesity, delayed healing of skin after surgery, a tumor that blocks blood vessels or lymph nodes in the underarm, chest, neck, pelvis, or abdomen (stomach), and lymph scar tissue under the collarbone.\nYour doctor will examine the swelling, ask you questions about your health history, and consider other causes. These may include infection orblood clots. He or she may measure the swelling. Diagnosis might include a lymphoscintigraphy. This procedure uses a probe to scan the inside of your body. Before the procedure, you are injected with a small amount of a radioactive dye. The dye lights up the affected area. It is visible with the probe.\nYour doctor may order imaging scans, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) to show the inside of your body. These scans are similar to an X-ray. They can reveal possible sources of blockage to the flow of fluid. Doctors grade the affected area (1-4) to determine the seriousness of the lymphedema. Grading is based on the size and severity of the swelling.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee you can prevent or avoid it. You can reduce your risks or delay onset. Take these precautions:\nThere is no medicine to treat lymphedema. It is treated by a physical therapist (PT). Your therapist will give you special exercises you can do with your PT and at home. These exercises reduce swelling.\nYou may have to wear a compression garment on your affected arm or leg. This is different than wearing tight clothing. The garment looks like a sleeve. It applies the right amount of pressure to the swelling. You may have to wear the compression garment all of the time or in certain circumstances. Many breast cancer survivors, for example, have to wear a compression sleeve during air travel. Air travel tends to increase swelling.\nLymphedema does cause discomfort. Therefore, it\u2019s important to plan ahead if you know you are having surgery that could cause lymphedema. Learn the preventive steps you can take to reduce your post-surgery risks or delay it. If you have lymphedema, your daily living will revolve around managing the discomfort. This includes exercise, weight loss, and avoiding injury.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nMad cow disease is the common name for a very rare and deadly brain disease. The scientific name is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It\u2019s spread by eating beef products from a cow that has been infected. Both animals and humans can get the disease. People get a version of BSE called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).\nIn humans, it\u2019s difficult to diagnose mad cow disease until it\u2019s reached the most serious stages. It can begin with symptoms ofdepressionand loss of coordination. Later,dementiasymptoms appear. These can include serious declines in memory, thinking, and behavior.\nBrain abnormalities can be seen through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. This test gives your doctor a picture of the inside of your brain. Abnormalities don\u2019t show up on an MRI until near the end of the disease. The disease progresses quickly, and it leads to death around one year after symptoms appear.\nEating meat or bone meal from infected cattle causes mad cow disease. The beef is contaminated when it\u2019s exposed to tissue from the infected cow\u2019s brain and spinal cord.\nDoctors focus on eliminating other diseases and conditions that have similar symptoms. For example, a blood test can help rule out some other brain diseases that are similar to mad cow disease. An MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan can help rule out a stroke or brain tumor. Doctors can order a spinal fluid test to see if the protein present in mad cow disease is found in your spinal fluid. Unfortunately, since mad cow disease is so rare, many doctors don\u2019t consider it until a person nears the end of their life.\nMad cow disease is extremely rare in the United States. Most cases have occurred in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom.\nU.S. government agencies have taken many steps to keep food in the United States safe. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulate animal feed to keep cows safe from BSE. They also prevent high-risk cows and cow products from entering the country from other countries. These and other steps have worked very well to keep mad cow disease out of the United States.\nIf you live in the United States, you don\u2019t need to do anything to avoid mad cow disease. If you are traveling to another country, the best way to reduce your risk is to avoid eating beef.\nMad cow disease isn\u2019t contagious. It can\u2019t be transmitted by being around someone who has the disease. So practices like good hygiene or handwashing don\u2019t prevent it.\nThere is no cure for mad cow disease. Doctors focus on providing patients and their caregivers advice for support.\nLiving with mad cow disease means learning to adapt to the changes and complications of brain deterioration. As the disease worsens, it takes away a person\u2019s independence. They are no longer able to care for themselves.

    "article_title": "What is malaria?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nMalaria\u00a0is a serious disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is carried by one type of mosquito in certain parts of the world (not in the United States). Humans get the disease when an infected mosquito bites them. People with malaria get very sick with flu-like symptoms. If left untreated, malaria can quickly become very serious. It can even be fatal.\nMalaria is almost wiped out in the United States. But it\u2019s common in developing countries with warm climates. These areas include:\nPeople who travel to these countries could get sick. If you\u2019re traveling to an area where malaria is common, you should be aware of the risk and take precautions. Check theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) website for\u00a0information about travel health concerns\u00a0for international locations before you go.\nThere are 4 types of malaria parasites that can infect people. The symptoms of each kind are generally the same. One kind tends to cause more severe symptoms and is more likely to lead to death than other kinds. Common symptoms of malaria include:\nMost people experience symptoms 10 days to 4 weeks after an infection. It\u2019s possible to not have symptoms for up to 1 year after you\u2019re infected. Two types of malaria can occur again. The parasites can go dormant in the liver for several months up to 4 years after infection. When they become active again, the person gets sick again.\nMalaria is caused by a parasite that is carried by mosquitos. If a mosquito carrying this parasite bites you, the parasite can get into your blood. The parasite lays eggs, which develop into more parasites. They feed on your red blood cells until you get very sick.\nBecause the parasites live in the blood, malaria can also be spread through other ways. These include blood transfusions, organ transplants, shared use of contaminated needles, and from mother to fetus. It\u2019s not a contagious disease, so it can\u2019t be spread from person to person like a cold or other illness.\nYour doctor will ask you where you traveled. He or she will also do a blood test that can confirm if you have malaria. If you suspect you have malaria, tell your doctor right away.\nThere are steps you can take to avoid getting malaria. To protect yourself from getting it, you should do whatever you can to keep from getting mosquito bites.\nIf you plan to travel to a country where malaria is common, you\u2019ll probably take a medicine that may keep you from getting the disease. This is called \u201cprophylactic\u201d malaria medicine. (Prophylactic means it\u2019s used to prevent disease.) But remember that no medicine can protect you 100%. You should still take other precautions to prevent being bitten by mosquitos.\nSee your doctor well before your trip. You will need to start taking the medicine a few days or weeks before you leave the country. You take the medicine during your trip and for 1 to 4 weeks after. How long you take it after your trip depends on which medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s important to keep taking the medicine after your trip. The malaria parasites could still be in your blood. If you stop taking the medicine too soon, it could give the parasites a chance to grow and make you sick.\nMalaria medicines have some side effects, and not everyone can take them. Your doctor can tell you which medicine is right for you. What type of medicine you take also depends on where you\u2019ll be traveling.\nBeware of homeopathic medicines advertised to prevent malaria. These medicines aren\u2019t regulated by the government. So it\u2019s hard to know whether they will be effective. The CDC warns against purchasing prophylactic malaria medicines overseas. In some countries, medicines sold to help prevent malaria may be fake or less effective than necessary.\nIf you\u2019re pregnant, the CDC advises that you not travel to areas where you could get malaria. Symptoms of malaria are more severe in pregnant women. It can also cause problems with the pregnancy. These include miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth. If you must travel to one of these places, you need to take the preventive medicine.\nMalaria can be cured with prescription medicines. What kind of medicine you take and how long you take it depend on several factors, including:\nThe disease can become serious quickly. Treatment should start as early as possible.\nIf you\u2019re treated for malaria with the right medicines, you should be cured. All of the parasite will be destroyed. But if the disease is left untreated or isn\u2019t treated correctly, it could continue. People who get one of the types that can go dormant in the liver sometimes need more than one medicine. This helps prevent a relapse months or years after infection. Another type of malaria can stay in the blood for decades if it\u2019s left untreated. That\u2019s why proper treatment for the specific type of malaria is so important.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Parasites\u2013Malaria\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Malaria\nLast Updated:June 19, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nBreast cancer is a form of cancer that occurs in your breast(s). Men can get breast cancer, but it is more common in women. Because of this, men often don\u2019t know they have breast cancer until it is advanced.\nThere are several types and levels of male breast cancer. Types vary based on the location of cancer cells and what they look like. Breast cancer can begin in your lining, ducts, or lobules. It also can occur in your nipple or areola (the circular area around your nipple). This is known as Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple.\nBreast cancer can be invasive. This means it has or could spread within the breast and nearby tissue. Metastatic spread means that the cancer can also travel through your lymphatic system to other tissue, organs, or bones. If your cancer hasn\u2019t spread, it is pre-invasive or \u201cin situ.\u201d Sometimes it is called non-invasive, but this can change if the cancer isn\u2019t treated.\nCancer grades and stages depend on the cancer cells\u2019 size, makeup, and features. The higher the grade is (1\u20133), the more abnormal the cells are. It also indicates how slow or fast your cancer cells grow. The higher the stage is (I\u2013IV) the more advanced your cancer is. It also indicates the chance that your cancer will spread. Your grade and stage affect your treatment and outlook.\nInfiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of male breast cancer. This starts in your breast ducts but is likely to spread to other areas.\nMen should be aware of the shape, size, and feel of their breasts. This can help you detect signs of breast cancer early. Symptoms include:\nIf you have breast cancer that has spread to your lymph nodes, you could find other lumps. These could be on the side of your breast, under your arm, or by your collarbone.\nAll people have cells in their bodies that grow and divide. Cancer happens when some of those cells change and grow out of control. These abnormal cells can form a mass, or tumor. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).\nBoys and girls have similar amounts of breast tissue when young. At puberty, girls produce increased amounts of estrogen. This female hormone causes breast tissue to grow. At the same time, boys\u2019 estrogen levels decrease, so little breast tissue grows.\nMen often find they have breast cancer at a late stage. That\u2019s because men have less breast tissue than women, and because many men aren\u2019t aware of male breast cancer. Most, but not all, cases of male breast cancer include higher than normal estrogen levels.\nAll people have cells in their bodies that body grow and divide.

Most, but not all, cases of male breast cancer include higher than normal estrogen levels.\nEarly detection and treatment will lead to better outcomes. See your doctor right away if you find a lump or notice symptoms.\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam and review your history. If your doctor thinks you may have breast cancer, he or she may order more tests.\nIf your doctor sees anything unusual on the tests, he or she will likely say you need a biopsy. During a biopsy, your doctor will remove a sample of the tissue. In some cases, they might need to remove the entire mass or lump. A biopsy is the only way to know if a mass is cancer or not. Biopsies determine the size, type, and grade of the cancer.\nCancerous cells also will be tested for certain hormones and genes. If your cells are receptive to estrogen and/or progesterone, you are hormone positive. This accounts for most cases of male breast cancer. Positive hormone receptors can suggest better outcomes. If your cells contain high levels of HER2, you are HER2-positive. This form of cancer cells tends to be more aggressive.\nBreast cancer can spread (metastasize) by way of your lymphatic system. If your cancer is invasive, you might need more testing.\nMen cannot prevent or avoid breast cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians does not recommend breast cancer screening for men. However, men should talk to their doctor if they are at high risk for breast cancer. Their doctor might suggest genetic testing or a mammogram.\nFactors that can increase the risk of male breast cancer include:\nAll factors of male breast cancer play a role in your treatment. This includes size, location, type, grade, and stage. The size of the mass doesn\u2019t change the outlook, but it can affect treatment options. Other aspects include your age, general health, and personal lifestyle choices. Talk to your doctor in detail about the risks and side effects of each treatment.\nTreatment can include one or more of the following:\nThe process to diagnose and treat cancer can be long and frustrating. Most treatments are invasive and cause side effects. Medicines help counter these, but effects can be long lasting. You likely will need to make changes to your lifestyle.\nAfter treatment, your cancer may subside. Remission can be brief or permanent. Cancer survivors usually require ongoing care. This can include testing and treatment to monitor and manage their health.\nLiving with cancer is emotional. You might consider joining a support group. Your doctor also might suggest rehabilitation to help with physical and life changes.\nHaving a male family member with breast cancer is a trigger for genetic testing and counseling. After receiving your diagnosis, a genetic counselor can help you determine if members of your family should be tested for mutations in the BRCA gene. Abnormalities in the BRCA gene cause forms of breast and ovarian cancer.\nAmerican Cancer Society: What Is Breast Cancer in Men?\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology: Breast Cancer in Men\nLast Updated:April 8, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated March 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMallet finger is an injury to your fingertip. It is common in sports, especially baseball and basketball. Mallet finger usually happens when a ball hits the end of your finger. This can cause injury to tendons in the finger, which causes mallet finger.\nYour finger may be painful, swollen, and bruised. You may also have trouble straightening it. When you do, the tip of your finger stays pointing down toward your palm.\nMallet finger most often happens when there is an injury to the tendon on the top or back side of your finger. Tendons attach muscles to bones. The tendon in the tip of your finger allows your fingertip to bend and straighten. When it is injured, you can\u2019t straighten the fingertip anymore. The injury usually happens when the tendon is torn or stretched. It can also happen if the tendon is ripped off the bone or pulls a piece of bone away from the rest of the finger bone.\nYour doctor can diagnose mallet finger by looking at your finger. They will ask what activity you were doing when you injured it. Your doctor may order X-rays to see if there is a break in the bone.\nMallet finger is an accidental injury, so it can be hard to prevent it. It usually happens when playing sports. Practicing good sports safety is important.\nIf you have injured your finger and it is painful, swollen, or difficult to straighten, see your doctor right away. Delaying treatment can cause permanent damage or may make your injury more difficult to fix.\nIn most cases, your doctor may tell you to put ice on the injury to prevent swelling. He or she will provide a splint for your finger. This will keep your finger from bending while it heals. It is important to remember not to bend your fingertip at all until it is completely healed. You may need someone to help you change your splint. If your injury is more severe (for example, if a bone is broken or a joint is out of place), you may need surgery.\nIn most cases, pain from mallet finger can be treated using over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\nIf you\u2019ve only stretched the tendon, you will wear a splint all the time for 4 to 6 weeks. If it is torn or pulled off the bone, you will wear a splint all the time for 6 to 8 weeks. After that, you\u2019ll wear the splint at bedtime for an additional 2 to 3 weeks.\nYou should be able to resume normal activities right after treatment. Most people can still play sports with a finger splint. Your doctor will let you know when it\u2019s safe to play sports without a splint.\nSometimes even with treatment, your fingertip could still have a slight tilt to it.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Mallet finger, aftercare\nLast Updated:March 18, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is sometimes called mass hysteria or epidemic hysteria. People could think they\u2019ve been exposed to something dangerous, like a germ or a toxin (poison). This could happen to a class in a school or workers in an office.\nMass psychogenic illness has occurred for hundreds of years. It has happened all around the world and in many different social settings. No one keeps track of these outbreaks. But they are probably a lot more common than we realize.\nThe symptoms of mass psychogenic illness depend on what sickness people believe they\u2019ve been exposed to. Some symptoms they could experience include:\nMany outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness start with an environmental \u201ctrigger.\u201d The environmental trigger can be a bad smell or a suspicious-looking substance. Or it could be something else that makes people in a group believe they have been exposed to a germ or a poison. When this happens, many of them may begin to experience symptoms of sickness at the same time. In some cases, one person gets sick and then other people in the group also start feeling sick.\nOutbreaks of mass psychogenic illness show us how stress affects us. Think of how stage fright can cause nausea, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, a racing heart, a stomachache, or diarrhea. Your body can have a similar strong reaction to other stressful situations. People who feel sick in an outbreak of mass psychogenic illness really believe they may have been exposed to something harmful.\nOutbreaks also show how other people\u2019s feelings and behavior can affect the way we feel. An outbreak of mass psychogenic illness is a time of anxiety and worry. A lot of media coverage or the presence of ambulances or emergency workers can make you and other people feel more anxious. At such a time, if you hear about or see someone get sick, it can be enough to make you feel sick too.\nNo, it is real. People who are involved in these outbreaks have real signs of sickness that are not imagined. They really do have headaches, or they really do feel dizzy. But in cases of mass psychogenic illness, these symptoms are not caused by a poison or a germ. The symptoms are caused by stress and anxiety, or by your belief that you have been exposed to something harmful.\nPsychogenic illness can affect normal, healthy people. Just because you reacted this way to the threat of something dangerous does not mean there is something wrong with your mind.\nThe following might indicate that a group sickness is caused by mass psychogenic illness:\nThe patterns of the outbreak might also give evidence of mass psychogenic illness. These could include:\nHowever, if you have any of the following symptoms, you should see your doctor:\nYour doctor can check for a different reason for your health problem.\nIt is unclear how mass psychogenic illness can be prevented. You might think you are involved in an outbreak, but you aren\u2019t showing any signs yet. In this case, it might help to remove yourself from the situation. This could prevent you from developing symptoms.\nMost outbreaks stop when people get away from the place where the illness started. The signs of illness tend to go away once people are examined and doctors find that they do not have a dangerous illness. It is important to keep the people who feel sick away from the commotion and stress of the outbreak.\nAfter experts check out the place where the outbreak started, they can tell people whether it is safe to go back to that place.\nWe all are in group settings at some points in our lives. This could be in school, at work, or in a living situation. It is easy to share stress and anxiety in these situations. Try not to get caught up in other people\u2019s anxiety. Keep a calm and level head. Don\u2019t assume that because someone else is sick that you are going to get sick too. This is probably the best you can do to protect yourself when living or working in group settings.\nLast Updated:January 26, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is usually caused by an infection. It often happens while a woman is breastfeeding, especially during the first 6-12 weeks. Having mastitis\u00a0does not raise your risk of developing breast cancer.\nWomen who have\u00a0mastitis\u00a0may feel ill. They may feel run down or achy. In addition to an inflamed breast, they may feel like they have the flu. Other symptoms may include:\nMastitis usually affects only one breast at a time.\nMastitis is usually caused by germs (bacteria) that are found on the skin or in your baby\u2019s mouth. These bacteria can enter your breast through a milk duct opening or a crack in the nipple.\nInfection is more likely to happen when milk is trapped in the breast. Stagnant milk sitting in the breast makes bacteria grow, which leads to infection. Trapped milk can happen due to inexperience or poor technique in breastfeeding. Sometimes a milk duct can get blocked, causing milk to back up in the breast.\nYou may be at higher risk of developing mastitis if you:\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected breast. They will check for swelling, tenderness, and a painful, wedge-shaped area on the breast that is a tell-tale sign of mastitis.\nIf you are not breastfeeding and you have symptoms of mastitis, your doctor may order other tests. These could include a breast ultrasound, MRI, mammogram, or biopsy.\nBelow are some basic breastfeeding techniques to lower your risk of developing mastitis.\nSometimes breast infections go away on their own. If you notice you have symptoms of mastitis, try the following:\nIf you don\u2019t start feeling better 24 hours after trying these tips, or if your symptoms are getting worse, call your doctor. You may need medicine.\nYour doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. You should start to feel better a few days after starting the antibiotics. But make sure you take all the antibiotics your doctor prescribes to prevent antibiotic resistance.\nOver-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) can help relieve pain. Warm showers can also help relieve the pain.\nAlthough it may be painful, it is important to keep breastfeeding when you have mastitis. Your breast milk will not be bad for your baby, even if you have mastitis, although some infants may not like the taste.\nGetting enough rest and drinking extra fluids can help you feel better faster. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms get worse.\nIf mastitis isn\u2019t treated properly, an abscess (collection of pus) may develop. This could form a mass in your breast.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nMastocytosis is the abnormal growth of mast cells in the body. Mast cells are part of the immune system, which helps protect your body against infection. The most common form of mastocytosis is when mast cells accumulate on the skin, causing reddish-brown spots or bumps. In rare cases, mastocytosis can affect other parts of the body. These include the stomach, the intestines, and the bone marrow.\nMastocytosis can occur in people of any age. It is usually mild in children, and they often outgrow it.\nWhat are mast cells?\nMast cells are a kind of cell made by your bone marrow. They\u2019re part of your immune system, which helps you fight off infections. There are more of these cells in your skin, lungs, and intestines than in other parts of your body.\nMast cells make a chemical called histamine. Normally, this chemical serves as a kind of alarm. It lets the immune system know that an infection is attacking part of the body. Histamine can cause swelling, itching, and redness. It is released when your body reacts to something like aninsect biteor a bee sting (called an allergic reaction).\nThe symptoms are different, depending on where the extra mast cells are. If there are too many mast cells in your skin, you might have a red and itchy rash. You could get hives or have a rash that looks like freckles. If you rub the rash, it may get red and swollen. Sometimes the mast cells collect at one spot in your skin and cause one large lump.\nIf the mast cells are in your stomach and intestines, you might have diarrhea and stomach pain. This is a rarer form of mastocytosis.\nIn some people the extra mast cells cause a serious reaction. It might be like a bad allergy reaction. This is very rare. Their blood pressure may suddenly drop to a low level, causing them to faint. They may have trouble breathing. This reaction can cause death if treatment isn\u2019t started right away.\nPossible symptoms of mastocytosis include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly why some people have too many mast cells. Some of the things that trigger the release of histamine from mast cells also cause the symptoms of mastocytosis. Symptoms may be triggered by cold or heat, certain medicines, emotional stress, and insect bites. However, the triggers aren\u2019t the same in every person.\nThe symptoms of mastocytosis can be similar to the symptoms of many other health problems. Your doctor may do a skin biopsy to find out what is causing your symptoms. To do a biopsy, your doctor removes a small piece of skin and puts it under a microscope to look for extra mast cells. When an adult gets mastocytosis, the doctor may order a bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy allows doctors to look for other blood diseases that might come along with the mastocytosis.\nIf you don\u2019t have a rash but you have other symptoms, such as diarrhea, your doctor may do a blood test or a urine test.\nThere is no way to completely avoid mastocytosis. But you may be able to help prevent symptoms by learning what triggers mastocytosis for you.\nThere currently is no cure for mastocytosis, but treatment can help stop your symptoms.\nAntihistamines (which are often used to treat allergies) are helpful. If a rash bothers you, your doctor may suggest that you be treated with ultraviolet light. If you have diarrhea, an oral version (taken by mouth) of a medicine called cromolyn sodium (brand name: Gastrocrom) may help relieve digestive problems.\nThe best treatment for mastocytosis may be to stay away from the things that seem to trigger your symptoms. It may help if you and your doctor list all the things that cause you to experience symptoms. Did your symptoms start after you were exposed to heat or cold? Felt stressed? Took a certain medicine? Got an insect bite? Share your list of triggers with your doctor.\nMastocytosis can cause a severe allergic reaction in some people. It\u2019s a good idea to always keep an emergency kit with you. This way, you can give yourself medicine to stop a dangerous reaction. Your emergency kit should include an EpiPen, Benadryl, and Pepcid.\nNational Center for Advancing Translational Science: Mastocytosis\nLast Updated:April 17, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nWith summer travel about to begin and the back-to-school season approaching, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging parents and travelers to be aware of a rise in measles cases. This highly contagious disease can spread quickly, but understanding measles symptoms and treatment and vaccination recommendations can help you take steps to protect your family.\nMeasles (also called rubeola) is a serious respiratory illness. This means it affects the lungs and breathing tubes. It also causes a rash and a fever. It is one of the most contagious diseases there is, and it can be spread to others very easily. In rare cases, it can be deadly.\nMeasles used to be acommon childhood illness, but in 1971 a vaccine was created to prevent it. Measles had been nearly eliminated in the United States, but measles outbreaks have increased in recent years. According to the CDC, as of July 7, 2023, a total of 18 measles cases were reported by 12 jurisdictions. That may not seem like a lot, but during the same time in 2022 there were just 3 cases. By the end of 2022 there were 121 cases. Compare that to 13 in 2020. Just one infected person can infect 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people they come into close contact with.\nThe increase in measles cases is partly because of a continueddecline in the vaccination rate. During the 2020-21 school year, state-required vaccines among kindergarten students fell from 95% to 94%. During the 2021-2022, it fell again to 93%. Part of this was due to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever to make sure your child is up to date on vaccinations as they return to in-person learning.\nMeasles outbreaks also occur when the virus is brought into the country from abroad. The disease is still common in other parts of the world. Twice as many Americans are planning to travel internationally in 2023 compared to 2022. Many other countries such as England have seen measles outbreaks recently. Because of this, the CDC is urging anyone planning to travel to another country to make sure their vaccines are up to date.\nA virus causes measles. Infected people spread the virus when they breathe, cough, or sneeze. You can catch measles just by being in the same room with someone who has it\u2014even up to two hours after they leave. Measles spreads very easily. If you get exposed and haven\u2019t received the vaccine, you\u2019ll likely become infected.\nIn the United States, most measles cases begin when an unvaccinated person travels to a region where the virus is more common. These regions include Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. When those travelers return to the U.S. while infected, they pass the disease to others who aren\u2019t vaccinated. Children who are too young to get the vaccine remain unprotected and can quickly become infected.\nPeople at highest risk of getting measles if unvaccinated include:\nMeasles often starts with the following symptoms:\nA few days after these symptoms start, tiny white spots called Koplik spots may appear inside the mouth. Following this, a rash of small, flat red spots appear on the skin. Sometimes small, raised bumps may appear on top of the flat red spots. The rash usually starts on the face and then spreads down the rest of the body. After a few days, the fever and rash start to slowly go away.\nSymptoms usually begin 8 to 12 days after a person has been exposed to the virus. A person infected with the measles virus is contagious for 3 to 5 days before the rash breaks out, and the contagious period continues for 4 days after the rash appears.\nYour doctor will examine you. They will ask you about your symptoms. Usually doctors can diagnose measles based on the rash and the Koplik spots (spots in the mouth caused by measles). There is also a test that can be run when a clinical diagnosis is unclear.\nThere is no cure for measles. The infection must run its course. Treatment usually involves relieving symptoms. This can include:\nIt is important to keep your child out of school or childcare when they have measles. They need to stay away from anyone who may not have been vaccinated against the disease. In some cases, people who have been vaccinated can still get measles, so they should follow their doctor\u2019s instructions on isolation and other precautions.\nYou can almost completely prevent getting measles by getting the measles vaccine. Doctors call it the MMR vaccine, which stands for measles, mumps, and rubella. This single shot protects you from all three diseases. The MMR vaccine is safe, and doctors recommend two doses for the best protection. Children should get the first dose at 12\u201315 months old and the second at 4\u20136 years old. Talk to your doctor to find out the best time to vaccinate your child.\nBefore doctors developed the measles vaccine, the disease was common. While some people believe measles isn\u2019t harmful, it can lead to serious health problems. Children under age 5 face the highest risk of complications. About 1 in 4 people who get measles end up in the hospital.\nMeasles can cause common complications like ear infections and diarrhea. It can also lead to severe complications, such as:\nPneumonia (a lung infection)\u2013 This is the leading cause of death from measles in young children.\nEncephalitis (brain swelling)\u2013 This can leave a child deaf or cause intellectual disabilities.\nMake sure you and your child get the measles vaccine. It protects against the disease and offers long-lasting immunity.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Measles\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Measles\nAcknowledgement: This resource is supported by an unrestricted grant from Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.\nLast Updated:May 5, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

A normal intestine does not have a pouch. The condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth. It occurs in a small percentage of the population.\nMost people who have a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum have no symptoms. Only a small percentage people who are born with it have problems. Symptoms vary by age. Infants and children may have bleeding from the rectum. Sometimes blood can be seen in the stool. In adults, the intestine may become blocked. Symptoms of this are stomach pain and vomiting. Other symptoms include fever,constipation, decreased ability to pass gas, and swelling of the stomach.\nA Meckel\u2019s diverticulum is formed when the fetus is in the womb. The pouch is made up of leftover tissue from the baby\u2019s digestive tract.\nAlthough a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum exists at birth, doctors do not test for it. Contact your doctor if you or your child develops symptoms. The doctor can do a test called a Meckel\u2019s scan. For the test, the doctor injects a fluid into your body that can be seen by a special camera. If you have a diverticulum, the fluid will gather around the pouch. This allows the doctor to confirm a diagnosis.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum.\nTreatment for a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum is needed for people who have symptoms. This may include surgery, as a last resort, to remove the pouch and repair the intestine. Risks of surgery include bleeding, swelling, tearing, and folding of the intestines.\nPeople who don\u2019t have symptoms can be monitored by their doctor.

Before birth, the fetal monitor may show a slow heart rate. During delivery or at birth, meconium can be seen in the amniotic fluid and on the infant. If the baby has trouble breathing, the doctor will listen to the newborn\u2019s chest and do a blood gas analysis (blood test to assess the baby\u2019s breathing). With MAS, the test will often show a decreased oxygen level and increased carbon dioxide level. This means the baby needs help breathing.\nFollowing your doctor\u2019s advice and taking good care of yourself and your baby during pregnancy can often prevent problems that lead to meconium being present at birth. Smoking during pregnancy can raise the chances of having a baby with MAS. Some additional risk factors for MAS include:\nEarly detection is key. A fetal monitor can detect if your baby is experiencing stress. If your doctor thinks your baby may have inhaled meconium, a special care team should be present during delivery. If after the baby is born, he\u2019s active and crying, no treatment is necessary.\nHowever, if the baby has trouble breathing, the doctor will quickly need to clear away as much meconium as possible to decrease the amount of meconium the baby inhales. They will suction the mouth, nose, and throat. Then they will insert a tube called a laryngoscope down the baby\u2019s throat and into the trachea to remove any meconium there.\nIf your baby is not breathing or has a low heart rate, a facemask with oxygen can help inflate the baby\u2019s lungs and help him or her breathe. Your baby may need to be monitored closely in a newborn intensive care unit (NICU). In the NICU, they may get:\nAlthough MAS can be scary for parents, most babies will get better quickly. While rapid breathing may continue for several days, it\u2019s rare for a baby with MAS to experiences any long-term damage. However, babies who experienced MAS may be at higher risk for an asthma-like disease called \u201creactive airway disease.\u201d This can cause wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, usually when they have a cold or other virus.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Meconium aspiration syndrome\nLast Updated:April 26, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nMelasma is a common skin condition in which brown patches appear on the skin. Melasma most often affects the skin on the face. It can also develop on the forearms and neck.\nMelasma is not a serious condition. But it can affect your appearance and the way you feel about it.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes melasma. It probably happens when the color-making cells in the skin produce too much color. Anyone can get it, but it is more common among young women. The condition is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. You are at increased risk of developing melasma if you are a woman who:\nBeing out in the sun for too long and too often also puts you at risk for this condition. Melasma is common in people who live in tropical climates. People who have darker skin are also more likely to get it.\nYour doctor will be able to tell if you have melasma by looking at your skin. He or she may use a special lamp (called a Wood\u2019s lamp) that uses ultraviolet light for a closer examination of your skin. In rare cases, your doctor may want to take a very small piece of your skin (biopsy) to make sure that the brown patches are melasma.\nMost people with melasma do not need treatment. Melasma may fade away slowly if you stop taking birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. If melasma appeared while you were pregnant, it may go away a few months after you have the baby.\nIf melasma doesn\u2019t fade or it bothers you, it can be treated. Your doctor will probably prescribe a cream that contains hydroquinone. Creams that combine hydroquinone with kojic acid, azelaic acid, tretinoin, corticosteroids, or glycolic acid can also treat melasma. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a chemical peel, microdermabrasion, or laser treatment to help lighten the dark patches.\nChange in skin color is the only symptom of melasma. The brown patches don\u2019t hurt, itch, or physically affect you. The patches are usually an even brown color and are usually symmetrical. They tend to appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip.\nSince doctors don\u2019t always know what causes melasma, it can be difficult to prevent it. The best way to avoid it is to use a broad spectrum, high SPF sunscreen every day. You should also wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect your face any time you\u2019ll be out in the sun.\nIt may take several months before you see the results of treatment. It\u2019s important to follow your doctor\u2019s recommendations, even if you haven\u2019t seen any improvement yet.\nYou may need to keep treating your skin even after your melasma goes away. This can help keep it from returning. It is also important to avoid being in the sun and to use sunscreen daily. This will also help prevent melasma from returning.\nAmerican Academy of Dermatologists, Melasma\nLast Updated:August 30, 2018\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMeniere\u2019s disease is a problem that occurs in your inner ear. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it may be related to a build-up of fluid in the inner ear. Although it can be troublesome, Meniere\u2019s disease is not contagious, and it isn\u2019t fatal.\nMeniere\u2019s disease is a chronic (ongoing) problem. People who have the condition don\u2019t have symptoms all the time. When symptoms occur, it\u2019s called an \u201cattack.\u201d Attacks may happen often or just sometimes. Attacks may last from 20 minutes to 2 hours or longer. Meniere\u2019s disease usually occurs in only one ear. But some people have problems in both ears.\nDuring an attack, symptoms include dizziness, a feeling of fullness in the ear, andtinnitus(a ringing sound in the ear). The dizziness is described as a spinning or whirling feeling. It may cause problems with balance and make you feel unstable while walking. Because of the spinning feeling, some people sweat, feel nauseated, and vomit during an attack. You may also notice some hearing loss, especially with sounds that have a low tone.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes Meniere\u2019s Disease. They believe it is related to having extra fluid in the inner ear. This extra fluid could be caused by several factors including allergies, viral infections, genetics, improper drainage of the middle ear, or more.\nThis condition can develop at any age but is more common in middle-aged adults.\nYour doctor will ask questions about your symptoms. They will ask you to describe what happens when you have an attack. Your doctor will want to rule out other ear problems, so they may do some tests. These tests might include:\nBecause doctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes Meniere\u2019s disease, you may not be able to prevent it. However, you can help control attacks by modifying your lifestyle and diet. Talk to your doctor about treating fluid build-up in your ear.\nThere is no cure for Meniere\u2019s disease, but your doctor can suggest ways to manage your symptoms, including:\nYour doctor also can prescribe medicine to relieve feelings of dizziness and\u00a0nausea. These medicines may cause you to feel sleepy.\nIn serious cases of Meniere\u2019s disease (when attacks can\u2019t be controlled by diet or medicine), surgery may be necessary.\nReducing the number of attacks decreases your chances for progressive hearing loss associated with the disease. This hearing loss is often temporary but can be permanent.\nDuring an attack, try to lie flat on a surface that doesn\u2019t move, such as the floor. To cope with the dizziness, keep your eyes aimed at an object that doesn\u2019t move. You will be less likely to vomit if you don\u2019t eat or drink much. When your symptoms go away, get up slowly. You may feel very sleepy and want to sleep for several hours after an attack. If you keep\u00a0vomiting\u00a0for more than 24 hours and can\u2019t tolerate liquids, call your doctor.\nMeniere\u2019s disease is often frustrating for people who have it. You may have to change the way you live to control the attacks. You should follow your doctor\u2019s advice about your diet, and about cutting out alcohol, caffeine, and smoking. Since\u00a0stress\u00a0may cause an attack, you may have to find ways to limit the stress in your life or learn how to deal with stress more effectively.\nLet your family, friends, and co-workers know about the disease.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMeningitis is swelling of the tissue around your brain and spinal cord. There are two common types of meningitis. Viral meningitis is the most common and least serious. It can make you feel like you have the flu. The treatment for viral meningitis if often only supportive, but it may also require anti-viral medicines. Bacterial meningitis is more serious. It can cause brain damage or death if not treated early. Both types are spread through direct contact with an infected person, especially through sharing food and drink.\nSymptoms are slightly different for viral and bacterial meningitis.\nViral meningitis symptoms include:\nBacterial meningitis symptoms appear fast. They include:\nMost people think it\u2019s the flu. This delays treatment and puts you at greater risk for complications. Complications can occur within a few hours of the symptoms.\nWatch for unusual signs of bacterial meningitis with a sick baby. These include:\nA serious case of untreated bacterial meningitis can causestroke, hearing loss, permanent brain damage, and death.\nViral meningitis is caused by a group of viruses. This group is common in the late spring to fall. Not everyone who is infected with these viruses will develop meningitis.\nBacterial meningitis is caused by some of the same germs that cause pneumonia and strep throat. These germs also can cause a serious illness called sepsis. Sepsis is your body\u2019s response to serious infection. It can cause your organs to fail, cause damage to your body\u2019s tissue, and even death.\nBoth types are spread through direct contact with an infected person. This includes sharing food and drink with that person. Viral and bacterial meningitis affect people of all ages. Young babies and young people in close living quarters are more likely to get it. This includes students attending camps and living in college dorms.\nDoctors will take a sample of your child\u2019s blood. Your doctor also may take a sample of fluid from your child\u2019s spine. If it is bacterial meningitis, further lab tests from the same sample will help your doctor determine treatment.\nFor a less serious case of viral meningitis, doctors will swab your child\u2019s nose and throat. They may also swab your child\u2019s bottom. They may ask for a stool sample. For a serious case of viral meningitis, doctors will take a sample of blood and spinal fluid.\nBacterial meningitis can be prevented with a vaccine. Children should get the vaccine at 11 years and a booster at 16 years.\nTo avoid viral meningitis:\nFast response time is important in treating meningitis. If you suspect meningitis, get to a doctor or hospital quickly. Doctors can treat bacterial meningitis early with antibiotics. They also will treat the early symptoms. This includes giving IV fluids. This helps replace what they\u2019ve lost from vomiting or not drinking. Also, they will give over-the-counter pain medicine (two brands: Tylenol, Motrin) for fever and headache. For milder cases of viral meningitis, you may only need rest and fluids. For more serious cases, a hospital stay may be required.\nPrescription medicine can treat more serious complications, such as seizures or stroke. Your doctor also may test for hearing loss. He or she may check for brain damage.\nSee your doctor early to reduce serious complications. Fast response is important. Specialists will treat hearing loss, stroke, seizures, or brain damage.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nMenopause\u00a0is when your menstrual periods permanently stop (12 months in a row without a period) and you can no longer become pregnant. It is normal and occurs as you age. Menopause begins and ends differently for each person. It\u2019s normal for menopause to occur anytime from age 40 to age 59. Menopause is a gradual process that can take several years.\nPerimenopauseis the term for the 3 to 5 years around the time it takes to complete menopause and before your final period. During this time, ovaries produce fewer hormones (estrogen and progesterone). These are the hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle. You will experience fewer periods that are further apart as it comes to an end completely. In general, your periods will likely not follow a pattern during this time.\nSymptoms of menopause vary. Some people just stop having periods. Most people experience some symptoms, including:\nTalk to your doctor if you have:\nMany people experience emotional symptoms during menopause. These symptoms may include sadness,\u00a0anxiety, and mood swings. For some people, symptoms can be severe. If you find that you\u2019re having emotional problems, talk to your family doctor.\nThe timing of actual menopause is different for each person. The average age for a person to have their last period is about 51. But it\u2019s normal for menopause to occur any time from age 40 to 59. A person often goes through menopause at about the same age as their mother.\nYou may stop having periods early (before age 40). If so, your doctor can do a blood test to see if you\u2019re going through menopause. If you\u2019re not, the doctor will look for another cause for your missed periods.\nMenopause is a gradual process that can take several years. You haven\u2019t fully reached menopause until you haven\u2019t had a period for 12 months. (During this time, keep using birth control if you don\u2019t want to become pregnant.)\nPeople who have both ovaries removed during surgery will go through \u201csurgical menopause\u201d at the time of their surgery. If the\u00a0uterus\u00a0is taken out but the ovaries are not, a person will stop having periods, but they will not go through surgical menopause.\nMenopause is a natural process of aging. It occurs as your ovaries stop producing the hormones that control\u00a0menstruation. These hormones are estrogen and progesterone. Without these hormones, your body will no longer release an egg each month.\nIf you believe you are going through menopause and have concerns, talk to your doctor. Menopause does not require an official\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0unless you need to confirm it. Your doctor may order a blood test to check your\u00a0hormone\u00a0levels. They will check for estrogen as well as a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\nMenopause cannot be prevented or avoided.\nThere isn\u2019t a set treatment for menopause. There are ways to manage some of its symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you are struggling with hot flashes, if sex is painful, or if your emotions seem unbalanced.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment for menopause symptoms. It involves taking prescription, synthetic hormones (which are made in a laboratory rather than by the body). HRT can involve taking estrogen alone or estrogen combined with another hormone, progestin. Some people have found that HRT can relieve menopause symptoms. These symptoms include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and some urinary problems. However, HRT is not for everyone. It does have its risks, including stroke, blood clots, and cancer. Recent studies suggest that for most people, the risks of using HRT may outweigh the benefits. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of HRT.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends\u00a0against\u00a0the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the prevention of\u00a0chronic\u00a0conditions in postmenopausal women. The AAFP also recommends\u00a0against\u00a0the use of estrogen for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a\u00a0hysterectomy.\nAccording to the AAFP, \u201cThis recommendation applies to postmenopausal women who are considering hormone replacement therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, or to women who have had premature menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency), or surgical menopause.\u201d\nYes, other medicines may help ease some menopausal symptoms. These include estrogen cream, low-dose antidepressants, water-based topical creams, soy products, and certain herbal supplements. Discuss these options with your doctor. Topical HRT also is associated with some risks.\nPhytoestrogens are plant-based substances found in some cereals, vegetables, beans and other legumes, and herbs. They may work in the body like a weak form of estrogen. Researchers are studying whether phytoestrogens can be used to relieve some symptoms of menopause. They are also studying the side effects caused by these substances. Many soy products are good sources of phytoestrogens. These include tofu, tempeh, soymilk, and soy nuts. Some studies indicate that soy supplements may reduce hot flashes after menopause.\nHowever, the results haven\u2019t been consistent. There is not enough scientific evidence to recommend the use of herbs that contain phytoestrogens to treat symptoms of menopause. This is also true of pills and creams made with these herbs. In addition, not enough is known about the risks of using these products. Herbs and supplements are not regulated like medicines. Some herbs and supplements can be harmful when combined with certain medicines. If you\u2019re considering using any natural or herbal products to ease your symptoms, talk to your doctor first.\nLiving with menopause is easier for some people than others. It depends on the severity of your symptoms. Use these tips to help ease symptoms and to learn more about how to deal with menopause.\nIf you have hot flashes, you may want to avoid spicy or hot foods and drinks. These can trigger hot flashes. Alcohol can trigger hot flashes, too. It also interferes with bone growth and calcium absorption. People who are going through menopause should avoid or limit alcohol.\nThe following tips can help reduce sleep problems:\nThe older a person is, the greater their risk ofosteoporosis. A person\u2019s risk becomes even greater when they go through menopause. When your estrogen level decreases during menopause, you lose more bone than your body can replace. This makes your bones weaker and more likely to break. To keep your bones strong, it\u2019s important to get enough calcium and\u00a0vitamin\u00a0D in your diet. These help your body absorb calcium. Your doctor can suggest ways to get more calcium through food, drink, and, possibly, a calcium supplement. They may also suggest that you take a vitamin D supplement to help your body process calcium. Ask your doctor what amount of daily calcium and vitamin D is right for you.\nPeople are more likely to develop\u00a0heart disease\u00a0after menopause. Lower estrogen levels may be part of the cause. It also could be that other health issues that are more common as people get older. These include gaining weight, becoming less active, and developinghigh blood pressureordiabetes. You can reduce your risk of these health problems by eating a variety of healthy, nutrient-rich foods. It also helps to stay active and maintain an appropriate weight.\nIf you are still having periods as you go through menopause, you may continue to be at risk of a low iron level. This is especially true if your bleeding is heavy, or you spot between periods. This can lead toanemia. Talk with your doctor about the amount of iron that\u2019s right for you. Good sources of iron include spinach, beans, and meat. Your doctor may also suggest that you take an iron supplement.\nQuestions to ask your doctor\nResources\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Menopause\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging: What Is Menopause?\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office on Women\u2019s Health: Menopause treatment\nLast Updated:October 30, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nMetabolic syndrome is the term used to describe a set of risk factors forheart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anddiabetesor high blood sugars.\nYour body changes most of the food you eat into glucose (a form of sugar). Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin allows glucose to enter all the cells of your body and be used as energy.\nFor some people, over time, their body\u2019s tissues stop responding to insulin. Doctors refer to this condition as insulin resistance. If you have insulin resistance, your body will make more and more insulin. Because your tissues don\u2019t respond to it, your body can\u2019t use glucose properly.\nHow does this relate to metabolic syndrome?\nInsulin resistanceoften goes along with other health problems. These include obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. These problems are all risk factors for heart disease. When a person has many of these problems at the same time, doctors commonly call it metabolic syndrome. It is sometimes called insulin resistance syndrome or metabolic syndrome X. Many people who havetype 2 diabetesalso have metabolic syndrome.\nFor the most part, metabolic syndrome does not have any true signs or symptoms. If you gain weight around your waist, it can be one indicator of metabolic syndrome.\nBut some of the other diseases that go along with metabolic syndrome do have symptoms. These include possible frequent urination and unusual thirst when you have diabetes.\nA number of factors can act together to cause metabolic syndrome. A person who takes in too many calories and too much saturated fat and does not get enough physical activity may develop metabolic syndrome. Other causes include insulin resistance and a family history of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam and blood tests. He or she can diagnosis metabolic syndrome if at least 3 of the following are true:\nThe more of these risk factors you have, the higher your risk of heart disease.\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent metabolic syndrome. This includes losing weight if you\u2019re overweight. It also includes getting more physical activity and eating a healthy diet. Also, if you smoke, you should stop.\nIf you already have metabolic syndrome, making these healthy lifestyle choices can help reduce your risk of heart disease and other health problems. If lifestyle changes alone can\u2019t control your risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help.\nMaintain a healthy weight.\nYour doctor can measure your body mass index (BMI) to determine a healthy weight for your height. He or she can help you make a plan to lose weight if you\u2019re overweight, and to maintain your weight through a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Carrying extra weight in your abdomen is especially unhealthy. Losing this weight or exchanging it for muscle weight will improve health.\nGet more physical activity.\nNot being active is one of the biggest risk factors for heart disease. It\u2019s important to get exercise on a regular basis. Start by talking with your family doctor, especially if you haven\u2019t been active for a while. You may need to begin with some light exercise, such as walking. Then you can gradually increase how hard you exercise and for how long. A good goal for many people is to work up to exercising 4 to 6 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes at a time. A minimum of 150 minutes a week is best for good health. Two days of resistance or strength training each week is also recommended for health. Your doctor can help you set a goal that\u2019s right for you.\nEat a healthy diet.\nWhen combined with exercise, a healthy diet can help you lose weight, lower your cholesterol level, and improve the way your body functions. Foods high in dietary fiber should be a regular part of your diet. You should eat several servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain bread every day. Also, limit the amount of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium (salt), and added sugar in your diet.\nImproving your heath through diet and exercise if often enough to prevent metabolic syndrome. You may also need to take medicine for diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Being proactive about your health will help reduce your risk for heart disease.\nNational Institutes of Health: What Is Metabolic Syndrome?\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Metabolic Syndrome\nLast Updated:December 16, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Staph is the common name for the bacteria named Staphylococcus aureus. What makes MRSA different from a typical staph infection is its resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and other common antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin. This means these antibiotics do not work on the infection. That\u2019s why an MRSA infection is so difficult to treat.\nTwo main types of MRSA arecommunity-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA)andhealth care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA).\nMRSA skin infections include:\nCuts, scrapes, and hairy areas of the body are common places for MRSA infections to occur.\nBumps from MRSA skin infections can quickly turn into pus-filled abscesses. These are deep, infected wounds. The bacteria may stay in the skin. They can also spread deep in the body. This could cause possibly life-threatening infections such as pneumonia. If they are not treated properly, MRSA infections can cause sepsis. This is a life-threatening reaction to severe infection in the body which weakens your organs.\nIf you or a family member experiences MRSA symptoms, it is important to call your family doctor immediately. This is especially important if the symptoms include fever. Do not pick at the infected skin or try to treat it yourself. Be sure to cover the area with a bandage. Wash your hands with soap before and after bandaging the wound.\nThe MRSA infection is spread through contact with an infected person. This could be skin-to-skin contact or from personal items that have touched the infected skin.\nHA-MRSA can spread when health care workers don\u2019t wash their hands well between seeing patients. To kill all the bacteria, hands must be washed thoroughly using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. If this isn\u2019t done, the bacteria can spread from infected patients to healthy ones.\nPeople in hospitals, health care facilities, and nursing homes who have weak immune systems are at risk of more serious complications if they get HA-MRSA. Many things can weaken a person\u2019s immune system. Some chemotherapy drugs and medicines taken after an organ transplant can weaken the immune system. So can having the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Risk factors for getting HA-MRSA include:\nCA-MRSA is spread through:\nDaycare centers, dormitories, jails, locker rooms, military barracks, prisons, and schools are common locations for the CA-MRSA.\nMRSA outbreaks have also occurred among members of sports teams. This is because skin-to-skin contact, sharing equipment, and minor cuts and scrapes occur frequently.\nSeveral tests can show if you have MRSA. Your doctor may take a sample from your wound or nasal passages. They may also take a sample of urine or blood to send to the laboratory. Results of this type of test (called a culture) should be ready in about 24 to 48 hours. It can take about 48 hours for the bacteria to grow. A newer rapid blood test provides results more quickly, in about 2 hours.\nGood hygiene is the best way to avoid MRSA and other bacterial infections:\nIn serious cases, some strains of MRSA respond to antibiotics. Take all the doses of the medicine, even if you\u2019re feeling better, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Contact your doctor if you do not improve after a few days or if the infection gets worse.\nFor mild cases of MRSA, your doctor may drain the skin boil or abscess and cover the wound with a clean dressing or bandage. The dressing will need to be changed regularly. Your doctor may also prescribe an ointment to apply to the area. Often, this is all that is needed to treat the infection. Schedule a follow-up visit to make sure the site is healing well. Call your doctor if you don\u2019t see any improvement after a few days.\nFollow your doctor\u2019s instructions for caring for your infection:\nIf your clothing, sheets, or towels are contaminated with the MRSA bacteria, wash them in hot water (at least 160\u00ac\u221eF) and laundry detergent. Use a hot dryer rather than air drying. Clean surfaces with household cleaners.\nYou may need to be hospitalized if:\nWhen you\u2019re in the hospital, you will be monitored closely and receive powerful antibiotics. These are called broad-spectrum antibiotics because they are designed to fight a wide range of infections.\nHealthy people who develop MRSA skin infections rarely develop more serious problems. But people who have weak immune systems and who get HA-MRSA can develop serious, even life-threatening infections.\nMRSA can be carried in the nasal passages and spread even if you don\u2019t know you have it and don\u2019t have any symptoms. If you have frequent MRSA infections, your doctor may want to perform a nasal swab to see if your family members are carriers of MRSA.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Methicillin-resistant\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: MRSA\nLast Updated:August 17, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

So, if you have microscopic hematuria, you have red blood cells in your urine that can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye.\nMost of the time, you won\u2019t have symptoms of microscopic hematuria. Sometimes you may feel a burning sensation when you urinate. Or you may feel the urge to urinate more often than usual.\nMany times, there is no cause for microscopic hematuria. It comes and goes on its own. Other times, it may be caused by:\nYour doctor will usually start by asking you for a\u00a0urine\u00a0sample. They will test your urine (urinalysis) for the presence of red blood cells. Your doctor will also check for other things that might explain what\u2019s wrong. For example, white blood cells in your urine usually means you have an infection. If you do have blood in your urine, your doctor will ask you some questions to find out what caused it.\nIf the cause isn\u2019t clear, you may need more tests. These may include:\nA nurse will give you an antiseptic wipe to clean yourself and a\u00a0sterile\u00a0urine collection cup. In the bathroom, wash your hands with soap and warm water first. If you are menstruating, tell your doctor before you give your urine sample.\nYou may not be able to prevent microscopic hematuria, depending on what causes it. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends drinking plenty of fluids, especially when you\u2019re exercising.\nIf your doctor finds what\u2019s causing the blood in your urine, they will treat that problem. Later, they will check your urine again to see if the blood is gone. If it\u2019s not, your doctor may perform more tests or refer you to a urologist.\nIf you have no symptoms of microscopic hematuria, you may not know to alert your doctor.

    "article_title": "Types of migraines",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nA migraine is usually an intense pounding headache that can last for hours or even days. The pounding or pulsing pain usually begins in the forehead, the side of the head, or around the eyes. The headache gradually gets worse. Just about any movement, activity, bright light, or loud noise seems to make it hurt more. Nausea and vomiting are common during a migraine.\nMigraines may happen only once or twice a year, or as often as daily. Women are more likely to have migraines than men.\nThere are different types of migraine headaches. The most common types of migraines are classic migraines and common migraines.\nClassic migraines(also called complicated migraines) start with a warning sign called an aura. These types of migraines are sometimes also called \u201cmigraines with aura.\u201d The aura involves changes in the way you see. You may see flashing lights, colors, a pattern of lines, or shadows. It\u2019s possible to temporarily lose some of your vision, such as your side vision.\nYou may also feel a strange prickly or burning sensation or have muscle weakness on one side of your body. Speaking/communicating may become difficult. You may also feel depressed, irritable, and restless.\nAuras last about 15 to 30 minutes. Auras may occur before or after your head pain. Sometimes the pain and aura overlap, or the pain never occurs. The head pain of classic migraines may occur on one side of your head or on both sides.\nCommon migrainesdon\u2019t start with an aura. For this reason, these types of migraines are also called \u201cmigraines without aura.\u201d Common migraines may start more slowly than classic migraines, last longer, and interfere more with daily activities. The pain of common migraines may be on only one side of your head. Most people who have migraines have common migraines (they don\u2019t have an aura).\nMigraines without head pain, sometimes called \u201csilent migraines,\u201d may cause you to feel other migraine symptoms, but not pain. This means you may not have the usual migraine pain around your eyes and temples. This type of migraine may even include an aura phase. You may also feel the same sensitivity to light and sound as with a typical migraine.\nHemiplegic migrainescause one side of your body to become weak, similar to having a stroke. These symptoms are only temporary. They are a part of the migraine attack. Areas of the body affected by the weakness may include your face, arm, or leg. The weakness may last from an hour to even days. It most often goes away within 24 hours. For this type of migraine, the head pain can come before or after the weakness. This type of migraine is rare.\nRetinal migraines(also called ocular migraines) cause changes in vision that are not related to aura vision changes. For retinal migraines, symptoms involve vision problems or even blindness in one eye. These symptoms do not last long. They can occur before or after head pain. If you experience this type of migraine, contact your doctor.\nIcepick headachesare not migraine headaches. They produce a stabbing pain around your eyes and temples. These stabbing pains may occur repeatedly in the same place or jump around to different areas each time. This type of headache can occur at any time and without warning. If you are a person who has migraine headaches, you are more likely to get icepick headaches, too.\nCluster headachesare not migraine headaches. They are rare headaches that occur in patterns, known as cluster periods. These periods can mean having a headache at the same time every day for a week or even a month. Cluster headaches can be extremely painful. They usually cause pain on one side of your head. This pain can be so severe that it makes your eyelid droop and your nose get stuffy.\nCervicogenic headachesare not migraine headaches. They are headaches caused by another illness or physical condition, usually a problem in your neck. Many times, this type of headache can be brought on by a sudden movement of your neck. You might also get a cervicogenic headache after keeping your neck in the same position for too long. You might notice more tightness or tenderness of your neck muscles. The pain can last for hours or days. It may be limited to one side of your head or face.\nThe pain of a migraine headache can be intense. It can interfere with your daily activities. Migraines aren\u2019t the same for everyone. Possible symptoms of migraines are listed below. You may have a \u201cpremonition\u201d several hours to a day before your headache starts. Premonitions are feelings you feel when a migraine is coming. These feelings can include intense energy, fatigue, food cravings, thirst, and mood changes.\nPossible symptoms of migraines include:\nResearchers do not yet understand all the factors that cause migraines. It appears they may be caused in part by changes in the level of a body chemical called serotonin. Serotonin plays many roles in the body and affects blood vessels. When serotonin levels are high, blood vessels constrict (shrink). When serotonin levels fall, the blood vessels dilate (swell). This swelling can cause pain or other problems. Another cause being studied is that migraine headaches go along with a spreading pattern of electrical activity in the brain.\nSome research suggests there could be a heredity factor for migraines, meaning they may run in families. Researchers have identified some genes associated with migraines. They are unsure why these genes impact some people more than others. The American Migraine Foundation reports that if one of your parents has migraines, there is a 50% chance that you will, too. If both of your parents have migraines, your chances jump up to 75%. Ultimately, migraines seem to be caused by a combination of factors: genetic, environmental, and lifestyle.\nWomen are more likely to have chronic migraines (migraines that occur 15 days a month or more). This is likely linked to hormones. Hormones fluctuate each month around the time of your period. They can also fluctuate if you are pregnant or going through menopause.\nSome risk factors make you more likely to get migraine headaches. Other things may trigger a migraine.\nFamily history:You are much more likely to have migraines if one or both of your parents had migraines.\nSex:Women are more likely than men to have migraines.\nAge:Most people have their first migraine during adolescence, but migraines can start at any age, usually before age 40.\nYour doctor can diagnose migraines by the symptoms you describe. In addition, your doctor will perform a physical exam. Your doctor might want to do blood tests or imaging tests, such as anMRIor CAT scan of the brain. These tests can ensure there are no other causes for the headache. You may also be asked to keep amigraine journal. This can help your doctor identify the things that might cause your migraines.\nIf headache pain is getting in the way of your daily activities, it\u2019s time to see your family doctor.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Jennifer Hanna\nMedicine to prevent migraines may be helpful if your headaches happen more than 2 times a month. You may want to consider this medicine if your headaches make it hard for you to work and function. These medicines are taken every day, whether you have a headache or not.\nPreventive medications for migraines can include prescription drugs often used to treat other ailments. Anti-seizure medicines, antidepressants, medicines to lower blood pressure, and even Botox injections are some of the preventive medications your doctor may prescribe. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors can also help prevent migraines. They do so by blocking a gene-related peptide in your sensory nerves. This peptide is known to increase during a migraine attack, so blocking it can help prevent migraines.\nThere are also a number of non-medical treatments designed to help minimize migraine pain and frequency. One is an electrical stimulation device, which has been approved by the FDA. It is a headband that you wear once a day for 20 minutes to stimulate the nerve linked to migraines. Another non-medical treatment is counseling aimed at helping you feel in more control of your migraines. This counseling works best when paired with medical prevention of migraines as well.\nWhat else can I do to prevent migraines?\nWhile there are no sure ways to keep from having migraine headaches, here are some things that may help:\nThere are 2 types of medicines for migraine treatments (abortive and preventive). One type, called \u201cabortive,\u201d focuses on stopping the headache from becoming severe and relieving the headache pain. You should start this type of treatment as soon as you think you\u2019re getting a migraine. The other type, called \u201cprophylactic\u201d or \u201cpreventive\u201d includes medicines that are taken every day to reduce how often headaches occur (outlined in the section above).\nTalk to your doctor about which of these two types of medicine is best for you. Some people use both types. Nonprescription and prescription medicines that are used often or in large doses may cause other problems.\nFor mild to moderate migraines, over-the-counter medicines that may help relieve migraine pain include:\nPeople who have more severe migraines may need to try \u201cabortive\u201d prescription medicines. A medicine called ergotamine can be effective alone or combined with other medicines. Dihydroergotamine is related to ergotamine and can be helpful. Other prescription medicines for migraines include sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, and frovatriptan.\nIf the pain won\u2019t go away, stronger pain medicine may be needed, such as a narcotic, or medicines that contain a barbiturate (sleep-inducing medicine). These medicines can be habit-forming and should be used cautiously. Your doctor may prescribe these only if they are needed and only for a short period of time.\nTo help manage your migraine pain, try the following:\nMigraines can come on quickly, many times without warning. They can ruin your day\u2014or even several days at a time. They can make you miss work, miss important events, miss out on fun. If you have recurring migraines, you probably feel like you don\u2019t have total control of your life.\nWork with your doctor to take back control. Keep a migraine journal. Document when you get migraines and what you were doing and eating. Keep a record of what the weather was like and if you were exposed to unusual smells or environments. Knowing your triggers can help you prevent migraines. You doctor also may prescribe different medicines or combinations of medicines. Doing this helps sort out which will be most effective for preventing migraines or stopping them when they start.\nAmerican Migraine Foundation\nNational Headache Foundation\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Migraine\nFunding and support for this material have been provided byThe Allergan Foundation.\nLast Updated:September 9, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMitral valve prolapse is a problem in your heart. Your heart has four chambers. The\u00a0mitral valve\u00a0controls the flow of\u00a0blood\u00a0between 2 of the chambers. These are the left atrium and the left\u00a0ventricle. Normally, when the\u00a0heart\u00a0relaxes in between beats, the 2 flaps of the mitral valve swing open to let blood flow from the atrium to the ventricle. The flaps normally open only one way and the blood only flows one way.\nIf you have mitral valve prolapse, the flaps of the mitral valve are \u201cfloppy\u201d and don\u2019t close properly. Sometimes this can allow blood to leak from the ventricle back into the atrium. When this happens, you may experience symptoms.\nApproximately 2% of Americans have mitral valve prolapse. More women have it than men.\nMost people don\u2019t know that they have mitral valve prolapse. It often causes no symptoms. If the blood leaks back into the atrium, you may have symptoms that can include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of mitral valve prolapse. People are usually born with it. It tends to run in families. You could have a higher risk of mitral valve prolapse if you have certain conditions, including:\nAging also raises your risk.\nUsually, your doctor will find mitral valve prolapse during a regular exam. When listening to your heart with a stethoscope, your doctor may hear the flap of your mitral valve make a clicking sound. If blood is flowing back into the atrium, your doctor will hear a \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound. This sound is called a\u00a0murmur.\nTo find out how well your valve is working, your doctor may order an echocardiogram. This provides a picture of your heart that shows your valve as the blood flows through it. This can help your doctor decide if you need treatment. Other tests that can help diagnose mitral valve prolapse include a chest X-ray or an EKG.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid mitral valve prolapse. Most people are born with it.\nOne complication from mitral valve prolapse is called infective endocarditis (IE). This is an infection in your heart. If you have mitral valve prolapse, antibiotics can prevent you from getting IE. If you\u2019re at high risk of getting IE, you can take antibiotics before surgeries or dental work to avoid getting the infection. Talk to your doctor about the risks vs. benefits of taking antibiotics to prevent IE.\nMost people who have mitral valve prolapse don\u2019t need any treatment. Only about 2 of every 100 people who have this condition have complications. Your doctor will tell you if you need treatment.\nSome people who have mitral valve prolapse must limit participation in competitive sports. If your mitral valve prolapse causes chest pain or other symptoms, your doctor might prescribe medicines such as beta blockers to make your symptoms better. If your symptoms are more significant, your doctor could prescribe other medicines, such as:\nSome people may need surgery to fix the problem. This could happen if your valve is very abnormal, or if a lot of blood is flowing in the wrong direction. Your doctor will operate to repair or replace the mitral valve.\nMost people with mitral valve prolapse can lead normal, active lives. They don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t need treatment. If you do have symptoms, they can normally be controlled with medicine.\nIf you have mitral valve prolapse, you do need ongoing care. You should have follow-up visits with your doctor and monitor your symptoms. Always take your prescribed medicine. Call your doctor if your symptoms increase or get worse.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nMononucleosis (often called \u201cmono\u201d) is a contagious illness. It\u2019s usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, but can be caused by other viruses, too. It\u2019s spread through saliva. For this reason, it\u2019s sometimes called the kissing disease. It\u2019s most common in teens and young adults. However, anyone at any age can get it.\nSome of the symptoms of mono are similar to those of a cold or flu. Symptoms often don\u2019t appear until 4 to 6 weeks after you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus. Mono symptoms may not come at the same time, and they may come on gradually. They include:\nSymptoms in young children are generally mild. In adolescents and young adults, symptoms tend to be more severe.\nMost cases of mono are caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. The virus is found in saliva, mucus, and other body fluids. It can be passed between people many ways. It can be passed through exposure to a cough or sneeze or by sharing food utensils (such as drinking glasses, spoons, and forks). Finally, mono can be passed from one person to another through kissing.\nYour doctor will probably first ask you some questions about your symptoms. He or she will do a physical exam and look for:\nYour doctor will probably order blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. One common test used to diagnose mono is called the Monospot test. Sometimes other blood tests are needed if the results of the Monospot test aren\u2019t clear.\nThere is no vaccine to prevent mono. The best thing you can do to avoid it is to stay away from anyone you know who has it. Don\u2019t kiss or share utensils or other personal items with someone who is sick (or has symptoms).\nThere isn\u2019t a cure for mono. The virus will go away on its own. Symptoms usually last about 4 weeks. The main goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms. Here are some steps you can take to feel better:\nAntibiotics are not effective against mono. Mono is caused by a virus. Antibiotics don\u2019t work against viruses. If you have a bacterial infection (such as strep throat) in addition to mono, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to treat that infection. Taking antibiotics for mono may cause an itchy rash.\nAvoid sports, physical activities, or exercise until your doctor tells you they\u2019re safe. Moving around too much puts you at risk of rupturing (bursting) your spleen, especially if it\u2019s enlarged. A ruptured spleen, while uncommon, causes bleeding that can be fatal. You\u2019ll need to avoid physical activities and contact sports for about 3 to 4 weeks after you\u2019ve had mono\u2014or until your doctor tells you it is safe.\nMost people feel better in 2 to 4 weeks. Fatigue may last for several more weeks. In some cases, symptoms can last for 6 months or longer. In addition, mono can sometimes have complications. The main complication is the enlargement of the spleen. The spleen is like a large gland. It\u2019s located in the upper part of your abdomen on the left side. It helps filter your blood. In severe cases of mono, the spleen can rupture (tear open).\nA ruptured spleen is rare in people who have mono. But it\u2019s wise to be aware of the signs:\nOther complications can include anemia, nervous system problems, or hepatitis with jaundice.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nMotion sickness is a sick feeling triggered by movement. It occurs in cars, buses, trains, planes, or boats. It can occur on amusement rides or virtual reality experiences. Seeing the movement of others or things can trigger it. This condition is not life-threatening, however, it can make traveling unpleasant. Planning ahead helps prevent, avoid, or reduce the effects. Other triggers include:\nMotion sickness is common in older people, pregnant women, and children between the ages of 5 and 12. Also, it\u2019s common in people who have migraine headaches. It may be genetic. Once the motion stops, you\u2019ll gradually feel better. In rare cases, the condition is triggered by a problem with your inner ear. This could be due to fluid buildup or an ear infection.Parkinson\u2019s diseaseis another cause of the condition.\nSymptoms can strike without warning. They can get worse quickly. You may feel sick to your stomach (nausea). Other symptoms include\u00a0vomiting, pale skin, headache, a\u00a0cold\u00a0sweat, dizziness, and irritability.\nMotion sickness is an imbalance between what you see and what you feel. In the car, the car is moving forward. However, your body is standing still. This imbalance is what causes you to feel sick.\nYou may notice a pattern of sickness when you travel. See your doctor if you experience motion sickness repeatedly. Your doctor will do a physical exam. They will look inside your ears and at your eyes. Your doctor will ask you questions about your health history before recommending treatment.\nIf you know you get motion sickness when traveling, plan ahead. These steps can prevent it or relieve the symptoms:\nIf your symptoms last longer than a few days, see your doctor.\nCommon medicines that treat motion sickness include Benadryl, Dramamine, and scopolamine. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends scopolamine. It eases nausea and vomiting. It does not make you sleepy. A skin patch works best.\nAntihistamines (one brand name: Benadryl) are helpful. However, these usually make you sleepy. Non-drowsy antihistamines are not effective in treating or preventing motion sickness. Another type of medicine is called antiemetics. These are used to treat nausea and vomiting.\nSome of these medicines are\u00a0prescription. Some are available over-the-counter. Talk to your doctor to determine which is best for you. These medicines work best when taken before you travel.\nOnce nausea begins, eat a few, plain crackers and drink clear, fizzy drinks (ginger ale is best) to relieve nausea.\nPlanning ahead is the best advice for motion sickness. If your symptoms are mild, medicines are effective.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byErin Corriveau, MD, MPH\nMpox (monkeypox) began making the news following a surge in new cases in summer 2022. This outbreak includes reports of cases in several countries where mpox hadn\u2019t been seen before. This includes the United States. In July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and in August 2022, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the ongoing spread of mpox virus in the U.S. a Public Health Emergency. By 2023, the number of cases decreased drastically.\nMpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. It has similar symptoms to smallpox, but it is milder and rarely fatal. Though the names sound alike, mpox is not related tochickenpox.\nMost infected people have mild cases, but there is risk for serious disease. Mpox can cause several symptoms, including:\nMost people with mpox report a rash that can look like pimples or blisters. It can appear on the face, including the inside of the mouth. It can also appear on other parts of the body including the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. Sometimes, people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Other people only experience a rash.\nMost people with mpox report a rash that can look like pimples or blisters. It can appear on the face, including the inside of the mouth. It can also appear on other parts of the body including the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. Sometimes, people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Other people only experience a rash.\nMpox is caused by a virus. The virus can spread from person-to-person in several ways:\nYou can also get the virus by being scratched or bitten by an infected animal. It can also come from meat or other products made from an infected animal.\nBecause the symptoms of mpox are similar to other diseases, your doctor will have to check for symptoms that are unique to mpox. Swollen lymph nodes are one such symptom. Your doctor may feel along your neck, armpits, or groin to check your lymph nodes for swelling.\nIf you have a rash or sore, your doctor may use a swab to take a sample and send it to a lab to be tested.\nThe risk to most people from mpox remains low, and there are many things you can do to reduce your risk even more. Take steps to avoid mpox as you would other viruses. These include:\nThe CDC offers guidance forsocial gatheringsandsafer sex practices.\nThere are vaccines for the mpox virus, but these are not yet available in all places. These are recommended for people who have been exposed and who may be at higher risk of being exposed. Mpox vaccine availability will be increasing very soon, so check with your doctor if you feel you would benefit from getting the vaccine.\nThere are no treatments specifically for mpox. But because it is similar to smallpox, treatments for smallpox have been effective.\nAntiviral drugs, such as tecovirimat, may be prescribed by your doctor if you are more likely to get severely ill.\nThe version of mpox in the current outbreak typically causes mild symptoms for 2-4 weeks and is rarely fatal. The CDC reports that while most people who contract mpox virus will recover, it is a more dangerous condition for those who are immune compromised. Children under age 8, those with compromised immune systems, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding may be more likely to suffer a more severe form of the illness.\nThe most common long-term effects will likely be scarring from the skin rash and possibly lasting vision loss in cases of eye involvement, which could lead damage to the cornea.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control: Mpox\nThe Cleveland Clinic: Mpox\nThis article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed by Erin Corriveau, MD, MPH.\nLast Updated:September 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is multiple myeloma?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nMultiple myeloma is a kind ofcancerin the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the tissue inside the bones where new blood cells are made. Multiple myeloma is caused when your body makes too many of a certain blood cell, called a plasma cell. When this happens, the abnormal plasma cells group together and form tumors. These tumors kill the bone cells around them. They also prevent your body from making other blood cells you do need.\nThe symptoms of multiple myeloma include:\nThe cause of multiple myeloma is currently unknown. This cancer usually occurs in people older than 60 years of age. It is slightly more common in men than in women. It often can run in families. Multiple myeloma is also twice as common in Black people than it is in white people. Some studies suggest that workers in agriculture or petroleum-based industries may be at greater risk due to exposure to chemicals.\nSeveral tests can help your doctor tell if you have multiple myeloma. An X-ray can identify areas of bone loss. Your doctor might order blood tests.\nIf the multiple myeloma is in a later stage, you may need more tests. Your doctor might want you to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan of your bones (also called an MRI scan). This scan can show if the multiple myeloma is in your spine.\nThe only way for your doctor to be sure you have multiple myeloma is by using a needle to take a very small sample of the tissue inside your bone. This is called a bone marrow aspiration. It can be done in your doctor\u2019s office. This procedure hurts a little, but no special care is needed afterward.\nThere is no known way to prevent multiple myeloma.\nThere is currently no cure for multiple myeloma. Treatment includes medicine to relieve pain, and chemotherapy to destroy abnormal cells and to slow the development of the disease. You will also need treatment if you have broken bones, a low blood count, infection, or kidney damage. Even with treatment, sometimes your symptoms will be better and sometimes they\u2019ll be worse. The 2 medicines most often used together to treat multiple myeloma are melphalan (a chemotherapy drug) and prednisone (a steroid medicine).\nYes, like most cancer medicines, these medicines have side effects. Your doctor will likely order monthly blood tests to evaluate progress. When melphalan kills the cancer cells, it also kills some of your body\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d cells. You may lose some of your hair, but it will grow back after you stop chemotherapy. However, if you have these symptoms, you should call your doctor right away:\nThese are some of the more serious side effects of melphalan. While you\u2019re taking melphalan, you must not get pregnant because melphalan might be harmful for the baby.\nIf the cancer doesn\u2019t respond to a combination of melphalan and prednisone, your doctor may talk with you about other treatments. These may include other medicines, radiation treatments, or a bone marrow transplant.\nEven with regular treatment, multiple myeloma may not completely go away. Or, if it does, you may live in fear of it coming back. That can cause much stress for you and your loved ones. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist about your feelings. Invite your family to do the same.\nIf you have multiple myeloma, you should try to stay active. Staying active helps keep the calcium in your bones instead of in your blood, which helps keep your bones strong. You should also eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Multiple Myeloma\nLast Updated:January 25, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is multiple sclerosis?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Normally, antibodies produced by the immune system help protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. In people who have MS, the immune system attacks the body. Antibodies destroy the substance that surrounds and protects your nerve cells, called the myelin sheath.\nThe CNS is made up of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Its job is to quickly send messages back and forth from the brain to different parts of the body. Damaged or destroyed myelin can slow down and block these messages.\nThere are four forms of MS:\nMS affects normal sensation, thinking, and movement. Symptoms vary depending on the part(s) of the body where the myelin sheath is damaged. Symptoms of MS are often mild. In rare cases, people may have some paralysis and lose the ability to write, speak, or walk\nCommon symptoms include:\nSymptoms of MS often come and go. Relapses may last for days, weeks, or months. For it to be considered a relapse, symptoms must last at least 24 hours and occur at least 30 days after the last relapse. During remission, your symptoms may continue or disappear for a while. Lesions can form and permanently affect nerves in that area.\nFor pregnant women, MS symptoms improve during pregnancy. Unfortunately, symptoms return within a few months of giving birth. Having MS while being pregnant does not put you or your baby at higher risk of complications. This includes pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure).\nThe exact cause of MS in unknown. It is most likely the result of genetic and environmental factors. Several viruses have also been linked to MS. A childhood virus may trigger MS later in life.\nMS affects women more than twice as often as men. White (Caucasian) people are more likely to develop it than people of other races. MS can run in families. Your risk of MS increases if someone in your family, such as a parent or sibling, has it. MS can affect people of any age, but it often begins between the ages of 20 and 40. If you have another autoimmune disease, such as thyroid disease or Type 1 diabetes, your risk of MS is higher.\nSome studies show that where you live can affect your risk of getting MS. People who grow up in areas with a mild climate, such as northern United States or southern Canada, seem to be at a higher risk for MS.\nLike other autoimmune diseases, MS can be difficult to diagnose. Most often, the first symptoms of MS are vision problems. Symptoms can also affect different parts of the body. Your doctor will ask about your health history and do a full exam.\nBefore making a diagnosis, your doctor will want to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. To do this, they may order certain tests, such as:\nTo diagnose MS, you must have damaged myelin in at least two areas of the CNS. You also must have had at least two relapses, or episodes, that caused damage. Your doctor also needs to rule out all other potential diagnoses.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid MS since the cause is unknown.\nThere is currently no cure for MS. The goal of treatment is to help you cope with and relieve symptoms, slow the progress of the disease and maintain a good quality of life. This can be done through a combination of medicine and physical, occupational, and speech therapy.\nMedicine\nPeople who have mild symptoms may choose not to take medicine due to potential risks and side effects. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of all drug options.\nCertain medicines can help relieve symptoms and treat short-term problems caused by MS:\nOther types of medicine can affect the long-term outcomes of the disease.\nInterferonsare a group of natural proteins made by human cells. Studies show they can slow down the worsening of symptoms. These medicines are often given as an injection (a shot). Examples of interferons used to treat MS are IFN Beta-1a and IFN Beta-1b. Interferons may cause serious liver damage. Other side effects include flu-like symptoms and depression.\nGlatirameracetates are thought to block the cells that damage myelin. It can lead to fewer relapses and fewer new lesions. The medicine is taken as a shot once a day. Side effects may include hives or pain at the injection site, heart tremors, and shortness of breath.\nTwo other types of medicine may be used to treat severe or advanced MS:\nDuring relapses, affected nerve areas can become inflamed. You may have severe pain and loss of vision or bodily function. Steroids can reduce swelling and allow you to return to normal function sooner. Examples of steroids used to treat MS are prednisone (a pill) and methylprednisolone (a shot). Steroids should be taken to treat short-term symptoms. They do not treat long-term effects of MS.\nTherapy\nDifferent therapies can be helpful for people who have MS:\nLiving with MS, a chronic (ongoing) illness, can be physically and emotionally hard. Certain lifestyle changes can help improve your quality of life and keep you as strong and healthy as possible.\nEat a well-balanced diet that is low in fat and high in fiber. A nutritious diet will keep your immune system strong and give you the best chance of good health.\nContinue to exercise if your doctor says it is okay. Exercise can improve your muscle tone and strength, balance, coordination, and even your mood. Stretching exercises can help with stiffness and mobility.\nIt is also important to get plenty of rest. MS causes fatigue, so pay attention to your needs. You may have to adapt your work or personal schedule to include time for rest.\nToo much heat can cause nerve pain and lead to extreme muscle weakness. Be careful using hot tubs or saunas and taking hot baths or showers. If heat bothers you, find ways to cool down. A cool bath or air conditioning may help\nGet support from your friends, family, and community. They can provide encouragement to help you cope with your disease. You can also look to your doctor, who may recommend a counselor or support group. Try to maintain as normal a life as you can and continue to do the things you enjoy. This can help you keep a good mood and healthy state of mind\nMultiple sclerosis and pregnancy\nPre-pregnancy planning is important for women. Certain medicines used to treat MS symptoms are not safe for your baby during pregnancy. These include medicines called \u201cdisease-modifying drugs.\u201d Another group is called \u201cchemotherapeutic drugs.\u201d This includes azathioprine or methotrexate. Your doctor may suggest that you stop taking these medicines before trying to get pregnant.\nSome other medicines that are considered safe during pregnancy can be helpful in treating MS symptoms. Your doctor may recommend that you change medicines while you are trying to get pregnant and during your pregnancy. Some medicines used to treat MS may be passed on to babies during breastfeeding. This is not safe for the baby. Talk to your doctor about your breastfeeding plans.\nIf MS affects your ability to walk, you may notice that walking is more difficult during pregnancy. This is because the weight you gain during pregnancy can shift your balance. Be extra careful to avoid falls. You may need crutches or other walking assistance devices. You may need to use a wheelchair\nYou may become tired more easily. This is true later in the pregnancy. Plan so your schedule allows for plenty of rest. Talk to your partner, family, and friends if you need help taking care of other children, doing chores, or running errands.\nUrinary tract infections(UTIs) are more common in pregnant women who have MS. Drink plenty of water. Let your doctor know if you have any symptoms. Your doctor may want you to have monthly urine tests to make sure a UTI doesn\u2019t sneak up on you.\nLabor and delivery\nSome women who have MS have damage to the spinal cord. This interferes with the ability to tell when labor starts. This is rare. But it may be a concern for some women. If you have reduced feeling in your pelvic area or abdomen, talk to your doctor. They can talk to you about other clues that labor has started.\nSome women who have MS experience nerve damage that prevents the muscles from pushing during delivery. If so, you may need extra help to deliver your baby vaginally. You may need a cesarean section (C-section). You may also need a C-section if you become overly tired during labor. Anesthesia is not any riskier for women who have MS than other women. Babies born to women who have MS have no greater risk of birth defects, physical, or intellectual disabilities.\nMake a plan for life after giving birth. Some women experience a \u201cflare\u201d or increase in symptoms after the delivery. You may be extra tired. The risk for post-partum depression is the same for women who have MS and those who do not.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nMumps is a virus. It causes the glands around your neck (between your ear and jaw) to swell. These glands make the saliva (spit) that helps you chew and swallow food. Mumps is most common in children between 2 to 12 years old who didn\u2019t get the mumps vaccine. You can get mumps as an adult if you did not get the vaccine. Some people call the virus \u201cthe mumps.\u201d\nThe most noticeable symptom is swelling in the face. Some people refer to this as \u201cchipmunk cheeks.\u201d Swelling can last five to seven days. The other noticeable symptom is neck pain in the area between your ear and jaw. Other symptoms include:\nMild symptoms usually disappear within two weeks.\nIn serious cases, mumps can affect your organs. This includes testicles, ovaries, the pancreas and the brain. It also can lead to miscarriage, hearing loss and meningitis. Meningitis is an infection that affects the lining of your brain and spinal cord. Call your doctor is you have more severe symptoms. This would include:\nIf you are pregnant and have been exposed to someone with mumps, see your doctor. You should see your doctor even if you are symptom-free.\nMumps is caused by a virus. It is spread by infected saliva. This means it can spread through sneezing, coughing or sharing cups and utensils with an infected person. You cannot get the virus if you\u2019ve been vaccinated for mumps. If you get the virus, symptoms usually appear 12 to 24 days after you\u2019ve been exposed. Your doctor will call this the incubation period.\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and do a physical exam. Your doctor also may do a throat culture or blood test. A throat culture involves swabbing the back of your throat.\nThe mumps can be prevented with a vaccine. The vaccine is called the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It can be given at any age. However, it is usually given to infants 12 to 15 months old. It prevents the mumps in 80 to 90% of people. Two doses are required to be effective. Thanks to this vaccine, very few people get the mumps in the U.S. anymore. Outbreaks can still occur in locations where vaccination rates are low.\nIf you work in a public setting or in the health care field, you should get vaccinated if you haven\u2019t already.\nThere is no medicine to treat mumps. It usually goes away on its own within two weeks. Because it is a viral infection, antibiotics do not work. If you or your child has mumps, you can relieve the discomfort:\nPeople who have the mumps once become immune to it for life. This means you can\u2019t get it again.\nLiving with mumps involves living with mild symptoms for two weeks. This will include pain, swelling, loss of appetite, headache, sore throat, fever and chills. The frustrating part of living with mumps is not being able to get out and see people.

    "article_title": "What is Munchausen syndrome by proxy?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nMunchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP) is a specific mental illness most often linked to child abuse. It affects caregivers, especially caregivers of children. It is also known as factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA). Mothers of small children are most often affected by this condition. Fathers or other caregivers can have it as well.\nSomeone suffering from MSP will act as though the person under their care is sick. They often will falsify medical information. They may lie to medical professionals about the health or condition of the person in their care. People with MSP do this to gain sympathy or for attention.\nSomeone who has MSP may purposely take action to make their child sick. They knowingly will expose the child to painful or risky medical procedures, even surgeries. They may deliberately create symptoms in a child by withholding food, poisoning or suffocating the child, giving the child inappropriate medicines, or withholding prescribed medicines. Creating these situations can put the child at extreme risk.\nCommon illnesses or symptoms that caregivers take MSP victims to the doctor for include:\nThose with MSP are not discouraged by the cost of medical treatments. They don\u2019t worry about how they will manage the bills. Instead, they believe driving up a large hospital bill reinforces the perception that they are doing everything they can for their child. They think others will see them as even better caretakers.\nSymptoms that can help identify someone who has MSP can be hard to spot. There are certain personality traits and backgrounds that seem to be common. Many suffered mental, physical, or sexual abuse growing up. Or they received love or attention only when they were sick.\nAs adults, people with MSP are very interested in medicine. They often work in the medical field and can speak expertly about medical conditions. They are typically very cooperative and friendly with health care professionals. People with MSP always appear to be completely devoted to the well-being of their child.\nBut to fake symptoms of illness in their child, they may do extreme things. These could include:\nThe child who has a caregiver with MSP will have a history of being in and out of hospitals with unusual health symptoms. Many times, their symptoms do not match any single disease. Symptoms usually get worse when they are alone with their caregiver. Symptoms often disappear in the absence of that person.\nDoctors don\u2019t know what causes this mental illness. It may be the result of being abused as a child. Some people with MSP may also have Munchausen syndrome. This is where they fake their own illness to gain attention.\nThe ethical issues involved in MSP make it hard to diagnose. Accusing a mother, father, or caretaker of intentionally creating symptoms or making a child sick is a serious matter. Medical professionals will look for symptoms and other incriminating evidence before doing so.\nOne way to confirm suspicions of MSP is to separate the mother, father, or caregiver from the child, then see if the child\u2019s symptoms improve. Doctors also can evaluate medical records. They can look for patterns that suggest something is off. For example, a child who has been seen for many different illnesses during a short period of time should trigger suspicion. If MSP is suspected, health care providers are required to report it.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to prevent MSP. The caregiver must recognize that their feelings about illness are not normal. In those situations, seeking help could prevent them from harming a child.\nIt is usually up to others to recognize the behavior and stop it before it escalates. If you believe a child is in danger or is currently a victim of MSP, contact a health care professional, the police, or child protective services.\nSafety of the child is the No. 1 priority of treatment. The child should be treated for any medical problems they are having and protected from further abuse. They may need to be removed from the care of the affected caregiver. Psychological treatment for the child may be necessary, as well, to help them understand and cope with what has happened to them.\nTreatment of the mother, father, or caregiver involved is not as straightforward. Many times, this person will deny playing a role, even when evidence proves it. They often have blurred what is true and what is not. Until they are ready to recognize the truth, it will be difficult for them to get better.\nPsychotherapy is recommended for persons who have MSP. During these counseling sessions, the therapist helps the caregiver identify the feelings that caused their harmful behavior. Over time, the caregiver can learn to change that behavior. They can learn to form healthy relationships that don\u2019t rely on someone being sick.\nBecause this mental illness is linked to child abuse, the syndrome must be reported to the authorities.\nSomeone living with Munchausen syndrome by proxy has a serious mental illness that puts children\u2019s lives at risk.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nMuscular dystrophy is a group of genetic diseases that permanently weaken and shrink your muscles. The disease is rare. However, it gets worse over time. Eventually, the muscle weakness will affect your ability to walk, swallow, and breathe. There are several types of muscular dystrophy:\nDuchenne is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne and Emery-Dreifuss affect males more often than females.\nWeakened and shrinking muscles are the underlying cause of the symptoms in each type. The different types of the disease affect different muscle groups. Muscle weakness often begins in one part of your body and progresses to other areas. For example, a person with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may:\nPeople with Duchenne muscular dystrophy don\u2019t have enough of a protein in their body called dystrophin. Dystrophin helps stabilize muscle cells. Symptoms for most types of muscular dystrophy often begin in childhood. However, some people don\u2019t experience their first symptoms until they become an adult.\nSymptoms for each type of muscular dystrophy include:\nDepending on the type, muscular dystrophy can shorten your lifespan. People who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for example, have a life expectancy of under 40 years. But with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a more typical lifespan is possible.\nFamily medical history is to blame. Muscular dystrophy is genetic and can be passed down in families.\nIf you are having muscle weakness problems, see your doctor. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history, family medical history, and do a physical exam. Your doctor might do an enzyme test. This involves taking a sample of your blood and sending it to a lab. The lab checks for high levels of the creatine kinase (CK) enzyme. CK levels are often elevated in people who have muscular dystrophy. A blood sample also can test your genes for the disease.\nThis is genetic disease. A pregnant woman can have a prenatal chorionic villus sampling (CVS) test to determine if the baby has muscular dystrophy. Both a man and woman can have a carrier test performed to determine if they carry the muscular dystrophy gene. This involves providing a blood or saliva sample.\nThere is no cure for muscular dystrophy. It is permanent and gets worse over time. Your family doctor will work with specialists to diagnose and best treat it.\nCertain things can help your symptoms. These include medicine that improves muscle strength and certain therapies (physical, occupational, and speech). Sometimes these things can prevent complications. Certain medical devices and technology also can help. Those items include equipment (such as a walker or a wheelchair) to help you move and be as independent as possible.\nA high-fiber, high-protein diet and drinking plenty of fluids are helpful in reducing the risk of problems affected by not being able to move or exercise. These includeobesity,constipation, anddehydration.\nSurgery to repair a curved or damaged spine is another possible treatment. If your heart is affected, your doctor may prescribe a heart medicine. If your respiratory (breathing) muscles are seriously weakened, you may need a device to help you breathe. This is called a respirator. You may need to use it part or all of the time.\nLiving with muscular dystrophy becomes more difficult as muscle weakness progresses. It threatens your health and limits your independence. In the later stages of the disease, you may get more respiratory infections. It\u2019s important to get pneumonia and flu vaccines. Choking may also be a hazard as the muscles in your throat affect your ability to swallow.\nEmotionally, losing your ability to move your muscles and be independent can be hard on you and your caregiver.

Some people with fungal nail infections have athlete\u2019s foot. This is a similar condition that affects the skin around the toes.\nFungal infections can also lead to ingrown toenails as well.\nThe infection is usually caused by exposure to a fungus. The fungus grows in wet, dark conditions. The fungus grows when your feet are in warm, sweaty environment (socks, work boots). It enters your nail through a crack in the nail.\nNail fungal infections happen at any age. They are more common in adults older than 60 years of age. They are common in people who have diabetes or circulation problems. They also are common in people with a weakened immune system. Men are more likely than women to get fungal nail infections.\nYour doctor will look at your nails and ask you questions. They might clip a sample of your nail and send the sample to a lab to see if you have an infection. There could be other causes for your symptoms and your doctor can help reveal what those are.\nAvoid situations that expose you to a fungus. This includes walking barefoot in locker rooms and having wet hands and feet often. This might be a problem for people who work in restaurants or house cleaning. People in a family can get nail fungal infections at the same time. This happens when their immune systems aren\u2019t able to fight off the infection. Or it could be the infection is spread when using the same towels. It is important to routinely clean your shower, tub, and bathroom to lower risk of fungal infection.\nPrescription medicines can treat a fungal nail infection. Oral antifungal medicines help a new nail grow. This will replace the infected nail. You may need to take antifungal medicine for 6 to 12 weeks. Some oral medicines are not safe for people who have liver problems. They are not safe for people who have a history of congestive heart failure. Tell your doctor if you have one of these conditions. Your doctor will decide which medicine is right for you.\nApply topical treatments (creams and polishes) to the top of your nail.

The nasopharynx is the area where the back part of your nose opens into your upper throat. This is also where tubes from your ears open into your throat.\nIf you have nasopharyngeal cancer, you might easily mistake the symptoms for other conditions. You might first notice a lump in your neck. You might have trouble hearing in one ear. You might have nosebleeds, headaches, blurred vision, or ringing in one or both ears. You might notice a change in the way one side of your face feels. You may have trouble breathing or speaking.\nNo one knows for sure what causes nasopharyngeal cancer. Nasopharyngeal cancer is rare. It most often affects people who are between 30 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have nasopharyngeal cancer than women.\nYour doctor might use endoscopy to try to see the cancer. For this exam, a thin tube with a very small camera on the end is put into your nose. This lets your doctor get a closer look at the cancerous tumor.\nDuring endoscopy, your doctor might take a small piece from the tumor. This is called a biopsy sample. They will then send a piece of the tumor to a lab where it is looked at under a microscope.\nYour doctor might also send you to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This MRI takes a special \u201cpicture\u201d of your nasopharynx so that your doctor can see the size of the tumor.\nEating salt-preserved foods (like fish, eggs, leafy vegetables, and roots) during early childhood may increase the risk of getting this form of cancer. Exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus may also make a person more likely to get nasopharyngeal cancer. This is the same virus that causes infectiousmononucleosis(also called \u201cmono\u201d).\nYou are most likely to get this cancer if you or your ancestors come from southern China, particularly Canton (now called Guangzhou) or Hong Kong. You are also more likely to get this cancer if you are from a country in Southeast Asia, such as Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, or Thailand.\nTobacco use and excessive alcohol can also raise a person\u2019s risk of developing nasopharyngeal cancer.\nRadiation is often successful in treating cancer in the nasopharynx. You might also need to have chemotherapy (medicines used to treat cancer). Radiation and chemotherapy can make you feel tired and sick to your stomach.

It often begins within 2 weeks of birth when the baby is still hospitalized.\nNEC symptoms may begin all of a sudden or over time. Common symptoms include:\nThere is no exact cause for NEC. The main source is intestinal bacteria. If your baby is premature, their immune and digestion systems are weaker. Another trigger could be a decrease in blood or oxygen to the intestine. This can damage tissue and lead to NEC. Full-term babies who have congenital heart disease also can get NEC.\nYour doctor can diagnose NEC. They will perform a physical exam to check for symptoms. They will likely do a stomach X-ray to check for inflammation or air in your baby\u2019s intestine. Lab tests, such as blood, urine, and stool, are likely too. These tests can determine the severity of the condition.\nIt is hard to prevent or avoid NEC. However, there are factors that can increase your baby\u2019s risk for NEC, including:\nA range of options is available to treat NEC. To start, your doctor will want to give your baby\u2019s intestine a rest. Instead of normal feedings, they will receive nutrition through an intravenous tube. Your doctor may need to relieve gas in your baby\u2019s bowel. This is done by inserting a tube into the stomach. Antibiotic medicines treat the infection. Your baby may need to use a breathing machine if breathing becomes difficult. Severe cases of NEC may require emergency surgery.

They affect a baby\u2019s spine, spinal cord, or brain. Very early in pregnancy, cells from the developing fetus gather together to form a tube. From this tube, the brain, spinal cord and spinal column develops. When a portion of that tube fails to form properly, it results in NTDs.\nThe different kinds of neural tube defects are:\nThe main sign of NTDs is physical deformities. Symptoms can include paralysis, developmental delays, and seizures.\nThe exact cause of NTDs is not known. It may be difficult to determine because the defects begin in the first month of pregnancy. A lot of women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant at this stage.\nYour risk for having a baby with neural tube defects increases if you:\nOther potential risk factors are genetics and the environment.\nA doctor often diagnoses an NTD during pregnancy. The defects can show up on imaging or lab tests. If your doctor sees signs of an NTD, they may perform additional tests.\nThe best way to help prevent neural tube defects is by taking folic acid. This is a type of B vitamin. You can take it as a supplement or in a multivitamin. Folic acid also is found in some enriched or fortified foods. Things like cereals, breads, pastas, rices, and flours contain higher amounts. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that all women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take folic acid. They need 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 mcg) every day.\nDoctors also suggest eating foods high in folate. These include:\nNTDs do not have cures. Treatment options focus on relieving pain and preventing future damage. Babies who have spina bifida may need surgery to help correct damage.\nBabies who have anencephaly do not live. They either are stillborn or die hours after birth. Babies who have other NTDs have lasting effects. Spina bifida can cause paralysis below the spine.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nNeurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder. It affects your nervous system and nerve cells. The condition produces tumors on your nerves. The tumors can be underneath or on your skin. Most tumors formed from NF are benign (non-cancerous). However, some can lead to cancer.\nThere are two main types of neurofibromatosis. Type 1 (NF1) begins at birth or as a child. It also is known as von Recklinghausen\u2019s disease. Type 2 (NF2) appears during late teenage or early adult years. It is less common than NF1. Schwannomatosis is a third and very rare form of NF.\nThe symptoms of NF vary by type, but all involve tumors.\nFor the more common NF1, symptoms include:\nPeople who have NF1 can be shorter than normal or have a larger head. Other side effects include body pain, headaches, and epilepsy.\nThe first apparent sign of NF2 is ringing in your ears or hearing loss. Impaired balance, early onset cataracts, and vision loss can be warning signs. NF2 tumors are called schwannomas.\nNF2 tumors can grow along any nerves. The most common are the cranial nerves, which affect your hearing and balance. The tumors can press against or wrap around nerves and cause damage. This is dangerous along the brain stem, spinal cord, and major blood vessels. It can lead to symptoms, such as muscle numbness and weakness.\nSchwannomatosis is rare. Its main feature is tumors anywhere except the vestibular nerve. Its main symptom is intense pain. This occurs as tumors grow, squeeze nerves, or crush tissue. Other symptoms include weakness, tingling, or numbness.\nNF is a genetic disorder. You can get it from your parents or a random gene mutation. If you have the condition, you can pass it on to your children.\nThere are a few ways to diagnose NF. To start, your doctor will discuss and examine your symptoms. They will look for presence of at least two of the disorder\u2019s symptoms. Tumor appearance, size, and location play a role. Your doctor may do blood or genetic testing. These tests can show gene defects. An X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also can help. They check for tumors in and around your nerves. If your doctor thinks you have NF2, they may do hearing tests.\nCaf\u00e9-au-lait spots can also be an indicator of NF. If these are present during the first year of life, they may be a predictor of NF. Having more than 6 caf\u00e9-au-lait spots increases the risk of NF.\nYou cannot avoid NF. You can have genetic testing to see if you carry the gene.\nWith NF, doctors cannot prevent tumor growth. Most treatment options focus on relieving or reducing symptoms. Medicine can help treat pain. If you have NF2, hearing aids may help with hearing loss. An auditory brainstem implant is another option.\nIn severe cases, you may need surgery. A surgeon can remove tumors that cause physical or cosmetic problems. However, there is a chance the tumors can grow back. Surgery can correct some bone deformities.\nIf you have malignant (cancerous) tumors, you\u2019ll need further treatment. This can include radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery.\nNF doesn\u2019t have a cure, but often doesn\u2019t affect the length of your life. It is a disorder in which symptoms worsen over time. Most people who have a form of NF need ongoing treatment. This treatment helps manage related conditions, which can include:\nThe social and mental aspects of NF can be hard. The condition may keep you from leaving the house or working. Talk to your doctor about counseling or therapy to help you manage the emotional side-effects of NF.\nChildren\u2019s Tumor Foundation\nNational Human Genome Research Institute: About Neurofibromatosis\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Neurofibromatosis\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: Neurofibromatosis Fact Sheet\nNeurofibromatosis Network\nLast Updated:January 23, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a form of cancer. It happens when your white blood cells become abnormal. The cancer starts in your body\u2019s lymph system. This includes your lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs. These make up your immune system. Lymph nodes help your body fight infection. They eliminate fluid, waste, and bad cells from your body. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma also can develop in your bone marrow and blood. There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment and prognosis depend on the type.\nPossible symptoms include:\nWhat causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma?\nThe exact cause of most lymphomas is unknown. With non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your body produces too many white blood cells. Normally, white blood cells die and new ones develop. When you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, white blood cells don\u2019t die. They grow uncontrollably. This is what doctors believe contributes to cancer.\nDoctors have identified certain risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. People with weakened immune systems are most at risk. This means they don\u2019t have infection-fighting ability. This includes people who have had an organ donation or HIV infection. People who have Down syndrome are at a higher risk. Certain viruses and chemicals can cause the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in people over the age of 60.\nHow is non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. They will look and feel for lumps in your neck, under your arm, and around your groin. They will ask you about your medical history and assess your risk. Your doctor will likely order a blood test. This involves inserting a small needle into the vein in your arm and withdrawing a small sample of blood. The blood will be sent to a lab. The lab will look at your white blood cell count.\nIf your doctor finds a lump, they may order an imaging test (similar to an X-ray). This might include an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography) scan, or PET (positron emission tomography) scan. An ultrasound might be used to see inside your body. This test uses a wand to move around the area in question. It creates pictures from sound waves as it moves across your body.\nTo diagnose (or rule out) lymphoma, your doctor may order a biopsy. This involves inserting a needle into the lump to sample a small amount of tissue. Your doctor may give you medicine to make you sleep during the procedure. If the biopsy is minor, you may be given medicine to relax you during the procedure. These tests give your doctor information about the type, stage, and severity of the disease.\nCan non-Hodgkin lymphoma be prevented or avoided?\nThere is no sure way to prevent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Prevention might be helpful for certain risk factors. For example, reduce your exposure to HIV by practicing safe sex. Reduce your risk of chemical exposure throughout your lifetime.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment\nYour treatment plan will depend on your type and stage of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Possible treatments include:\nIf left untreated, the disease can lead to death. If you decline life-saving treatment, you can choose to get support from palliative care (a medical team that manages your symptoms and pain). Later, hospice can support you in the final months to help you manage your quality of life.\nLiving with non-Hodgkin lymphoma depends on several factors. These include the stage of your disease, whether you receive treatment, the type of treatment you receive, and your prognosis.\nIf you choose to undergo treatment, common approaches, such as chemotherapy and radiation, have significant side effects.\nChemotherapy can cause nausea and fatigue. It can cause infection, mouth sores, and hair loss. Radiation can cause similar problems. This includes burns to the skin near the area being treated. It also can cause changes in blood counts.\nImmunotherapy side effects include fever, chills, and nausea. More serious side effects include hepatitis and damage to the pancreas.\nTargeted therapy side effects include high blood pressure, bleeding, and blood clotting difficulties. That is dependent upon the type of medicine used. Also, it can include delayed wound healing, damage to the heart, swelling, and autoimmune problems (when your body is attacking its immune system). The most significant side effect of targeted therapy is skin problems. This can range from rash to itching and dry skin.\nStem cell transplant side effects include nausea, infection, mouth and throat pain, and bleeding. More serious problems include stem cell rejection, where your body attacks the newer cells.\nResources\nNational Cancer Institute: Lymphoma\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Lymphoma\nLast Updated:May 5, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nMost people associate addiction with tobacco, drugs, and alcohol. A non-substance addiction includes things such as gambling, risky sex, pornography, food, the internet, mobile devices, and shopping. These are sometimes called behavioral addictions. When a person does these things in excess and can\u2019t stop, it becomes an addiction. All addictions can interfere with your work and personal life. It can even place you in unsafe situations. It can result in physical, emotional, and financial harm. Some can lead to other disorders and substance addictions. This includes depression, alcohol, drugs, and suicide.\nA person with a non-substance addiction is unable to stop doing the activity or behavior. For example, a person addicted to gambling may spend all their savings. Non-substance addiction symptoms can include:\nAddiction is a chronic disorder of a person\u2019s brain activity. Simply put, your brain is wired that way. Doctors can\u2019t say why certain people can\u2019t control behavior. But the behavior combines reward, motivation, and memory in an unhealthy way. This triggers physical, emotional, and social responses. Doctors believe the behavior provides a rush or a thrill. For example, people addicted to gambling may experience a rush when winning or losing money. A person\u2019s experiences and personality type play a part in addiction.\nSome people with a non-substance addiction recognize the problem and seek help. Some people are told by family and friends. A mental health professional can diagnose the addiction.\nNon-substance addiction cannot be prevented or avoided. However, once you have been diagnosed, your mental health professional will help you find ways to avoid your exposure to triggers.\nTreatment is possible. First, you must admit you have an addiction. Talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a mental health expert for more help. This help may involve cognitive behavioral therapy. This is talk therapy. It involves talking with your mental health professional about your addiction. It also may include advice about how to understand your addiction urges and how to handle them. Treatment for a non-substance addiction may also include treatment for depression or substance abuse, if needed. Support groups can also be help in addressing addiction.\nIt\u2019s okay to tell trusted family and friends that you have a non-substance addiction. This is important if you\u2019re trying to avoid triggers. For example, if you are addicted to gambling, don\u2019t go to a casino with friends. If you are addicted to shopping and want to join friends, you might leave your credit cards and cash at home. Also, join an addiction support group. These are self-help groups for addictions. Your family and friends can even join support groups for loved ones with addictions.\nResources\nAmerican Society of Addiction Medicine: Definition of Addiction\nCleveland Clinic: Addiction\nLast Updated:May 5, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is a common condition. MASLD can be harmless, but sometimes it may cause the liver to swell. Over time, this swelling can cause scarring in your liver (cirrhosis). The more scarring your liver has, the worse it functions.\nMany people do not have any symptoms of MASLD. If you have MASLD, you may feel fullness or pain in the middle or upper right side of the abdomen. You may feel extremely tired. Your belly may be swollen. You may have yellowing of your skin and eyes.\nIf your MASLD has progressed to cirrhosis, you may have more serious symptoms including fluid retention, internal bleeding, and mental confusion.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes MASLD. They do know that MASLD is linked to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when your body doesn\u2019t respond well to insulin. This makes it more difficult for your body to regulate blood sugar.\nIt is not caused by drinking alcohol.\nTo diagnose MASLD, your doctor may check your blood and order a scan of your liver. If your doctor thinks you may have a more severe liver disease, you may need a liver biopsy. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a needle through your skin and removes a small piece of tissue from your liver. This tissue is looked at under a microscope to check for signs of severe liver disease.\nA wide range of things can increase your risk of MASLD, including certain medicines and genetic disorders. The most common risk factors for MASLD are obesity,diabetes, andhigh cholesterollevels.\nPeople who have MASLD usually do not need treatment. The most important thing is to focus on what has caused your MASLD. Losing weight gradually (1 to 2 pounds per week) may reduce the amount of fat in your liver. However, losing weight quickly may make MASLD worse. Ask your doctor for advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way. If your cholesterol and blood sugar levels are high, your doctor may give you medicine to lower them. If a medicine you take is causing your MASLD, your doctor may consider switching you to a different medicine.\nThere are some oral (taken by mouth) medicines that may help with MASLD. However, there is limited success without addressing obesity and weight loss.\nFor most people, MASLD is harmless and does not cause serious health problems. MASLD usually does not affect how well the liver works. However, in rare cases, MASLD may stop the liver from working as it should. Although rare, liver transplants have increased significantly in recent years as a result of MASLD. No one can tell for sure who will have liver problems from MASLD. It is more likely to happen in people who have diabetes or who are very overweight.\nAmerican Liver Foundation\nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Disease: New NAFLD Nomenclature\nLast Updated:February 28, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nA nosebleed is blood loss from the tissue that lines your nose. It can affect both nostrils, but most often occurs in only one nostril. Usually, a nosebleed is not serious.\nThe nose has many blood vessels in it to help warm and humidify the air you breathe. These vessels lie close to the surface, making them easy to injure \u2014 which can cause a nosebleed. Sometimes, though, nosebleeds are more serious. These stem from large vessels in the back of the nose. Nosebleeds from these larger vessels often occur after an injury, in young children, or in the elderly. Usually, the older the patient, the more serious the nosebleed.\nMost often, you will have no other symptoms other than the nosebleed itself.\nTwo of the most common causes of nosebleeds are dryness (often caused by indoor heat in the winter) and nose picking. These 2 things work together \u2014 nose picking occurs more often when mucus in the nose is dry and crusty. Colds also can cause nosebleeds.\nLess common causes include injuries, allergies, or the use of illegal drugs, such as cocaine. Children may stick small objects up their noses, and that can cause the nose to bleed. Older people may haveatherosclerosis(which is the hardening of the arteries), infections,high blood pressure, or blood clotting disorders that may cause nosebleeds. Nosebleeds may occur and last longer if you\u2019re taking drugs that interfere with blood clotting, such as aspirin. A rare cause of frequent nosebleeds is a disorder called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Sometimes, the cause of nosebleeds can\u2019t be determined.\nFrequent nosebleeds may mean you have a more serious problem. For example, nosebleeds and bruising can be early signs of leukemia. Nosebleeds can also be a sign of a blood clotting or blood vessel disorder, or a nasal tumor (both non-cancerous and cancerous).\nThere is usually no need to formally diagnose a nosebleed. If your nose is bleeding, it\u2019s fairly self-evident.\nTips for preventing nosebleeds:\nA nosebleed can be scary to get \u2014 or see \u2014 but try to stay calm. Most nosebleeds look much worse than they really are. Almost all nosebleeds can be treated at home.\nIf you get a nosebleed, sit down and lean slightly forward. Keeping your head above your heart will slow the bleeding. Lean forward so the blood will drain out of your nose instead of down the back of your throat. If you lean back, you may swallow the blood. This can irritate your stomach.\nUse your thumb and index finger to squeeze together the soft portion of your nose. This area is located between the end of your nose and the hard, bony ridge that forms the bridge of your nose. Keep holding your nose until the bleeding stops. Don\u2019t let go for at least 5 minutes. If it\u2019s still bleeding, hold it again for another 5 to 10 minutes.\nOnce the bleeding stops, wait a few hours before doing anything that might make it start again, such as bending over or blowing your nose.\nSee your doctor if:\nYour doctor will try to find out where the bleeding is coming from in your nose. He or she will probably ask you some questions and examine your nose. If the bleeding doesn\u2019t stop on its own or when pressure is applied, your doctor may cauterize the bleeding vessel or pack your nose to stop the bleeding.Cauterizationinvolves using a special solution called silver nitrate or an electrical or heating device to burn the vessel so that it stops bleeding. Your doctor will numb your nose before the procedure. Packing the nose\u00a0involves putting special gauze or an inflatable latex balloon into the nose so that enough pressure is placed on the vessel to make it stop bleeding\nNosebleeds can be a nuisance.

    "article_title": "What is obesity?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byErin Corriveau, MD, MPH\nTable of Contents\nObesity is a complex and increasingly common disease that is associated with many health risks such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, and even death. Maintaining a normal weight is one of the best ways to prevent many serious health problems. When you have obesity, your body weight is too high for your height, often due to excess body fat. Obesity can develop at any age and is considered a chronic (long-term) condition.\nYou may be diagnosed with obesity if your body mass index (BMI) is at or above 30kg/m2.BMIis a measure of your weight relative to your height and functions as a rough estimate of body fat. An elevated BMI or diagnosis of obesity can also lead to other serious health conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, arthritis) that have symptoms of their own. Although a high BMI does increase your risk of other health complications, BMI by itself is not a very good indicator of overall health.\nObesity risk is complicated by factors such as genetics, hormones, lifestyle, and environment.\u00a0 Certainly, eating more calories than your body can use can cause your body to store extra fat, which can increase your risk of obesity. But for many people, this outdated explanation of obesity as the result of individual choices or poor diet alone just isn\u2019t accurate. Current evidence suggests your risk of obesity is determined by a complex combination of factors.\nSome individual and environmental factors that increase your risk of obesity include:\nSome medicines and medical conditions may make it more challenging to maintain a healthy body weight or to lose weight. Medicines include:\nObesity can sometimes be associated with other medical conditions, or may lead to certain medical conditions, including:\nTalk to your doctor if you think you have or have had any of the conditions above or take the medicines listed above. In some cases, specific treatments for your medical condition or a change in medicines can make a difference in your efforts to manage your weight.\nObesity is most often diagnosed using yourBMI. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is in the \u2018overweight\u2019 range, and obesity is diagnosed when BMI is 30 and above. However, because BMI only estimates body fat by your height and weight, BMI by itself isn\u2019t a perfect tool for diagnosing obesity. For example, people who are very muscular could have a BMI that indicates obesity \u2013 even if body fat is normal or low. On the other hand, BMI may suggest that obesity is absent when body fat is actually high. This happens most commonly in older adults.\nThe measurement around your waist (sometimes called a waist circumference) is also commonly used to diagnose obesity. Although waist measurement is also not a perfect tool for diagnosing obesity, having a lot of body fat around your waist is tied to a number of health issues. You can measure your waist by wrapping a measuring tape around your waist (closest to your belly button). For most women, a waist measurement of 35 inches or more could put you at higher risk. For most men, that number is 40 inches.\nIf you think you might have obesity, talk to your doctor about health complications and other factors that may be involved. Your doctor can also work with you to find treatment options that are right for you.\nObesity is caused by a complex combination of factors, including hormones, genetics, and even your environment. Unfortunately, many risk factors for obesity \u2013 such as your age and family history \u2013 are out of your control. However, some lifestyle factors like healthy eating, exercise, and good sleep habits also play an important role. Talk to your doctor about the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight to prevent obesity and preventing complications if you are diagnosed.\nObesity is a complex chronic health condition that is best treated with the help of your family doctor. Treating obesity is about preventing health complications and improving the symptoms of obesity by reducing body fat \u2013 it\u2019s not about getting to a specific number on the scale.\nYou and your doctor can work together to decide what your treatment goals are and how to achieve them. Treatment options for obesity generally include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery.\nLifestyle treatments range from self-help and commercial weight loss programs to professional dietary counseling, physical activity training, and behavior therapy. Start small and set realistic goals. Even small changes can make a surprising difference in your health. There are also many online tools and mobile apps that might be helpful for setting and keeping lifestyle goals. Your doctor can provide advice and referrals.\nIf lifestyle changes alone aren\u2019t enough to help you meet your treatment goals, your doctor may talk to you about adding anti-obesity medicines. These medicines should be used in addition to healthy eating and exercise. Most available anti-obesity medications are approved for long-term use to help you reduce body fat and keep it off. Obesity is a chronic (long-term) condition. Anti-obesity medicines can help control symptoms like excess body fat and elevated BMI, but they won\u2019t cure obesity. Stopping these medicines can lead to a return of symptoms.\nSurgical treatment may be an option for people with severe obesity. Surgery for obesity (called metabolic and bariatric surgery) can help patients lose a large amount of weight and can reverse some complications of obesity. Although some weight regain is common after surgery, the effect of this treatment option is often permanent. The two most common metabolic and bariatric surgeries both involve creating less room for food and changing your body\u2019s hormonal response to food. Both surgeries are usually minimally invasive and performed using very small incisions (laparoscopically):\nLosing weight is an important part of obesity management, but it\u2019s not the only part. Weight loss maintenance (keeping weight off) is also a goal. Like other chronic diseases, obesity requires long-term treatment, likely using a combination of these different treatment options (lifestyle, medication, surgery). Obesity is not something you need to manage alone. Your family doctor is there to support you in setting and achieving your treatment goals.\nObesity can affect many other aspects of your overall health.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is mental health disorder, such as anxiety disorder or depression. It causes unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). We all have habits and routines in our daily lives, such as brushing our teeth before bed. However, for people with OCD, excessive repetitive behavior gets in the way of their daily lives.\nMost people with OCD know that their obsessions and compulsions make no sense. Yet, they can\u2019t ignore or stop them.\nObsessions are ideas, images, and impulses that run through the person\u2019s mind over and over again. A person with OCD doesn\u2019t want to have these thoughts and finds them bothersome. Despite this, they can\u2019t control them. Sometimes these thoughts occur occasionally and are mildly annoying. Other times, a person who has OCD will have obsessive thoughts all the time.\nObsessive thoughts cause people who have OCD to feel nervous and afraid. They try to get rid of these feelings by performing certain behaviors that follow \u201crules\u201d or \u201csteps\u201d that they make up for themselves. These behaviors are called compulsions. Compulsive behaviors are sometimes also called rituals. For example, a person who has OCD may have obsessive thoughts about germs. As such, the person may wash their hands repeatedly even if they are already clean.\nPerforming these behaviors usually makes the nervous feelings go away for a short time. When the fear and nervousness return, the person who has OCD repeats the routine all over again.\nFor many years, OCD was thought to be rare. Some recent studies show that it is more common than once thought. OCD affects men and women equally.\nThe following are some common obsessions:\nThe following are some common compulsions:\nNo one has found a single, proven cause for OCD. Some research shows that it may have to do with chemicals in the brain that carry messages from one nerve cell to another. One of these chemicals is called serotonin. It helps to keep people from repeating the same behaviors over and over again. A person who has OCD may not have enough serotonin.\nMany people who have OCD can function better when they take medicines that increase the amount of\u00a0serotonin\u00a0in their brain. OCD tends to run in families. Symptoms often begin in children or teens.\nIf you believe that you have OCD, you should see your family doctor. They can help diagnose and begin treatment for OCD. Your family doctor may also arrange for you to see other mental health professionals such as a counselor or psychiatrist. Sometimes OCD can be confused with other disorders and your family doctor, with the other members of your healthcare team, can help make an early and accurate diagnosis.\nAn OCD diagnosis will be based on your symptoms. This includes your behavior, your obsessions and/or your compulsions. A mental health care professional will also consider how these affect or interfere with your daily life.\nYou cannot prevent OCD from starting. And once you have OCD, you will always have it. OCD is a chronic condition. But you can prevent the symptoms of OCD by following your treatment plan. You should also take any OCD medications exactly as they are prescribed. You should do this even if you are feeling better.\nCombining therapy with medication is usually considered the most effective way to treat OCD.\nSeveral medicines are available to treat OCD. These medicines are also often used to treat\u00a0depression and anxiety and include:\nThese drugs can cause side effects such as dry mouth,\u00a0nausea,\u00a0and drowsiness. Sometimes they also have sexual side effects. It may be several weeks before you see an improvement in your behavior.\nUnder the guidance of a trained therapist, behavioral therapy can also be used to treat OCD. In behavioral therapy, people face situations that cause or trigger their obsessions and anxiety. Then they are encouraged not to perform the rituals that usually help control their nervous feelings. For example, a person who is obsessed with germs might be encouraged to use a public toilet. After doing this, they would be asked to limit hand-washing to one time. To use this method, a person who has OCD must be able to tolerate the high levels of\u00a0anxiety\u00a0that can result from the experience.\nPeople who have OCD often have other kinds of anxiety. These can include phobias (such as fear of spiders or fear of flying) or panic attacks.\nPeople who have OCD also may have:\nHaving one or more of these disorders can make\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0and treatment more difficult.

This can include a bronchoscopy, biopsy, or surgery.\nDepending on your line of work, you might not be able to avoid occupational respiratory disease. You can try to limit exposure to reduce your risk of disease. Things you can do are:\nWorkplaces should have programs in place to monitor and limit exposure.\nThere is no cure for occupational respiratory disease. Treatment can help reduce symptoms and prevent further damage. It also can help improve your quality of life. Treatment types vary and can include use of medicines, inhalers, and/or oxygen. Severe conditions may require a lung transplant.\nTalk to your employer if you are diagnosed. They may need to create new measures to reduce or remove your exposure. A change in elements, machines, or work processes can lessen toxins in the air. You may have to change jobs altogether.\nIf your case is mild, you should be able to lead a normal life. Your doctor can help you manage your condition. They will talk to you about routine testing and vaccines, such as the flu shot. You should avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. Try to maintain a healthy weight. If you have trouble breathing when you exercise, you may need pulmonary rehabilitation.\nOccupational respiratory disease can lead to lung cancer and other diseases.

    "article_title": "What is opioid addiction?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nAn addiction is a strong craving to do something. In this case, it\u2019s a strong craving to use opioids. Addiction is a disease that affects your brain and behavior. At first, you should have control over your choice to use opioids. However, opioids are very addictive. Over time, their effect can make you want to keep using the medicine or use it incorrectly. This can lead to changes in brain function that cause you to develop a powerful urge to take opioids.\nAn opioid addiction is an unhealthy dependence on these powerful medicines. Opioids are a class of drugs that are made with natural or synthetic chemicals found in the opium poppy plant. This includes illegal substances, such as heroin, and prescription drugs intended to help relieve pain. Opioids also relax the body and produce a \u201chigh.\u201d\nDoctors typically prescribe opioids in instances such as:\nTypes of opioid drugs include:\nSome\u00a0prescription\u00a0cough medicines also contain opioids.\nAn opioid addiction is considered a form ofsubstance abuse. The signs and symptoms of\u00a0substance abuse\u00a0can be physical, behavioral, and psychological. One clear sign of addiction is not being able to stop using opioids. This may look like using the medicine more frequently than your doctor prescribed, using a higher dose than prescribed, or using someone else\u2019s prescription for yourself. Another sign of addiction is seeking the immediate rewards (the \u201chigh\u201d) of the drug despite knowing the consequences.\nCommon symptoms of opioid addiction include:\nOngoing slowed breathing can lead to a condition called hypoxia. This occurs when not enough oxygen reaches your brain. Hypoxia can lead to permanent brain damage, coma, or death.\nIf you take too many opioids, you may experience an opioid overdose. Even a small amount can be too much for some people and lead to an overdose. An overdose is a very serious medical condition. Symptoms can include:\nAn opioid overdose requires immediate medical treatment. Call 9-1-1 right away if you think someone has overdosed. In some states, a prescription nasal spray called naloxone (Narcan) is available to keep on hand in case of an overdose. Talk to your doctor to see if you might need this medicine for emergency reasons.\nOpioid drugs alter your brain by creating artificial endorphins. These block pain and change how your brain responds to pain. The false endorphins can even produce a high or feelings of euphoria. Opioid use can cause your brain to depend on these endorphins, or even to stop producing its own endorphins. The longer you use opioids, the more likely this is to happen.\nDrug tolerance occurs when your body gets used to the effects of a drug over time. As this happens, you may need to take a higher dose of the drug to get the same effect.\nDrug dependence occurs when your body changes and starts to rely on a drug to function. These changes often lead to withdrawal\u00a0symptoms when you stop using the drug. Withdrawal symptoms can be mild or severe, and may include:\nYou should always talk to your doctor before you stop using a drug, even an opioid. They can help you reduce or prevent withdrawal symptoms by gradually lowering your dose over time until you no longer need the medicine.\nWhat is the difference between drug tolerance, dependence, and addiction?\nDrug tolerance and dependence are a result of taking any opioid drug for a long time. You can be tolerant to or dependent on a drug, but not yet be addicted to it.\nDrug addiction is a disease for which help and treatment options are available. When you become addicted to a drug, it might seem like your body and mind can\u2019t function without the drug. Addiction can cause you to obsessively seek out the drug, even when the drug use causes health, behavior, or relationship problems.\nHow is opioid addiction diagnosed?\nYour doctor or a medical health professional can\u00a0diagnose\u00a0opioid addiction or opioid use disorder. Diagnosis will involve a medical assessment. It may also include certain lab tests or mental health tests.\nYou might have an opioid addiction if you crave the drug or if you feel you can\u2019t control the urge to take the drug. You may also be addicted if you keep using the drug without your doctor\u2019s consent, even if the drug is harmful for you. Opioid addiction can lead to problems in daily life, such as trouble with health, money, work or school, the law, or your relationships with family or friends. Those close to you may become aware of your addiction before you do.\nCan opioid addiction be prevented or avoided?\nOpioid medicines can be safe when used correctly. However, opioid drugs have a high risk for addiction, especially when used for a long time. People can also become addicted if they misuse the medicine (opioid use disorder) or use the drug illegally.\nIn general, you are more likely to avoid addiction if you use opioid drugs no longer than a week. Research shows that using them for more than a month can make you dependent on them.\nOpioid addiction is a chronic illness and should be treated the same as other chronic illnesses. It should be managed and monitored by medical professionals who are properly trained to treat the condition.\nTreatment for opioid addiction is different for each person. The main goal of treatment is to help you stop using the drug. Treatment will also help you recover and hopefully prevent you from using the drug again in the future.\nWhen you stop using opioids, you will experience a period of withdrawal. You will likely have symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, chills and fever, fatigue, and depression or anxiety. It is normal\u2014although hard\u2014to have these symptoms as your body recovers from the effects of the drug and lessens its tolerance and dependence on the drug.\nYour doctor may prescribe certain medicines to help relieve your withdrawal symptoms and control your drug cravings. These medicines include methadone (often used to treat heroin addiction), buprenorphine, and naltrexone.\nMethadoneandbuprenorphinehelp reduce withdrawal symptoms by targeting the same centers in the brain that opioids target. However, these medicines will not make you feel high. They help restore balance to your brain and allow it to heal. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), you may safely take the medicines long-term, even for life. You should not quit taking them without first talking to your doctor.\nNaltrexoneis another medicine your doctor may prescribe. This medicine doesn\u2019t help you stop taking opioids. It is meant to prevent you from relapsing or taking opioids again.\u00a0This medicine is different from methadone and buprenorphine because it does not directly prevent cravings or withdrawal. Instead, according to the NIH, it prevents you from feeling the high you get when taking opioids.\nAlong with opioid addiction treatment, you may also need help with your mental or emotional health. Behavioral treatments can help you learn how to manage depression or anxiety. They can also help you cope with avoiding opioids, dealing with cravings, and healing damaged relationships. Some behavioral treatments include individual counseling, group or family counseling, and cognitive therapy.

Those who have it are angry, argumentative, and defiant much more often than others in their age group. The behaviors associated with ODD have a negative effect on the child\u2019s or teen\u2019s relationships and ability to do well in school and at home.\nEvery child or teen gets angry, throws tantrums, and argues. But it can be hard to tell if a child or teen is just acting out, or if they have ODD. The symptoms of ODD are disruptive to home and family life. They\u2019re almost constant and last for at least 6 months. Symptoms of ODD may include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of ODD. It may result from a combination of factors. The child\u2019s general attitude and how the family reacts to his or her behavior may play a role in it. ODD may run in families. Other causes may be related to the nervous system or to brain chemicals that are out of balance.\nYour doctor will ask about your child\u2019s symptoms, medical history, family history, and other emotional or behavioral problems. Your doctor may want to refer your child to a doctor specializing in behavior problems for a more in-depth evaluation.\nA child is more likely to develop ODD if they have the following risk factors:\nThere are several treatment options for ODD. Some focus only on the child, while other treatments include the child\u2019s family and school.\nYour doctor will probably work with another doctor who specializes in mental health to treat your child. This other doctor will likely be a psychologist or counselor. Treatment will focus on helping your child learn better ways to manage his or her anger. It will also help your child learn how to handle social situations so they will feel less frustrated with other people.\nTreatment can also help families learn to communicate better with each other. Your doctor also can help you learn how to manage your child\u2019s behavior and how to use discipline effectively.\nIn a treatment called cognitive behavior therapy, children and their families learn problem-solving skills and how to feel more positive.\nYou may feel helpless if your child or teen has ODD.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nOrganic acid metabolism disorders are a group of rare birth defects. They affect your ability to break down food into energy. Another name for them is organic acidemia metabolic disorders. There are numerous types of the disorder. They occur when a newborn lacks a certain protein or has a protein that doesn\u2019t work correctly.\nSymptoms may begin right after birth or a few days later. Some babies never have symptoms or don\u2019t have any until they are older. Each type of disorder has different symptoms based on the protein it affects. Common signs of a disorder are:\nThese types of disorders are genetic. Parents may carry the recessive gene even if it\u2019s not active. There is a chance parents can pass it to their children.\nA doctor often diagnoses the disorders during your baby\u2019s routine newborn screening test. This is a heel prick test to collect a blood sample. All babies have the test within 24 to 48 hours of birth before leaving the hospital. The screening checks for a range of birth defects and rare conditions. Ask your doctor or hospital which metabolic disorders they screen for.\nIf your baby tests positive for a disorder, the doctor will perform other tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nSince the disorders are caused by genetics, you cannot prevent them. If you know you have one of the disorders, there is a risk of passing it to your offspring. You might not know you carry the gene, if it is recessive. The only way to find out is to get genetic testing done before or during pregnancy.\nOrganic acid metabolism disorders treatment\nEarly diagnosis is key to treatment. Newborns who have a disorder are at risk of death if it is not detected. Treatment should begin right away with nutrition changes. You will have to switch your baby to a low-protein diet. This helps manage acid levels and the breakdown of food. Some disorders require taking dietary supplements.\nThere is no cure for the rare disorders. If you have a disorder, you will need to maintain the specialized diet for life. Your child\u2019s doctor, as well as a geneticist and nutritionist, can help monitor the condition.\nThe risk of death decreases as your baby gets older. However, severe problems can occur if they don\u2019t get treatment, lapse on the diet, or miss meals. The buildup of protein acids in their body becomes toxic. This is known as metabolic acidosis.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nOsgood-Schlatter disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in growing children and athletes. Osgood-Schlatter is more common in boys than girls. It can occur during a growth spurt in pre-teens or teenagers. Kids who also play sports\u2014especially running and jumping sports\u2014are at greater risk.\nOsgood-Schlatter can affect one or both knees. The main symptoms are swelling and pain below the knee and above the shin bone (tibia). Activities that require running, jumping, and climbing may make the pain worse.\nThe leading cause of Osgood-Schlatter disease is pulled or overused muscles around the knee.\nYour doctor will examine your child and discuss their symptoms. Your doctor may also want to do a knee X-ray to make sure the pain isn\u2019t caused by something else.\nHave your child do regular stretching and strengthening exercises. This is the best way to prevent Osgood-Schlatter disease.\nIn most people, Osgood-Schlatter disease goes away on its own with rest and time. Your doctor may prescribe some exercises for your child to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstrings (muscles around the knee). These may be done at home or with a physical therapist.\nWhile your child is recovering, your doctor may suggest that they rest from normal activities. This could mean cutting down on time spent playing sports until the pain has improved for a few weeks. Your child may need to avoid any activity that requires deep knee bending. They may also need to avoid or limit the amount of time running and jumping.\nYour child can apply ice to their knee to reduce swelling and relieve pain. After applying ice, wrap your child\u2019s knee with an elastic bandage and keep the leg elevated. Use the word RICE to help remind you of this at-home treatment:\nR= Rest the knee from the painful activity.\nI= Ice the knee for 20 minutes, 3 times a day.\nC= Compress the knee with an elastic bandage.\nE= Elevate the leg.\nIf these treatment steps don\u2019t work, the doctor may suggest that your child wearbraces. These can help reduce tension on the muscles and tendons around the knee. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (one brand name: Motrin) may help relieve the pain and swelling. Do not give aspirin to children under 18 years of age. It can cause Reye\u2019s syndrome. Your child may need to use crutches for a while to allow complete healing. As a last resort, your child\u2019s doctor may suggest surgery.\nOnce your child stops growing, the pain and swelling should go away because the muscle attachment spot has closed and is solid. It is rare for Osgood-Schlatter disease to persist into adulthood.\nIt may take several weeks or months for the pain to stop. Once the pain is gone, your child may slowly return to their regular activity.\nIf your child ignores or plays through the pain, the disease may get worse and be more difficult to treat.\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nArthritis is inflammation (swelling) of the joints. It causes pain and often limits movement of the affected joints. There are many kinds of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common kind.\nOsteoarthritis is sometimes called degenerative\u00a0joint\u00a0disease or \u201cwear-and-tear\u201d arthritis. It can affect any joint in your body. It most often happens in the hands, hips, knees, and spine. It causes the cushion layer between your bones (called the cartilage) to wear away. This happens slowly and usually gets worse over time.\nThere are some factors that can increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including:\nIf you\u2019re having joint pain, tell your family doctor. Treating early can help prevent or reduce lifelong disability.Read\u00a0More\nbyDr. Shweta Akhouri\nThe most common symptoms of osteoarthritis include:\nThe exact cause of osteoarthritis isn\u2019t known. It may be hereditary, which means it runs in families. People who play sports may get it because sports can be hard on joints. However, in most people, it seems to be related to the wear and tear put on joints over the years.\nNormally, a smooth layer of\u00a0cartilage\u00a0acts as a pad between the bones of a joint. Cartilage helps the joint move easily and comfortably. In some people, the cartilage thins as the joints are used. This is the start of osteoarthritis. Over time, the cartilage wears away and the bones may rub against each other. The rubbing causes pain, swelling, and decreased motion of the joint.\nBones may even start to grow too thick on the ends where they meet to make a joint. Bits of cartilage may loosen and get in the way of movement. This also can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness.\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your pain. They will probably ask you if your joint pain gets worse with activity and better with rest. Your doctor will examine you to see if you have trouble moving your joint. Your doctor may order an X-ray or an MRI of the joint that\u2019s causing problems to see what\u2019s causing the pain. Blood tests can help rule out other forms of arthritis.\nThere\u2019s not much you can do to avoid getting osteoarthritis as you age. However, the following may help:\nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis. It will probably get worse over time. But the right plan can help you stay active, protect your joints from damage, limit injury, and control pain. Your doctor will help you create a plan that is right for you. They will treat you with a combination of therapies.\nIt\u2019s important to stay as active as possible. When joints hurt, people tend not to use them as much. Then the muscles get weak. This can cause the joint to work less effectively. That can make it harder to get around. This causes more pain, and the cycle begins again. Talk to your doctor about ways to control your pain so that you can stay active and avoid this problem.\nExercise keeps your muscles strong and helps you stay flexible. Exercises that don\u2019t strain your joints are best. To avoid pain and injury, choose exercises that can be done in small amounts with rest time in between. Dancing, weight-lifting, swimming, and bike-riding are good exercises for people who have arthritis. Avoid activities that make your pain worse.\nYour doctor may also prescribe physical therapy. This usually includes muscle-strengthening exercises that can help your joints work better and reduce arthritis pain.\nYour doctor will probably recommend taking over-the-counter medicines to manage your pain. These are medicines you can buy without a doctor\u2019s prescription. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation and relieve pain. They include aspirin, ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil), and naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Other pain relievers may help you feel better, such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol).\nAnother over-the-counter option your doctor may recommend is a topical NSAID (one brand name: Voltaren Topical Gel). These are are available as creams, gels, or sprays that you can apply directly to the skin to treat pain and help with inflammation.\nYour doctor can also prescribe medicine for you. This could be prescription pain relievers or prescription NSAIDs.\nMedicine should be used wisely. You only need the amount that makes you feel good enough to keep moving. Using too much medicine may increase the risk of side effects.\nSpecial supportive devices can help people who have arthritis stay independent. These devices help protect your joints and keep you moving. Devices can include canes, crutches, and walkers. Talk to your doctor if you think a special device may help your arthritis.\nSometimes osteoarthritis becomes severe. It can cause severe joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. When other therapies haven\u2019t worked, your doctor may give you a shot in your joint. The shot could contain pain medicine. This can stop the pain for days to weeks. Adding another medicine (called a corticosteroid) may keep the pain and inflammation away longer.\nIf this doesn\u2019t help enough, your doctor may talk to you about hyaluronic acid injections. Your joints already contain hyaluronic acid. If you have osteoarthritis, that acid gets thinner. When this happens, there isn\u2019t enough hyaluronic acid to protect the joint. These shots put more hyaluronic acid into your joint to help protect it. These injections are usually only used for osteoarthritis in the knee. These injections help some people, but not everyone. And some research has shown that they don\u2019t work. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons doesn\u2019t recommend using hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee.\nTalk to your doctor about injections to see if they would be a good choice for you.\nSometimes\u00a0osteoarthritis is so severe that surgery is required to relieve the symptoms. There are many types of surgery for osteoarthritis. The type of surgery you may have depends on several factors. These include your age, your activity level, which joint is affected, and how bad the damage is.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nOsteochondritis dissecans (OC) is a joint problem. It occurs when an area of bone under a piece of cartilage in the joint dies. This happens because of a loss of blood supply to the area. It can cause a thin layer of bone and the cartilage to break loose. The loose piece may stay in place or fall into the joint space. This makes the joint unstable. It causes pain and feelings that the joint \u201csticks\u201d or is \u201cgiving way.\u201d\nOsteochondritis dissecans most often occurs in the knees. It also may occur in other joints, including elbows, ankles, shoulders, and hips. It is most common in children and adolescents. It typically affects only one joint, but can affect multiple joints in children.\nThe symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans include:\nThese are all clues that you may have osteochondritis dissecans. See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms, or if you have persistent pain or soreness in a joint.\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes osteochondritis dissecans. The loss of blood supply could be caused by repeated minor injuries or stress to the bone that you don\u2019t even notice. Children and teens can get the condition when they spend months doing high-impact activities, such as running or jumping.\nAnyone can get osteochondritis dissecans. It happens more often in boys and young men 10 to 20 years of age who are very active. It is being diagnosed more often in girls as they become more active in sports. It affects athletes, especially gymnasts and baseball players.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. They will ask you about your symptoms and your activities. They will check the joint to be sure it is stable. They will check for extra fluid in the joint. Your doctor will consider all the possible causes of joint pain. These could include fractures, sprains, damage to cartilage or ligaments, and osteochondritis dissecans.\nIf osteochondritis dissecans is suspected, your doctor will order X-rays to check all sides of the joint. If signs of osteochondritis dissecans are seen on X-rays of one joint, you may have X-rays of the other joint to compare them. After this, you may have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computerized tomography) imaging tests done. These tests can show whether the loose piece is still in place or whether it has moved into the joint space.\nSince the cause of osteochondritis dissecans is unknown, it can be hard to avoid it. Children who are very active in sports can be taught how to reduce their chance of being injured. This includes learning the proper techniques and mechanics of their sport. It also includes using protective gear and participating in strength and stability exercises.\nA child with osteochondritis dissecans might not need much treatment. If the child is still growing, the bone and cartilage will probably heal on their own. Your child needs to rest their joint and avoid sports until their symptoms get better. This might mean they need to use a brace, a cast, or crutches for a while.\nFor grown children and young adults, the problems can be worse. If the loose piece is stable (still in place), home treatment can help with the symptoms. This can include:\nIf the loose piece is unstable (meaning it has moved into the joint space), you might need surgery to remove it or secure it.\nIf a nonsurgical treatment is recommended, you should avoid activities that cause discomfort. You should avoid competitive sports for 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor may suggest stretching exercises or swimming instead as a means of physical therapy.\nYoung people have the best chance of returning to their usual activity levels. But they might not be able to keep playing sports with repetitive motions, such as pitching in baseball. Adults are more likely to need surgery. They are less likely to be completely cured of the condition. They are at higher risk of later developing osteoarthritis in the affected joint.\nAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Osteochondritis Dissecans\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus:Familial osteochondritis dissecans\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is osteopenia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nOsteopenia is a condition that begins as you lose bone mass and your bones get weaker. This happens when the inside of your bones become brittle from a loss of calcium. It\u2019s very common as you age. Total bone mass peaks around age 35. Sometimes, osteopenia is a precursor to osteoporosis. People who have osteopenia are at a higher risk of havingosteoporosis.\nMost people who have osteopenia don\u2019t have symptoms. Loss of bone mass isn\u2019t painful. Broken bones or fractures can occur, but these problems tend to happen once you have osteoporosis.\nDuring your life, your bones constantly change. New bone grows while old bone breaks down and your body absorbs it. When you\u2019re young, you grow new bone faster than your body breaks down old bone. This contributes to a high bone mass. Once your body starts to break down old bone faster than it creates new bone, your bone mass begins to decrease. Loss of bone mass weakens your bones and can cause them to break. The beginning of this decline is known as osteopenia. For some people, it can lead to osteoporosis, which is more severe.\nWomen are more likely than men to have this condition for several reasons. Women have a lower bone mass overall and absorb less calcium than men do. They also tend to live longer. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up after menopause as estrogen levels fall. Since the ovaries make estrogen, faster bone loss will occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.\nIn order to diagnose osteopenia, your doctor will do a bone density test. Bone density measures bone mass and bone strength. One type of test is a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA). It measures bone density in your hips, spine, and wrist. The result can tell if you have osteopenia or osteoporosis, or if your bones are normal. The lower your score, the higher your risk of bone breakage. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 is labeled osteopenia. A T-score lower than -2.5 is labeled osteoporosis.\nAccording to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, all women over 65 years old should have a bone density test. Women under 65 years old should be tested as well if they\u2019re at high risk.\nYou can\u2019t always avoid osteopenia. No matter what you do, bone mass decreases over time. There are other natural factors that increase your risk, including:\nThere are some things you can do to lower your risk.\nLong-term use of certain medicines also can increase your risk. Examples include corticosteroids and anticonvulsants. Talk to your doctor about all the ways you can prevent unwanted bone loss.\nTreatment for osteopenia starts with changes to your lifestyle. Your doctor will want you to increase your physical activity. Weight-bearing exercise can help strengthen your bones. It also can build muscle and improve your balance, which help prevent against broken bones. Examples of weight-bearing exercise include walking, jogging, and climbing steps.\nYour doctor also will suggest ways to get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Nonfat and low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt, cheese, and milk, are good sources of calcium. Other sources of calcium include dried beans, salmon, spinach, and broccoli. Some foods, such as orange juice, breads, and dry cereals, may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D, or both. Your doctor may suggest a vitamin D or calcium supplement as well.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of osteopenia is important. It can help prevent osteoporosis and future health problems.\nAARP: Do You Need a Bone Scan?\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Bone Density\nLast Updated:June 3, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated July 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nOsteoporosis is a disease of the bones. It causes you to lose bone mass. Osteoporosis occurs most often in older adults. Women are more likely to have it than men. This is due to several factors. Women have less bone mass than men to begin with. Women also tend to live longer and absorb less calcium. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up aftermenopause, when\u00a0estrogen\u00a0levels decrease. Since the ovaries make estrogen, faster bone loss may occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.\nYou may not know you have osteoporosis until your symptoms are severe. Signs include frequent broken bones or fractures,low back pain,\u00a0or a hunched back. You may get shorter over time due to osteoporosis. The condition can cause your\u00a0vertebrae\u00a0(the bones in your spine) to collapse. These problems tend to occur after a lot of bone calcium has already been lost.\nThere are two ways osteoporosis can occur. You can lose too much bone, or your body cannot produce enough bone. Some people have both issues. When you\u2019re young, your bones are dense and strong. Osteoporosis makes your bones brittle and breakable.\nIt is natural to lose some bone mass as you age. For most adults, this begins in their mid 20s. Other factors can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Some of these risk factors are out of your control. For others, you can take steps to reduce your risk. Talk to your family doctor about your risk factors.\nUncontrollable risk factors:\nControllable risk factors:\nContact your doctor if you have signs of osteoporosis or if it runs in your family. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends that certain women be screened for osteoporosis. This includes women who are 65 years and older or have an equal or greater fracture risk. Your doctor can help you assess your fracture risk. Currently, the AAFP does not recommend that men be screened for osteoporosis.\nTo diagnose the condition, your doctor will do a bone density scan. This is a common test that measures your bone density. It is called a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The scan often checks your hips, spine, and\u00a0wrist. These are the most common places to have osteoporosis.\nThe AAFP does not recommend that doctors use DEXA scans for women younger than 65 or men younger than 70 unless there are risk factors.\nYou cannot always avoid osteoporosis. However, there are some changes you can make to prevent or reduce your risk. These include regular exercise and getting enough calcium and vitamin D. They help keep your bones healthy as you age.\nCalcium.Women 50 years of age and younger and men 70 years of age and younger should get 1,000 mg of calcium per day. For women older than 50 years of age and men older than 70 years of age, 1,200 mg of calcium per day is recommended. Women who are post-menopausal may need 1,500 mg of calcium per day. It is best to get your calcium from food. Nonfat and low-fat dairy products are good sources of calcium. Other options include dried beans, salmon, spinach, and broccoli. If you don\u2019t get enough calcium from the food you eat, your doctor may suggest taking a calcium supplement.\nVitamin D.Most people need about 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D each day. It helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight, food, and supplements. Your skin makes vitamin D when it is exposed to sunlight. However, you should be careful of sun exposure. Too much can causeskin cancer. Your doctor can test your\u00a0blood\u00a0to measure your vitamin D level. If your vitamin D level is low, your doctor may suggest taking a supplement.\nExercise.Regular exercise helps you build and keep strong bones. This is why it\u2019s important to begin an active lifestyle at a young age. However, it\u2019s never too late to start exercising. Ask your doctor for tips on how to exercise safely. Try to do a mix of strength training and weight-bearing exercises.\nTreatment for osteoporosis starts with changes to your\u00a0diet\u00a0and lifestyle. You need to get enough calcium and vitamin D. Your doctor will want you to increase your physical activity. This helps to strengthen your bones and increase your bone mass. Examples of weight-bearing exercises include walking, jogging, and climbing steps. You also should stop smoking and limit alcohol.\nIf you\u2019re at risk for falls, reduce your risk by getting rid of tripping hazards in your home. For example, remove rugs, avoid slick surfaces, and move electrical cords. You can install grab bars in certain places, such as your bathroom and shower. The bars can help you move around more easily and safely.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine(s) to help treat osteoporosis. There are several types and forms.\nBiophosphonates.This type helps reduce your risk of breaks and fractures. It also increases bone density. It comes in oral (pill) form or intravenous (IV or injection) form. Side effects can include nausea or stomach pain. You may have irritation of the esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth and stomach). Some people cannot take biophosphonates. This includes people who have kidney disease or low levels of calcium in their blood, and women who are pregnant or nursing. Examples of biophosphonates include:\nCalcitonin.This is a hormone that helps slow down bone loss. It is available as an injection or nasal spray. Side effects of the injection include diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Side effects of the nose spray include headache and irritation of your nose lining.\nRaloxifene.This medicine helps prevent and treat osteoporosis in women. It increases your bone density. It is not a hormone, but it mimics some of the effects of estrogen. Side effects may include hot flashes and a risk ofblood clots.\nTeriparatide.This medicine helps to grow new bones. It is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone. Both women and men can use it. It is available as an injection. You inject it in your thigh or stomach once a day. Common side effects are nausea, stomach pain, headache, muscle weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite.\nDenosumab.This drug is used when other drugs don\u2019t work or if you can\u2019t tolerate other treatment options. Denosumab increases your bone density. It can be used by both women and men. It is given as an injection by your doctor. Side effects can include lower calcium levels, skin rash, or pain in the arms and legs.\nIf your doctor prescribes medicine to treat osteoporosis, it is important that you take it.\nWhen your doctor prescribes a medicine, be sure to discuss:\nThere is no complete cure for osteoporosis. You should work with your doctor to treat the condition.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nOsteosarcoma is a kind ofbone cancerthat most often affects children, teenagers, and young adults between the ages of 10 and 20. It usually begins in a leg bone (either the femur or the tibia) near the knee or in the upper arm bone (the humerus) near the shoulder. Osteosarcoma can metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. Most often it spreads to the lungs or to other bones.\nOsteosarcoma isn\u2019t a common cancer. Only between 800 and 900 cases occur in the United States each year. But it is the most common bone cancer in children and teenagers. It\u2019s slightly more likely to affect males.\nMost people who have osteosarcoma don\u2019t feel or look sick. An osteosarcoma tumor may cause a dull aching pain in the bone or joint around the tumor. Often, there is a firm swelling or lump in the area of the pain. This swelling is caused by the tumor growing inside the bone.\nIf thecanceris in a leg bone, the person may limp. Also, the muscles in the arm or leg that have the osteosarcoma may look smaller than the muscles in the opposite arm or leg. Sometimes, the bone can break in the area of the tumor because the tumor weakens the bone.\nOsteosarcoma has no known cause. Some researchers believe that genetics may play a role. In some cases, osteosarcoma can develop because of radiation therapy.\nThere are several tests your doctor may use to determine if your child has osteosarcoma:\nThere are no known ways to prevent osteosarcoma.\nOsteosarcoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy. For chemotherapy, your child or teenager will be given medicines that kill the main tumor. These medicines will also kill any tumor cells that have moved to other parts of the body. This treatment is usually started before surgery to kill the tumor or make it smaller.\nSurgery is performed to remove the tumor. Almost everyone who has this type of cancer can have \u201climb-sparing\u201d surgery. In this surgery, the tumor is removed along with the area of bone that it grew in. Then the doctor replaces the missing bone so that, after rehabilitation, the joint will still work normally. In some cases, the doctor may recommend amputation (removal of the limb) as the best way to remove the tumor.\nAfter the surgery, the doctor may recommend more chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy help kill any remaining cancer cells that might be left in the body after surgery.\nToday, about 3 out of 4 people who have osteosarcoma can be cured if the cancer hasn\u2019t spread to other parts of the body. Almost everyone who is treated with limb-sparing surgery ends up with that arm or leg working well.\nMany people who have osteosarcoma will need physical therapy for several months after surgery. If amputation is necessary, rehabilitation may last for much longer. There are many new prosthetic treatments now available to help people who have had amputations regain movement and independence.\nAfter the treatment is over, you or your loved one will:\nLast Updated:June 8, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It\u2019s often caused by swimming a lot or swimming in unclean water. It can occur suddenly. It\u2019s common in children and young adults but can happen to anybody. The medical name for swimmer\u2019s ear is otitis externa.\nSwimmer\u2019s ear infects the outer ear or ear canal.

Note this type of infection is different than an inner ear infection.\nThere are many symptoms of swimmer\u2019s ear, including:\nIn serious cases, swimmer\u2019s ear can spread to other areas of the ear. This includes the skull bone. The infection can become severe in older people and people who havediabetes.\nSeveral things can cause swimmer\u2019s ear, including:\nYour doctor will look inside your ears. As they do, touching or moving it may hurt. The infected ear will appear red and swollen. It also may look scaly. Your doctor will check your eardrum for infection or a hole. They may not be able to see the eardrum due to swelling.\nYour doctor may take a sample of fluid from the ear to send to a lab. The lab is checking for bacteria or fungus.\nFollow these tips to prevent swimmer\u2019s ear:\nYour doctor will clean the drainage or pus from your ear. They will likely prescribe antibiotic ear drops to make your infection go away and may prescribe oral antibiotics if your case is severe. They may also prescribe other medicine to help with itching. Over-the-counter medicine can relieve pain. Ask your doctor what type you should take.\nAfter your diagnosis, keep your ear as dry as possible for 7 to 10 days. Take baths instead of showers. Put a cotton ball in each ear to keep the water out. And don\u2019t swim during that time. Your symptoms should be better in 3 days. They should go away in 10 days.\nSwimmer\u2019s ear usually isn\u2019t serious if it\u2019s treated early. Most symptoms will go away as the infection clears up.

The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum. Otitis media with\u00a0effusion\u00a0means there is fluid (effusion) in the middle ear, without an infection.\nFluid in the middle ear can have few symptoms, especially if it develops slowly. It almost always goes away on its own in a few weeks to a few months. So, this kind of ear problem doesn\u2019t usually need to be treated with antibiotics. Your doctor may decide to treat it if it causes a painful\u00a0infection\u00a0or if the fluid doesn\u2019t go away.\nOtitis media with effusion is most common in young children, age 2 and under. But it can affect people of any age.\nChildren who have otitis media with effusion may not have any symptoms. Usually they don\u2019t act sick. They could experience the following:\nIf your child\u2019s otitis media with effusion develops into an infection, he or she may have other symptoms. These include:\nThe Eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the back of the throat. Normally, this tube lets fluid drain out of the middle ear. But sometimes the Eustachian tube swells. It can become partially or completely blocked. This can cause fluid to build up in the middle ear.\nThe following may cause the Eustachian tube to swell:\nIf the Eustachian tubes are blocked, fluid in the ear cannot drain normally. If bacteria grow in the middle ear fluid, an effusion can turn into a middle ear infection (acute otitis media). This will usually increase pressure behind the eardrum and cause a lot of pain. The eardrum will become red and bulging. If this happens, your child may need to be treated with antibiotics. Children who have frequent ear infections can also develop otitis media with effusion after their infection is gone, if fluid stays in the middle ear.\nIt is not a good idea to let your baby fall asleep with a bottle or to leave a bottle in the crib. Drinking while lying down can wash bacteria from the throat right into the Eustachian tubes and middle ear space. This increases the risk for tube blockage and infection.\nIf you think your child may have otitis media with effusion, make an appointment your child\u2019s doctor. He or she will look in your child\u2019s ears. They will look at the eardrum for signs that there may be fluid behind it. They may order a test called tympanometry. It can diagnose otitis media with effusion. It can also help tell the amount and thickness of the fluid that is trapped. They may also want to do a hearing test on your child.\nThe best ways to prevent fluid build-up in the ears are the same as preventing ear infections:\nIf your child is older than 6 months of age and only has mild symptoms, the best treatment is to let the fluid go away on its own. You can give your child an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, (one brand: Children\u2019s Tylenol) if he or she is uncomfortable. A warm, moist cloth placed over the ear may also help.\nUsually the fluid goes away in 2 to 3 months, and hearing returns to normal. Your doctor may want to check your child again at some point to see if fluid is still present. If it is, he or she may give your child antibiotics.\nOne treatment your doctor may suggest is a nasal balloon. A nasal balloon can help clear the fluid from the middle ear. You can easily use a nasal balloon at home. Your child will simply insert the balloon nozzle in one nostril while blocking the other nostril with a finger. Then, he or she will inflate the balloon with their nose.\nIf the fluid does not go away after a certain amount of time and treatment, your child may need ear tubes. These small tubes are inserted through the ear drum. They allow the doctor to suction out the fluid behind the ear. They also allow air to get into the middle ear, which helps prevent fluid build-up. Any hearing loss experienced by your child should be restored after the fluid is drained.\nThe. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advise against the use of ear candles. Ear candles can cause serious injuries and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness. For more information, please visit theFDA Web site.\nMost cases of otitis media with effusion go away on their own in a few weeks or months. Treatment may speed up the process. Most children don\u2019t have any long-term effects to their ears, their hearing, or their speaking ability. This is the case even if they had fluid build-up in their ears for a long time.\nIn a few cases, otitis media with effusion could lead to longer term issues.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nOvarian cancer is cancer in one or both ovaries. Ovaries are small organs located on each side of a women\u2019s pelvis. They produce sex hormones, regulate the menstrual cycle, and produce eggs. While ovarian cancer isn\u2019t common, women of any age can get it. It is serous and, if it progresses too far, it can be fatal.\nMost women don\u2019t have symptoms of ovarian cancer until the cancer has spread outside the ovary. Plus, symptoms are similar to other medical conditions, not just ovarian cancer. When they do occur, symptoms include:\nBecause these symptoms can have many causes, ovarian cancer may be hard to diagnose early. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good to know your body. Be aware of slight changes and share them with your doctor. Also, talk with your doctor if your symptoms persist or worsen.\nFamily history is one of the biggest risk factors for ovarian cancer. The breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are hereditary. If you have these genes, and if they change inside your body, they can cause ovarian cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends genetic counseling and testing for women with this family history. Talk to your doctor if you think you meet the screening requirements.\nThere are other risk factors for ovarian cancer. These include your pregnancy and reproductive history, use of hormone replacement therapy, poor diet, and inactivity. But being at high risk for ovarian cancer doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get it. Your doctor can perform tests to examine potential signs. These tests include a pelvic and vaginal exam, X-ray, ultrasound, or blood test.\nCancer from other areas in your body, such as your breasts or colon, can also lead to ovarian cancer.\nYour doctor will talk with you about your medical history, your family\u2019s medical history, and your symptoms. They will do a pelvic exam to feel for issues with your ovaries.\nYour doctor also may order a pelvic ultrasound. This is a painless procedure that will take pictures of the inside of your body. Your doctor also may ask you to have a biopsy. This is when a piece of the mass in your ovary is removed and sent to a lab to examine under a microscope. A biopsy is the only way to confirm ovarian cancer.\nThe AAFP does not recommend ovarian cancer screening. Screening is used to identify conditions prior to having any symptoms. AAFP has found that ovarian cancer screening is not accurate or valuable. AAFP also recommends against genetic counseling related to ovarian cancer, unless you are high risk.\nOvarian cancer can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. However, certain risk factors increase your chances of getting it. These include:\nTalk to your doctor about screening or testing if you have any of these. If you\u2019re extremely high-risk, your doctor might recommend removing your ovaries. This surgery is called an oophorectomy.\nAny woman can develop ovarian cancer. Studies show that some things can reduce your risk, such as:\nTreatment requires a team of specialists. Your doctor will refer you to a specialist called an oncologist. This doctor specializes in cancer treatment. You also may be referred to a surgeon. They may be able to remove your cancer.\nBoth the oncologist and the surgeon will discuss treatment with you. After meeting with them, you may want to seek a \u201csecond opinion\u201d from another oncologist and/or surgeon.\nTreatments vary based on the type, grade, and stage of cancer.\nThere are many types of ovarian cancer that fall into main categories.\nGrades rate how the cancer cells look compared to healthy cells. If there\u2019s not much difference, the tumor is a low-grade tumor. If there\u2019s a lot of difference, the tumor is a high-grade tumor. Grades can help your doctor determine how the cancer may act in the future.\nStages rate if the cancer is contained to the ovary or if it has spread. Your surgeon will be able to help determine the staging during surgery to remove the tumor. You doctor also may order additional tests to see if the cancer has spread to other areas of your body. This is usually done with imaging, such as an X-ray, colonoscopy, CT (computed tomography) scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or PET (positron emission tomography). There are four stages of cancer. Stage 4 is the most severe.\nThe goal of cancer treatment is:\nMost treatment programs include a mix of:\nTreatment is more successful if the cancer is detected early.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nAn ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac in or on a person\u2019s ovary. The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. They produce eggs and hormones.\nOvarian cysts are very common. They often occur during ovulation. This is when the ovary releases an egg each month. These are called functional cysts. Most are noncancerous. Many times, these cysts go away on their own without treatment.\nIt is common for a person with regular periods to develop an ovarian cyst. They are less common after menopause. Individuals who have reached menopause and have an ovarian cyst are at higher risk for ovarian cancer.\nOften, functional cysts do not cause any symptoms. You may have one and not know it. Other times they can cause symptoms, including:\nIf you are menopausal and are not having periods, functional cysts shouldn\u2019t form. But it is possible for other types of ovarian cysts to form. Call your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of an ovarian cyst.\nThe most common causes of ovarian cysts include:\nOften, your doctor will feel a cyst during a pelvic exam. If you have a cyst, your doctor can do two things. One is to wait and watch to see if the cyst changes or starts causing symptoms. The other is to order tests to help plan treatment. What they choose to do depends on several factors. These include your age and if you\u2019re having symptoms.\nIf your doctor orders tests, they will probably want you to have a sonogram (ultrasound) so they can look at the cyst. A sonogram uses sound waves to make pictures of organs in the body. With a sonogram, your doctor can see the size, shape, and location of the cyst as well as if it is solid or filled with fluid.\nYour doctor could also order other tests. These could include:\nIf you are ovulating normally, there is nothing you can do to prevent a functional ovarian cyst from forming. If you get cysts frequently, your doctor may prescribe hormonal birth control. This will stop you from ovulating and lower your chances of getting new cysts.\nThe treatment for ovarian cysts depends on several things. This includes your age, whether you are having periods, the size of the cyst, its appearance, and your symptoms.\nFunctional cysts normally shrink on their own over time, usually in about 1 to 3 months. If you have a functional cyst, your doctor may want to check you again in 1 to 3 months to check on the status of the cyst. If you develop functional cysts often, your doctor may want you to take birth control pills or other hormonal birth control so you won\u2019t ovulate. If you don\u2019t ovulate, you won\u2019t form functional cysts.\nSurgery is an option for some people. You may need surgery if the cyst:\nIn addition, if you\u2019re past menopause and have an ovarian cyst, your doctor will probably want you to have surgery. Ovarian cancer is rare, but individuals 50 to 70 years of age are at greater risk. People who are diagnosed with cancer at an early stage do much better than those who are diagnosed later.\nThere are 2 main ways surgery can be done on an ovarian cyst:\nYour doctor will talk to you about the risks of each kind of surgery. They will tell you how long you are likely to be in the hospital and how long it will be before you can go back to your normal activities.\nIf you have an ovarian cyst, you can usually just wait for it to go away on its own in a few months. But sometimes cysts can break open. This is called a rupture. This can cause a lot of pain and heavy bleeding.

You may have to urinate more often or urgently. Sometimes you may leak a small amount of urine before you make it to the bathroom.\nIf you have 2 or more of these symptoms, you may have overactive bladder.\nNerve and muscle damage near your bladder causes overactive bladder. The damage causes your bladder to contract (squeeze) at an unplanned time. That\u2019s what causes leaking and the sudden, urgent need to urinate. Sometimes, having too much fluid in your bladder or too much caffeine can cause overactive bladder.\nNerve damage is caused by:\nBladder cancer can lead to overactive bladder. In most cases, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) does not recommend routine screening for bladder cancer unless you have symptoms of overactive bladder.\nYour doctor will start by discussing your symptoms and medical history. They might order certain tests to help diagnose the problem. These tests might include:\nOveractive bladder cannot be prevented. However, you can reduce the risk of overactive bladder by treating those diseases and conditions that cause it. For example, following your doctor\u2019s treatment advice for diabetes will reduce nerve damage. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor about the potential for bladder damage if you have a vaginal delivery.\nOveractive bladder can be treated with medicine, bladder exercises, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Your doctor will tell you which is best for you.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine to treat your overactive bladder. Muscle relaxants help control muscle spasms that cause your bladder to squeeze at the wrong time. Common side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, a fast heartbeat, and a flushed feeling (feeling warm and red). The medicine can be prescribed as a pill or patch.\nBladder exercises strengthen and retrain your bladder to hold the urine until you can get to a bathroom.\nThis is a medical procedure that sends safe, electrical pulses through your vagina or anus (bottom). They also can be given through a patch. Another method involves placing a wire near your tailbone. Your doctor will tell you how many treatments are necessary for you.\nThere is a surgical procedure known as augmentation cystoplasty. This may be necessary in severe cases, or when no other treatment works. It involves making your bladder larger. Part of your bowel may be used to expand your bladder. This gives you more room to store urine. The risks of this surgery include a tear in your bladder (leaking urine in your body), bladder stones, mucus in the bladder, and infection.\nLiving with overactive bladder will depend on how serious your problem is and how well your treatment works. In either case, living with the condition may require better planning. You may have to plan when you consume liquids and how close you are to a bathroom. You also may consider wearing disposable undergarments that protect your clothing from leaking urine.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Bladder Control Problems (Urinary Incontinence)\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Overactive Bladder\nLast Updated:January 23, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "list_title": "Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks",
    "article_title": "What is panic disorder?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nPanic disorder is a condition in which a person has episodes of intense fear or anxiety that occur suddenly, often without warning. Suppose one day you\u2019re getting out of your car to go to work. Suddenly, your chest feels tight. Your heart races. You begin to feel dizzy and faint. You start to choke. You feel as if you could be dying. Was it all in your head? No. Most likely, you had a panic attack.\nPanic attacks can last from minutes to hours. They may occur only occasionally or frequently. The cause, or trigger, for these attacks may not be obvious. Panic attacks can lead to phobias if they aren\u2019t treated.\nA phobia is an extreme, unreasonable fear in response to something specific. There are lots of different phobias. These include fear of crowds, bridges, snakes, spiders, heights, open places, or social embarrassment.\nA phobia is considered a problem only when it keeps you from living a normal life. An example is being afraid to leave home because you are afraid of one of the things listed above.\nPanic attacks are associated with physical symptoms that include:\nA person may also have an extreme fear of losing control, going crazy, or dying during a panic attack. It is very rare for a person to have all these symptoms at once. However, the presence of at least 4 symptoms strongly suggests that a person has panic disorder.\nMany of the symptoms that occur during a panic attack are the same as the symptoms of diseases of the heart, lungs, intestines, or nervous system. The similarities between panic disorder and other diseases may add to the person\u2019s fear and anxiety during and after a panic attack. For example, you may believe that you are having aheart attack.\nJust the fear of having a panic attack is often enough to trigger the symptoms. This is the basis for a condition called agoraphobia. A person who has agoraphobia finds it difficult to leave home (or another safe area) because he or she is afraid of having a panic attack in public or not having an easy way to escape if the symptoms start.\nDoctors do not know what causes panic disorder. Some believe that it could be linked to genetics (runs in families). It could also simply be your body\u2019s response to major stress.\nMany people who have panic attacks don\u2019t seek medical care because of embarrassment. They may also fear seeking medical attention or fear taking medicine. If you have panic attacks, it is very important to seek medical care and discuss your problem with your doctor.\nAfter you have been evaluated, your doctor will be able to tell you if your panic attacks are related to panic disorder or are caused by another problem. If you have more than 4 panic attacks and you are in constant fear of having another, you may be diagnosed with panic disorder. Simple treatments are available to help control panic attacks and panic disorder.\nYou can\u2019t prevent panic disorder because doctors aren\u2019t sure what causes it. But you may be able to prevent a panic attack by knowing your triggers. Your doctor can help with that. He or she can help make sure your panic attacks don\u2019t become worse or more frequent. It\u2019s also a good idea to be physically active. Getting exercise is a known stress reliever and may also guard you against panic attacks.\nThe two most common ways to treat panic disorder are through counseling and through medicine. Several kinds of counseling are very effective in treating panic attacks and panic disorder. You can ask your doctor about the different kinds of counseling that are available. Counseling does not work as fast as medicine, but it can be just as effective. The combination of both counseling and medicine seems to be an effective treatment for panic attacks and panic disorder. Relaxation, meditation, or breathing exercises may also be beneficial.\nThere are several medicines that can make panic attacks less severe or stop them altogether.\nAntidepressants are effective in preventing anxiety and panic attacks. Often, they stop the attacks. You don\u2019t have to be depressed for them to help. Side effects are usually mild. Antidepressants will not make you lose control or change your personality. These medicines can be used for as long as necessary, even for years.\nAnti-anxiety medicines are another useful medication for panic disorder. As their name suggests, these medicines give relief from fear and anxiety. They should be used only for a short period of time (a few weeks to a few months) unless you absolutely can\u2019t function without them. Never suddenly stop taking either of these medicines. If you need to stop, these medicines should be tapered off over several weeks. This should only be done under your doctor\u2019s supervision.\nHow long treatment continues depends on you. Stopping panic attacks completely is a reasonable goal. Your doctor will design a treatment plan just for you. A treatment period lasting at least 6 to 9 months is usually recommended. Some people taking medicine for panic disorder can stop treatment after only a short time. Other people need to continue treatments over a long period of time, or even for their lifetime.\nPanic attacks are often unpredictable, even after your diagnosis. They can make you feel helpless. In addition to your treatment plan, consider these lifestyle changes to help reduce risk of a panic attack.\nAnxiety Disorders Association of America\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Anxiety Disorders\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can\u2019t be pulled back down into a normal position.\nParaphimosis can happen to any uncircumcised penis. It is most common in younger and older people. It is a medical emergency and needs to be treated quickly.\nThe main symptoms of paraphimosis include:\nOther symptoms could include:\nIf you can\u2019t pull your foreskin over the head of your penis, you should call your doctor right away.\nUncircumcised people sometimes pull the foreskin back during sex, when they go to the bathroom, or when they clean their penises. Doctors and nurses might pull the foreskin back when they examine the penis or put in a catheter.\nSometimes you, a doctor, or a nurse might forget to pull the foreskin back down. If the foreskin is left behind the head of the penis too long, your penis might swell so much that the foreskin is trapped behind it.\nOther causes of paraphimosis:\nThere are no tests required to diagnose paraphimosis. Your doctor will do a physical exam and look at your or your child\u2019s penis to diagnose it.\nThe only way to completely prevent paraphimosis from happening is by being circumcised. If you are not circumcised, you can still avoid paraphimosis by:\nThe first thing your doctor will do is treat the swelling. This can be done by pressing your penis with a hand, wrapping your penis in a tight bandage, or using ice. After the swelling has gone away, your doctor should be able to pull the foreskin back down. If the foreskin remains stuck, your doctor might need to make a small cut in the trapped foreskin to loosen it. In some cases, your doctor may need to do a circumcision.\nIf paraphimosis is diagnosed and treated quickly, you shouldn\u2019t have any other problems. If the condition is left untreated, it can cause complications. It could disrupt blood flow to the tip of the penis. Though rare, this could lead to damage to the penis tip, gangrene, or loss of the penis tip.\nLast Updated:January 27, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It affects the nervous system and causes problems with muscle movement. It is a chronic and progressive disease. This means it doesn\u2019t go away, and the symptoms get worse over time.\nSome nerve cells in the brain make a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine sends signals to help coordinate movement and coordination. In people who have Parkinson\u2019s disease, these cells die or do not work properly. The level of dopamine produced decreases. This affects the person\u2019s ability to control their movement normally.\nThere is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms.\nThe 4 primary motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease are:\nOther motor symptoms include:\nThere are also several non-motor symptoms that patients with Parkinson\u2019s experience. These include:\nSome people with Parkinson\u2019s develop cognitive issues. This includes problems with memory, confusion, and slowed thinking. In some cases, they develop Parkinson\u2019s-related dementia. This is a separate form of dementia that is unique to Parkinson\u2019s patients.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes Parkinson\u2019s disease. In some people, genetics seem to play a role. These people could have inherited the genes for Parkinson\u2019s disease from a family member. Or they could have a gene mutation. Environmental factors may also play a role. For example, long-term exposure to certain toxins, such as pesticides, may increase the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease. You have a higher risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s if you are over age 60. Men get it more often than women.\nThere is not a test that can confirm you have Parkinson\u2019s. You must experience at least 2 of the 4 main motor symptoms before your doctor will consider it. They will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. If your doctor thinks you have Parkinson\u2019s disease, they may refer you to a neurologist. The neurologist will have you complete tasks that use your nervous system. These are intended to test your balance, muscles, gait, and agility. They may also do imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan, to rule out other conditions.\nThere is no known way to prevent or avoid getting Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThere is no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease. But medicines can help control the symptoms. They often produce very good results, especially in the earlier stages of the disease. The most common medicine used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease is carbidopa-levodopa. This helps increase the amount of dopamine in your brain. Other classes of medicines, such as dopamine agonists or anticholinergics, can also help. Your doctor will recommend the best treatment for you.\nIn addition to medicine, your doctor may also recommend exercise or physical therapy. These can help you control your movements better. In some cases, surgery can also help relieve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation has been approved to treat many stages of Parkinson\u2019s. Electrodes are inserted in your brain, and electrical impulses are sent to stimulate it.\nLiving with a chronic illness can be frustrating and discouraging. Parkinson\u2019s will gradually get worse. You will eventually have trouble with simple tasks. These include walking, talking, and eating, among many others. It is common for people with Parkinson\u2019s to develop depression. Antidepressant medicines are available and can help with your depression symptoms. If you\u2019ve been feeling persistently sad or hopeless, call your doctor. There is help available.\nJoining a support group can be particularly helpful for Parkinson\u2019s patients. It is helpful to have people around you who know exactly what you\u2019re going through.

Germs get into the skin and cause an infection. These germs can be bacteria or a fungus.\nOften, the skin is injured because of biting, chewing, or picking at the nails. It can also be caused by pulling hangnails or sucking on fingers. An\u00a0ingrown toenail\u00a0can also cause paronychia.\nMoisture allows certain germs, such as candida (a type of fungus) and bacteria to grow. People whose hands may be wet for long periods of time are at higher risk for chronic paronychia. These may include bartenders, dishwashers, food handlers, or housecleaners. Chronic paronychia may also be caused by irritant dermatitis, a condition that makes skin red and itchy. Once the skin is irritated, germs can take hold and cause an infection.\nParonychia is more common in adult women and in people who have\u00a0diabetes. People who have weak\u00a0immune\u00a0systems are also at higher risk of getting paronychia. This includes people who must take medicine after having an\u00a0organ\u00a0transplant or people who are infected with\u00a0HIV.\nYour doctor can\u00a0diagnose\u00a0paronychia with a simple physical exam. Special tests aren\u2019t usually necessary. Your doctor may want to send a sample of fluid or\u00a0pus\u00a0to a laboratory. There they can identify the bacteria or\u00a0fungus\u00a0that is causing the infection.\nThe best away to avoid acute paronychia is to take good care of your nails.\nYou can avoid chronic paronychia by keeping your hands dry and free from chemicals. Wear gloves when working with water or harsh chemicals. Change socks at least every day, and do not wear the same shoes for two days in a row. This allows them to dry out completely.\nParonychia treatment methods depend on how severe the infection is.\nIf you have acute paronychia, soaking the infected nail in warm water 3 to 4 times a day can help reduce pain and swelling. It should heal up in a few days.\nIf the infection is very painful, doesn\u2019t get better with home care, or has a pus-filled abscess, you may need to see your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics if your paronychia is caused by bacteria. He or she may prescribe antifungal medicines if your infection is caused by a fungus.\nIf you have an abscess, your doctor may need to drain it. Your doctor will numb the area, separate the skin from the base or sides of the nail, and drain the pus.\nIf you have chronic paronychia, it is important to keep your nails dry and protect them from harsh chemicals. You may need to wear gloves or use a skin-drying cream to protect skin from moisture. You may need an antifungal medicine or antibiotic, depending on what is causing the infection.\nParonychia caused by a fungus can be hard to get rid of. Be patient and follow your doctor\u2019s recommendations. If the infection does not clear up, be sure to tell your doctor.\nMost of the time, paronychia treatment is effective. But sometimes complications can happen.\nRarely, paronychia can cause permanent damage to your nail. If you havediabetes, there\u2019s a risk that paronychia could spread to deeper tissues and bones, or into the bloodstream and other parts of the body. In extreme cases of deep infection, paronychia can result in the loss of fingers, toes, or limbs.\nBe sure to contact your doctor if:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Fungal Nail Infections\nLast Updated:May 5, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated March 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nA group of muscles and connective tissues make up your pelvic floor. When your pelvic floor weakens, it can cause problems. You may have bladder- or bowel-control problems (incontinence). It can cause constipation or painful urination. A weakened pelvic floor can even cause pelvic organ prolapse (when an organ slips forward or down).\nSymptoms of pelvic floor disorders vary. Pelvic floor disorders are commonly associated with women. But men can also have pelvic floor disorders.\nThere are many ways to tell that you may have pelvic floor disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Common symptoms include:\nThere are many things that can damage your pelvic floor muscles. For women, childbirth is a common way those muscles lose their shape. Being overweight can also cause more stress on those muscles, pushing them out of shape. Or simply age can cause the muscles to wear down over time. This is especially true if you do not exercise them.\nYour doctor will diagnose your pelvic floor disorder. After discussing your symptoms, they may perform a pelvic exam. During the exam, your doctor will check for muscle weakness.\nDepending on the extent of your symptoms, your doctor may also order additional tests. Each of these can help define the level of weakness in your pelvic floor and how best to treat it. Some tests focus on rectal muscles. Other tests target how well your bladder and urethra are working.\nPelvic floor disorders are caused by strain. This can be strain over time or strain from a specific event. So sometimes, there may be nothing you can do to prevent it.\nIn other situations, you may be able to prevent pelvic floor disorders from happening. Or at the very least, you may be able to ensure that they don\u2019t happen prematurely. Being proactive about pelvic floor disorders can also limit their severity.\nTo help prevent pelvic floor disorders, you should:\nThere are surgical and non-surgical treatments for pelvic floor disorders. Your treatment plan will depend on the severity of your disorder.\nThese treatments are the least invasive. They can help mild forms of pelvic floor disorders.\nIf you don\u2019t get relief of symptoms using non-surgical methods, you may need to consider surgery. There are several types of surgery used to correct pelvic floor disorders. The type of surgery you have will depend on how severely your pelvic floor is damaged. It will also depend on your symptoms. Surgeries for urinary incontinence focus on adding support for the bladder. Correcting prolapse involves surgery to build back a support system for your pelvic floor. Bowel incontinence may call for surgery to repair your sphincter muscle.\nManaging incontinence every day can be a challenge. There are products to help you with daily hygiene. There are absorbent pads, disposable underwear, reusable underwear with built-in pads, and more. You have choices, even if your incontinence is moderate to severe. You can use these products in the short-term as you work to rehabilitate your pelvic floor muscles. You can also use them long-term as a solution for your mild or moderate incontinence.\nKnow that it is also important to care for your skin when you are incontinent. Change soiled pads or briefs as soon as possible. This will minimize the amount of wetness against your skin. Keep your skin clean and dry. Wash your genital area with mild soap and water when you shower.\nIf your incontinence prevents you from having dry skin most of the time, you may need to use a barrier cream. These creams can protect you from rashes and irritation.\nYou may feel alone in your battle with incontinence. You should know that millions of men and women share your struggle.\nNational Institutes of Health: Pelvic Floor Disorders\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pelvic Floor Disorders\nLast Updated:July 21, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2020 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an\u00a0infection\u00a0of the female reproductive organs. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Left untreated, PID can damage a woman\u2019s reproductive organs. It can cause trouble getting pregnant, problems during pregnancy, and long-term pelvic pain.\nPelvic inflammatory disease causes different symptoms in different women. These may include:\nSome women who have PID don\u2019t experience symptoms and don\u2019t know they have the disease. This is why it is important to have routine checkups and testing.\nIf you have the above symptoms, or if you think you have been exposed to an STI, call your doctor. The sooner you see your doctor, the better. Waiting can allow the infection to spread and cause more pain and damage.\nPelvic inflammatory disease is caused by different types of bacteria. Many times, it\u2019s caused by bacteria from asexually transmitted infection(STI). The two most common STIs that cause PID are chlamydia and gonorrhea. But PID can be caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina, too. You can get PID if the bacteria move from your vagina into your reproductive organs.\nThere are several ways women can get PID. The most common way is by having sex with a person who has an STI. These diseases are carried in the\u00a0semen\u00a0and other body fluids of infected people. During sexual contact, the germs spread to the woman\u2019s cervix. The germs can also infect the glands at the opening of the vagina, the urethra (passageway for urine), or the anus.\nSometimes PID can occur after the cervix is treated due to an abnormalPap smearor after the insertion of anintrauterine\u00a0device(IUD). However, that\u2019s uncommon. Rarely, PID can occur as a result of giving birth or having a miscarriage, abortion, or procedure to take a sample from the inside of the womb for laboratory testing.\nAdditionally, the same things that put you at risk for STIs also put you at risk for PID. Your risk for PID is higher if you:\nThere is no single test for PID. Your doctor will diagnose the condition based on your medical history, your symptoms, and a pelvic exam. This exam can help him or her tell if any of your reproductive organs are tender. Your doctor may swab the area for a sample and have the sample tested for STIs. He or she may test for a urinary tract infection or other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. He or she might also do imaging tests, such asultrasound. This uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It can help your doctor look for signs of PID.\nMany cases of pelvic inflammatory disease can be prevented in the same way that STIs are prevented. The only way to avoid an STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.\nIf you\u2019re sexually active, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:\nPelvic inflammatory disease can be treated, especially if it\u2019s diagnosed early. It can usually be cured with antibiotics. It\u2019s very important that you take all of your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to, even if your symptoms go away. If you don\u2019t take all the medicine, your symptoms may get worse. A few days after you start taking the medicine, your doctor may want to see you again for a checkup.\nThe sooner your PID is treated, the better. The longer PID is left untreated, the more damage it can cause, and the more likely there will be complications.\nHospitalization may be recommended if you\u2019re very sick with PID. It may also be needed if you\u2019re pregnant, are under the age of 18, or have HIV.\nIf you\u2019re treated for pelvic inflammatory disease, especially if it\u2019s caused by an STI, your partner must also be treated. Unless your partner is treated, you may be infected again. Making good choices about sexual contact is important. If you think you might have PID, talk to your family doctor right away.\nEarly and complete treatment can help prevent complications of pelvic inflammatory disease. However, if PID isn\u2019t treated, it can cause permanent damage to your internal organs. Scar\u00a0tissue\u00a0can form in the fallopian tubes and around the abdomen. This tissue can prevent pregnancy. It can also cause the pregnancy to form outside the uterus. This is called a tubal orectopic pregnancy. Scarring can cause pain that lasts for months or even years. Occasionally, the effects of PID can be so severe that surgery is required to remove pus, get rid of scar tissue, or remove damaged organs.\nPID is more likely to come back if you\u2019re exposed to STIs again.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nPerimenopause is a stage in a woman\u2019s reproductive years. It\u2019s a sign that a woman is getting closer to menopause. Menopause is the time in a woman\u2019s life when she stops having periods and can no longer become pregnant. Perimenopause generally starts in a woman\u2019s 40s and commonly lasts several years. However, it can vary for every woman. It\u2019s important to remember that a woman can still become pregnant during perimenopause. Birth control would still be important to use during this phase of your life if you want to prevent a pregnancy.\nThere are many symptoms a woman will not see during perimenopause. For example, estrogen (the female hormone) will fluctuate. And a woman\u2019s ovaries will slowly stop releasing eggs (meaning you are not ovulating). Other symptoms that youwillnotice include some that are similar to menopause, including:\nWhile irregular periods are normal during perimenopause, talk to your doctor if your period is extremely heavy (you are changing pads or tampons every couple of hours). Also, talk to your doctor if your bleeding lasts longer than seven days, if you bleed between periods, or if you are getting your periods less than 21 days apart.\nPerimenopause is a natural part of aging for women. However, other factors can cause it to start earlier than normal. Those factors include:\nYour doctor will talk to you about your symptoms. They will consider your age, your family history, and your menstrual history to determine if you are experiencing perimenopause. A blood test can check your hormone levels. However, your doctor may not order this unless your symptoms are occurring at an unusually young age.\nIt cannot be prevented or avoided. However, not smoking can delay an early onset.\nPerimenopause is often treated with prescription hormone medicine or nothing at all. Hormones treat the symptoms of perimenopause. They are offered in pill form, as a cream, or a skin patch. Your doctor will typically start you on the lowest possible dosage. This approach is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It is a risk factor for certain types of female cancers. Certain over-the-counter vaginal products can relieve dryness. Water-based vaginal dryness products are best. Certain prescription medicines can treat urinary incontinence (leaking). Talk to your doctor if you are having significant mood changes. They may treat it with prescription antidepressant medicine.\nSome common healthy practices can help with symptoms. This includes eating healthy foods, exercising, getting enough sleep, reducing your alcohol consumption, and practicing relaxation exercises.\nLiving with perimenopause can be frustrating at times. Many of the symptoms appear without warning, including hot flashes, mood changes, and sleep disturbances. Irregular periods or periods with a heavier flow can be a difficult adjustment. And if you are trying to prevent a pregnancy, you have to be absolutely certain you have reached menopause before giving up birth control.

    "article_title": "What is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and claudication?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a problem with blood flow in the arteries, especially those in the legs. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the muscles and organs throughout your body. When you have diseased arteries, they become narrow or blocked. If you have PAD, your arms, and more commonly your legs, don\u2019t get enough blood flow. The most common complaint of people who have PAD is claudication.\nClaudication is pain in the calf, thigh, or hip muscle that occurs after you have walked a certain distance, such as a block or more. The pain stops after you rest for a while. Each time the pain occurs, it takes about the same amount of time for the pain to go away after you stop walking.\nPAD can cause the artery that normally supplies blood to the muscle to narrow. When that happens, less blood can flow through the artery. When you\u2019re resting, enough blood flows to the muscle to meet the needs of the muscle. However, when you walk, the working muscle needs more blood. The narrowed artery may not let enough blood through.\nMany times, you will have no symptoms of PAD or your symptoms will be mild. Claudication is the most common symptom. Other symptoms may include:\nPeople with leg pain might think it\u2019s from aging, arthritis, or a diabetes-related symptom. PAD can be dangerous if it\u2019s not treated. If you notice pain in your legs while walking, ask your doctor about claudication and PAD.\nThe most common cause of narrow or blocked arteries is the buildup of fatty deposits inside them. This is called atherosclerosis. Claudication occurs because not enough blood is flowing to a muscle you are actively using.\nYour doctor may suspect that your arteries have narrowed and will check the pulses in arteries in your legs and feet. Your doctor will listen to the blood flow with a stethoscope or a small Doppler device. Your doctor may hear a noise, called a bruit, which can be a warning that there is a narrowed area in the artery. Blood pressure in your ankles can also be compared to blood pressure in your arms. This test is called an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. Your doctor may do some other tests to look into possible PAD. They may also do tests to see if arteries in other parts of your body have atherosclerosis.\nIf surgery might help treat the symptoms of claudication, your doctor may recommend an arteriogram. This is an X-ray taken after dye is injected into an artery. The dye study may show narrowing in an artery and provides a \u201cmap\u201d for the doctor who will do the surgery.\nRisk factors for PAD and claudication include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, and older age. Claudication is also more likely in people who already have atherosclerosis in other arteries, such as the arteries in the heart or brain. People who have claudication may have already had heart attacks or strokes.\nPAD and claudication treatment\nPAD and claudication are often treated with diet and exercise, and sometimes medicine. People who have PAD or claudication should not smoke. It is important to bring down high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar levels.\nA walking program is very helpful. You should walk at least 4 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes each time. Walk until the pain is too uncomfortable to continue. Stop and rest until the pain goes away. Then start walking again. If you start a new exercise program, such as walking or stair climbing, begin by exercising slowly and gradually increase the time you spend exercising. You may see improvement in your symptoms within 2 months.\nMedicine can help some people who have PAD and claudication. Ask your doctor if medicine is right for you.\nIf your arteries are badly blocked, you may need a procedure called angioplasty to open them up. During an angioplasty, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into the artery. A small balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated. This helps to open up the artery. The balloon is then deflated and removed. Sometimes a device called a stent (a small wire mesh tube) will be left in the artery. The stent will help hold the artery open. Angioplasty is normally done while you are awake.\nIf the narrow area of the artery is very long, you may need to have bypass surgery. For the surgery, your doctor will take a vein from another part of your body. The vein will be attached above and below the narrowed part of the artery. This lets the blood flow around the narrowed area. Sometimes a synthetic (manmade) graft is used instead of a vein.\nIf you believe you could have PAD, it is important that you talk to you doctor right away. Being diagnosed with PAD indicates that you are also at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. Treatment and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can improve PAD symptoms. They can also decrease your likelihood for heart attack or stroke.\nAmerican Heart Association: About Peripheral Artery Disease\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Peripheral Artery Disease\nLast Updated:February 29, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The tonsils are the oval-shaped areas of pink tissue on each side at the back of your throat.\nThe symptoms of a peritonsillar abscess include:\nCall your doctor right away if you have trouble breathing, swallowing, talking, or if you start to drool. These are symptoms of a more serious abscess and need immediate medical attention.\nPeritonsillar abscesses are caused by an infection. Most are a complication oftonsillitis(an infection of the tonsils). They also can be caused bymononucleosis(also called mono), tooth and gum infections. People who smoke are more likely to get a peritonsillar abscess.\nYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and examine the back of your throat. He or she will look for swelling on one side and on the roof of your mouth. The uvula (which hangs at the back of your throat) may appear to be pushed to one side because of the swelling. Your neck and throat may be red and swollen on one or both sides. Your doctor may swab the back of your throat to collect a bacteria sample.\nYour doctor may order additional tests, including:\nQuickly treating tonsillitis can reduce the chances of getting peritonsillar abscesses.\nYour doctor will need to remove the pus from the abscess. To do this, he or she will numb the skin around the abscess. Your doctor will either remove the pus with a needle or make a small cut in the abscess. Surgery to remove your tonsils (called a tonsillectomy) also is an option. You will probably only need surgery if you have had many tonsil infections or abscesses before.\nYour pain and symptoms should get better after the pus is drained. Your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics to make sure the infection goes away completely. He or she may also give you medicine to help relieve the pain.\nThe worst is over once a peritonsillar abscess is treated. If left untreated, you will be uncomfortable from the symptoms listed above.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nPersistent depressive disorder (PDD) is chronicdepressionthat lasts a long time. A person\u2019s moods are generally affected for at least 2 years (1 year for children and adolescents). Their\u00a0depression\u00a0is usually mild or moderate, rather than severe. Most people who have PDD can\u2019t recall when they first became depressed.\nPDD is a common type of depression. It can begin in childhood or in adulthood. No one knows why. It appears to be more common in women. It used to be called dysthymic disorder or dysthymia.\nThe main symptom of PDD is a sad, low, or dark mood on most days. This lasts for at least 2 years. Children and teens with PDD can feel irritable instead of depressed. Their symptoms last for at least 1 year.\nOther symptoms that happen much of the time include:\nMost people who have PDD may have an episode of major depression at least once in their lives. Older people who have PDD find it difficult to care for themselves. They feel isolated and have medical illnesses\nPeople who have PDD may have periods of normal moods that can last up to 2 months. Family members and friends may not even know that their loved one is depressed. This type of depression is mild. It may be difficult for a person to function at home, school, or work.\nNo one knows what causes PDD. It may be related to some changes in the brain that involve a chemical called\u00a0serotonin. Serotonin helps your brain handle emotions and make judgments. Other medical problems and ongoing life\u00a0stress\u00a0may also play a role.\nYou may be at higher risk of developing PDD if you are a woman. It also tends to run in families. If a family member has it or another type of depression, you could be more likely to get it.\nIf you think you have PDD, discuss your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor will ask you questions to find out if you have depression and what type you have. Your doctor may ask you questions about your health and your symptoms. This may include how well you\u2019re sleeping, if you feel tired a lot, and if you have trouble concentrating. Your doctor will also consider medical reasons that may cause you to feel depressed. These could be problems with your thyroid or a certain medicine you may be taking. Your doctor might order blood or urine tests to check for these or other causes.\nIn general, PDD and other forms of depression are conditions that cannot be prevented. There are lifestyle changes you can make that can boost your mood and minimize symptoms, including:\nPDD can be treated with an antidepressant medicine. This type of medicine helps relieve depression. Antidepressants don\u2019t cause people to feel \u201chigh,\u201d and they are not habit-forming.\nIt may take weeks or months before you and your doctor know whether an antidepressant is helping you. It is important for you to take the medicine exactly as your doctor tells you. If the antidepressant helps you feel better, you may need to take this medicine for several years. You should continue to take the medicine, even if you begin to feel better. Never stop the medicine without first discussing it with your doctor.\nSometimes there are side effects from stopping antidepressant medicine suddenly. If you want to stop taking your medicine, talk to your doctor first.\nShould I see a counselor too?\nSome patients find that counseling can help them deal with specific problems. It\u2019s a safe place where you can talk about your thoughts and feelings. Many doctors believe that combining talk therapy with medicine is the most effective way to treat PDD and other types of depression.\nPDD is a chronic condition. It can last for many years. If you have PDD, there are things you can do to help yourself feel better. Talk to your doctor about how you\u2019re feeling. Get treatment for your PDD. It may help to find activities that make you feel good or help you feel a sense of accomplishment.\nComplications\nPeople with PDD sometimes experience episodes of major depression. This can make them think about suicide. If you have thoughts about hurting yourself or others, tell someone right away. You can tell your doctor, your family, or a friend. You can also call a suicide hotline. There may be a local number you can call. Or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.\nGet help right away.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nPeyronie\u2019s disease is the buildup of fibrous scar\u00a0tissue\u00a0in the penis, causing it to curve. The curve can be slight to severe. A severe curve can cause erections to be painful or erections that aren\u2019t hard enough for sex. At its worse, Peyronie\u2019s disease can cause impotence.\nThe primary symptom of Peyronie\u2019s disease is a curved penis. Your penis could be curved up, down, or to either side. While you may not notice it, another symptom is the scar tissue that causes Peyronie\u2019s disease. You can feel this scar tissue just under the skin of your penis. It feels like a ridge or a row of tiny bumps. Another symptom can beerectile dysfunction(difficulty getting or maintaining an erection). You may also notice that the scar tissue is making your penis shorter. Finally, you may have penile pain as a result of Peyronie\u2019s disease. This pain may be in general or it may be only when you have an erection.\nScar tissue under the skin of the penis causes the curve. No one knows for sure why the scar tissue starts. Some men who have Peyronie\u2019s disease have had a penis injury or radiation therapy for prostate cancer that causes scar tissue. Most of the time, though, the cause of the scar tissue isn\u2019t known. The scar tissue can keep getting worse during the first few years, making the penis curve more and more. You might notice this more during an erection. After a few years, the scar tissue usually stops getting worse. Sometimes it even gets better. But in most cases, it doesn\u2019t completely go away.\nYour doctor will most likely perform a physical exam. During the exam, they will inspect and feel your penis, looking for scar tissue. This is usually enough for a\u00a0diagnosis. Sometimes, your doctor will also order an ultrasound to look for scar tissue. If so, you\u2019ll receive an\u00a0injection\u00a0that will make you penis erect before the ultrasound.\nSince doctors aren\u2019t sure what causes the scar tissue related to Peyronie\u2019s Disease, there is no way to prevent it or avoid it. You may be more at risk for the disease if your father or brother has it. This means that it could run in families. It also becomes more common as you get older. You also have a higher chance of developing this disease if you have a\u00a0connective tissue\u00a0disorder.\nThere is no cure for Peyronie\u2019s disease. Your treatment plan will depend on your symptoms. If your penis curvature isn\u2019t severe or painful and isn\u2019t interfering with sex, you may not need treatment.\nYour doctor may prescribe a medicine that can help reduce\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and even curvature. Medicines like aminobenzoate potassium or\u00a0vitamin\u00a0E help some people. Aminobenzoate potassium is a\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicine. Vitamin E is available over the counter. If you take vitamin E, don\u2019t take more than your doctor tells you. Too much vitamin E or aminobenzoate potassium can hurt your\u00a0liver. Aminobenzoate potassium can also make you nauseous or take away your appetite. Other medicines your doctor may prescribe include tamoxifen, colchicine, and pentoxifylline.\nAnother treatment option is an intralesional injection. This means the doctor would give you a shot directly into the scar tissue. The shot may contain these drugs: verapamil, interferon, steroids, or collagenase. These may help break down the scar tissue and allow new tissue to grow. These shots are usually given over 3 months.\nDiscuss treatment options with your doctor. They can recommend the best treatment for your situation. However, not all treatments are guaranteed to work, and some may make the scaring worse.\nSurgery might help individuals who have pain during erection or who can\u2019t keep an erection long enough to have sex. There are several surgical procedures that can help. One option is to have a\u00a0prosthesis\u00a0(something to make the penis firm) put in the penis. The prosthesis helps make the penis straighter. It also helps erections last longer. Another option is to have the scar tissue removed from the penis. Your doctor can explain all surgical options and can help you decide which is best for you.\nHaving Peyronie\u2019s disease can impact your sex life and, as a result, your relationship with your partner. It can make you anxious, even irritable. You may not want to talk about it. This can create barriers in your relationship. Instead, try to be open with your partner. It may be helpful to consult with a doctor or therapist who can help initiate open communication between you and your partner.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Curvature of the penisNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Penile Curvature (Peyronie\u2019s Disease)\nLast Updated:June 7, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is\u00a0phenylketonuria (PKU)?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDaron Gersch, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic condition where babies are born unable to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This causes phenylalanine to build up. When phenylalanine levels get too high, it can damage the brain. This can lead to intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nPhenylalanine is found in foods that contain protein. PKU is manageable, mostly through your diet. The key to living with PKU successfully is finding it early. That\u2019s why all babies in the United States are screened for the disease at birth.\nNewborns don\u2019t initially have symptoms. But within a few months of birth, depending on the severity of the disease, symptoms begin to show. These include:\nIf PKU isn\u2019t controlled through changes in diet, it can cause severe and permanent intellectual and developmental disability.\nPKU is an inherited disease. This means it\u2019s passed down to the baby through the genes of the mother and father. It\u2019s caused by mutations in the gene that helps make an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme helps break down phenylalanine. When this gene doesn\u2019t work right, the body can\u2019t break down phenylalanine. It starts to build up and causes damage to nerve cells in the brain.\nIn the United States, you\u2019re at higher risk of having PKU if you\u2019re of European or Native American descent.\nAll newborn babies born in the United States are routinely tested for a range of diseases and conditions. One of the tests is a blood test that looks for the presence of phenylalanine hydroxylase. If that enzyme is missing, or if there is too much phenylalanine in the blood, more blood and urine tests will be done. These can confirm the diagnosis of PKU.\nNearly all cases of PKU are diagnosed through this newborn blood test.\nRarely, PKU could be missed during the screening process. For this reason, people of any age who have developmental delays or an intellectual disability are often tested for PKU.\nPKU can also be diagnosed before the baby is born. A pregnant woman can requestgenetic testingbe done to see if her unborn baby will have the disease. This is done through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. This testing can be useful if the parents already have one child with PKU. Their chances of having another child with the condition are higher than average.\nBecause PKU is a genetic condition, it can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. Genetic testing is the only way to determine if people carry the defective gene. Some people may carry the gene but not have PKU. These people are called carriers. Both parents must carry one copy of the abnormal gene for the disease to be passed to the baby.\nThere is no cure for PKU. The most important treatment is a diet that limits foods with phenylalanine. This means the diet must be low in protein.\nNewborns diagnosed with the disease must use special infant formula. This can be mixed with small amounts of breast milk or regular formula. It\u2019s a delicate balance. Your baby does need some phenylalanine for normal development. But too much can hurt.\nChildren and adults who have PKU will also need to follow a low-phenylalanine diet. Phenylalanine is found in most protein foods. This includes all meats and fish, milk, cheese, eggs, nuts, soy, and beans. It\u2019s also found in some non-protein foods. These include certain vegetables and fruit, certain breads, and beer. The sweetener aspartame, which releases phenylalanine when it\u2019s digested, must also be avoided.\nIf you have PKU, you must follow a strict low-Phenylalanine diet both before becoming pregnant and during the pregnancy. Buildup of\u00a0phenylalanine will damage your developing fetus, even if the baby hasn\u2019t inherited the defective gene.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the medicine sapropterin dihydrochloride (brand name: Kuvan) for the treatment of PKU. Kuvan can help the body break down phenylalanine. However, the medicine only helps some people. Even for those it does help, it doesn\u2019t decrease enough phenylalanine. Those taking the medicine must still follow a low-phenylalanine diet.\nBecause the PKU diet is so limiting, it\u2019s hard to get all the essential nutrients the body needs. A special daily formula can help ensure those with PKU get proper nutrition. Taking supplements may also be necessary. For example, fish oil can replace some of the fatty acids (the basic building blocks of lipids, or fats) missing from the standard PKU diet. Those fatty acids can help improve neurological development.\nEach person with PKU has a different level of phenylalanine they can tolerate. If you have PKU, you must work closely with your doctor to develop your individual diet. You need to eat enough phenylalanine for healthy growth and development. However, you can\u2019t eat so much that it will be harmful to your health. Going to the doctor often, and getting regular blood tests, helps keep everything in check.\nThe PKU diet is very restrictive. But it must be followed. Babies who start the diet soon after birth usually develop normally. Many show no symptoms of PKU. Those people who stay on the diet throughout their lives have better overall physical and mental health than those with PKU who don\u2019t. Support from friends and family or a PKU support group can be helpful when facing the challenges that come with this diet.\nLast Updated:December 11, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nPica is a compulsiveeating disorderin which people eat nonfood items. Dirt, clay, and flaking paint are the most common items eaten. Less common items include glue, hair, cigarette ashes, and feces. The disorder is more common in children, affecting 10% to 30% of young children ages 1 to 6. It can also occur in children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. On rare occasions, pregnant women crave strange, nonfood items. For these women, pica often involves eating dirt and may be related to an iron and zinc deficiency.\nPica symptoms are related to the nonfood item the person has eaten. They include:\nThese symptoms are the result of the toxic, poisonous, and bacterial content of the nonfood items. Repeatedly eating nonfood items over a period of time can cause:\nMany typical children chew on things such as their nails and ice, or they mouth their toys and hair. These are normal habits. However, a person diagnosed with pica repeatedly eats nonfood items, even if those items make them sick. Those people should see a doctor.\nTreatment for pica will address several areas. Your doctor will address your child\u2019s illness from having eaten nonfood items. For example, your doctor will treat your child\u2019s constipation, diarrhea, ulcer, intestinal tear, infection, or any combination of illnesses. If your doctor finds your child doesn\u2019t have enough iron or zinc, they will address that with a vitamin supplement and dietary recommendations.\nFinding the underlying cause of your child\u2019s pica diagnosis is another part of treatment. Your doctor will discuss your child\u2019s home environment, educate you as a parent, and refer your child to a behavioral or mental health specialist.\nPica cannot be prevented. Proper nutrition may help some children keep from developing it. If you pay close attention to eating habits and supervise children who tend to put things into their mouths, you may be able to catch the disorder early, before complications can happen. If your child has been diagnosed with pica, you can reduce their risk of eating nonfood items by keeping those items out of reach in your home. Be sure to monitor your child\u2019s outside play, as well.\nMost children outgrow pica as they get older. It usually goes away in a few months.

It also can occur in the shoulder, ankle, elbow, hand or foot.\nWhen you have PVNS, the lining of a joint becomes swollen and grows. This growth harms the bone around the joint. The lining also makes extra fluid that can cause swelling and make movement very painful.\nPVNS isn\u2019t common. It can affect anyone, but it is most common in people 20 to 45 years old. It may happen slightly more often in men.\nIf you have PVNS, you\u2019ll notice swelling and stiffness in a joint, most often your knee. The joint may hurt. You may have a \u201cpopping\u201d feeling when you move the joint. The symptoms usually appear gradually and may come and go over time.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes PVNS.

Your doctor may use tests to check for these conditions. After a physical exam, your doctor may want to take an X-ray of the affected joint.\nYour doctor may also want to take some fluid from the joint and test it. He or she may also want to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which takes a picture of the joint.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes PVNS, so it currently cannot be prevented or avoided.\nThe best way to treat PVNS is to remove the lining of the joint. This can be done with traditional surgery or with arthroscopy. In arthroscopy, the doctor makes a tiny cut in the skin over your joint. Then a thin tube is put into the joint to remove the lining.\nYou can ease the pressure on the affected joint by resting it. For example, you might use crutches to keep weight off your sore knee or hip. Or you might need to stay off your feet. This may also relieve swelling. You can take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine such as ibuprofen (some brands: Advil, Motrin), aspirin and naproxen (one brand: Aleve) to ease the pain and swelling.\nEven with treatment, PVNS comes back about half the time. If the pain comes back again and again, radiation therapy may help. Sometimes, the only real remedy comes by completely replacing the joint.\nLast Updated:September 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Your child may also move around a lot in bed at night or not be able to sleep. That\u2019s because your child it itchy. The itching is caused by the female pinworm that comes out of the rectum to lay eggs around the anus (the opening to the rectum). The eggs stay in the upper part of the intestine until they hatch. After they hatch, the worms move down the length of the intestine, and then out the anus where they lay more eggs.\nYou also may be able to see the tiny, white worms (shorter than 1/2 inch in length) on your child\u2019s bottom at night. Or the worms may show up in your child\u2019s stools.\nPinworms are contagious and easily spread, usually from child to child. Pinworm eggs can be picked up on children\u2019s fingers when they\u2019re playing. When children who are infected scratch their itchy bottoms, the tiny eggs can get under their fingernails. Eggs can stay on your child\u2019s skin for several hours. They can survive for up to 3 weeks on clothes, bedding, and toys. If the eggs are on your child\u2019s hands or toys and they put their fingers or toys in their mouth, the tiny eggs can enter their bodies. Children who don\u2019t wash their hands thoroughly before eating and children who suck their thumbs are at an increased risk.\nAlthough pinworm infection is morecommon in school-aged children, anyone can get it. As children who are infected move around the house, the eggs may be spread, and other family members can become infected. Sometimes adults breathe in the eggs when the bed covers are shaken. However, this isn\u2019t very common.\nPets don\u2019t spread pinworms, although they may carry their own kinds of worms.\nBecause pinworms usually crawl out of the anus while a child sleeps, the tape test is an easy way to find pinworms. It\u2019s best to do this right when your child wakes up and before they use the bathroom or take a bath. To do the tape test, pat a piece of clear tape on the skin around the anus. Do this for three mornings in a row and save the tape from each morning. Then take the tape to your doctor, who can use a microscope to check for pinworms or eggs. It\u2019s also possible to see the adult worms around the anus during the tape test.\nThere are ways to prevent or avoid getting pinworm infection\u2014and reinfections. Follow these tips:\nMost pinworm infections are mild and easily treated. Your doctor may prescribe a single chewable tablet of a medicine called mebendazole. A second tablet is taken about 3 weeks later if the infection isn\u2019t cured. Or your doctor may recommend another kind of medicine called pyrantel, which is taken as a single dose.\nEven if only one child in your family has pinworms, it\u2019s often important that everyone in the household be treated with the pinworm medicine at the same time.\nPinworm infection is very contagious. If you don\u2019t take precautions, it\u2019s easy to become reinfected. If anyone in your home has pinworms, take these steps to get rid of the pinworm eggs. Doing so will minimize your chances of reinfection.\nCenters for Disease Control & Prevention: Pinworm Infection\nLast Updated:December 11, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed bySarah Coles, MD\nYour piriformis muscle runs from your lower spine to the top of your thigh bone. Piriformis syndrome occurs when this muscle presses on your sciatic nerve (the nerve that goes from your spinal cord to your buttocks and down the back of each leg). This can cause pain and numbness in your lower body.\nThe most common symptom of piriformis syndrome is sciatica. This term describes pain, tingling, or numbness that starts in your buttocks and runs down the back of your leg. Sciatica may start as an intense, burning pain deep in the buttocks. The pain gets worse during activities that cause the piriformis muscle to press against the sciatic nerve, such as sitting, climbing stairs, or running.\nTalk to your doctor if any of the following are true:\nYou can develop piriformis syndrome from everyday activities, such as long periods of inactivity or sitting for long periods of time, climbing stairs, walking, or running. You can also develop it after a traumatic event, such as a car accident or a fall. Abnormal anatomy at birth can also be the cause.\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam. They will move the affected leg into several different positions to check your pain level.\nIf your doctor thinks something other than piriformis syndrome is causing your sciatica, they may order additional tests. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can\u2019t diagnose piriformis syndrome. However, they may show your doctor if something else is pressing on your sciatic nerve.\nOnce your symptoms improve, you may need to change your activities to avoid developing piriformis syndrome again. The following are some tips to help prevent piriformis syndrome:\nMost people who have piriformis syndrome get better with treatment and lifestyle changes. Failure to treat this condition can lead to permanent nerve damage, so be sure to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions.\nSelf-care tips for piriformis syndrome include the following:\nYou may find that piriformis syndrome comes and goes, depending on your activity level.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nHypopituitarismis a disorder in which your body doesn\u2019t make enough hormones from thepituitary gland. The\u00a0pituitary gland\u00a0is a small, bean-shaped\u00a0gland\u00a0at the base of your brain. It plays a role in controlling your body\u2019s endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands that produce and secrete hormones to regulate your body\u2019s processes.\nIn hypopituitarism, the pituitary gland fails to produce or doesn\u2019t produce enough of one or more of its hormones. When your pituitary gland doesn\u2019t produce enough hormones, your body functions are affected.\nThe pituitary gland is responsible for releasing:\nIt\u2019s possible for the symptoms of hypopituitarism to appear suddenly. But it\u2019s much more common for them to develop over time. Because of this, they\u2019re often overlooked for months or years.\nPossible symptoms include:\nMen may also experience:\nWomen may also experience:\nChildren may also experience:\nYou should see a doctor immediately if certain symptoms of hypopituitarism develop suddenly. These include:\nSudden onset of these symptoms could be a sign of sudden bleeding into the pituitary. This is called pituitary apoplexy, which is a serious condition.\nHypopituitarism is commonly caused by a\u00a0tumor\u00a0in the pituitary gland. A tumor can squeeze the pituitary gland as it grows, which can cause damage. A pituitary tumor can also put pressure on the optic nerves in the eyes and cause visual problems.\nOther causes of hypopituitarism are:\nHypopituitarism can also be caused by diseases of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain located just above the pituitary gland. It\u2019s responsible for producing hormones that help the pituitary gland function normally.\nIn other cases, the cause of hypopituitarism may be unknown.\nIf you have symptoms of hypopituitarism, your doctor may order blood tests to check your hormone levels. Or you doctor may want to check for pituitary tumors or defects. This is done using a computerized tomography (CT) scan or for more detail and smaller concerns, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain. Your doctor may do several\u00a0vision\u00a0tests to see if your sight is being affected. In children, X-rays can measure whether bones are growing normally.\nYour doctor may also want you to see an endocrinologist. This is a doctor who studies the endocrine system. You may need to go to a special endocrine clinic for other tests.\nIn most cases, you can\u2019t prevent this disorder. Some medicines can suppress pituitary function. This can cause hypopituitarism. Ask your doctor about these risks if you\u2019re taking glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone).\nYour doctor will treat the condition that\u2019s causing your hypopituitarism first. This can help restore your pituitary gland\u2019s ability to produce hormones.\nIf a tumor on your pituitary gland is causing your hypopituitarism, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove it. Or they may recommend radiation therapy to shrink it.\nSometimes, even after treatment, your body doesn\u2019t produce enough of one or more pituitary hormones. In these cases, your doctor may prescribe a hormone replacement medicine to add to your body\u2019s hormone production.\nHormone replacement medicines include:\nIf you\u2019re taking hormone replacement medicine, your doctor may want to regularly monitor your hormone level. Doing so will make sure you\u2019re getting the right amount of replacement hormones.\nIf you become very sick (such as with the flu) or go through a stressful time, your doctor may adjust the dose of replacement hormone you take (just as a normally functioning pituitary gland would do). You might also need a dose adjustment if you become pregnant or have a significant change in weight.\nYou should carry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. This way, emergency medical workers know what kind of care you need in case of emergency.\nManaging hypopituitarism using hormone replacement therapy is often successful. Just remember that you\u2019ll need to check in regularly with your doctor to monitor hormone levels.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Hypopituitarism\nLast Updated:August 10, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nPlagiocephaly is a condition where your baby\u2019s head has a flat spot or is misshapen. There are various levels of severity and can occur during pregnancy or after birth.\nThere are two main types of plagiocephaly. Positional plagiocephaly, or \u201cflat head syndrome,\u201d is more common. It occurs in about 50% of children. Congenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, is a rare birth defect.\nDoctors diagnose plagiocephaly in babies. Signs of the condition vary based on type and level of severity. Your doctor can help identify your baby\u2019s symptoms, which include:\nSerious symptoms include:\nPositional plagiocephaly can occur one of two ways. It has become more widespread since the mid-1990s when the National Institutes of Health launched the Back to Sleep campaign. Now known as Safe to Sleep\u00ae, the campaign\u2019s goal is to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The main guideline is for babies to be on their back when sleeping. Sleeping or lying in the same position can produce a flat spot. Premature babies, who have softer skulls, or infants who are hospitalized for a prolonged time are more vulnerable. While placing your baby on their back may lead to plagiocephaly, it is still the safest position to place them in for sleep.\nBabies also can be born with a flattened head due to pressure in the womb. This is more common in multiple births.\nCongenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, is a birth defect. When your baby is born, the seams (sutures) on their head should be open and soft. This allows their skull to continue growing and reshaping in their first few years. With craniosynostosis, one or more of the seams close early, affecting the shape of your baby\u2019s head.\nA newborn baby\u2019s skull is naturally soft and will continue to grow and reshape over time. As parents, you will be able to identify if your baby\u2019s head is not growing or appears misshaped by regularly monitoring it. Your doctor also will measure your child\u2019s head at their routine checkups.\nDoctors recommend observing your baby\u2019s head by looking directly down on it from above. If you detect a persistent flat area on your baby\u2019s head, you can monitor the spot by taking photos. Contact your doctor if the spot shows no change or worsens.\nTests are not required to diagnose flat head syndrome. If your doctor suspects possible congenital plagiocephaly, they may order additional tests, such as an X-ray.\nThere are things you can do to help prevent your baby from developing a flat head. Alternate your baby\u2019s head position during sleep and have supervised tummy time when your baby is awake. You also can use a special mattress or pillow that puts less pressure on your baby\u2019s head.\nThe cause of craniosynostosis is mostly unknown, and therefore is difficult to prevent. Recent studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report potential factors that can lead to craniosynostosis. These include thyroid disease, use of clomiphene citrate (a fertility medication), or certain genetic syndromes.\nBased on the type and level of your baby\u2019s condition, doctors may recommend one or more treatment options. You should begin treatment at a young age, between 3 and 18 months, while the skull is still forming.\nRepositioning is a practice that teaches you how to regularly alternate your baby\u2019s head position. This can prevent or help correct flat head syndrome. Suggestions for this method include:\nAnother option is \u201chelmet therapy.\u201d Your baby will wear a medical helmet for several months to reshape their skull. The success rate for this form of treatment is high.\nBabies who have congenital plagiocephaly, or craniosynostosis, often require surgery. This allows the plates on their head to grow and reshape, and also eases pressure on their brain. Typically, this type of surgery occurs prior to age 1. Use of a medical helmet may also be necessary. Additional medical treatments may be required if craniosynostosis is part of a genetic syndrome with other conditions.\nBabies who have flat head syndrome have a high chance of living a normal life. They can grow out of it naturally or correct it with therapy. It is unlikely to cause issues with their brain growth or function.\nHowever, if plagiocephaly is left untreated, children are at risk of developmental, neurological, or psychological difficulties.\nChildren who grow up with severe plagiocephaly, like craniosynostosis, will likely require healthcare observation to manage ongoing or new problems. They also may benefit from counseling if they experience self-esteem issues.\nThe National Association for Plagiocephaly\nLast Updated:August 18, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nPlantar fasciitis is an inflammatory condition. It occurs in the plantar fascia, which is a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot. The plantar fascia works like a rubber band. It forms the arch of your foot and connects your heel to your toes. If the band is short, you have a high arch. If the band is long, you have a low, or flat, arch. A pad of fat covers the tissue and helps your heels to absorb shock put on your feet. Damage to the plantar fascia can cause heel swelling and pain.\nPain and swelling are the main symptoms of plantar fasciitis. Pain may be worse in the morning or when you put pressure on your heel. It may be dull or sharp, depending on the time of day and what you\u2019re doing.\nAs you age, the plantar fascia becomes less like a rubber band and more like a rope that doesn\u2019t stretch as well. The fat pad on your heel becomes thinner and can\u2019t absorb as much shock. The extra shock can damage the plantar fascia and may cause it to swell, bruise, or tear. Most people also have pain to some degree.\nRepeated impact on the heel, like from running, walking, or standing, also can cause plantar fasciitis. Existing foot arch problems \u2013 such as flat feet and high arches \u2013 can also cause plantar fasciitis.\nYour doctor will examine your foot and review your symptoms. They will want to know about your pain, when it occurs, and how long you\u2019ve had it. Your doctor may order tests to make sure the pain is not caused by another problem. These tests could include an X-ray ormagnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nYou cannot prevent plantar fasciitis if aging is the cause. However, there are risk factors that can increase your chance of getting it. You may be able to avoid one or more of these. Risks include:\nIn most cases, your doctor will start with basic treatments that can be done at home. These may vary depending on the cause of your pain.\nStretching exercises for your feet and legs are important. Do the stretches shown here at least twice a day. Do not bounce when you stretch.\nStrengthening exercises are important as well. You can strengthen your leg muscles by standing on the ball of your foot at the edge of a step and rising up onto your toes as high as possible. Relax between toe raises and let your heel fall a little lower than the edge of the step. You can strengthen your foot muscles by grabbing a towel with your toes as if you are going to pick it up with your foot. Repeat these exercises several times a day.\nMedicines, such as naproxen and ibuprofen, can help reduce swelling and pain. Talk to your family doctor before you start a new medicine.\nMost cases of plantar fasciitis go away over time. For best results, try to be consistent in your treatment approaches.

They may fill up with fluid or pus. This causes a variety of symptoms, which range from mild to severe. Pneumonia is usually caused by bacteria or a virus. It also can be caused by fungi or irritants that you breathe into your lungs. How serious pneumonia is depends on many factors. These include what caused the pneumonia, your age, and your overall health.\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe. This depends on your risk factors and the type of pneumonia you have. Common symptoms are similar to the symptoms caused by a cold or the flu. They include:\nYou may also sweat, have a headache, and feel very tired. Some people also experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nIf any of these symptoms are severe, call your family doctor. You should also call your doctor if you suddenly start getting worse after having a cold or the flu.\nMost cases of pneumonia are caused by:\nYou can also get pneumonia through aspiration. This is when you inhale particles into your lungs. These could be food, saliva, liquids, or vomit. It occurs most often after vomiting, and you are not strong enough to cough the particles out. The particles cause irritation, swelling and can get infected. This causes pneumonia.\nPneumonia can sometimes be hard to diagnose because the symptoms are the same as for a bad cold or flu. If you think it could be pneumonia, you should see your doctor. Your doctor may diagnose your illness based on your medical history and the results from a physical exam. He or she will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Your doctor may also do some tests, such as a chest X-ray or a blood test. A chest X-ray can show your doctor if you have pneumonia and how widespread the infection is.

But they can make it less likely that people who are at risk will experience the severe, and possibly life-threatening, complications of pneumonia.\nTreatment depends on several factors. These include what caused your pneumonia, how severe your symptoms are, how healthy you are overall, and your age.\nFor bacterial pneumonia, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics. Most of your symptoms should improve within a few days. A cough can last for several weeks. Be sure to follow your doctor\u2019s directions carefully. Take all the antibiotic medicine that your doctor prescribes. If you don\u2019t, some bacteria may stay in your body. This can cause your pneumonia to come back. It can also increase your risk of antibiotic resistance.\nAntibiotics don\u2019t work to treat viral infections. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor will likely talk to you about ways to treat your symptoms. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are available to lower fever, relieve pain, and ease your cough. However, some coughing is okay because it can help clear your lungs. Be sure to talk to your doctor before you take a cough suppressant.\nIf a fungus is causing your pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antifungal medicine.\nIn severe cases of pneumonia, you may need to be hospitalized. If you are experiencing shortness of breath, you may be given oxygen to help your breathing. You might also receive antibiotics intravenously (through an IV). People who have weakened immune systems, heart disease or lung conditions, and people who were already very sick before developing pneumonia are most likely to be hospitalized. Babies, young children, and adults who are 65 years of age and older are also at increased risk.\nIn addition to taking any antibiotics and/or medicine your doctor prescribes, you should also:\nYour doctor may schedule a follow-up appointment after he or she diagnoses you with pneumonia. At this visit, he or she might take another chest X-ray to make sure the pneumonia infection is clearing up. Keep in mind that chest X-rays can take months to return to normal. However, if your symptoms are not improving, your doctor may decide to try another form of treatment.\nAlthough you may be feeling better, it\u2019s important to keep your follow-up appointment. The infection can still be in your lungs even if you\u2019re no longer experiencing symptoms.\nPneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially for certain at-risk people. You should call your doctor if you have a cough that won\u2019t go away, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever. You should also call your doctor if you suddenly begin to feel worse after having a cold or the flu.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Pneumonia\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pneumonia\nLast Updated:November 22, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Keep reading to learn the best poison ivy rash treatment and prevention strategies to help you recover quickly and avoid future outbreaks.\nPoison ivy is a type of\u00a0toxic\u00a0plant. It is very common in most parts of the United States. Poison ivy often grows low to the ground, resembling a weed or shrub. It also can grow taller as a vine, along plants, trees, or poles. Both forms have stems with 3 leaves. The leaves change color with the seasons. They may produce whitish flowers or berries.\nThe main symptom of poison ivy is arash. This is otherwise known as contact\u00a0dermatitis. The rash can be mild or severe. It may appear right away or 1 to 2 days after contact. It is marked by redness and swelling. Small blisters may form and become itchy or painful. Try not to scratch the blisters. Bacteria from under your fingernails can get into the blisters and cause an\u00a0infection.\nPoison ivy contains an oil called urushiol. Most people are allergic to it. This oil sticks to your skin when you come into contact with it. You can get the oil on your skin by:\nA doctor can\u00a0diagnose\u00a0a poison ivy rash by reviewing your symptoms.

But you can spread poison ivy to another person if they touch the oil on you or your clothing.\nWash your skin right away if you come into contact with poison ivy or another toxic plant. Its oil can bond to your skin within minutes. Use soap and cool water. This can help remove the oil or prevent the oil from spreading. Products that contain certain cleansers, such as mineral oil, may help.\nSome over-the-counter medicines help relieve rash symptoms, such as pain and itching. These include:\nOatmeal baths and wet compresses can help reduce symptoms as well.\nMost cases of poison ivy go away on their own in 1 to 3 weeks.

Many different types of poison exist. Poisonous substances can be products you have in your house. Medicines that aren\u2019t taken as directed can be harmful. There are several ways you can be exposed to poison. You could breathe it in, swallow it, or absorb it through your skin. Poisoning can be an accident or a planned action.\nThe effects of poisoning depend on the substance, amount, and type of contact. Your age, weight, and state of health also affect your symptoms.\nPossible symptoms of poisoning include:\nThere are a number of substances that are harmful and can cause poisoning. These include:\nYour doctor can diagnose poisoning. First, they will review your medical history and do a physical exam. Your doctor also can perform tests to find the cause. Most poisons can be detected in your blood or urine. Your doctor may order a toxicology screen. This checks for common drugs using a urine or saliva sample.\nThe best way to prevent poisoning is to avoid contact with harmful substances. Below are some guidelines you should follow.\nTreatment depends on the person and the type of poisoning. In this situation, try your best to stay calm. The first step is to get away from or remove the poison if you can. If the poison is in the air, move to a safe place with fresh air. If the poison is on the skin, rinse it off with water and remove nearby clothing. If the person swallowed the poison, do not try to induce vomiting. This approach is no longer recommended.\nIf the poisoned person is awake and alert, call the poison control center at1-800-222-1222. You should have this number stored in your house and phone. Stay on the phone with the operator and follow all instructions. Try to have the following information ready:\nCall 911 if the poisoned person is unconscious or not breathing. The medical team will provide additional treatment. They can use methods to get rid of the poison before it causes more harm. Some types of poison have antidotes. These work by reversing the poison\u2019s effects and curing it. Treatment also includes measures to relieve symptoms.\nThe sooner you recognize poisoning symptoms, the better the outcome. However, the lasting effects of poisoning vary. It depends on the substance, amount, and type of exposure. Your age, weight, and state of health also affect your outcome.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disease that affects the kidneys. Inherited means it runs in families and is passed down from parents. It causes abnormal sacs of fluid (called cysts) to grow in the kidneys. If too many cysts grow or if they get too big, the kidneys become damaged. The cysts may also cause pain or get infected.\nPKD is the most common inherited disease in the United States. Children of parents who have PKD have a 50% chance of getting the disease.\nThe most common symptom is high blood pressure. About 60% of people who have PKD also have high blood pressure, which can be treated with medicine. Other symptoms include:\nNot all patients will have all of these symptoms. For many people, PKD is mild and causes only minor problems. For others, PKD is more severe and can cause kidney failure. About 50% of patients who have PKD have kidney failure by age 60. Dialysis (blood filtering) and kidney transplants are both effective treatments for kidney failure.\nPeople who have PKD may also have cysts in the liver, but these cysts seldom cause problems. Other organs that may be affected include the heart, brain, intestines, pancreas, ovaries, and spleen. PKD can cause problems with heart valves in some people. When PKD affects the brain, it can cause an aneurysm (a bulging blood vessel that can rupture).\nGenes tell your body how to work. When you have PKD, there\u2019s something faulty with your genes, and they don\u2019t tell your body how to work correctly. That leads to the problems with PKD. Genes are passed from a parent to a child. The bad genes that cause PKD can be passed from a parent to a child. That\u2019s how PKD runs in families.\nPKD is generally worse in men, African Americans, and people who have sickle cell disease. There is also a childhood form of PKD, which is usually more severe than the type that occurs in adults.\nPKD is often diagnosed when a person begins to have symptoms or is at risk for the disease.\nYour doctor may want you to have an ultrasound imaging test or a CT (computerized tomography) scan. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your organs. A CT scan uses many X-rays to form pictures of your organs. Both tests are painless and can detect cysts on the kidneys.\nPKD also can be diagnosed in unborn babies using a test called amniocentesis. During this test, doctors take a very small amount of the amniotic fluid from the womb. They test the fluid for PKD. Another test, called chorionic villus sampling, involves testing a very small piece of the placenta. If you have PKD and you\u2019re pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, talk with your doctor about these procedures.\nThere is no way to prevent polycystic kidney disease. There is also no cure. However, you can manage symptoms of PKD through lifestyle changes and medication. Talk to your doctor about how to best manage your symptoms.\nNo treatment is available for the cysts caused by PKD. If the cysts are causing symptoms, the symptoms can be treated to make you more comfortable.\nIf you have PKD, it\u2019s important to get regular checkups and talk with your doctor. Managing PKD is easier when you eat a well-balanced diet, so talk with your doctor about what foods you should and shouldn\u2019t eat. You should also stay physically active.\nIt\u2019s especially important to monitor and control your blood pressure when you have PKD. This can help slow the growth of cysts. It also helps prolong kidney function.\nIf you have PKD and you also have a relative who has had a brain aneurysm, your doctor may suggest that you have a CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of your brain to check for an aneurysm. (MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of your brain.) If you\u2019re at high risk of an aneurysm, your doctor may suggest you have CT or MRI of the brain every few years to detect an aneurysm before it causes problems.\nPKD Foundation\nLast Updated:February 29, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

An imbalance of hormone levels in a woman\u2019s body causes the cysts to form. The cysts are like tiny, fluid-filled balloons.\nWomen can develop PCOS during their teenage or childbearing years. PCOS can cause changes in a woman\u2019s:\nUsually, women who have PCOS have irregular, infrequent, or no menstrual periods. They may also have trouble getting pregnant. Some women who have PCOS do not experience any symptoms.\nOther signs and symptoms of PCOS may include:\nWomen who have PCOS are also more likely to have type 2 diabetes,high blood pressureandhigh cholesterol,\u00a0and high levels of triglycerides. Together with obesity, these conditions are known as the \u201cmetabolic syndrome.\u201d\nDoctors do not know exactly what causes PCOS. If you have PCOS, you have a hormone imbalance. Your ovaries make too much of one type of hormone (called androgens). You may also have too much insulin, which regulates your blood sugar levels. You also may have insulin resistance. These hormone problems cause the symptoms of PCOS.\nPCOS seems to be heredity, meaning that it runs in families. You are more likely to have PCOS if your mother or sister has PCOS.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and will look for the signs of PCOS. They \u00a0will give you a full physical examination, which will most likely include a pelvic exam. Blood tests can measure your hormone levels. An ultrasound exam can show if you have cysts on your ovaries.\nTreatment for PCOS focuses on managing the symptoms. You might need to lose weight. Eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise can help manage PCOS.\nMedicine can help regulate your menstrual cycle and reduce abnormal hair growth and acne. Birth control pills (for women not trying to have a baby) and metformin are 2\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicines that are often helpful. If you havediabetesor high blood pressure, those conditions also need treatment.

Talk to your doctor about how to best manage your symptoms.\nIf you have PCOS, you are more likely to develop high blood pressure, high\u00a0cholesterol,\u00a0or type 2 diabetes. This means you have a greater risk for strokes and heart attacks. It is important to work with your doctor on a health plan to minimize these risks.\nProblems with menstrual periods may also cause women who have PCOS to be infertile (unable to get pregnant). PCOS also causes you to have a higher risk forcancerof the\u00a0uterus\u00a0or breast.

Contact your doctor if you have bleeding from your rectum. This can be a sign of colon polyps. Women may have yellow discharge or irregular bleeding from their vaginas. These can be signs of cervical or uterine polyps or cancer.\nThere is no one specific reason you get a polyp. Abnormal growths of body cells and tissue cause them to form.\nPeople with rare, inherited disorders have a greater chance of getting colon polyps. These include:\nIf a polyp is in your ear or nose, you may see or feel it. Colon polyps often are diagnosed during a colorectal screening, called acolonoscopy. Cervical and uterine polyps may be diagnosed during apap smearorcolposcopy. If your doctor finds a polyp anywhere, he or she will likely do abiopsy. This consists of removing a sample of abnormal tissue. They will send it to a lab to check the cells and look for cancer.\nPolyps cannot be prevented. As you age, your risk of getting a colon polyp increases. You can help find colon polyps early by getting routine colorectal screenings. Finding the polyps early can help prevent colon cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends routine colorectal screening for all adults between the ages of 50 and 75.\nIf you are healthy, your doctor likely will recommend removing the polyps. This helps to prevent cancer from developing or spreading. The type of procedure will depend on the location, size, and type (cancerous or not) of the polyps. You may have to fast from food and drink. Your doctor may sedate you with medicine to reduce pain and help you relax. Someone else will need to drive you home after the procedure if you have had sedation.\nColon polypsare removed during a colonoscopy. The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube through your rectum into your colon, or large intestine. This tube is called a colonoscope. The doctor then feeds a small tool through the tube to remove the polyps. A sigmoidoscopy is another type of procedure used to remove polyps. In some cases, the doctor may need to do a colectomy. This procedure removes part of the colon. It may be done if the polyps are large and/or cancerous.\nCervical and uterine polypscan be removed. The doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina to open it up and see your cervix better. They may use a tool to twist off a small polyp. Larger polyps may be removed using an electric device to burn them off. This is known as electrocautery.\nStomach or throat polypsare removed during an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube through your throat and esophagus. This tube is called an endoscope. The doctor then feeds a small tool through the tube to remove the polyps.\nNose or throat polypsare removed during a laryngoscopy. The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube through your mouth. This tube is called a laryngoscope. The doctor then feeds a small tool through the tube to remove the polyps.\nEar polypsare easier to remove because they are visible.

For some women, it is normal to feel the \u201cbaby blues\u201d for a week or two after giving birth. With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, restlessness, and anxiety may last longer than two weeks.\nAfter having a baby, many women have mood swings. One minute they feel happy, and the next minute they start to cry. They may feel a little depressed, have a hard time concentrating, lose their appetite, or find that they can\u2019t sleep well, even when the baby is asleep. These symptoms usually start about 3 to 4 days after delivery and may last several days.\nIf you\u2019re a new mother and have any of these symptoms, you may have the baby blues. The baby blues are considered a normal part of early motherhood and usually go away within 10 days after delivery.\nThe symptoms of postpartum depression affect your quality of life and include:\nMost women who develop postpartum depression do so right after childbirth; however, some women don\u2019t begin to feel depressed until several weeks or months later. Depression that occurs within 6 months of childbirth may be postpartum depression.\nIn rare cases, a woman may develop postpartum psychosis. This is a very serious disease. It often includes many of the symptoms of postpartum depression along with delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. Additionally postpartum depression may cause the mother to be at risk of hurting herself or her baby\nWhat causes postpartum depression?\nThe exact cause isn\u2019t known. Hormone levels change during pregnancy and right after childbirth. Those hormone changes may produce chemical changes in the brain. This plays a part in causing depression.\nPostpartum depression is more likely to occur if you have had any of the following:\nSchedule a visit with your doctor if you suspect you have postpartum depression. Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and feelings. He or she will ask you how long you have been feeling depressed. Your doctor may ask you to complete a questionnaire about your depression or order a blood test to check your hormone levels.\nPostpartum depression cannot be prevented or avoided. However, if you have a history of depression or postpartum depression after giving birth to other children, you can prepare. Preparation might include keeping your mind and body healthy. Eat healthy during your pregnancy, exercise, and learn stress reduction strategies. Once your baby is born, stay away from alcohol and caffeine. Continue to make healthy lifestyle decisions. See your doctor earlier in your pregnancy or sooner after giving birth if you are worried you will have postpartum depression.\nAdditionally, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommends screening for depression in the general adult population. This includes pregnant and postpartum women. Screening efforts should focus on ensuring accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow up.\nPostpartum depression is treated much like any other depression. Support, counseling (talk therapy), and prescription medicines (antidepressants) can help. Talk with your doctor about what treatment is best for you. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby, get help immediately. Call a suicide hotline, a friend, family member, or 911.\nIf you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking an antidepressant. Many antidepressant medicines are safe for breastfeeding infants. Your doctor can decide which medicine you can use while nursing your baby.\nMost importantly, don\u2019t assume there\u2019s nothing you can do if you are suffering from postpartum depression. Help is available, and you can get better.\nFeeling depressed doesn\u2019t mean that you are a bad person. It doesn\u2019t mean that you did something wrong or that you brought this on yourself. It also does not mean that you don\u2019t love your baby. If you have given birth recently and are feeling sad, blue, anxious, irritable, tired, or have any of the other symptoms of postpartum depression, remember that many other women have had the same experience.\nYou\u2019re not \u201closing your mind\u201d or \u201cgoing crazy.\u201d You shouldn\u2019t feel that you just have to suffer through it.

It can happen as early as a few days afterwards, or up to several weeks after having a baby. In addition to high blood pressure, a woman who has postpartum preeclampsia will also have too much protein in her urine. It is a rare medical condition.\nPostpartum preeclampsia is different than preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is high blood pressure that happens while you are pregnant. Postpartum preeclampsia can only happen after the baby is born.\nThe main sign of postpartum preeclampsia is high blood pressure (140/90 millimeters of mercury \u2014 mm Hg). Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Other common symptoms include:\nSerious complications can include:\nThe exact cause is unknown. However, your risk of getting it is higher if you had high blood pressure after the 20th week of your pregnancy. Other risk factors includeobesity, a family history of high blood pressure, age (younger than 20 and older than 40), and being pregnant with multiple babies (twins, triplets, or more).\nYour doctor will check your blood pressure before you leave the hospital after giving birth. It will be checked again at your post-birth doctor visits. If your doctor suspects you have the condition, a blood test and urine test can provide more information. A blood test involves inserting a small needle connected to a syringe into the vein in your arm to collect a sample of blood. A urine test involves peeing into a cup at a lab or doctor\u2019s office. If your blood pressure is too high, your doctor may send you to the hospital for overnight observation.\nThis condition cannot be prevented or avoided. Know your body. If you have any of the symptoms listed, contact your doctor immediately.\nCertain blood pressure medicines are used to treat this condition. The medicine will lower your blood pressure. Your doctor may also prescribe other medicine to prevent seizures. It is safe to take these medicines and breastfeed.\nGetting the right medicine and dosage will lower your blood pressure.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nPrediabetes means your blood glucose (also called blood sugar) levels are higher than normal. When your blood glucose levels reach a certain level, you havediabetes. This is a disease that occurs when your body doesn\u2019t make or use the hormone insulin properly. It causes too much glucose to build up in the blood. Too much glucose in your blood can be harmful to your body over time.\nPrediabetes is when your blood glucose levels are too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes. People who developtype 2 diabetesusually have prediabetes first. If you have prediabetes, you are at much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You are also at risk of developing other health conditions, includingheart disease, heart attack, or stroke.\nIf you have prediabetes, you can prevent or delay the onset of full-blown type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly.\nPrediabetes usually doesn\u2019t cause any symptoms. The only way to know you have it is if your blood sugar levels are tested.\nPrediabetes occurs when the insulin in your body doesn\u2019t work as well as it should. Insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose from your blood. When the insulin doesn\u2019t work properly, too much glucose builds up in your blood. Higher levels than normal can indicate prediabetes. If the levels get high enough, you develop type 2 diabetes. High glucose levels can damage your blood vessels and nerves over time. This increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health problems.\nYou are at risk for prediabetes if any of the following are true:\nYou should be tested for diabetes if you are age 45 or older. You should also be tested if you are younger than 45 and have any of the risk factors listed above.\nYour doctor can order several tests to check for prediabetes. First, the doctor may want to test your \u201cfasting blood sugar.\u201d This is your blood sugar level before you eat in the morning. The ranges for the results of a fasting blood sugar test are:\nYour doctor may also want to do an A1C blood test. This test provides information about your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. The results are reported as a percentage:\nPrediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be delayed and even prevented. Lifestyle changes like losing weight if you are overweight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly can help with this. The longer you have prediabetes or diabetes, the more health problems you may experience. Delaying or preventing the onset of the disease can help your health.\nIf I have prediabetes, can I avoid developing diabetes?\nIf you have prediabetes, the best way to avoid developing type 2 diabetes is by making changes in your lifestyle.\nYour doctor might refer you to a dietitian or diabetes educator to help you change your eating and exercise habits. Some people also take medicine to help prevent or delay diabetes. Ask your doctor if this is a good option for you.\nThe primary treatment for prediabetes is the same as what you would do to prevent diabetes: lose weight, exercise, and eat a healthy diet. These 3 things can help control your blood sugar levels and keep them from getting higher. In some cases, your blood sugar levels might decrease. It is possible to reverse prediabetes by making these lifestyle changes.\nCan medicine help treat prediabetes?\nDiabetes medicines are not as effective as diet and exercise. However, your doctor might prescribe medicine if you are at high risk for diabetes or have other medical problems. These could include obesity, a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, or high blood pressure.\nWhen you\u2019re living with prediabetes, you should focus on preventing full-blown diabetes. The best ways to do this are by losing weight, eating right, and exercising regularly. But these lifestyle changes can be hard. Here are some tips to help you make changes successfully.\nTake small steps.\nChanging to a healthy lifestyle takes time and effort. But you don\u2019t have to make all the changes at once. Start small, such as switching from drinking soda to drinking water. Once you\u2019ve made the change, celebrate your progress. Then move on to the next change you need to make. It may take a while but keep moving forward. Your lifestyle will continue to improve, and so will your health. Even if you do not lose weight, making these lifestyle changes does make you healthier.\nDon\u2019t let setbacks derail you.\nNobody is perfect. It can be easy to slide back into old habits. If you slip up and have a setback, move back to your healthy habit as soon as you can. You might take one step backward sometimes, but as long as you keep moving forward, your health will improve.\nFind support.\nIt\u2019s harder to do things by yourself. Find other people who are trying to make the same changes you are. They can provide encouragement and new ideas for you to try as you support each other. They also make you more accountable for your decisions. It\u2019s a lot harder to skip a workout when you have someone who is waiting to do it with you.\nEducate yourself.\nLearn how to make healthier food decisions at the grocery store, in the kitchen, and when eating out. The more you know about how food works in your body and what you should be eating, the easier it is to make healthy choices for yourself. Your doctor may recommend nutritional counseling or a visit with a dietitian. They can help you break your old habits and learn how to live healthier.\nRemember the big picture.\nThe day-to-day decisions you need to make can be hard. But in the long run, they add up to make you a much healthier person. Prediabetes can be controlled and even reversed through hard work, focus, and good choices. You are changing your life, one step at a time.\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, MedlinePlus: Prediabetes\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Diabetes\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Diabetes\nLast Updated:May 31, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is preeclampsia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nPreeclampsia is a condition women can get when pregnant. It is sometimes called toxemia. It occurs when women who are pregnant have an increase in blood pressure along with signs of organ damage (most often to the kidneys or liver, but sometimes the lungs or other organs). Preeclampsia usually begins after the 20th week of pregnancy.\nPreeclampsia can prevent the placenta (which gives oxygen and nutrients to your baby) from getting enough blood. If the placenta doesn\u2019t get enough blood, your baby gets less oxygen and nutrients. This can cause low birth weight and other problems for the baby.\nIn some cases, women can get preeclampsia after having their baby. This is called postpartum preeclampsia.\nIt\u2019s very important to see your doctor for routine prenatal visits. Preeclampsia is usually detected early in women who get regular prenatal care, and most problems can be prevented. However, if the condition doesn\u2019t get diagnosed or treated, it can have harmful effects on the mother and/or baby.\nNote: Just because you have high blood pressure while pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you have preeclampsia. If your doctor sees your blood pressure is high, they will watch you closely for changes. In addition to high blood pressure, preeclampsia sometimes also causes excessive swelling. Women with preeclampsia may also have protein in their urine. Many women who have high blood pressure during pregnancy don\u2019t have protein in their urine or extreme swelling, and don\u2019t get preeclampsia.\nMost women who have preeclampsia don\u2019t know they have it. Symptoms either don\u2019t exist or are mild. They include swelling and rapid weight gain (more than 2 pounds a week).\nOther symptoms can include:\nSevere symptoms are less common and can be confused with normal pregnancy symptoms.\nCall your doctor if you have:\nThere is no exact cause of preeclampsia. Women who have autoimmune disorders or blood vessel problems may be more likely to develop preeclampsia. Doctors believe it may also be related to a woman\u2019s genes and diet.\nThe following conditions could put you at greater risk:\nDuring pregnancy, you should visit your doctor for regular checkups and exams. The doctor will check for signs of preeclampsia. This includes checking your blood pressure and weight. You also will be asked to leave a urine sample. Your doctor may also do a blood test.\u00a0 Other tests may be done to check your and the baby\u2019s health, if needed. These can determine if your condition is mild or severe.\nWarning signs of severe preeclampsia may include:\nCan preeclampsia be prevented or avoided?\nYou cannot avoid preeclampsia. You may be able to help prevent it by focusing on better health before you get pregnant. This includes managing chronic conditions, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding use of tobacco, illicit drugs, and alcohol.\nPreeclampsia treatment\nMost women who have preeclampsia still deliver healthy babies. A few develop a condition called eclampsia (preeclampsia with seizures), which is very serious for the mother and baby, or other serious problems.\nThe only way to cure preeclampsia is to deliver your baby. However, that might not always be possible. Your doctor will discuss the best option based on your length of pregnancy and the state of your condition.\nIf you are less than 34 weeks along and your condition is mild, the doctor likely will monitor your symptoms. This may mean more frequent doctor visits to check your blood pressure and urine. The doctor may give you orders to help manage symptoms at home. For example:\nIn some cases, your doctor may want to monitor you and your baby from the hospital. The doctor may prescribe steroid injections to speed up the growth of your baby\u2019s lungs. Once the doctor thinks your baby is developed enough, they will schedule delivery.\nIf you are 37 weeks or more along and/or have severe preeclampsia, your doctor likely will want to deliver your baby right away. To do this, they may induce you (give you medicine or break your water) to start labor or order a C-section.\nSometimes your high blood pressure may get worse after delivering your baby. But in most cases, preeclampsia usually goes away within 6 weeks of delivery. You may need to take medicine during this time to manage your blood pressure or prevent seizures. Women who have preeclampsia once are more likely to have it in future pregnancies. If you have high blood pressure during pregnancy, you are at risk of having high blood pressure when you are older. You also are at an increased risk of kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes, andHELLP syndrome.\nComplications of preeclampsia (for the mother) are rare but include:\nLast Updated:May 12, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Premature ejaculation can happen before or shortly after penetration.\nThere is no set time for how long a person should \u201clast\u201d during sex. But when an individual has an orgasm before they want to, they lose their erection and can\u2019t continue with\u00a0intercourse. Premature ejaculation can be frustrating and embarrassing. You may feel you don\u2019t have enough time to enjoy sex. You may have difficulty satisfying your partner. For some people, embarrassment about premature ejaculation can cause problems with intimacy and damage their relationships.\nPremature ejaculation is a common problem. Up to 40% of individuals have this problem at some time in their lives.\nMost often, you will have no other symptoms other than the premature ejaculation itself.\nA number of emotional and physical factors can lead to premature ejaculation. It may happen when a person becomes too excited or stimulated, or if their penis is very sensitive. It may also happen if they\u2019re nervous or uncomfortable with a new partner. Other common causes include the following:\nPeople who have a low amount of a special chemical called\u00a0serotonin\u00a0in their brain may have problems with premature ejaculation.\nNot in most cases. Rarely, the condition results from a serious health problem, such as nervous system damage from surgery or trauma.\nIf this condition is interfering with your sex life, talk to your doctor. They will perform a physical exam and ask you some questions. Based on your answers, your doctor may order some lab work and will provide a diagnosis. They will also be able to answer your questions and reassure you that this is a common problem.\nThis condition can be prevented or avoided, depending on what is causing it.

Most of the time, using the behavioral methods listed below will work to prevent it.\nBehavioral methods are helpful for more than 50% of people who ejaculate prematurely.\nIn this type of treatment, you practice controlling your ejaculation, either alone or with a partner.\nIn the start-and-stop method, you or your partner will stimulate your penis until you feel like you are about to have an orgasm. Then the stimulation stops for about 30 seconds. Once you regain control of your response, stimulation begins again. This process is repeated 3 or 4 times before you allow yourself to have an orgasm.\nIn addition to using a behavioral method, you may want to try thought distractions. For example, while you\u2019re being sexually stimulated, think about the names of players on your favorite sports team.\nAnxiety,\u00a0depression, and other emotional issues can lead to premature ejaculation. For these issues, seeking the help of a psychologist, psychiatrist, or sex therapist may be helpful. Couples therapy may also help if relationship problems may be the cause.\nSeveral medical treatments may help people who have this condition. Some antidepressants seem to help delay ejaculation, including antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These antidepressants are available with your doctor\u2019s prescription. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of these medicines to treat premature ejaculation. Also, antidepressants may cause side effects such as nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness. Antidepressants may also decrease your desire to have sex. Your doctor can help you decide if an antidepressant is right for you.\nMedicines used to treat erectile dysfunction may also help prevent this condition. Your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines alone or in combination with an antidepressant.\nAnesthetic creams can also be used to prevent premature ejaculation. These creams are applied to the head of the penis to make it less sensitive. Usually, the cream is applied about 30 minutes before sex and then washed off once it has decreased the feeling in your penis. The cream must be washed off before sex. If it is left on, it can cause a loss of erection and vaginal numbness.\nFor some people, simply wearing a\u00a0condom\u00a0can help delay ejaculation because it may make the penis slightly less sensitive.\nPremature ejaculation is very common. But if it happens frequently, talk to your doctor. There are many techniques you can use that may help prevent it. You should also talk to your partner. Often, they may feel responsible or disconnected. Talking about it can help put both of you more at ease.

They may also want to talk about your eating habits, exercise habits, your work, and your family.\nPMS can sometimes be prevented by controlling hormone fluctuations with hormone-containing contraceptives, for example. For some women, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly may ease PMS symptoms.\nThere is no cure for PMS, but taking medicine may help. No single PMS treatment works for everyone, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, to help ease cramps, headaches, backaches, and breast tenderness. Depending on your PMS symptoms and how severe they are, your doctor may prescribe medicine for you.\nYou may need to try more than one medicine to find the treatment that works best for you. Medicines that your doctor can prescribe include diuretics, antidepressants, and birth control pills.\nDiuretics help your body get rid of extra sodium and fluid. They can ease bloating, weight gain, breast pain, and abdominal pain. Diuretics usually are taken just before you would normally experience these symptoms in your menstrual cycle and can be stopped when they are no longer needed.\nAntidepressants can help with the severe irritability, depression, and anxiety that some women experience as part of PMS. These medicines are usually taken every day, even when you feel fine.\nYour doctor may talk to you about taking birth control pills (often just called \u201cthe pill\u201d) or other hormone-containing contraceptives to help ease some of your PMS symptoms. Birth control pills help by evening out your hormone levels throughout your cycle. Some women\u2019s PMS symptoms get a lot better when they take birth control pills. However, the pill can also cause side effects of its own, and it doesn\u2019t help all women.\nYou can buy medicines without a prescription to help with the symptoms of PMS. These medicines usually combine aspirin or acetaminophen with caffeine, antihistamines, or diuretics. Some brand names include Midol, Pamprin, and Premsyn PMS.\nSome over-the-counter pain relievers can also help. These include ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen (brand name: Orudis KT), and naproxen (brand name: Aleve).\nThese medicines can work well for mild or moderate PMS. Talk to your doctor before you try one of these drugs.\nManaging your PMS begins with knowing what your PMS symptoms are and when they happen. Then you can change your diet, exercise, and schedule to get through each month as smoothly as possible.\nTry not to get discouraged if it takes some time to find tips or medicine that help you. Treatment varies from one person to another. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment.\nYou may have read that some vitamins and other supplements, such as vitamin B6, vitamin E, magnesium, manganese, and tryptophan, can help relieve PMS. There haven\u2019t been many studies about these treatments, and it\u2019s possible that they could do more harm than good. For example, vitamin B6 and vitamin E can cause side effects if you take too much of them. Talk to your doctor if you\u2019re thinking of trying any of these vitamins or supplements.\nOn the other hand, taking calcium pills may reduce symptoms of water retention, cramps, and back pain. Taking about 1,000 mg of calcium a day probably won\u2019t be harmful, especially because calcium has so many other benefits, such as being good for your bones.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Premenstrual Syndrome\nOffice on Women\u2019s Health: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nLast Updated:June 16, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

They may abuse their own medicine in a way that is not instructed by the doctor. This includes taking more medicine than they need or taking it when they don\u2019t need it. Or they may abuse a prescription that is meant for someone else. Prescription drug abuse also can occur when people mix medicine with alcohol or other drugs.\nPrescription drug abuse is also a term that refers to the improper use of medicines that are categorized as controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Examples include medicines that doctors prescribe to treat pain, anxiety, or sleep. This can lead to serious problems, such as drug interactions, addiction, or even overdose. A drug interaction occurs when two or more drugs react with each other. It could make drugs less effective or cause harmful side effects.\nMost prescription drugs are safe and effective when you follow your doctor\u2019s directions for how to take the medicine.\nMost older adults who suffer from prescription drug abuse do so by accident. They take more medicine than other age groups. According to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse, 50% of people between the ages of 57 to 85 take more than 5 medications or supplements daily. This increases the risk for mistakes and drug abuse.\nGrowing older also slows down your body\u2019s abilitye to absorb and filter medicines. This means that an older adult might develop drug abuse to or have side effects from a prescription drug at a lower dose than a younger adult.\nA person can abuse any type of prescription drug. Elderly adults commonly take 2 types of medicines that have a high potential for misuse and/or abuse.\nSymptoms of prescription drug abuse can be hard to recognize in older adults. This is because they are similar to symptoms of aging. For instance, confusion and memory loss are symptoms of both.\nIf you care for or spend time with an older adult, be aware of their medicines and behavior. The following are warning signs that someone may be abusing prescription drugs. If they:\nIf you suspect that an older adult is abusing a prescription drug, contact their doctor right away. Tell them about your concerns. The doctor will likely make an appointment to evaluate the person. They can diagnose if the problem is prescription drug abuse.

    "article_title": "What are pressure sores?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nPressure sores are sores on your skin. They\u2019re caused by being in a bed or wheelchair nearly all the time. Sometimes they\u2019re called bedsores or pressure ulcers. The sores usually develop over the bony parts of your body. Those are places with little padding from fat. Sores are common on heels and hips. Other areas include the base of the spine (tailbone), shoulder blades, the backs and sides of the knees, and the back of the head.\nPeople who need to stay in bed or in a wheelchair for a long time are at greater risk of developing pressure sores. This can include people who are paralyzed and those who aren\u2019t able to get up on their own. But even some people with short-term illness and injuries can get pressure sores. Sores can happen if they have to stay in bed or a wheelchair while they heal. Lastly, some chronic (long-lasting) diseases make it hard for pressure sores to heal. Those includediabetesand hardening of the arteries.\nInfected pressure sores take a long time to heal. Also, the infection can spread to the rest of your body.\nPressure sores are caused by sitting or lying in one position for too long. It\u2019s important to know that a pressure sore can start quickly. In fact, a Stage 1 sore can occur if you stay in the same position for as little as 2 hours. This puts pressure on certain areas of your body. It reduces blood supply to the skin and the tissue under the skin. If you don\u2019t change position frequently, the blood supply will drop. A sore will develop.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam to look at the sores. They will examine the size and depth of the sore and look to see if blood or fluid is oozing from the sore. Your doctor will check to see if your sore has a bad smell. They also will check for additional sores.\nTesting may help to diagnose pressure sores or their complications. These tests might include a blood test. Another test would be to take a sample of the tissue from the sore. This is done by scraping or cutting it from the sore. That sample is sent to the lab for examination.\nThe best way to prevent pressure sores is to avoid spending long periods of time in a chair, wheelchair, or bed. If you\u2019re unable to move on your own, make arrangements for somebody\u2014such as a family member, friend, or caregiver\u2014to help you move.\nIf you must spend a lot of time in a chair, wheelchair, or bed, check your entire body daily. Look for spots, color changes, or other signs of sores. Pay attention to the pressure points where sores are most likely to occur. Again, if you\u2019re unable to look on your own, ask someone to help you.\nAnother way to avoid pressure sores is to keep your skin healthy. This includes keeping it clean and dry. Wash it with mild soap and warm water. Don\u2019t use hot water. Apply lotion often.\nEven small amounts of exercise can help prevent pressure sores. That\u2019s because exercise improves blood flow, strengthens your muscles, and improves your overall health. Talk to your doctor if physical activity is difficult. They can suggest certain exercises. Your doctor also may refer you to a physical therapist. They can show you how to do exercises that fit with your current health condition.\nLastly, if you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your risk of pressure sores.\nTreatment depends on the seriousness of the sore. If the sore is infected, you may be able to treat it by applying an antibiotic cream to the area. If bone or deeper tissues are infected, you may require antibiotics. These may be taken by mouth (orally) or by a shot or IV (injection).\nOther things that can help include:\nLiving with pressure sores requires a plan to move and turn frequently. Good hygiene will always be required. Pressure sores should be kept covered with a bandage or dressing. Sometimes gauze is used. The gauze must be changed once a day. Newer materials include a see-through film and a hydrocolloid dressing. A hydrocolloid dressing is a bandage made of a gel. It molds to the pressure sore and promotes healing and skin growth. These dressings can stay on for several days at a time.\nDead tissue in the sore can interfere with healing and lead to infection. Dead tissue looks like a scab. To remove dead tissue, rinse the sore every time you change the bandage. Special dressings can help your body dissolve the dead tissue on its own. The dressing must be left in place for several days. Another way to remove dead tissue is to put wet gauze bandages on the sore. Allow them to dry. The dead tissue sticks to the gauze until it is removed. For severe pressure sores, dead tissue must be removed surgically by your doctor.\nRemoving dead tissue and cleaning the sore can hurt. Your doctor can suggest a pain medicine. Take it 30 to 60 minutes before changing the dressing.\nHealthy eating helps sores heal. Make sure you\u2019re eating the proper number of calories and protein every day. Nutrients are important too, including vitamin C and zinc. Ask your doctor for advice on a healthy diet. Be sure to tell them if you\u2019ve lost or gained weight recently.\nAs pressure sores heal, they get smaller. Less fluid drains from them. New, healthy tissue starts growing at the bottom of the sore. This new tissue is light red or pink. It looks lumpy and shiny. Treatment may take 2 to 4 weeks before you see signs of healing.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Pressure Sores\nAARP: What Caregivers Need to Know About Bedsores\nLast Updated:November 11, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The prostate gland is part of a man\u2019s reproductive system. It makes a fluid that mixes with sperm and other fluids during ejaculation. A normal-size prostate is about the size of a walnut.\nProstate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Most types of prostate cancer grow slowly. However, some types can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, doctors say the cancer has \u201cmetastasized.\u201d\nProstate cancer, especially in its early stages, often doesn\u2019t have any symptoms. Symptoms usually appear as the cancer grows. Those can include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes prostate cancer. However, they do know that certain risk factors may increase your risk for the disease. These include:\nProstate cancer is diagnosed with a biopsy of the prostate. A biopsy is usually done if symptoms or a screening raises concern. A prostate cancer screening is a test your doctor uses to look for the disease before you have symptoms. There are two screening tests available: a digital rectal exam (DRE) and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. You and your doctor will decide if you need a screening. However, these tests can only tell your doctor whether your prostate is healthy. Abnormal test results don\u2019t always mean you have cancer. How often you should be screened depends on your age and your personal risk factors.\nDuring a DRE, your doctor will insert their gloved, lubricated finger a few inches into your rectum to feel your prostate gland. A normal prostate feels firm. If there are hard spots on the prostate, your doctor may suggest additional testing to check for prostate cancer.\nDuring a PSA test, you will get a blood test. A blood test involves inserting a small needle into a vein in your arm to take a sample of blood. The test measures the level of PSA (a substance produced by the prostate) in your blood. Men who have prostate cancer may have a higher level of PSA in their blood. However, a PSA level can also be high because of less serious causes, such as infection or an enlarged prostate.\nIf your screening test results are abnormal, your doctor may recommend additional other tests to check for cancer. Those tests may include:\nIf your biopsy is normal, you don\u2019t have prostate cancer. Talk to your doctor about whether another condition may have caused your symptoms or your high PSA level. Ask your doctor how often you should have checkups.\nIf your biopsy results are positive for cancer, your doctor will grade and stage the cancer.\nGrading tells you how aggressive (fast-growing) the cancer is. Higher grade cancers are more likely to grow and spread. A common system of grading is called the Gleason score. Gleason scores range from 2 (not aggressive) to 10 (very aggressive).\nStaging tells you how advanced the cancer is. Also, it tells you how far it has spread. To determine the stage, your doctor may order imaging tests such as ultrasound, bone scan, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Stages I and II mean the cancer was caught early and hasn\u2019t spread outside the prostate. Stages III and IV mean the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, organs, or to other body parts.\nSome medical professionals argue that screening isn\u2019t necessary. For people who have fast-growing (aggressive) tumors, catching it early can help. Cancer is usually easier to treat and more likely to be cured when caught early. However, most cases aren\u2019t fast-growing.\nAnother argument is that PSA tests aren\u2019t always accurate. In fact, a significant number of PSA tests are false positives. This causes unnecessary worry and expense for men who get the false positives. For these reasons, some medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), recommend against routine PSA screening for men of all ages. Talk to your doctor. Consider the pros and cons of screening, your health, individual risk factors, your preferences regarding diagnosis and treatment, and your doctor\u2019s opinion and advice.\nSome risk factors, such as family history and hormone levels, can\u2019t be prevented. However, your weight, physical activity, and diet may lower your risk for prostate cancer. Work toward a healthy lifestyle by eating the recommended daily amount of fruits and vegetables, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight (or losing weight, if you need to).\nProstate cancer treatment depends on your age, your overall health, and the grade and stage of your cancer. If you have prostate cancer, your doctor will need to monitor the growth of your cancer. Fast-growing tumors can quickly spread to other organs in the body. This makes treatment more difficult. Men who have slow-growing tumors may not need treatment for a long time. Some never need treatment.\nCommon treatment options include the following:\nThere are risks and benefits of each type of therapy.\nRadiation therapy.Older studies show that about one-half of patients developerectile dysfunction(also called impotence, which is the loss of the ability to get or keep an erection long enough to have sex) within 5 years of having radiation therapy. However, newer forms of radiation may have different outcomes:\nRadical prostatectomy.The short-term risks of this surgery are low if you\u2019re young and in good health:\nThe main risks of radical prostatectomy areincontinence(loss of bladder control) and impotence.\nHormone therapy.Hormone therapy often is used in combination with other treatments. It does have side effects:\nChemotherapy.Chemotherapy has been shown to help some people who have advanced prostate cancer live longer.\nChemotherapy can have many side effects, including hair loss, nausea, fatigue, and loss of taste.\nLiving with prostate cancer depends on how early you were diagnosed. Also, it depends on the type of treatment you received. For example, if you had to have your prostate removed, you may have to live with sexual dysfunction. If you had hormone or chemotherapy, you may have long-term effects from the medicines used on those treatments. Ask your doctor how you can improve the quality of your life after treatment.\nAmerican Cancer Society: Prostate Cancer\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Prostate Cancer\nNational Cancer Institute: Prostate Cancer\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Prostate Cancer\nLast Updated:February 29, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is chronic if it starts slowly and lasts for several months. It is acute if it begins and goes away quickly. Infection can occur from:\nNonbacterial prostatitis is more common, but its cause is unknown. This type usually is chronic. It may be related to a previous urinary tract infection (UTI) or chemicals in your urine. Pelvic nerve damage also is a possible cause.\nYour doctor will ask about your family\u2019s medical history. They will also do physical and rectal exams. For the physical test, the doctor looks for a swollen, tender scrotum and enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area. For the rectal test, your doctor will insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. They feel the back of your prostate gland for swelling, warmth, and tenderness. Your doctor also may test your urine, blood, or semen samples. This helps rule out other problems.\nYou can\u2019t prevent most cases of prostatitis. However, you should get checked for STIs.

Normally, itchy skin isn\u2019t serious, but it can make you uncomfortable. Sometimes, itchy skin is caused by a serious medical condition. However, most itchy skin can be treated at home with lotions, moisturizers, and over-the-counter medicines.\nBeyond an itching sensation, symptoms can include:\nDry, irritated skin is more likely to get infected. Infected skin is red, warm and swollen. It may ooze fluid. You may need antibiotics to get rid of this kind of infection. Severe itching or pain, especially in older adults, sometimes is caused by a serious medical problem. Call your doctor if you are an older person who has severe itching or pain that doesn\u2019t have an obvious cause and doesn\u2019t get better within 2 weeks.\nIt can be caused by many things, including:\nMany times, itchy skin just happens when your skin is dry. This pattern is very common in the winter and in dry climates.\nYour doctor will do a visual exam to look at the area that itches. They also will ask you questions about your health history. If your doctor thinks it might be caused by a more serious problem, you may have to undergo more tests. The tests are related to the condition for which your doctor is testing.\nIf you know what is causing your itchy skin, you may be able to prevent it. For example, if it is caused by allergies, you will need to take your allergy medicine regularly. You may need to avoid the outdoors or other things that trigger your allergies.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nPseudogout is a type of arthritis that causes painful swelling in one or more of your joints. It can lead to joint damage if left untreated.\nPseudogout is similar to a condition called gout. However, gout typically affects the joint in the big toe. Pseudogout usually affects larger joints, such as your knees. Also, pseudogout is caused by the buildup of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in your joints, while gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid.\nPseudogout causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and warmth in large joints. It most commonly affects the knees, but it can also affect the elbows, ankles, wrists, shoulders, or hands. Pseudogout attacks can be sudden, and the symptoms may last for days or weeks. Some people who have pseudogout don\u2019t have any symptoms between attacks. In other cases, pseudogout can cause constant pain and discomfort. This chronic (long-lasting) pseudogout may seem similar to osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\nPseudogout develops when deposits of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals build up in the cartilage (tissue that protects your bones) of a joint. The cause of this buildup is often unknown. The crystals are then released into the fluid in your joint. This causes joint pain and swelling.\nYou may be at higher risk of pseudogout as you get older (especially older than 70 years of age). You may also be at higher risk if you have:\nYour doctor may draw fluid from your joint to check for the crystals that cause pseudogout. X-rays might also show some buildup of crystals or signs of joint damage. Your doctor will probably want to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as gout, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.\nTreatment can relieve the symptoms of pseudogout and slow or prevent damage to your joints. Unfortunately, no treatment can get rid of the crystal deposits that cause pseudogout. Taking low doses of colchicine may help to reduce your risk of future attacks. Your doctor can talk to you about the risks and benefits of taking this medicine.\nIf another condition, such as a thyroid problem, caused your pseudogout, treating that condition may help to make the symptoms of pseudogout less severe. It may also make flare-ups less frequent.\nYour doctor may suggest using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (called an NSAID) to treat pain and swelling. These include ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). For severe attacks, your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength NSAID such as indomethacin.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nPsoriasis is a common chronic skin condition. There are several types of psoriasis. The main type is plaque psoriasis. It occurs when skin cell overgrowth forms a type of rash on your skin. The rash often is raised with red marks and flaky white patches that look like scales.\nThe symptoms of psoriasis may include:\nSymptoms can occur anywhere on your body. Common places are your knees, elbows, and scalp.\nPsoriasis starts with the immune system. Your immune system protects your body against infection and disease. When you have psoriasis, your T cells (a kind of white blood cells) wrongly attack your skin cells. This causes your skin cells to rapidly produce and swell.\nMost people who get psoriasis are between the ages of 15 and 35. Psoriasis can be genetic, and it is not contagious. You cannot get it from another person or give it to someone else by touching them. You also cannot spread it to other parts of your body.\nIt may be hard to diagnose psoriasis. This is because it looks like other skin problems, such aseczema. Talk to your doctor if you think you have psoriasis. The doctor will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. They may take a biopsy of skin and look at it in the lab to help with your diagnosis. They may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor).\nThere are different degrees of psoriasis:\nYou cannot avoid psoriasis, but you can help control it. People who have this condition may experience periods of time without any symptoms. Other times, psoriasis can flare up or get worse. Avoid factors that can cause flareups, including:\nThere are several treatments for psoriasis. Your doctor will help you decide which one is best for you. Try an over-the-counter product first to moisturize your skin. Body lotion and moisturizing creams can help keep your skin from getting too dry and cracking. It can remove some of the scales or rough patches. Bathing in Epsom salts, Dead Sea salts, bath oil, or oatmeal can relieve symptoms as well. It can help reduce redness and itching and remove scales.\nIf over-the-counter solutions don\u2019t work, your doctor can prescribe topical medicines. These include prescription creams, ointments, lotions, and gels. You apply these to your affected areas. Cover the treated patches with plastic wrap to help the medicine stay on your skin. You can use special shampoos for psoriasis on the scalp.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicine in pill or injection form. This is more common in severe cases or when the condition is widespread. Some of these medicines can cause side effects. Often, you take these for a short period of time, like when symptoms flare.\nSunlight can help psoriasis but be careful not to stay in the sun too long. A sunburn can make your condition worse. Talk to your doctor about how to safely use sunlight exposure as a form of treatment. Light therapy can be another option if symptoms are confined to certain areas of your body. With this treatment, the affected skin is exposed to controlled forms of artificial sunlight. Your doctor may also have you take Psoralen, which makes your skin more receptive to light. This is known as PUVA treatment.\nThere is no cure for psoriasis. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and reduce flares. People who have psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis. This affects your joints and causes swelling, stiffness, and pain. Psoriasis can be linked to other health conditions. Examples include diabetes and heart disease.\nNational Psoriasis Foundation\nLast Updated:April 8, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is a serious health problem.\nPulmonary arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your lungs. These arteries can narrow or become blocked or damaged. When this happens, they cannot carry as much blood to your lungs. This causes pressure to build up in the narrowed arteries. This puts strain on your heart because it has to work harder to push the blood through. Over time, this weakens your heart, and you can develop heart failure.\nPulmonary hypertension may not cause any symptoms at first. Often, shortness of breath or lightheadedness during activity is the first symptom. As the disease gets worse, symptoms can include the following:\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension usually limit a person\u2019s ability to exercise and do other activities.\nMany things can cause pulmonary hypertension. This can make finding the exact cause difficult. Sometimes the disease is inherited. This means it is passed down from a parent to a child in their genes. Other times the cause isn\u2019t known. This is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.\nWhen pulmonary hypertension develops because of another medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension. Breathing problems such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as sleep apnea, are common causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension.\nOther causes include:\nSome people have a higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. These include people who:\nSigns of pulmonary hypertension can be similar to the signs of many other health problems. This makes it hard to diagnose. Your doctor will probably run tests to estimate the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. He or she will also want to find out how well your heart and lungs are working. These tests may include:\nYour doctor may also need to do other tests to find out whether another medical condition is causing your pulmonary hypertension. These could include:\nIf your doctor determines that you have pulmonary hypertension, he or she will want to see how severe it is. For this, they may order an exercise test. These tests measure your activity level and how well your lungs and heart work while you are exercising. These tests can also be done during treatment to see how well the treatment is working.\nNot all pulmonary hypertension can be prevented. But you can try to prevent other conditions that can cause the disease. These include high blood pressure, heart disease, liver disease, and chronic lung disease from tobacco use.\nThere is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatment can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. The kind of treatment you receive could depend on what is causing the condition. If the cause is known, treating the cause may improve your condition. For example, if your condition is caused by a lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy to raise the level of oxygen in your blood. Or if it is caused by blood clots in your lungs, you will likely take blood-thinning medicines to prevent clots from getting larger.\nThere are several treatments that are often used to treat pulmonary hypertension no matter what the cause. These include:\nLifestyle changes can also help you feel better. If you smoke, stop. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a nutritious diet, and reduce the amount of stress in your life. If you are a loud snorer or have other signs of sleep apnea, ask your doctor about a sleep study to diagnose this condition. Ask your doctor to recommend ways that you can stay as active as possible. Regular activity can help improve your ability to be active.\nIn some severe cases, people who have pulmonary hypertension need surgical treatment. This could include a lung transplant or a heart and lung transplant.\nYour doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.\nBecause there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, you will need to learn to manage your condition. The best way to do this is by following the treatment plan developed between you and your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms change or get worse. Know what symptoms could require emergency treatment, such as chest pain.\nMaking lifestyle changes can also help your condition. This could include:\nWhich changes you should make may depend on the cause of your condition.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nPyloric stenosis is a medical condition. It is a narrowing of the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. That space is called the pylorus. It often occurs in babies younger than 6 months. It is more common in boys than girls.\nVomiting is the primary symptom. It usually starts around 3 weeks of age. Projective vomiting is common. The vomiting occurs after each feeding or some feedings. The baby is still hungry after vomiting. Other symptoms can include:\nThe condition is caused by a thickening of muscles around the pylorus. This prevents the stomach from passing on its contents to the small intestine.\nAn exact reason some babies have pylorus stenosis is unclear. It could be hereditary. Parents who had the condition can pass it on. Rick factor can increase a baby\u2019s chance of having it. These include certain antibiotics, too much acid in the top part of the small intestine, and certain diseases, such asdiabetes.\nIf your baby is vomiting a lot, see his or her doctor. Your doctor may diagnose it with a physical exam, imaging test, and blood test. Physical signs include dehydration (dry skin and mouth, few tears when crying, and dry diapers). Other physical signs include a swollen stomach. Your doctor may order a barium X-ray to look into your baby\u2019s stomach. This is an X-ray with dye. It highlights certain parts of the stomach and intestine. The X-ray may show an olive-shaped mass in the upper stomach. A blood test can detect dehydration.\nPyloric stenosis cannot be prevented or avoided.\nTreatment requires surgery. The surgery is designed to widen the pylorus. It is called pyloromyotomy. In most cases, surgeon will give the baby anesthesia to sleep during the surgery. If that is not possible, your doctor may use an endoscope for the procedure. This is a tiny device with a balloon at the end. It is inserted down your baby\u2019s throat. The balloon is widened to expand the pylorus. In some cases, the condition is treated with a feeding tube or medicine that relaxes the pylorus.\nThe condition is generally caught early. So there are no long-term problems to live with. The exception would be the use of a feeding tube. Your doctor can tell you how long your baby may need the tube.\nU.S. National Library of Medicine: Pyloric stenosis \u2013 infant\nLast Updated:September 16, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It is a temporary narrowing of your blood vessels caused by spasm. The condition affects the blood to your skin, mainly to your fingers and toes.\u00a0It is sometimes called Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon or syndrome.\nThe reduced blood flow causes your skin to turn white or blue.

Babies\u2019 immune systems begin to mature soon after birth. The number of infections begins to go down with time. By the time children are of school-age, their rate of infection is usually the same as the rate for adults.\nInfections come in two main types: bacterial and viral. Bacterial infections are caused by bacteria. Viral infections are caused by a virus. The most common bacterial infections in babies are skin, ear, and throat. The most common viral infections in babies are respiratory, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and influenza virus. Serious but infrequent newborn infections can include blood (bacteremia), urinary tract, and brain or spinal fluid infections (bacterial meningitis).\nThe most common signs of infection in your baby include:\nMost children who have repeated infections don\u2019t have any serious problems and grow up to be healthy adults. Make sure your child gets plenty of sleep and eats ahealthy diet. Sleep and proper nutrition may be just as important as medicine in helping your child fight off infections.\nSometimes it\u2019s easy to see the cause of repeated infections. In daycare centers, children give infections to each other. They drool and their noses drip. They touch each other and touch all the toys. This spreads infections. Some viruses can live on objects for several hours. As adults we have far less contact with each other\u2019s germs, so we are less likely to catch so many infections.\nExposure to cigarette smoke (sometimes called \u201cpassive smoking\u201d) is another cause for runny noses and wheezing in young children. Passive smoking is linked to asthma in children. It is also a risk factor for respiratory infection in children. This makes it important to keep all children away from cigarette or cigar smoke.\nStructural changes in the sinuses or the eustachian tubes (connecting tubes in each ear) are a common cause of repeated infections in children. The term \u201cstructural changes\u201d refers to differences in the bony parts of the skull, the sinuses, and the ears. These differences may be inherited. Some differences in body structure make it easier for a person to get infections because the normal drainage of the eustachian tube (in the ear) or sinuses (in the nose) is blocked. When the drainage is blocked, the number of bacteria grows. This leads to infection. In most children, as the head grows, drainage problems get better. If young children are having too many ear infections, they might need antibiotics or special ear tubes.\nAllergies can also cause repeatedsinusitis(stuffy or drippy nose) and wheezing. Allergies can cause inflammation inside the nose that lasts for a long time. Because of the inflammation, the normal drainage pathways of the nose and sinuses swell and get plugged up. Bacteria grow, causing an infection. Medicine is necessary to treat the cause of the infection, which is the allergy.\nPersistent coughing and wheezing that occurs with mild viral infections may be a sign ofasthma. Sometimes when we think children have pneumonia as a complication of a cold, they really have asthma. These children need asthma medicine in addition to other medicine for infection.\nIn some cases, the answer is chance alone. In rare cases, an otherwise healthy child will have 2 or 3 severe infections for no obvious reason. However, your doctor may want your child to have some simple screening tests to check for an immune deficiency (a weakness in the immune system). This is the main cause of repeated severe infections.\nMost doctors become concerned if children go from simple viral infections to more complicated and severe bacterial infections. Examples are blood infections and pneumonia. Unusual infections or an increase in the number of infections over time are other warning signs.\nIf you have a family history of allergies and asthma, you may want to have your doctor check your child for these conditions.\nAmerican Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology: Recurrent Infections May Signal Immunodeficiencies\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: When and How to Wash Your Hands\nMedlinePlus: Germs and Hygiene\nNational Institutes of Health: Detecting bacterial infections in newborns\nWorld Health Organization: Newborn infections\nLast Updated:May 31, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2020 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nRestless legs syndrome (also called RLS) is a condition in which your legs feel very uncomfortable when you\u2019re sitting or lying down. It usually happens in the evening or night. It can affect both men and women and occur at any age (including during childhood). It often worsens with age and becomes a problem for older adults. RLS can make sleeping and traveling difficult and uncomfortable.\nPeople who have RLS often say it\u2019s difficult to describe their symptoms. If you have RLS, you may have a \u201ccreepy-crawly\u201d feeling in your legs that makes you want to move around. You may experience achy, tingly, or burning sensations in your legs, which can make it difficult to sleep or sit for long periods of time. Moving your legs makes the feeling go away for a few minutes, but it comes back after you sit or lie still again. Your legs may also twitch when you try and sleep (also called periodic limb movements of sleep or PLMS).\nDoctors don\u2019t know what causes RLS. Some cases are related to other conditions, such as pregnancy, iron deficiencyanemia,\u00a0or\u00a0kidney\u00a0failure. Other cases of RLS have no known cause. RLS may be hereditary, which means it can run in your family.\nThere are some types of medications that can worsen RLS symptoms. These include antidepressants, antinausea drugs, antipsychotic drugs, and cold and allergy medications that contain antihistamines.\nTell your doctor about the restless sensations. He or she will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as when they start and whether you\u2019re able to do anything to make them go away. He or she may also ask if any other people in your family have similar symptoms. Tell your doctor about any medicines (including over-the-counter medicines) you\u2019re taking. You could be taking a medicine that makes RLS worse. If so, your doctor may be able to recommend another medicine.\nRLS can\u2019t be prevented because doctors aren\u2019t sure what causes it. But there are some things you can do to help lessen your symptoms.\nLifestyle changes to treat RLS:\nTreatment for RLS includes medicines and lifestyle changes. Medicines used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease can help reduce tremors and twitching in the legs. If your iron levels are low, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement.\nIn some cases, an anticonvulsant medicine (usually used to stop seizures) can be helpful. Historically, sleep aids,\u00a0muscle\u00a0relaxants (called benzodiazepines), and pain medicines (called opioids) have been prescribed by doctors to relieve symptoms. Use of these medicines is becoming more and more limited for RLS because of their known side effects and potential drawbacks. Opioids, if not taken exactly as instructed by your doctor, can be addictive.\nFor many cases of RLS, a combination of medicines is usually needed to best treat the condition. Your doctor may prescribe several trials of medicine before finding one that works best for your case of RLS.\nKeep your doctor posted on how you\u2019re feeling. He or she can suggest different relaxation techniques and can change your medicine if it\u2019s not helping. You may want to join a support group to talk to other people who are suffering from RLS. Also, because RLS tends to run in families, you may want to talk to your relatives about your RLS and see if they have similar symptoms.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Restless Legs\nLast Updated:September 29, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nReye\u2019s syndrome is a rare but serious illness that can be harmful to the brain and the liver. It is most common in children, but anyone can get it. It is considered a two-phase illness because it typically occurs in children who are recovering from a viral infection. But it can occur three to five days after the start of the virus. Viruses could include a cold, theflu, orchickenpox. Also, it is commonly associated with the use of aspirin in children. You should avoid giving a child aspirin (salicylates) or over-the-counter medicines that contain salicylates to help prevent Reye\u2019s syndrome.\nThe symptoms of Reye\u2019s syndrome can be very mild and may go unnoticed. But they also can be very serious and worsen within hours, even to the point of death. That is why it\u2019s important for parents to take symptoms of Reye\u2019s syndrome seriously. If your child shows these symptoms, they need medical attention right away.\nThe most common symptoms include:\nOther symptoms could include:\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure exactly what causes Reye\u2019s syndrome. But they have found that using aspirin to treat a viral illness increases the chances that a child will develop the condition. Now that doctors know this, parents should not give their children aspirin when sick. Fortunately, the number of cases of Reye\u2019s syndrome have decreased. The condition is now very rare in the United States.\nThere is no one test for Reye\u2019s syndrome. Diagnosis usually starts with blood and urine tests. Doctors may also test for metabolic disorders that could affect the liver. Sometimes more invasive tests are needed. This could include a spinal tap (lumbar puncture), liver biopsy, CT scan, or MRI. These tests can help the doctor rule out other conditions that could be causing the symptoms.\nThe best way to avoid this illness is to avoid giving children aspirin, especially to treat symptoms of a viral illness. Unless instructed to do so by your child\u2019s doctor, don\u2019t give aspirin to any child under the age of 19. Always check the label before giving your child an over-the-counter medicine. Aspirin can be hidden in many medicines, such as Pepto-Bismol and Alka-Seltzer. Other names for aspirin include:\nIf your child has chickenpox, the flu, or another viral illness, you can treat fever and pain with other medicines. These include acetaminophen (1 brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (1 brand name: Advil), or naproxen (1 brand name: Aleve).\nAnother way to help prevent Reye\u2019s syndrome is to prevent viral illnesses that can cause it. Make sure your child\u2019s vaccinations are current. This includes 2 doses of the chickenpox vaccine and a yearly flu vaccine.\nThere is no cure for Reye\u2019s syndrome. Successful treatment depends on early diagnosis. Treatment usually happens in the hospital. If it is a severe case, your child may be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatments may include:\nReye\u2019s syndrome is a serious illness that can cause major complications. A child\u2019s recovery depends on how severe the swelling of the brain is. If the disease is caught early, swelling may not be significant. The child has a good chance of a full recovery. But if the disease reaches the later stages, a child may suffer brain damage and disability. In some cases, the child may die. That is why it is so important that you get medical help right away if you notice the symptoms of Reye\u2019s syndrome in your child.

It mostly happens in areas that don\u2019t have access to health care. It usually doesn\u2019t happen in the United States. Children ages 5 to 15 are at greatest risk.\nRheumatic fever affects your heart, brain, joints, and skin. Common symptoms include fever,sore throat, stomach pain, andnosebleeds. You may haveshortness of breathor chest pain. Other symptoms include:\nRheumatic fever happens after you have a Group A streptococcus bacterial infection. These infections includestrep throatandscarlet fever. If you\u2019re not treated for these infections, the bacteria can eventually make your immune system attack your body\u2019s healthy tissue. Rheumatic fever begins 14 to 28 days after the initial infection.\nFirst, your doctor will ask about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam. This includes looking at your joints and skin, and listening to your heart. Next, they can perform several tests. A blood test or throat culture can detect a strep infection. An electrocardiogram (EKG) uses electrical signals to check your heart rate and rhythm. A sedimentation rate or a C-reactive protein (CRP) checks for inflammation.\nYour doctor will group your symptoms and test results into two categories. In order to diagnose rheumatic fever, you must have strep throat and either 2 major symptoms or 1 major symptom and 2 minor ones.\nVisit your doctor if you have signs ofstrep throat. This can prevent the infection from turning into rheumatic fever.\nThe main treatment for rheumatic fever is antibiotics. These will get rid of the bacteria and can help keep you from getting the condition again. Adults and teenagers may need to take antibiotics for up to 5 years. Children may need to take them up to age 21.\nYour doctor may prescribe other medicines to treat your symptoms. Seizure medicine can help with the jerky motions or spasms. Aspirin or corticosteroids can help reduce swelling or inflammation.\nAlthough strep throat is contagious, rheumatic fever is not. When treated, you can recover, but you may have short- or long-term damage to your heart. This can include rheumatic heart disease.

It causes swelling and pain in the lining of your joints. It can affect other parts of your body, such as the lining of your\u00a0heart\u00a0and lungs.\nRheumatoid arthritis often occurs in your hands, wrists, feet, and knees first. It can affect several joints at the same time, on both sides of your body. For example, both of your wrists may be painful and stiff. The joints of the fingers and toes can be some of the first places that have pain and stiffness. Over time, RA may affect other joints, such as your jaw, shoulders, and hips.\nSymptoms of RA may include one or more of the following:\nRheumatoid arthritis is a form of arthritis and a type of autoimmune disease. It occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks its own joint tissue. The exact cause of this is unknown.\nYour doctor will review your symptoms and do a physical exam. They also may order\u00a0blood\u00a0tests, X-rays, or a\u00a0joint\u00a0fluid analysis, which tests the fluid in your joints for other possible causes of pain.\nYou can\u2019t prevent or avoid rheumatoid arthritis since its cause is unknown. However, you may increase your chances of developing RA if you:\nTreatment of rheumatoid arthritis aims to relieve symptoms, reduce pain, prevent future damage, and improve quality of life. Talk to your doctor about treatment options. They can help you decide which is best for you. Options include medicine, surgery, and lifestyle changes.\nFor mild cases of RA, your doctor may suggest taking over-the-counter (OTC) medicines to reduce inflammation. These include aspirin (one brand name: Bayer), ibuprofen (one brand name: Advil), or naproxen (one brand name: Aleve). Medicines such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) can help relieve pain and make you feel better. Your doctor will also prescribe medicines to help treat RA. Prescription pain relievers and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and swelling. These medicines do have some side effects and should be taken wisely.\nMedicines that manage your immune system (called immunosuppressants) also can be used to fight RA. When you have RA, your immune system is out of control. These drugs bring it back to normal. However, they can affect your immune system\u2019s ability to respond to infections.\nYour doctor also may prescribe a steroid, such as prednisone. Steroids can reduce pain and swelling, while slowing the damage to your joints. However, they can only be used for a brief time. The longer you use steroids (several months or years), the less effective they become. Steroids do have side effects, such as easy bruising, bone thinning,\u00a0cataracts,\u00a0and diabetes.\nAnti-rheumatic medicines can help treat RA. If you start taking these drugs early enough, they can slow the damage to your joints. These medicines work slowly, and it may take a few weeks to start feeling better. Your doctor may do a blood test to make sure these medicines are safe for you. Some of these medicines should not be taken if you\u2019re pregnant.\nFor severe cases of RA or cases not effectively treated with medicine, surgery may be an option. Procedures may include correcting a deformity or replacing a joint. Knee and hip replacements are most common. The effects of surgery can help to ease pain and regain joint movement. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of surgery.\nThere are lifestyle changes you can make to help manage RA.\nRheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong disease. When it\u2019s treated, it may go away for a little while, but it usually comes back. It\u2019s important to see your doctor as soon as symptoms begin. The earlier you start treatment, the better your outcome. Some of the damage from RA is irreversible, so finding the disease and treating it early is important.\nIf left untreated, RA can cause other health problems. Your hands may become bent or twisted. Other joints can become deformed. Inflammation will affect your cartilage and bones. Lung and heart problems also can occur.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nRotavirus is a common stomach and intestinal illness. It mostly affects babies and young children. It is one of the most common causes of severe diarrhea. Almost all children will have a rotavirus infection by the time they are 5 years old.\nRotavirus is highly contagious. It spreads through direct or indirect contact with an infected person\u2019s feces (poop). It can happen if you touch a contaminated object, food, water, or the hands or mouth of an infected person. The virus enters your body when your unclean hand touches your nose or mouth.\nThe risk of catching rotavirus is greatest in the winter and spring (December through June). Adults can get the disease, but their symptoms usually aren\u2019t as severe.\nSymptoms include watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and stomach pain. If your child has rotavirus, they also may be weak and cry more than normal. Dehydration (not getting enough fluids) is a symptom in more severe cases. Dehydration happens because diarrhea and vomiting cause your body to lose fluids.\nSymptoms of dehydration include:\nOnce you have been exposed to rotavirus, it takes about 2 days for symptoms to appear. Symptoms can last between 3 and 8 days.\nRotavirus is a part of the Reoviridae family of viruses that commonly cause stomach and respiratory illness. It is spread through people\u2019s stool (poop). If your child gets rotavirus particles in their mouth, it can make them sick. This happens when:\nRotavirus spreads easily between babies and young children. They can then spread it to caregivers or family members who they have close contact with.\nYour doctor can usually diagnose rotavirus in your child based on their symptoms and an office exam. If your doctor is uncertain, he or she may ask that you bring in a stool sample from your child. Your doctor will send the sample to a lab for testing.\nA rotavirus oral vaccine offers some protection against the disease. There are two different vaccines available. One is usually given to babies at 2 and 4 months old. The other is given at 2, 4, and 6 months old. Your doctor will recommend which vaccine is right for your child. Your child should receive all doses of the vaccine before they are 8 months old.\nThe vaccine is not 100% effective. Children can still get the disease after getting the vaccine. However, vaccinated children typically have less serious symptoms than children who didn\u2019t get the vaccine.\nBeyond the vaccination, simple hand washing is the best prevention. Always wash your hands (and have your child wash their hands) before eating and after using the toilet. Always wash your hands after changing a diaper, whether or not the baby has the virus. If you know someone has rotavirus, wash your hands after touching them or anything they\u2019ve touched. Children who are infected should stay away from other children until their diarrhea has ended.\nBecause rotavirus is a virus, it cannot be treated with antibiotics. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.\nYour doctor will recommend treatment for your child\u2019s symptoms, especially for fever and diarrhea. In severe cases of the illness, where dehydration occurs, your doctor will focus on giving your child more fluids. You may be able to increase your child\u2019s fluids at home by giving them ice chips or popsicles. Avoid giving your child fruit juice or soda, which can make diarrhea worse. Your doctor may recommend special drinks that replace body fluids. If the problem is severe, your child may have to go to the hospital to receive IV fluids (injecting fluids into your child\u2019s veins by inserting a small needle into their arm).\nLiving with rotavirus will be unpleasant for a short time for your child and you, as the caregiver.

Experts believe that inflammation causes these granulomas to form. The inflammation could be triggered by an infection or exposure to certain substances in your environment.\nSarcoidosis is most common in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. If you have this disease, you may not have any symptoms. Or you may have serious problems with many different parts of your body.\nThe exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. It is most common in adults between 20 and 40 years of age. It\u2019s more common in women than in men. Worldwide, it occurs more often in African Americans and northern Europeans, especially people from Scandinavia.\nSarcoidosis is not contagious. This means you can\u2019t catch sarcoidosis from another person who has the disease.\nMany people who have sarcoidosis have few, if any, symptoms. (Often, sarcoidosis is found when a chest X-ray is done for another reason.) Some people will have general feelings of illness, such as fatigue, fever, or swelling and pain in the joints. Others will experience symptoms based on the part of the body that is affected.\nThe most common symptoms of sarcoidosis involve the lungs, skin, eyes, and liver.\nThe\u00a0lungs\u00a0are the most commonly affected part of the body in people who have sarcoidosis. Lung or chest symptoms include:\nSarcoidosis may cause skin problems. These could include:\nEye symptoms caused by sarcoidosis can make it hard to see, but they rarely cause blindness. They include:\nSarcoidosis can cause a person\u2019s\u00a0liver\u00a0to become enlarged. Some people have abnormal liver tests and/or a liver problem called cirrhosis. However, this is rare.\nSymptoms are much less common in other areas of the body, but may include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of sarcoidosis. They think having certain genes makes it more likely that a person will develop the disease. Triggers of the disease could include infection with a bacteria or virus, or contact with something in your environment, such as dust or chemicals.\nYou are at higher risk of developing sarcoidosis if you:\nTo find out if you have sarcoidosis, your doctor will perform a physical exam. Then you may undergo a variety of tests, as he or she will want to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms. They may order blood tests, imaging tests, or a biopsy (tissue sample) of an affected organ. Blood tests can help look for other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. Imaging tests could include X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, or ultrasound. These tests can be used to look for granulomas. A biopsy can also show if you have granulomas.\nThere is no way to avoid getting sarcoidosis. If you are at higher risk for the disease, it may be better for you to avoid environmental substances that are known to trigger it. These could include insecticides, mold, or other substances. Talk to your doctor about what substances you should avoid.\nNot everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment. Sometimes it goes away on its own. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms, which organs are affected, and how those organs are working.\nYour doctor will probably treat sarcoidosis if it involves your kidneys, eyes, heart, nervous system, or lungs (especially if breathing problems are getting worse). He or she will treat the disease if you have skin lesions that bother you or if your sarcoidosis is severe. Your doctor will try to do the following:\nMany medicines can be used to treat sarcoidosis. The most common are called corticosteroids. They help your condition by reducing inflammation. How long you take the medicine depends on how severe the disease is and how well you respond to the medicine. Other medicines are sometimes used to treat more severe forms of sarcoidosis.\nIn many people, sarcoidosis gets better all by itself. Women and people who have less severe lung involvement usually do the best. If you have sarcoidosis, you should discuss your illness in more detail with your family doctor. You and your doctor should work together as partners to create a treatment plan that is right for you.\nThere are many factors that will determine how often you see your doctor. This includes how severe your symptoms are, which organs are affected, your treatment, and if you have any side effects. Even if you don\u2019t have any symptoms, it is important to see your doctor for ongoing care.\nComplications\nSometimes serious sarcoidosis is left untreated or treatment doesn\u2019t work.

It makes it hard for you to think clearly and make decisions. It is also hard for you to relate to people and act appropriately in social situations. People with schizophrenia can have trouble telling the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. For example, they may hear voices that aren\u2019t there or think that someone is out to get them.\nSchizophrenia occurs in both women and men. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 16 and 30. It is a lifelong condition. It can be disabling to work and school life as well as relationships if not treated and regularly managed.\nSymptoms of schizophrenia usually develop slowly over time. They fall into multiple categories.\nPsychotic symptoms\nThese are symptoms that often appear during psychotic episodes.\nNegative symptoms\nThese reflect the absence of or reduction in certain appropriate behaviors. They can sometimes be confused with symptoms ofdepression.\nDisorganization symptoms\nCognitive symptoms\nThere is a misperception that people who have schizophrenia are violent. This is not true. In fact, most people who have the disorder are more likely to be harmed by someone else. They are at a higher risk of being taken advantage of by others, as well.\nThere isn\u2019t one known cause of schizophrenia. Researchers have found that your risk of developing the illness could be higher if:\nIf you or a family member have symptoms of schizophrenia, see your family doctor. They will review your medical history and ask you about your symptoms. Your doctor may order tests, such as blood tests or brain scans. These can help rule out physical conditions that have similar symptoms.\nYour doctor may refer you to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. They will assess your symptoms, talk to your family, and observe your behavior over time. To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must experience at least 2 symptoms regularly for at least 6 months.\nSchizophrenia can be hard to diagnose and it can mimic other mental illnesses. There aren\u2019t any tests for it. Substance abuse, medicines, or other medical conditions can produce some of the same symptoms. Many people diagnosed with schizophrenia don\u2019t believe they have it. In those cases, friends and family members must make sure the person gets help.\nSchizophrenia can\u2019t be prevented or avoided. Symptoms may be avoided by taking medicines as prescribed by your doctor.\nThere is no cure for schizophrenia. However, treatments can help people manage their symptoms and improve their daily lives, especially in achieve personal life goals, such as completing education, pursuing a career, and having fulfilling relationships.\nSchizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when you don\u2019t have symptoms. Treatment should reduce the number of times you relapse, and improve your quality of life. Medicine and support therapy are the most common forms of treatment.\nPeople with schizophrenia commonly take antipsychotic medicines. These change the balance of chemicals in your brain and help manage symptoms. Some can cause side effects. You might need to try different medicines to find one that works for you.\nSupport therapy helps people with schizophrenia manage their illness. This can include one-on-one counseling, training in social skills, family therapy, and job support.\nWhen symptoms are severe, people with schizophrenia may need to stay in the hospital. This will make sure they stay safe and are taken care of.\nSchizophrenia doesn\u2019t ever go away, but it can be managed. Many people can control their symptoms with medicine. Therapy, case management, job, and social support help people with their recovery. In the early stages of the illness, relapses and recurring episodes are common. Symptoms and relapses tend to decrease over time if a person continues to take their medicine and receives support. Some people with schizophrenia can live on their own. Others may live with family members or a group home for extra support.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Schizophrenia\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Schizophrenia\nLast Updated:June 1, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It occurs when your immune system attacks your body\u2019s tissues and/or organs.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history. He or she also will perform a physical exam and look for changes in the appearance of your skin. Your doctor may want to remove a small sample of skin (biopsy) to look at it under a microscope. He or she also may order a blood test to check for antibodies, or other tests to see if any internal organs have been affected. All of this helps to determine if you have scleroderma.\nYou can\u2019t prevent or avoid scleroderma.\nYour doctor will choose the right treatment for you depending on your type and symptoms. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing more damage. Possible treatments include medicine, such as creams for your skin. He or she may also recommend dietary and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may suggest physical or\u00a0occupational therapy\u00a0to help you manage your pain. Cosmetic surgery may help to lessen the effects of scleroderma on your skin.\nLocalized scleroderma sometimes goes away on its own. If scleroderma has caused internal damage, your doctor may work with specialists to treat your condition. For example, if scleroderma affects your heart, your doctor will work closely with a heart specialist (cardiologist).\nThere is no cure for scleroderma. The best thing you can do is to work with your doctor(s) to manage symptoms and prevent complications.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated March 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nScoliosis is an abnormal curve of the spine (backbone). Normally, the spine is straight. With scoliosis, the spine is crooked and curves to the side. The curve can be C-shaped or S-shaped. Scoliosis is more common in girls than in boys.\nScoliosis may begin in childhood but often is not noticed until the teenage years. Key signs are having uneven shoulders and leaning to one side. If your spine is very crooked, your ribs or hips may stick out to the side as well. People who have scoliosis may have back pain and have it more often than people who don\u2019t have scoliosis.\nThe exact cause of scoliosis is unknown. It can run in families. It can be caused by an injury, disease, infection, or birth defect. It also can be caused or worsened by repeated use of one side more than the other, such as in a certain motion or activity.\nContact your doctor if you have back pain or other signs of scoliosis. Your doctor will do a physical exam and review your health and family history. If your doctor is concerned about the curve, they likely will order an X-ray to get a better view of the spine.\nYour family doctor may check for scoliosis at regular check-ups. Some schools screen children for the condition.\nYou cannot prevent or avoid scoliosis.\nMild cases of scoliosis do not require treatment. Your doctor may want to monitor your condition to see if it gets worse. The curve of the spine may be temporary or permanent. It often can improve with time, especially for children as they grow.\nYour doctor may have you wear a brace. This keeps the spine from curving more. Newer braces are light and less bulky than old braces. Most braces fit under clothes and are not visible.\nPeople who have severe scoliosis may need surgery. The surgeon will move the bones in your spine, fuse them together to strengthen the spine, or place a rod in your spine to help straighten it. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of surgery. These will depend on your age, state of health, and amount of curve.\nFor most people, the curve in their spine is so small that it causes no problems. Treatment can improve or manage the condition. In rare cases, the curve may restrict the amount of space available for your lungs and heart to work.\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Scoliosis in Children and Teens\nNational Scoliosis Foundation\nLast Updated:February 1, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is seasonal affective disorder?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type ofdepressionthat is triggered by the seasons of the year. Symptoms usually begin in late fall or early winter. People with SAD usually feel better in the spring and summer. It is thought that SAD is related to changes in the amount of daylight during different times of the year. Some people have SAD with depressive episodes in the summer instead of winter. This is much less common.\nBetween 4% and 6% of people in the United States suffer from SAD. Another 10% to 20% may experience it in a milder form. SAD is more common in women than in men. Some children and teenagers get SAD. But it usually doesn\u2019t start in people younger than 20 years of age. The risk of SAD decreases for adults as they age. SAD is more common in northern regions of the United States. Winters are typically longer and harsher there. There is also less sunlight because they are farther away from the equator.\nNot everyone who has SAD experiences the same symptoms. Common symptoms of winter-onset SAD include:\nSymptoms of summer-onset SAD include:\nSymptoms of SAD tend to come back year after year. They usually come and go at about the same time every year. If you think this could be happening to you, call your family doctor.\nIn most cases, SAD seems to be related to the loss of sunlight in the fall and winter. Researchers have found that reduced sunlight can affect the body in ways that could contribute to SAD. These include:\nCircadian rhythm (biological clock)\u2013 The decrease in sunlight could disrupt your body\u2019s natural rhythms. This could lead to feelings of depression.\nSerotonin levels\u2013 Serotonin is a brain chemical that affects your mood. Reduced sunlight could cause serotonin levels to drop. This could trigger depression.\nMelatonin levels\u2013 Melatonin is a brain chemical that regulates sleep. More darkness causes the body to produce more melatonin. More melatonin could make you feel more tired and lethargic. These are common symptoms of depression.\nVitamin D levels\u2013 It is believed that vitamin D plays a role in serotonin levels. Much of the vitamin D we get is from the sun. Less sunlight could lead to a deficiency in vitamin D. This can cause depression symptoms.\nSome people have a higher risk of developing SAD. Factors that increase risk include:\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings, and behavior. They may perform a physical exam. They may request lab tests to rule out other conditions that cause symptoms similar to SAD. They may refer you to a specialist to diagnose your condition. This could be a psychologist or a psychiatrist.\nCan SAD be prevented or avoided?\nThere\u2019s not much you can do to avoid getting SAD. But you can take steps to manage it so your symptoms don\u2019t get worse. Some people start treatment before their symptoms start. They also continue treatment past the time that their symptoms normally go away. Others need continuous treatment to control their symptoms.\nThe three main ways SAD is treated are with light therapy, behavioral therapy, or medicine. Your doctor may want to combine therapies if using one does not work for you.\nLight therapy is designed to make up for the lack of sunlight during the fall and winter. It has been used to treat SAD since the 1980s. You will sit in front of a special light box every day. The box emits a bright white light that mimics natural sunlight. It seems to make a change in brain chemicals that regulate your mood. The amount of time you sit in front of the light box depends on the strength of the light. It is usually between 20 and 60 minutes.\nThere are other types of light therapy. Instead of sitting in front of a box, you can wear a visor that emits light. Another kind is a \u201cdawn simulator.\u201d This light turns on early in the morning in your bedroom. It mimics a natural sunrise and gradually increases in brightness. This allows you to wake up naturally, without using an alarm.\nIf light therapy helps, you\u2019ll continue it until enough sunlight returns. This usually happens in spring. Stopping light therapy too soon can result in a return of symptoms.\nWhen used properly, light therapy seems to have very few side effects. Some side effects include eyestrain, headache, fatigue, and irritability. If you use it too late in the day, you could have trouble sleeping. Talk to your doctor before starting light therapy if you have:\nTanning beds should not be used to treat SAD. The light sources in tanning beds are high in ultraviolet (UV) rays. These harm your eyes and your skin. They also cause skin cancer.\nTalk therapy or behavioral therapy can help you identify negative thoughts. Then you replace those with more positive thoughts. Therapy can help you learn healthy ways to manage your symptoms of SAD. You can also learn how to manage stress.\nYour doctor might recommend you take medicine to help with your symptoms, especially if they are severe. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat depression. Some have been approved to treat SAD specifically.\nYou may have to take the medicine for several weeks before you feel better. You may have to try more than one medicine to find the one that works best for you.\nYou can also make lifestyle changes that can help your symptoms.\nThe keys to living with SAD are to plan ahead and to manage your symptoms.\nNational Institute of Mental Health, Seasonal Affective Disorder\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Seasonal Affective Disorder\nLast Updated:February 29, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nSeborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition. It affects the scalp, face or inside the ear. The affected areas have white to yellowish flakes. The skin also can be red and greasy. When adults get it on their scalp, it\u2019s commonly called \u201cdandruff.\u201d In babies, it is known as \u201ccradle cap.\u201d Seborrheic dermatitis can appear on other parts of the body. This includes the chest, creases of the arms, legs and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is common in babies younger than three months of age and in adults. In adults. It\u2019s more likely to affect adult men than women.\nSeborrheic dermatitis symptoms include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis. The cause may be different in babies and adults. It may run in families. One cause may be hormones. It usually appears in babies and disappears before puberty. Another cause may be a fungus. The fungus is called malassezia. It is present on the skin in small numbers. Sometimes the numbers increase and lead to skin problems.\nSeborrheic dermatitis has been linked to neurologic disorders. This includes Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and stroke. Doctors do not know why. Other factors include:\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and do a physical exam of your skin and scalp. If your doctor is uncertain about whether you have the condition, he or she may have you get a skin biopsy. This involved in cutting or scraping off a small sample of the affected skin. This step is rare.\nIf the condition is genetic, it cannot be prevented. Most other causes cannot be prevented. However, you can reduce the severity of symptoms. Controlling risk factors and careful skin care can help. This includes avoiding lotions that contain alcohol, using special skin products recommended by your doctor, protecting yourself from HIV/AIDs, losing weight and getting plenty of rest.\nTreatment depends on your age and location of the symptoms. Several over-the-counter and medicated shampoos can relieve the flaking and dryness. You do not \u00a0need a prescription for these products. Look for a product that says it treats seborrheic dermatitis. Important ingredients include salicylic acid, coal tar, zinc, resorcin, ketoconazole and selenium sulfide.\nOther treatments that could help include phototherapy. This is a medical procedure in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Moderate sunlight is helpful.\nSeborrheic dermatitis is considered chronic. Also, it is a life-long condition. It\u00a0comes and goes, and it\u00a0can be controlled with treatment. The negative effects of living with the condition are additional fungal infections and emotional distress.

    "list_title": "Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)",
    "article_title": "What is sensory processing disorder?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nSensory processing disorder (SPD) is a condition that affects how your brain processes sensory information (stimuli). Sensory information includes things you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. SPD can affect all of your senses, or just one. SPD usually means you\u2019re overly sensitive to stimuli that other people are not. But the disorder can cause the opposite effect, too. In these cases, it takes more stimuli to impact you. On the other hand, lack of sensory input can impact your social and emotional health. For example, hearing loss has been shown to increase the risk of developing dementia because it causes social isolation and depression.\nChildren are more likely than adults to have SPD. But adults can have symptoms, too. In adults, it\u2019s likely these symptoms have existed since childhood. However, the adults have developed ways to deal with SPD that let them hide the disorder from others.\nThere is some debate among doctors about whether SPD is a separate disorder. Some doctors argue it isn\u2019t. Some say it\u2019s a diagnosis for things that could be explained as common behavior for children. Others say some children are just highly sensitive. Some doctors say that SPD is a symptom of other disorders\u2014such asautism spectrum disorder,attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder,anxiety, etc.\u2014and not a disorder itself. Other doctors believe your child may suffer from SPD without having another disorder. Some say it\u2019s clear that some children have trouble handling regular sensory information (stimuli). For now, SPD isn\u2019t recognized as an official medical diagnosis. Even so, it is a way to identify those who may need some extra attention in this area.\nSPD can affect one sense or multiple senses. Children who have SPD may overreact to sounds, clothing, and food textures. Or they may underreact to sensory input. This causes them to crave more intense thrill-seeking stimuli. Some examples include jumping off tall things or swinging too high on the playground. Also, children with SPD are not always just one or the other. They can be a mixture of oversensitive and under-sensitive.\nChildren may be oversensitive if they:\nSometimes these symptoms are linked to poor motor skills as well. Your child may have trouble holding a pencil or scissors. They may have trouble climbing stairs or have low muscle tone. They also may have language delays.\nIn older children, these symptoms may cause low self-confidence. That may lead to social isolation and evendepression.\nChildren may be under-sensitive (sensory-seeking) if they:\nDoctors don\u2019t know what causes SPD. They\u2019re exploring a genetic link, which means it could run in families. Some doctors believe there could be a link between autism and SPD. This could mean that adults who have autism could be more likely to have children who have SPD. But it\u2019s important to note that most people who have SPD don\u2019t have autism.\nParents may recognize their child\u2019s behavior is not typical. But most parents may not know why. Don\u2019t be afraid to discuss your child\u2019s behavior with your doctor. They may refer you to an occupational therapist. These professionals can assess your child for SPD. They will likely watch your child interact in certain situations. The therapist will ask your child questions. All of these things will help make a diagnosis.\nSPD can\u2019t be prevented or avoided because doctors don\u2019t know what causes it.\nTreatment is usually done through therapy. Research shows that starting therapy early is key for treating SPD. Therapy can help children learn how to manage their challenges.\nTherapy sessions are led by a trained therapist. He or she will help you and your child learn how to cope with the disorder. Sessions are based on if your child is oversensitive, under-sensitive, or a combination of both.\nThere are different types of therapy:\nSensory integration therapy (SI).This type of therapy uses fun activities in a controlled environment. With the therapist, your child experiences stimuli without feeling overwhelmed. They can develop coping skills for dealing with that stimuli. Through this therapy, these coping skills can become a regular, everyday response to stimuli.\nSensory diet.Many times, a sensory diet will supplement other SPD therapies. A sensory diet isn\u2019t your typical food diet. It\u2019s a list of sensory activities for home and school. These activities are designed to help your child stay focused and organized during the day. Like SI, a sensory diet is customized based on your child\u2019s needs. A sensory diet at school might include:\nOccupational therapy.Your child also may need this therapy to help with other symptoms related to SPD. It can help with fine motor skills, such as handwriting and using scissors. Therapy also can help with gross motor skills, such as climbing stairs and throwing a ball. It can teach everyday skills, such as getting dressed and how to use utensils.\nIf your child has a sensory deficit, such as a hearing loss, hearing aids can help. Talk to your doctor about being tested for a hearing loss and the hearing aid options that could work for your child.\nTalk to your health insurance representative about how a therapist fits in your health coverage. Many times, insurance won\u2019t pay for therapies used to treat SPD. That\u2019s because SPD isn\u2019t yet recognized as an official diagnosis.\nLiving with SPD can be hard. Parents of children with SPD can feel alone. They may avoid taking their child out in public to avoid sensory overload. Parents may also feel like they need to make excuses for their child\u2019s behavior.\nAdults who have SPD may feel isolated, too. Sensory overload can prevent them from leaving the house. This can make it difficult to go to the store or even to work.\nAdults who are struggling with SPD should work with an occupational therapist. The therapist may be able to help them learn new reactions to stimuli. This can lead to changes in how they deal with certain situations. And that may lead to an improved lifestyle.\nSometimes, even if SPD gets better with therapy or age, it may never go away. A major life event or stress can trigger symptoms.\nIf you are an adult with a hearing loss, talk to your doctor about getting a hearing test and the available options for prescription and over-the-counter hearing aids.\nChild Mind Institute: Sensory Processing Issues Explained\nNational Institute on Aging: Take care of your senses: The science behind sensory loss and dementia risk\nLast Updated:May 5, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nSever\u2019s disease is a common heel injury that occurs in children. It is painful and caused by swelling of the growth plate in the heel. Children can injure this growth plate through typical weight-bearing activity (activity performed while standing).\nSever\u2019s disease can cause heel pain in one or both heels. It usually starts after a child begins a new sports season or a new sport. Your child may walk with a limp. The pain may increase when he or she runs or jumps. You may notice your child tiptoeing to avoid putting pressure on his or her heel. You may notice swelling or redness in the heel area.\nThe foot is one of the first body parts to grow to full size. This usually happens in early puberty. During this time, bones often grow faster than muscles and tendons. As a result, muscles and tendons become tight, making the heel area less flexible. During weight-bearing activity, the tight heel tendons may put too much pressure at the back of the heel (where the Achilles tendon attaches). This can injure the heel and cause Sever\u2019s disease.\nYour child is most at risk for injury in early puberty during a growth spurt. Sever\u2019s disease is most common in physically active girls 8 years to 10 years of age. It is most common in physically active boys 10 years to 12 years of age. Soccer players and gymnasts often get Sever\u2019s disease. But children who do any running or jumping activity may also be at an increased risk. Sever\u2019s disease rarely occurs in older teenagers because the back of the heel has typically finished growing by 15 years of age.\nYour child\u2019s symptoms will play a big role in the diagnosis. The doctor will also examine the injured heel. He or she may squeeze both sides of the back of the heel to see if it causes pain. This is called the squeeze test.\nSever\u2019s disease may be prevented by maintaining good flexibility. Stretching exercises can lower your child\u2019s risk for injuries during the growth spurt. Talk with your doctor for more advice. Quality shoes with firm support and a shock-absorbent sole will help, too. Your child should avoid excessive running on hard surfaces.\nIf your child has already recovered from Sever\u2019s disease, stretching and putting ice on the heel after activity will help keep your child from developing this condition again.\nFirst, your child should cut down or stop any activity that causes heel pain. Apply ice to the injured heel for 20 minutes 3 times a day. If your child has a high arch, flat feet, or bowed legs, your doctor may recommend orthotics, arch supports, or heel cups. Your child should never go barefoot.\nIf your child has severe heel pain, medicines such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin) may help.\nYes, stretching exercises can help. It is important that your child performs exercises to stretch the hamstring and calf muscles, and the tendons on the back of the leg. The child should do these stretches 2 or 3 times a day, holding each stretch for about 20 seconds. Your child should stretch both legs, even if the pain is only in 1 heel.\nYour child also needs to do exercises to strengthen the muscles on the front of the shin. To do this, your child should sit on the floor, keeping his or her hurt leg straight. Hook one end of a bungee cord or piece of rubber tubing around a table leg. Hitch the other end around the child\u2019s toes. Your child should scoot back just far enough to stretch the cord. Next, your child should slowly bend the foot toward his or her body. When the child cannot bend the foot any closer, he or she slowly points the foot in the opposite direction (toward the table). Your child should do this exercise (15 repetitions of \u201cfoot curling\u201d) about 3 times each day.\nWith proper care, your child should feel better within 2 weeks to 2 months. Your child can start playing sports again only when the heel pain is gone. Your doctor will let you know when physical activity is safe.\nNo long-term problems have been linked to Sever\u2019s disease. However, call your doctor if your child\u2019s heel pain does not get better with treatment, gets worse, or if you notice changes in skin color or swelling.\nLast Updated:February 1, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is shaken baby syndrome (abusive head trauma)?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nAbusive head trauma is also called shaken baby syndrome. This is because it is most often caused by shaking a small child or infant so hard that it has a\u00a0whiplash\u00a0effect. It can also be caused by jerking, throwing, or hitting the child. Abusive head trauma is a form of child abuse that can be deadly or leave a baby seriously injured for a lifetime. Most often, victims of this kind of abuse are less than 1 year old, but it can happen with children up to age 5.\nA severe case of abusive head trauma in your baby or young child can cause unconsciousness, seizures, or\u00a0shock.\nOther initial symptoms of abusive head trauma can include:\nIn many cases, abusive head trauma also leaves a child with long-term problems that affect them physically and intellectually. A survivor of abusive head trauma may be dependent on medical services, special education, and social services for the rest of their life.\nAbusive head trauma happens when a baby is shaken violently, hit in the head, thrown, or dropped on purpose. It usually happens at the hands of an overwhelmed parent or caregiver who can\u2019t cope with a baby\u2019s long periods of crying and the demands of caring for a young child.\nViolently shaking a young child or hitting them in the head causes the child\u2019s brain to shake back and forth inside the\u00a0skull. This is especially true in babies, whose neck muscles aren\u2019t fully developed. The movement causes your child\u2019s brain to swell,\u00a0bruise, and bleed from the tearing of\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels, nerves, and\u00a0tissue.\nThrowing a baby up in the air and catching them is also not a good idea. It can cause the exact same damage as if they were shaken.\nYou should go to the emergency room right away if you suspect your child is suffering from abusive head trauma. Some symptoms of abusive head trauma (for example, vomiting or irritability) are also common in other illnesses. So it is important for the doctor to know if your child may have been shaken or hit in the head. The doctor will ask questions about what happened. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the abuse may not be honest about their actions.\nThe doctor will use a number of visual clues and tests to make the\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0and find out how severe the damage is. Visual clues include checking the child\u2019s eyes for bleeding; looking for marks on the skull, arms, or legs; and checking for bruises around the child\u2019s neck or chest. Certain imaging tests (for example, an X-ray,\u00a0CT\u00a0scan, or\u00a0MRI) can show evidence of swelling or bleeding in the brain. These tests also can show skull or rib fractures.\nBecause this happens due to a caregiver\u2019s actions, it is absolutely possible to prevent abusive head trauma. It is important for everyone who takes care of your baby or young child to learn how to handle stressful situations (for example, when your baby cries for a long time).\nOne way to handle\u00a0stress\u00a0is taking several deep breaths, finding a safe place for your child (for example, the crib), and walking to another room for 10 to 15 minutes to calm yourself. When you feel out of control, call a friend or family member to help with your child or help you regain control. Understanding the consequences of abusive head trauma can help you take an active role in preventing this with your child.\nSoothing a crying baby is not easy. However, there are a number of things you can try to calm the baby, including:\nCombining these strategies with \u201cwhite noise\u201d or rhythmic sounds (for example, music, a hair dryer, or a clothes dryer) can help. You also can try putting your child down for a nap on their left side to help with\u00a0digestion, or on their back. If all else fails, be sure to consider whether your child could be sick. Call your doctor for advice.\nIf you have a caregiver for your child, it\u2019s important to teach your caregiver about the dangers of shaking a baby or young child. Be sure they know what to do if they feel stressed while caring for your child. Choose a caregiver carefully and continue to monitor your child\u2019s safety under their care.\nFor milder cases of abusive head trauma, your child may need medicine, a hospital stay, and at-home observation. In the most severe cases, treatment may begin in the hospital emergency room or operating room with life-saving steps. These steps might include inserting a breathing tube down your child\u2019s throat or doing surgery to stop bleeding or reduce swelling in your child\u2019s brain.\nDepending on how severe the trauma is, your child may have to be monitored over time. Survivors of abusive head trauma may suffer long-term health problems, such as:\nThe National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome\nLast Updated:July 2, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The pain is often caused by overuse (running and jumping). Shin splints usually heal within a few weeks, with rest and proper treatment.\nYou can get shin splints in one or both of your legs. Most people who have shin splints feel pain on the inside edge of their shinbones. Pain may be acute (sharp) or a dull ache. Your shins may hurt when you\u2019re active. They can also hurt when you are inactive shortly after completing activity. The pain may be worse with pressure or exercise. It may improve with rest and at-home treatment.\nShin splints occur from repeated and often high-impact motion. They cause inflammation where your muscles and tendons connect to your shinbone.\nSome people have an increased risk of getting shin splints. This includes people who:\nIf you have pain that doesn\u2019t improve with rest or your shin area is swollen, red, or hot to the touch, you should call your doctor.\nYour doctor will review your symptoms, activity, and health history. They may order tests, including an X-ray orMRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This can rule out other issues, such as a stress fracture. This is a small crack along the bone.\nAthletes who are at risk of shin splints can take some precautions. Runners should choose shoes that fit well and absorb shock. Shoes start to lose shock resistance after about 250 miles of use. Try running on softer surfaces, such as a track or treadmill. Do not increase training too fast if you are new or getting back into running. Dancers and gymnasts can exercise on sprung floors, if available. Cross training with low-impact activities also can help. Examples of these include swimming and using an elliptical machine.\nTreatment for shin splints depends on the degree of your injury and your health. You can try at-home treatments, such as the following:\nYour doctor may recommend getting physical therapy. This can help with pain, but also strengthen your leg muscles. Athletes can try using orthotic shoe inserts or arch supports. These help realign your feet and absorb shock. Ask your doctor for suggestions.\nBegin treatment right away if you have symptoms of shin splints. This can help reduce long-term damage. It can take several weeks or months for shin splints to heal. Once the pain is gone, you can gradually return to your normal routine. Start slow to prevent reinjuring yourself.

    "article_title": "What is shingles?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nShingles is a painful skin rash. It is also called zoster or herpes zoster. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus. This is the same virus that causeschickenpox. Nearly one-third of people in the United States will get shingles in their lifetime. Most people will only get it once. But some people can have more than one episode.\nThe virus that causes shingles is not the same virus that causes oral or genital herpes. That virus is called the herpes simplex virus. The two are in the same family of viruses.\nShingles usually causes a painful, blistering rash. Sometimes pain, itching, or tingling start a few days before the rash appears. The rash begins with reddish bumps. In a few days, these bumps turn into fluid-filled blisters. You might feel a stinging or burning pain. The rash might also itch. Other shingles symptoms include:\nShingles occurs most often on the trunk of the body. It also occurs on only one side of the body. This could be a band of blisters around your back or chest. The blisters usually scab over in about a week. The rash usually clears up in 2 to 4 weeks. You may see changes in the color of your skin when the scabs fall off. In more severe cases of shingles, these color changes could be permanent.\nEven though the rash from shingles gets better or goes away in a few weeks, the pain may last longer. This condition is known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). In most people, however, the pain of shingles goes away in 1 to 2 months.\nShingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you\u2019ve had chickenpox, the virus goes dormant (inactive) in your body. It stays inside certain nerve cells. Your immune system keeps the virus in these cells. As you get older, your immune system may get weaker. If this happens, the virus may reactivate, causing shingles. Many times this happens years after you\u2019ve had chickenpox. If you have had the chickenpox vaccine, you are less likely to get chickenpox. Therefore, you\u2019re less likely to later develop shingles.\nMost people who get shingles are over 50 years of age or have a weak immune system. For example, you might get shingles if you:\nNo one can catch shingles from you. But the virus can be spread to a person who has never had chickenpox. The virus lives in the blisters that shingles causes. It can be spread until the blisters are completely healed. If you have blisters that have not crusted over yet, you should stay away from:\nTell your doctor if you live with children who have not had chickenpox. They may need to be vaccinated.\nYour doctor will ask you about your medical history, including if you\u2019ve ever had chickenpox. He or she will also ask about your symptoms. They will do a physical exam and inspect your rash. There is a test that can confirm shingles, but it is not normally needed.\nThe best way to prevent shingles is through vaccination. Vaccinate your children for chickenpox. This vaccine reduces their risk for getting chickenpox. You can\u2019t get shingles unless you\u2019ve had chickenpox first.\nWhen you are older, get the shingles vaccine. It is recommended for adults 50 years of age and older. It can prevent shingles. People who have had shingles should get the vaccine to help stop the disease from reoccurring. Common side effects of the vaccine are headache, plus redness, swelling, itching, and soreness at the injection site.\nThe shingles vaccine isnotrecommended for anyone who:\nShingles is often treated with an antiviral medicine. These medicines can reduce the severity and duration of your shingles symptoms. Acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir are commonly prescribed. Your doctor will decide whether one of these medicines is right for you. These medicines work better if you start taking them in the first 3 days after you get the rash.\nYour doctor might also have you take a steroid medicine to reduce your pain and swelling. This medicine along with the antiviral medicines may reduce your risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia.\nTo help with the pain of shingles symptoms, your doctor might have you take an over-the-counter pain medicine. This could include acetaminophen (one brand: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (two brands: Motrin, Advil).\nApplying a medicated anti-itch lotion (two brands: Benadryl, Caladryl) to the blisters might reduce the pain and itching. Placing cool compresses soaked in water mixed with white vinegar on the blisters and sores might also help.\nIf shingles causes severe pain, your doctor might prescribe a stronger pain medicine.\nMost people will only get shingles once in their life. The pain and the rash resolve in 3 to 5 weeks, and the blisters don\u2019t leave scars. There are a few complications that can occur.\nThe most common complication of shingles is post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). This is when the pain of shingles lasts for a long time after the rash is gone. About 10% of people who have shingles will develop PHN. It is caused by damaged nerve fibers that send exaggerated pain messages from your skin to your brain. The older you are, the more likely you are to develop PHN. It is also likely to be more severe when you are older.\nShingles can also lead to an eye condition called herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO can cause a rash with small blisters to break out on the forehead and around the eye. Usually this happens only on one side of your face. Sometimes you will have pain in the same area of your face a few days before the outbreak. Infection of the eye causes extreme pain, swelling of the eyelid, light sensitivity and redness. In severe cases, the cornea can be damaged. This can affect your vision.\nPeople who have HZO should see an eye doctor right away.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: About Shingles\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Shingles\nLast Updated:February 23, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can signal an underlying health problem. Sometimes the feeling is worse when you are physically active or when you lie down flat. You may have other symptoms such as a cough or a fever.\nIf you are experiencing any of these problems, tell your doctor. If your shortness of breath is sudden or severe, or if you also have chest pains, you should call 911.\nWhen you have shortness of breath, you feel as though you can\u2019t catch your breath. You feel as though you can\u2019t get enough air in your lungs or breathe deeply. You may also feel a tightness in your chest.\nShortness of breath can be caused by many things, including:\nIf you are short of breath with a cough and/or fever, you may have a chest infection orpneumonia. Less common causes of breathing problems are lung cancer, a blood clot in the lungs, air leakage around the lungs, and scarring of the lung tissue.\nYour doctor can help find the cause of your breathing problem. They will begin by asking you questions about your symptoms and performing a physical exam. Your doctor also may order some tests.\nTo find the cause of your shortness of breath, your doctor may order a chest X-ray. They will also measure the oxygen saturation of your body by placing an oximeter on your finger.\nThey may also order an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG). During this test, your doctor will have you lie down so your heart can be monitored. The ECG machine creates a picture, or tracing, that shows your heart\u2019s electrical signals.\nYou may need to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is another type of X-ray. Your doctor may measure the strength of your breathing (called a spirometer) and the oxygen level in your blood. You also may need to have a blood test or specialized lung test called pulmonary function test (PFT).\nWhether you can prevent shortness of breath depends on what is causing it. If it is caused by allergies, you may be able to prevent it by identifying your allergy trigger. Once you know what triggers your allergies, you can do your best to avoid it. If your shortness of breath is caused by smoking, stopping can help prevent it. Other causes may not be as easy to avoid. If it is caused by a medical condition such as asthma, inhalers can help.\nYour doctor will treat the cause of your breathing problem. To help your treatment, if you smoke, you need to stop. Ask your doctor for help. Also, avoid breathing chemicals that can bother your lungs, such as fumes from paint and car exhaust. If your doctor says it\u2019s okay, you should try to get plenty of exercise.\nIt can be scary to have frequent shortness of breath. It can be less scary if you learn to control it.

In this case, \u201cinstability\u201d means the shoulder joint isn\u2019t stable. This means the bones aren\u2019t held together as tightly as they should be. This is different from shoulder dislocation. That is when the shoulder is completely out of place. In this case, shoulder ligaments are torn and cannot hold the joint in place.\nPain and weakness are the main symptoms of shoulder instability. The pain can start suddenly or slowly. It may hit you just as you throw a ball, for example. If it happens suddenly, you may also feel numb all the way down your arm.\nIf shoulder instability comes on slowly and over time, it may only be painful at certain times. Shoulder motions like throwing may hurt. But the pain isn\u2019t as bad as the pain of a sudden injury. Your shoulder might be sore when you move it. It might feel loose in its joint. You also may have numbness or tingling with instability that comes on slowly.\nThe most common cause of shoulder instability is an injury. Shoulder instability occurs when the ligaments and muscles are overused. Shoulder muscles and ligaments can become overused if you often throw a ball, hit hard with your shoulder in a football game, or serve a volleyball really hard. Repeating the same motion over and over again, age, and performing manual labor also can cause shoulder instability.\nYour doctor will look at your shoulder. They will move your arm around to find signs of instability. Your doctor may also take X-rays. The X-rays will show if your shoulder bones are in the right place. Your doctor might want you to have a magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan. An MRI lets your doctor see the bones, ligaments, and other parts of your shoulder in greater detail.\nThere\u2019s no way to prevent shoulder instability. But you can reduce the chances of it occurring by protecting yourself from a sports-related injury. If your job involves repeat motions or manual labor, find ways to give your muscles a rest.\nTreatment for shoulder instability depends on how bad your injury is and how important it is for you to have a strong shoulder. Some people need physical therapy. After an injury, apply ice to the injured area and rest the shoulder in a sling for one or two weeks. After resting the shoulder for several days, it\u2019s important to begin an exercise program designed to strengthen your shoulder muscles. Avoid overuse for the next month.\nIf your shoulder instability is due to your job, talk to your doctor about ways to treat the pain with over-the-counter medicine. If it\u2019s sports-related, some people stop playing sports and avoid things that might hurt their shoulder again. If you don\u2019t want to give up sports or can\u2019t change your job, talk to your doctor about resistance and weight-lifting exercises. Ask about physical therapy. Both can help strengthen your shoulder muscles.\nOrthoInfo: Chronic Shoulder Instability\nLast Updated:August 17, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

The sinus node (also called the sinoatrial node) is a natural pacemaker in your heart that helps your heart beat steadily. An electric current starts in one of the upper chambers (called the\u00a0atria) of the heart and goes through the heart to the bottom chambers (called the ventricles). The sinus node can increase your heart rate during times of high demand, such as during exercise. If you have sick sinus syndrome, your heart rate may betoo slow or too fastto meet the needs of your body.\nAbout 1 in 600 people with heart problems have sick sinus syndrome. It can happen to people of any age. Women are affected about as often as men.\nSome people with sick sinus syndrome don\u2019t feel ill or have only mild feelings of illness. Other people have symptoms that come and go. The following are some possible symptoms of sick sinus syndrome:\nSick sinus syndrome sometimes can be caused by other heart conditions. It also may be caused because of advanced age. In many cases, however, the cause is unknown.\nOther medical problems can cause the same symptoms as sick sinus syndrome. Your doctor may order lab tests to help determine why you\u2019re having your symptoms. These labs can be helpful in ruling out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely also order some tests that check your heart. One of these tests iselectrocardiography(also called\u00a0ECG). During this test, your doctor will have you lie down so your heart can be monitored. The ECG machine makes a picture (or tracing) that shows your heart\u2019s electrical signals. Your doctor may also have you wear a special monitor, called a Holter monitor, for a few days to keep track of your heart\u2019s electrical signals.\nDo what you can to keep your heart healthy. Eat anutritious diet.Exercise regularlyif your doctor says you can.Don\u2019t smoke.Limit alcohol. These things may help you prevent heart disease. However, sick sinus syndrome isn\u2019t preventable in all cases.\nMost people who have sick sinus syndrome will need to have an artificial pacemaker put into their body. A pacemaker is a small electronic device that\u2019s put under the skin on your chest. It helps your heart keep a regular beat, especially when your heart beats too slowly.\nIf you have a pacemaker and your heart rate is too fast, your doctor may prescribe medicine to control it. In addition, your doctor may want to change some of your other medicines because some medicines can make sick sinus syndrome worse.\nSick sinus syndrome usually gets worse with time. People with sick sinus syndrome have a higher chance of getting other heart-related conditions. These includeatrial fibrillation(an irregular heartbeat),heart failure, and\u00a0cardiac\u00a0arrest.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byBeth Oller, MD\nTable of Contents\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition you have at birth. It runs in families and is more common in Blacks or African Americans.\nSCD refers to a group of red blood cell disorders. Normal red blood cells are round and flexible. They contain hemoglobin (a protein), which carries oxygen in your blood. With SCD, some red blood cells are misshapen and look like sickles (a C-shaped farm tool). These sickle cells become hard and sticky. They can get stuck\u2014or even burst and die\u2014when traveling through small blood vessels. This slows or blocks blood and oxygen to parts of your body. Sickle cells also contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin. This can also result in cells dying.\nThere are several forms of SCD. They vary based on the sickle cell and hemoglobin genes you inherit from your parents. HbSS is the most common form. It is known as sickle cell anemia. It also is the most severe form of SCD. People who have HbSS get 2 sickle cell genes, 1 from each parent.\nAnother form of SCD is sickle cell trait. People who have this get 1 sickle cell gene from a parent and 1 normal gene from the other parent. Typically, they don\u2019t have SCD symptoms. However, they can pass the sickle cell gene on to their kids.\nAnemia is a common symptom of SCD. It occurs because your body has a hard time creating enough new cells to replace the ones that die early. Side effects of anemia include:\nOther symptoms of SCD include:\nSCD is a condition you inherit from your parents at birth.\nSCD is diagnosed with a simple blood test. It often is included in routine newborn screening tests at birth in the hospital. It\u2019s important to test babies for SCD. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent and manage symptoms of SCD.\nTalk to your doctor if you or your partner has SCD or if it runs in your family. If you\u2019re trying to get pregnant, your doctor can tell you options for genetic counseling. If you have SCD and are pregnant, you should receive extra care to monitor your SCD and treat problems early. Your baby can be tested for SCD during pregnancy.\nSCD can\u2019t be prevented since it\u2019s genetic.\nTreatment for SCD varies for each person. It\u2019s based on your form of SCD, your symptoms, and your overall health. Most treatment options aim to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.\nPain crises are a common symptom of SCD. These painful attacks occur quickly. They can last for a few hours to a few days. They happen when sickle cells get stuck in your blood vessels. This reduces the oxygen that gets to your tissues. You may feel pain in your back, knees, legs, arms, chest, or stomach. Crises are hard to predict. However, there are things you can do to help prevent them.\nNew treatment options have been introduced in recent years. These include bone marrow and stem cell transplants. These two treatments can cure SCD when successful. Transplants require a donor and are risky. They typically only are approved for severe cases. They involve taking bone marrow or stem cells from the donor and implanting them into your body. Transplants have a lot of side effects and can result in death when not successful.\nSCD is a life-long condition. For most people, there is no cure. A managed lifestyle is the best way to reduce symptoms and complications and prolong life.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Sickle Cell Disease\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Sickle Cell Disease\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Sickle Cell Disease\nLast Updated:August 5, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

You often don\u2019t know you are having a silent heart attack. Many people don\u2019t find out until weeks or months later. Recent research suggests that nearly half of all heart attacks are silent heart attacks.\nThe symptoms of a silent heart attack are not as severe as those for a regular heart attack. They can often be mistaken for other conditions. Some people feel no symptoms at all. Pay attention when you feel any of the following:\nIf you experience one or more of these symptoms, call your doctor right away, go to the emergency room, or call 911.\nSilent heart attacks are caused by the same things that cause traditional heart attacks. This happens when part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies because it hasn\u2019t received enough oxygen. This is often due to a blocked artery in the heart. Risk factors for silent heart attacks are also the same. They include:\nMany times, silent heart attacks are found during a routine check-up. If your doctor thinks you may have had one, they may order imaging tests. These could include an echocardiogram or echo, which is a special ultrasound, or a CT scan or MRI of your heart.\nThese tests can show if your heart muscle has been damaged, signaling that you\u2019ve had a heart attack. If you\u2019ve gone to the emergency room with silent heart attack symptoms, the doctor may order blood tests.\nA healthy lifestyle can help prevent any kind of heart attack. This includes:\nNormally, silent heart attacks are found long after the heart attack is over. Treatment will mostly involve taking medicines. These medicines help improve blood flow to your heart, prevent clotting, and reduce the risks of having another heart attack. They include:\nYour doctor will prescribe the medicines that are right for you. If you have had a heart attack, your doctor will also talk to you about lifestyle changes. You can make these changes to prevent more heart problems.\nAfter you\u2019ve had a silent heart attack, you are at higher risk of having another one. This one will likely be more severe and harmful.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated December 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nA sinus infection is a condition in which the lining of your sinuses becomes inflamed. It is caused by bacteria or a virus. When your sinuses are inflamed or swollen for other reasons, it is called sinusitis.\nFour hollow air spaces make up your sinuses. They\u2019re located in the bones behind your cheeks, jaw, and eyebrows. Your sinuses make mucus, a fluid that cleans bacteria and other particles out of the air you breathe. Mucus is removed from your sinuses by draining out your nose. But when your sinuses are swollen, the mucus has nowhere to go. It stays in your sinuses and become painful and uncomfortable.\nThere are four main types of sinus infections:\nThe symptoms of a sinus infection include:\nA sinus infection and COVID-19 do have similar symptoms, so you may be wondering if you have a sinus infection or COVID-19. The best way to tell the difference is to consult your family doctor. They will decide if you need tests for diagnosis.\nWhen bacteria or a virus causes sinusitis, it\u2019s called a sinus infection. This can occur after you\u2019ve had a cold. The virus attacks the lining of your sinuses, causing it to swell and narrow. Your body responds by producing more mucus, but it gets blocked in your sinuses. This buildup is a good place for bacteria to grow.\nOther causes for sinusitis can include:\nYour doctor can diagnose a sinus infection. They will do an exam and review your symptoms. Your doctor also may check your mucus or order an imaging test to confirm it.\nSinus infections can\u2019t be prevented. Certain factors increase your risk of getting an infection. These include:\nHowever, there are some things you can do to try to keep yourself healthy:\nThe simple answer is no, a sinus infection is not contagious. However, if a cold or virus caused your sinus infection, those are contagious.\nThere are several treatment options for sinusitis that is not caused by an infection. They vary depending on the cause of your condition.\nYou can use asaline nasal spray.\u00a0This will clean out your nasal passages and help clear congestion. Your doctor may suggest a decongestant nasal spray to treat swelling. Don\u2019t use this for more than 3 days. It can worsen the swelling in your sinuses once you stop using the medicine.\nA process callednasal irrigationcan provide relief. A saline solution through a device called a neti pot (which looks like a small teapot with a long spout) can flush out your sinuses and help loosen thick mucus. It\u2019s important to use distilled or sterile water or tap water that has been boiled for 3 to 5 minutes and cooled. Regular tap water isn\u2019t safe to use because it hasn\u2019t been properly filtered or treated to be safe in the sinuses. Some tap water contains organisms that can cause serious infections in your nasal passages.\nDecongestant medicinesrelieve sinus pain and pressure. In general, you should only use them short-term.\u00a0Over-the-counter pain relievers\u00a0can relieve aches and fever as well. Talk with your doctor before using any over-the-counter cold medicine. Some can make your symptoms worse or have other side effects.\nYour doctor can\u00a0also prescribe allergy medicine\u00a0to treat conditions caused by allergies.\nSevere sinus infections caused by bacteria may require an antibiotic. Your doctor will instruct you to take this for 5 to 10 days. However, you often will start to feel better after taking it a few days. Make sure you finish all the medicine your doctor prescribes.\nA sinus infection often goes away even without treatment. There are things you can do at home to help yourself feel better.\nContact your doctor if you:\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Sinusitis\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration: Is Rinsing Your Sinuses With Neti Pots Safe?\nCenters for Disease Control: Antibiotic Prescribing and Use: Sinus Infection\nLast Updated:December 15, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

It can also cause dryness in other places that need moisture. This includes the nose, throat, or skin. It is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks your body by mistake. In Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, the immune system attacks the glands that make tears and saliva (spit). The damage keeps the glands from working properly.\nThe most common symptom of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome is severe dryness in the eyes and mouth. This lasts for at least 3 months and isn\u2019t caused by any medicines you are taking.\nIn more severe cases of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, other parts of your body may be affected by the condition. These could include:\nSymptoms in these areas include:\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. It usually affects women over age 40. It is 9 times more common in women than in men. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome may develop in people who have other autoimmune diseases, such asrheumatoid arthritis,Hashimoto\u2019s disease, orlupus. Research shows that genetic factors could make a person more likely to develop the disease.\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid getting Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\nThere is no cure for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Treatment involves easing the symptoms that the disease causes. Over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription eye drops can help with dry eyes. In more severe cases, the tear ducts that drain tears from your eyes can be plugged or blocked. To treat dry mouth, you can drink water, chew gum, or use saliva substitutes. If necessary, your doctor can prescribe medicines that will help your body make more tears and saliva. These treatments can help relieve some of the dryness. But usually it doesn\u2019t go away completely.\nIf you have joint pain associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, your doctor may recommend taking an OTCnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)such as ibuprofen (two brand names: Advil, Motrin). This medicine can help relieve the pain and swelling in your joints.\nDepending on your symptoms and whether you have organ damage from Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, your doctor may prescribe other medicines and treatments.\nCurrently, there is not a cure for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. However, in most cases, treatment can help relieve your symptoms and prevent complications. The majority of people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome are healthy and don\u2019t have serious complications from the disease.\nPeople with the disease do have more risk of having some problems because of the long-term decrease in tears and saliva. These include infections in or around the eyes and dental problems such as cavities. Make sure you are taking good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly. If you notice any pain or redness in your eyes, get it looked at right away.

Almost all skin cancers are the result of too much exposure to ultraviolet light. This is found in sunlight, tanning booths, and sunlamps. Skin cancer is usually one of the most curable types of cancer, especially when patients participate in regular screenings.\nBasal cell carcinomaandsquamous cell carcinomaare two of the most common forms of skin cancer. They are very curable. These cancers occur in the basal and squamous cell layers at the top of the skin. They are almost always slow-growing. If found early, they are easy to treat and do not spread.\nMelanomais a less common but aggressive form of skin cancer. It occurs in skin cells that make a skin color pigment called melanin. If it is not found early, it will likely spread to other tissues. It can spread through the whole body and may cause death. Only 2% of skin cancer cases are melanoma. But it causes the most deaths from skin cancer.\nThe main symptom of skin cancer is a new or changing bump, growth, lesion, mole, or rough patch of skin. Not all skin cancers look alike.\nA normal\u00a0mole\u00a0is solid tan, brown, dark brown, or flesh colored. Its edges are well defined. It\u2019s usually smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter (not bigger than a pencil eraser). It has a round or oval shape. It is flat or dome-like.\nTheABCDErule can help you remember what to look for when you\u2019re checking for moles. If you notice any of these signs, talk to your doctor right away.\nOther signs of cancer could include:\nMost skin cancers occur on parts of the body that are repeatedly exposed to the sun. For men, these areas include the head, neck, face, tips of the ears, hands, forearms, shoulders, back, and chests. For women, they occur most commonly on the back and the lower legs.\nMelanomas can be anywhere on your body. In men, they are most often on the chest, stomach, or back. In women, they are most often on the lower legs.\nMoles also can grow in hidden areas of your body. This includes between toes, on your scalp, or under a nail. If you notice a mole that has changed, or if you have a new mole that doesn\u2019t look like your other moles, see your family doctor right away.\nMost cases of skin cancer are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. There are 2 types of UV rays:\nResearchers used to believe that only UVB rays led to cancer. But studies have shown that both UVA and UVB damage the skin and can cause cancer.\nA tan is the body\u2019s attempt to protect itself from the sun\u2019s harmful rays. Even if you don\u2019t burn, being in the sun too often for too long can lead to skin cancer. Tanning booths are just as dangerous as long periods of sunlight.\nSome people are more at risk of developing skin cancer. Things that could increase your risk include:\nMelanoma can occur anywhere on your body. This includes places that aren\u2019t exposed to the sun. There could be other factors that can cause it. Risk factors for developing melanoma include:\nCertain medications are also associated with increased risk of skin cancer. One example is hydrochlorothiazide, a common blood pressure medication.\nThe first step to diagnosing skin cancer is usually through regular self-examination. Use a full-length mirror and a handheld mirror to check every inch of your skin.\nBy checking yourself regularly, you are familiar with what\u2019s normal for your skin. If you find anything unusual, see your family doctor. The earlier skin cancer is found, the better.\nYour doctor will examine your skin. They will look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any concerning areas. If you have skin changes that might be skin cancer, your doctor will do a\u00a0biopsy. During a biopsy, a small piece of your skin is removed and sent to the lab for testing.\nIf skin cancer is diagnosed, you may undergo more tests to see if the cancer cells have spread. These tests could include a CT scan, MRI, or lymph node biopsy.\nThe key to preventing skin cancer is to avoid being in the sun or using sunlamps. If you\u2019re going to be in the sun for any length of time, follow safe-sun guidelines. These are ways to protect your skin and reduce your risk of skin cancer. For the best protection, follow all of these guidelines every time you\u2019re outside.\nRemember, you\u2019re not completely safe just because you\u2019re wearing sunscreen. Sunscreen cannot give you 100% protection against the sun\u2019s harmful UV radiation.\nWear protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants made of tightly woven fabric. If the clothes fit loosely, you will feel cooler. Special sun-protective clothes are available from several companies.\nWear sunglasses to protect your eyes. Sun exposure increases your risk of gettingcataracts. Choose sunglasses that protect the sides of your eyes and block both UVA and UVB rays.\nRemember that you are exposed to the sun while driving, especially your hands and arms. Clouds and water don\u2019t protect you. UV rays can reach swimmers at least 1 foot below the surface of the water, and 60% to 80% of the sun\u2019s rays go through clouds. The sun\u2019s rays also can reflect off water, snow, white sand, and concrete.\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) advises talking to children, teens, and young adults, who are 10 to 24 years of age, about the dangers of too much sun exposure. Teach them how to protect themselves and reduce their risk of skin cancer.\nTreatment for skin cancer depends on several factors. These include the type of cancer, where it is located, how big it is, how far it has spread, and your general health. Most cases of nonmelanoma cancers can be taken care of with surgical removal of the mole or lesion. Other options include freezing, medicated creams, or laser therapy.\nTreatment for melanoma is more complex. When caught early, the cancerous tissue can be removed with surgery. If it has spread beyond the skin, treatments could include:\nSkin cancer is treatable, especially when caught early. Cancerous tissue can be removed with a minor surgical procedure. In many cases, that is all the treatment needed. Future lesions may occur. You will need to continue checking your skin. Call \u00a0your doctor if you see changes.\nFor more advanced cases, living with cancer during treatment can be stressful. Each treatment can have different side effects on your body. Take good care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, and try to keep your energy up by staying active.\nEven after your cancer goes into remission, you are at higher risk of cancer returning to your body.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nSleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder. People who have sleep apnea stop breathing for 10 to 30 seconds at a time while they are sleeping. These short stops in breathing can happen up to 400 times every night. If you have sleep apnea, periods of not breathing can disturb your sleep (even if they don\u2019t fully wake you up).\nMen, people who are overweight, have endocrine disorders, neuromuscular conditions, heart or kidney failure, genetic syndromes, premature birth, and people who are older than 40 years of age are more likely to have sleep apnea. However, it can affect anyone at any age, even children.\nBecause some of the symptoms of sleep apnea occur while you\u2019re sleeping, your bed partner may notice them first. You, or that person, may notice heavy snoring or long pauses in your breathing during sleep.\nEven if you don\u2019t remember waking up during the night, you may notice daytime sleepiness (such as falling asleep at work, while driving, or when talking), irritability, or fatigue. You may also experience morning headaches, forgetfulness, mood changes, and a decreased interest in sex\nThere are two kinds of sleep apnea: obstructive apnea and central apnea.\nObstructive sleep apneais the most common type. Nine out of 10 people who have sleep apnea have this type of apnea. If you have obstructive apnea, something is blocking the airway that brings air into your body (also called the trachea). When you try to breathe, you can\u2019t get enough air because of the blockage. Your airway might be blocked by your tongue, tonsils, or uvula (the little piece of flesh that hangs down in the back of your throat). It might also be blocked by a large amount of fatty tissue in the throat or by relaxed throat muscles.\nCentral sleep apneais less common. This type of sleep apnea is related to the function of the central nervous system. If you have this type of apnea, the muscles you use to breathe don\u2019t get the \u201cgo-ahead\u201d signal from your brain. Either the brain doesn\u2019t send the signal, or the signal gets interrupted.\nYour doctor can diagnose sleep apnea. He or she may ask you if you feel tired or sleepy during the day. Your doctor may also want to know about your bedtime habits and how well you sleep. Your doctor may ask you to go to a sleep disorder center for a sleep study. Tests done at the sleep disorder center may reveal which kind of sleep apnea you have. Or, you may be able to do your sleep study at home.\nThere are things you can do to prevent sleep apnea. The following steps help many people:\nCertain dental devices can be used to treat mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea. These devices move your jaw forward to make breathing easier.\nA common treatment for sleep apnea is called\u201ccontinuous positive airway pressure,\u201d or CPAP. In this treatment, you wear a special mask over your nose (and sometimes mouth, too) while you are sleeping. The mask will keep your airway open by adding pressure to the air you breathe. It helps most people who have sleep apnea.\nIn very few cases, surgery is necessary to remove tonsils or extra tissue from the throat.\nSleep apnea can cause serious problems if it isn\u2019t treated. Your risk of high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer, and cognitive and behavioral disorders is higher if you have serious sleep apnea that goes untreated. You are also more likely to have traffic accidents if you drive while you\u2019re sleepy.

They look like they are awake. Sleepwalking occurs during deep sleep. It happens early in the night during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Usually, a person has no memory of it. Sleepwalking is more common in children and young adults. This is because older people don\u2019t experience deep sleep as often. Some of the things people do while sleepwalking, include:\nSleepwalking can last a few seconds to 30 minutes. It could last longer. The average sleepwalking episode lasts 10 minutes. While sleepwalking, a person may look confused or dazed. If you talk to the person during the episode, he or she will not respond.\nSleepwalking isn\u2019t as worrisome as you may think. A person\u2019s safety is the biggest concern. And sleepwalking rarely involves unsafe behavior.\nTalk to a doctor if sleepwalking is chronic. Tell your doctor if it causes fatigue during the day or attention problems. Typically, there are no exams or tests for sleepwalking. If your doctor is concerned, he or she may look into other medical causes. This might include seizures. He or she also may look at a person\u2019s emotional history.\nIf the problem is chronic, your doctor may discuss medicines to treat it. He or she also may recommend keeping a sleep diary. This would be helpful in tracking episodes.\nIt is a myth that you should not wake a sleepwalker. It is okay to do so.

    "article_title": "What is slipped capital femoral epiphysis?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a hip problem. It starts if the epiphysis (growing end) of the femur (thigh bone) slips from the ball of the hip joint. SCFE may develop in one or both legs.\nSCFE usually occurs in children between the ages of 8 and 15 years old. It often happens during a growth spurt. It\u2019s also more common in children who have a family history of SCFE. More boys than girls get SCFE. It\u2019s more common in blacks than whites. Children who have obesity have a much higher risk of getting SCFE.\nThere are two types of slipped capital femoral epiphysis: stable and unstable.\nA child is considered to have stable SCFE if they can walk with or without crutches. More than 90% of cases of SCFE are stable.\nA child who has stable SCFE may first have stiffness in the hip. The stiffness may get better with rest. After a while, the stiffness may turn into a limp. The child may have pain that comes and goes. The pain is often felt in the groin, the thigh, or the knee, and not in the hip itself.\nLater, the child may lose some ability to move the involved hip. This leg will usually twist out. It may look shorter than the other leg. The child may not be able to play sports or run. Your child may also have trouble with regular tasks such as bending over to tie shoes. The symptoms may change gradually or rapidly.\nA child who can\u2019t walk, even with crutches, has unstable SCFE. Unstable SCFE often happens after a trauma, such as a sports injury or a fall. Falling can also cause a stable SCFE to become unstable.\nA child who has unstable SCFE has extreme pain. The pain is similar to what might be felt with a broken bone. The child probably won\u2019t be able to move the injured leg. If you think your child has unstable SCFE, don\u2019t force the leg to move. That could make the thigh bone slip even more.\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of SCFE.\nYour child\u2019s doctor will talk with you and your child about their symptoms. The doctor may watch your child\u2019s gait (how they walk). Your doctor may order X-rays of your child\u2019s pelvis and thigh.\nIf your child is severely overweight, losing weight may help reduce the chance of getting SCFE.\nOnce SCFE is diagnosed, treatment is needed right away. That usually means surgery. Your doctor will probably refer your child to an orthopedic surgeon. This is a doctor who fixes bone problems.\nThe most common surgery of SCFE is called in-situ fixation. With this treatment, the bone is held in place with a screw. This screw keeps the thigh bone from slipping and will close the growth plate. This usually works for children with stable SCFE. The results of this treatment are good, and it has few complications.\nOther surgical treatments (including in-situ fixation with more than one screw) are used less often. Ask your doctor to explain the potential benefits and risks of the treatment options.\nIf SCFE is caught early, there is a good chance for full recovery, especially if it is stable. Research suggests that 30% to 60% of children diagnosed with SCFE will have it occur later in the other leg. This means close follow up and monitoring are important. Sometimes surgery is done to prevent this from occurring. Some children who have had SCFE may get arthritis in the hip later in life.\nIf your child has surgery, it will take time to get better. For 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, your child will need to use crutches to walk. Then your child can slowly get back into normal activities. They may be able to return to running and contact sports.\nComplications sometimes happen with SCFE. The most serious complications are avascular necrosis (a lack of blood flow to the bone) and chondrolysis (decay of cartilage). Your doctor can explain these issues to you, if needed.\nLast Updated:September 23, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nSmall vessel disease is a condition that affects the tiny arteries in your heart. It is caused when these arteries are damaged and don\u2019t dilate properly. It is also called coronary microvascular disease. Your small vessels expand and contract to provide blood to your heart. They send more blood when you exercise or exert yourself. They send less blood when you are at rest. Small vessel disease makes blood flow more difficult.\nAngina is the most common symptom of small vessel disease. Angina feels like pain or pressure in your chest. It can make you sweat or make it hard to catch your breath. The pain can spread to your arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder. The symptom is similar to a heart attack.\nOther symptoms of small vessel disease include:\nMost people who have small vessel disease notice symptoms in their daily routine. You also can have them when you are active or stressed. If left untreated, small vessel disease forces your heart to work harder to pump blood. This puts you at risk for heart attack and heart failure.\nWomen are at higher risk for small vessel disease. Other risk factors include:\nA narrowing of your heart arteries leads to small vessel disease. This can be caused by:\nSmall vessel disease is not the same as coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD affects the large vessels in your heart. They carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart. CAD is caused by a build-up of a fatty substance (plaque) in your large vessels. When your heart lacks blood and oxygen, you can have a heart attack.\nTalk to your doctor if you have any of the symptoms of small vessel disease. Small vessel disease is hard to diagnose. This is because the vessels are so tiny. Your doctor may perform tests to examine your symptoms. He or she will make sure the blockage is not in your large coronary vessels.\nIf you have severe chest pain that extends from your chest to your jaw or left arm, get help right away.\nThe best way to prevent small vessel disease is by reducing your risk factors.\nMedicine can help control the narrowing of your small blood vessels. It also can help control your symptoms, such as pain and high blood pressure. Surgery is not an option because the vessels are so small.\nYour doctor will want routine check-ups to monitor how you are doing. The frequency of these check-ups will depend on the severity of your disease. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms. Also tell your doctor if you\u2019ve ever had anemia.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nSocial phobia, also called social anxiety disorder, is a fear of being judged by others during social situations. This includes, work, parties, family gatherings, etc. Most people feel nervous in certain social situations, such as at a job interview or when giving a speech. Most of us worry about what we\u2019re going to say, do, or wear during events like these. These situations often become easier with some experience. However, for people who have social\u00a0phobia\u00a0these situations can be frightening and unbearable.\nThere are different levels of social phobia. For instance, some people may only have symptoms in one specific situation, such as performing on stage or speaking to a crowd. Others may have it any time they are out in public or around people.\nPeople who have social phobia can experience internal and external symptoms.\nInternal (emotional) symptoms include:\nExternal (physical) symptoms include:\nPeople who have social phobia often realize that their fears are not rational or warranted. However, they may still dread social situations. They may even go out of their way to avoid events. If they do go to an event, they usually feel nervous before the event and uncomfortable during it. Afterward, the unpleasant symptoms and feelings may linger as they worry about what people thought of them.\nSocial phobia is about twice as common in women as it is in men. Most people notice it as children or teens. The condition can be genetic and run in families. Other potential factors include hormones and environment. For example, race, culture, economic status, and neglect can increase a person\u2019s risk. Social phobia also can be related to other conditions, including depression, other anxiety disorders, or addiction.\nTalk to your family doctor if you have symptoms of social phobia. They will want to know about your symptoms, health history, and family history. When diagnosing the condition, the doctor will look for:\nYour doctor may reference theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).They may refer you to a specialist, such as a psychologist.\nThere is little you can do to prevent social phobia. You can get treatment to help manage, reduce, or relieve symptoms. You can learn to adjust in social situations you must participate in, such as work. Also, you can learn to adapt, such as attending a party for a shorter time.\nSocial phobia is an ongoing disorder that should be treated with medical care. It is real and does not usually go away on its own. Your family doctor can help you find ways to manage your symptoms. A range of treatment includes:\nCognitive\u00a0behavioral therapy (CBT). Thishelps people think about social situations in a different way. The goal of therapy is to remove the thoughts and actions that are driving anxiety. CBT teaches you how to address fear, cope with stress, and improve social skills. Your doctor may suggest group or family therapy in addition to CBT.\nSocial skills training. This can teach a person some strategies for handling certain types of social situations.\nPrescription medicines. Your doctor may recommend prescription medicine. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines are most common. Beta-blockers may help people who have a certain form of social phobia called \u201cperformance anxiety.\u201d You can take them before a performance to help ease anxiety. Medicines may take a while to begin working. Do not stop taking anxiety medicine without talking to your doctor first.\nSocial phobia can make it hard to go to work, school, or take part in daily activities. It can affect your ability to make and keep friends. It is not a condition that you should have to deal with alone. Talk to loved ones and your doctor to begin treatment. It is common to choose a combination of therapy and medicine. Your doctor should monitor your treatment and progress.\nPeople who have social anxiety may try to self-medicate by experimenting with and becoming dependent on the use of alcohol or illegal drugs to manage a situation. This puts them at higher risk of substance abuse.\nDiet and exercise also are important in managing the symptoms of social anxiety. This includes regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine and over-the-counter cold medicines.\nAnxiety and Depression Association of America: Social Anxiety Disorder\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Social anxiety disorder\nNational Institute of Mental Health: Social Anxiety Disorder: More Than Just Shyness\nLast Updated:January 26, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nSomatic symptom and related disorders is the name for a group of conditions in which the physical pain and symptoms a person feels are related to psychological factors. Such pain and symptoms result in excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors and can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to function and maintain relationships. These symptoms can\u2019t be traced to a specific physical cause. In people who have a somatic symptom and related disorders, medical test results are either normal or don\u2019t explain the person\u2019s symptoms.\nPeople who have this disorder may have several medical evaluations and tests to be sure that they don\u2019t have another illness. They often become very worried about their health because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing their health problems. Their symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other illnesses and may last for several years. People who have a somatoform disorder are not faking their symptoms. The pain that they feel is real.\nThere are several types of somatic symptom and related disorders.\nSomatization disorderusually involves pain and severe neurological symptoms (such as headache, fatigue). Other symptoms include:\nHypochondriasisoccurs when a person believes that normal body functions (such as a grumbling stomach) or minor symptoms (such as a common headache) are symptoms of a very serious disorder. To a person who has hypochondriasis, a grumbling stomach may mean stomach cancer. A headache may mean a brain tumor.\nBody dysmorphic disorderoccurs when a person becomes obsessed with a flaw in their physical appearance. The flaw is either a minor flaw or a flaw that doesn\u2019t exist. They constantly worry about the perceived flaw, which can be any part of the body. Common concerns for people who have body dysmorphic disorder include:\nConversion disorderis when physical symptoms that are similar to a neurological disorder develop even though no neurological disorder is actually present. Common symptoms include:\nStress may make the symptoms worse.\nNo one knows exactly why symptoms of somatic symptom and related disorders appear. In some cases, there may be a problem with the nerve impulses that send signals of pain, pressure, and other unpleasant sensations to the brain. We do know that the pain and problems caused by somatic symptom and related disorders are real. They are not imagined.\nLike many medical problems, somatic symptom and related disorders often run in families. They also tend to come and go over time.\nSomatic symptom and related disorders can be difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will do a physical exam and possibly order tests. If tests show that you aren\u2019t sick, your doctor may refer you to a mental health provider. In general, your doctor will evaluate whether you are experiencing:\nPeople with somatic symptom disorder typically see their primary care physician rather than seek counseling or mental health care. This may be due to the fact that people experiencing this disorder can\u2019t accept a mental health diagnosis. They may continue to be fearful and worried even when they are shown evidence that they do not have a serious condition. Some people have only pain as their dominant symptom. Somatic symptom disorder usually begins by age 30.\nThere is no known way to prevent somatic symptom and related disorders.\nAlthough there is no known cure for somatoform disorders, they can be managed. Treatment focuses on helping the person who has the disorder to live as much of a normal life as possible. Even with treatment, they may still have some pain or other symptoms. Fortunately, a somatoform disorder will not shorten a person\u2019s life.\nYour doctor may be able to prescribe medicine for some of your symptoms. They may prescribe an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine to treat depressive and anxiety disorders, In many cases you will not need medicine for physical symptoms.\nLiving with somatic symptom and related disorders can be hard. You may feel as though no one believes that you are really sick. You may not understand why this is happening to you. You may become frustrated with your body. Work with you doctor to manage your symptoms.\nSeeing your doctor for regular checkups is the most important part of your treatment. Your doctor will tell you how often they need to see you. You may feel frustrated if your symptoms continue but remember that somatoform disorders can be very difficult to treat.

It feels irritated or scratchy. You may feel mild discomfort or a burning pain. A sore throat may feel worse when you swallow. Possible complications from a sore throat include ear and sinus infections. Another complication is an abscess (buildup of pus) near your tonsils. There are various ways to soothe a sore throat depending on its cause.\nDepending on the cause of your sore throat, symptoms may include:\nIn some cases, additional symptoms may include:\nMost sore throats are caused by viruses, such as the cold or flu virus. Some of the more serious causes of sore throat includetonsillitis,strep throat,andmononucleosis (mono). Other causes include smoking, mouth breathing at night while you sleep, pollution, and allergies to pets, pollens and molds. General anesthesia during surgery can also cause a sore throat.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. They will look at the back of your throat. Your doctor may swab the back of your throat. This is called a throat culture. It is done to collect a sample of bacteria. This also is used in a rapid strep test. This is a quick test to diagnose strep throat. The test won\u2019t tell if your sore throat is caused by something other than strep. The results of a throat culture take between 24 and 48 hours. If your doctor thinks you may have mono, they will probably do a blood test.\nThe best way to avoid a sore throat is to avoid getting sick. Avoid catching or spreading the viruses and bacteria that cause a sore throat. Wash your hands regularly. Avoid touching your eyes or mouth. Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.\nIf your sore throat is cause by the flu, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Antibiotics don\u2019t work on viruses. Most sore throats caused by a cold or flu-type virus go away in a week to 10 days.\nIf your sore throat is caused by bacteria, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. You will feel better in a few days. It is important to take all your antibiotics. This reduces the risk that your sore throat will return.\nSymptoms caused by mono can last for 4 weeks or more. The treatment for mono is rest and reduced exercise.\nIf a sore throat is caused by allergies, your doctor may talk to you about allergy triggers. They may recommend medicine for the allergy.\nIf your sore throat is caused by tonsillitis, you may need an operation. This is called a tonsillectomy. The surgery removes your tonsils. Most people who have tonsillitis don\u2019t need surgery, however you might need surgery if you get severe tonsillitis often.

But if your child doesn\u2019t talk as much as most children of the same age, the problem may be speech delay.\nA speech and language delay is when a child isn\u2019t developing speech and language at an expected rate. It\u2019s a common developmental problem that affects as many as 10% of preschool children.\nYour child may have a speech delay if they aren\u2019t able to do these things:\nThe most common causes of speech delay include:\nOther developmental or genetic disorders include:\nLiving in a bilingual home also may affect a child\u2019s language and speech. The child\u2019s brain has to work harder to interpret and use 2 languages. So, it may take longer for these children to start using one or both languages they\u2019re learning. It\u2019s not unusual for a bilingual child to use one language for a while.\nYour doctor can help you recognize a speech and language delay. They will ask you what you have heard and can listen to your child\u2019s speech and check your child\u2019s mental development.\nYour doctor may refer you to other specialists to determine why your child isn\u2019t speaking. For example, if your doctor thinks your child may have trouble hearing, they may refer your child to an audiologist for a hearing test. This is a licensed health care professional who treats hearing problems.\nDepending on the cause of your child\u2019s speech delay, you may not be able to prevent or avoid it.\nYour child may not need treatment. Some children just take more time to start talking. But if your child needs treatment, the type will depend on the cause of the speech delay. Your doctor will tell you the cause of your child\u2019s issue and talk to you about treatment options. Your doctor may refer you to a speech and language pathologist. This person can show you how to help your child talk more and speak better, and also can teach your child how to listen or how to lip read.\nTeaching young babies and children a version of sign language also can help them with their language development. Contrary to what some might think, using sign language with babies and young children does not delay their language development.\nOther specialists your doctor may recommend you see include a psychologist (a specialist in behavior problems), an occupational therapist (for help with daily activities), or a social worker (who can help with family problems). Your doctor may also suggest early intervention programs in your area. Many are associated with your local school district\nIf your child\u2019s speech is delayed due to a hearing loss, hearing aids or cochlear implants may help your child hear speech. Once your child has access to sound (and speech), they may be able to develop language and even catch up to their hearing peers.\nIf your child hears and understands language, you can encourage them to speak by talking as much as you can around them. Describe what you\u2019re doing as you do everyday activities. Keep talking. If your child speaks, confirm what they are saying. Always provide positive feedback.\nSpeech and language delays can be frustrating for parents and children. Children who can\u2019t express their thoughts and emotions are more likely to act out. They anger easily. They may use unexpected behavior to get your attention. Try to remember your child does want to communicate with you. Read to your child and talk as much as you can.

This can cause damage to the spinal cord and nerves. It can cause lifelong problems, including physical and intellectual disabilities. Spina bifida is aneural tube defect.\nSpina bifida develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she\u2019s pregnant.\nThere are three forms \u2014 and three levels of severity \u2014 of spina bifida.\nWith the occulta form of spina bifida, symptoms may never occur. However, symptoms of the meningocele or myelomeningocele forms can be seen after your baby is born. They include:\nAlso, if your baby has a dimple or unusual patch of hair in a certain spot on their back, this may alert your doctor to test for spina bifida.\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes spina bifida. Genetics and ethnicity (Caucasian and Hispanic) may play a role.\nHowever, you can take steps to reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.\nIt\u2019s possible for your doctor to diagnose your baby with spina bifida even before they\u2019re born. Your doctor may order a screening during pregnancy if:\nIf your doctor wants to do a screening while you\u2019re pregnant, they may do the following:\nThen, after your baby is born, your doctor may order an X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scan to better check for and determine the severity of spina bifida.\nStudies show that folic acid can reduce the risk of spina bifida. Folic acid is a vitamin present in women before and during pregnancy. A pregnant woman should take 400 micrograms of folic acid every day throughout pregnancy. This is especially important for unplanned pregnancies. A higher dose may be necessary for pregnant women with certain risk factors. This includes obesity, diabetes, depression, or a family history of spina bifida.\nEating foods high in folic acid also can help. These include:\nThere\u2019s no medicine or cure for spina bifida. Babies with myelomeningocele and meningocele will likely need treatment. That\u2019s often in the form of surgery. When surgery happens depends on the type and severity of the condition. Some babies may have surgery while they\u2019re still in their mother\u2019s womb. Others will have surgery 1 to 2 days after being born. Some children will need to have repeated surgeries as they grow older.\nIf your baby has physical disabilities, your doctor also may refer them to a physical therapist. This is a specialist who can help your child increase their strength and balance.\nLiving with spina bifida depends on the severity of your child\u2019s case. In minor instances, mild complications are possible, including:\nMore serious cases may have severe complications, including:\nIn cases where a child has a hard time moving independently, a physical therapist can teach your child how to be mobile.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nYour spinal cord is made up of bundles of nerves and nerve cells. These carry messages from your brain to the different parts of your body. Your spinal cord runs from the base of your brain to your waist. It is protected by your backbone, or spinal column. The backbone is made up of bony rings in your back called vertebrae.\nThere are many common causes of spinal cord injury including falling, sports-related events, and car accidents. The spinal cord also can be injured as a result of diseases such as polio or spina bifida.\nSymptoms of a spinal cord injury (SCI) vary. They depend on the type, location, and severity of the injury. An entire loss of muscle control and feeling is called a complete SCI. Some muscle control and sensation is called an incomplete SCI. Injuries that occur higher up the spinal cord usually result in more severe symptoms.\nParalysis is a common symptom of spinal cord injuries. It is a loss of movement in part of your body. When this happens, there may be some or no feeling in the paralyzed area. Damaged vertebrae in your neck can paralyze your arms, chest, and legs. It also can affect the muscles that control breathing. Damaged vertebrae in your upper or lower back areas can paralyze your chest and legs.\nImmediate signs of an SCI include:\nIn addition to these symptoms, ongoing issues may be:\nIf you think someone has an injury to their head, neck, or back:\nThere are two main causes of a spinal cord injury. The first is a blow to the spinal column. It can damage your spinal cord or the nearby vertebrae or tissue, which can pinch the cord. This can result from a car accident, sports injury, fall, or assault, such as a gunshot or knife wound. Additional damage can occur in the following days. Bleeding, swelling, and fluid buildup can put pressure on your spinal cord.\nDisease also can cause a spinal cord injury. Examples include arthritis and polio. Osteoporosis and aging are risk factors. These can weaken your spinal column and make you more prone to SCIs. Spina bifida (\u201csplit spine\u201d) is a birth defect that can act like an SCI.\nA doctor will diagnose your spinal cord injury. They will keep you immobile (still) during tests at the hospital. Possible tests are an X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests take pictures of the vertebrae to show if there is any damage. Your doctor also will perform a neurological exam. This helps them determine how severe the injury is. They will see how much muscle control you have and whether or not you can feel sensations. All of these tests diagnose the level and completeness of your injury.\nSCIs that occur from disease cannot be prevented. However, SCIs that are caused by accidents or sports injuries may be prevented. Prevention would include not participating in the activity that puts you at risk for injury.\nA team of doctors will decide the best treatment for your spinal cord injury. In the short-term, medicine can help reduce swelling of the SCI. Methylprednisolone is a cortisone or steroid medicine. If it is given right away, it can reduce damage to your nerve cells. You may need surgery to stabilize your spine or remove bone or tissue that is pressing on your spinal cord. Your doctor will put you in traction to keep your head and body still during surgery.\nLong-term treatment options have several benefits. They help prevent blood clots, muscle shrinkage, calcium loss, and thinning of your skin. Treatments include:\nYour recovery depends on how severe your injury is. In most cases, improvement occurs within the first 6 months of injury. However, some people continue to make progress beyond that. There is no cure for SCIs, so you will need ongoing treatment.\nPeople who have spinal cord injuries can live full, happy lives. They can work, get married, and have children. Some can go to events, play sports, and drive cars.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nSquamous cell carcinoma is a common form of skin cancer. It develops in the thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the skin. It is usually caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This can happen by being outside in the sun, or by using tanning beds. Squamous cell carcinoma usually is found on the face, ears, neck, hands, or arms. It can also occur in other areas of the body.\nThe main symptom of squamous cell carcinoma is a new or changing bump, growth, lesion, skin spot, or rough patch of skin. Not all skin cancers look the same. A helpful way to see if you have signs of skin cancer is called the ABCDE rule. Look at your skin spots for these signs:\nOther signs of cancer could include:\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, or if you have a new skin spot that looks different from your other skin spots, see your family doctor right away.\nMost cases of squamous cell carcinoma are caused by too much exposure to UV radiation. This can come from the sun or from UV lights in tanning beds.\nSome people are more at risk of developing this form of skin cancer. Things that could increase your risk include:\nThe first step in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma is regular self-examination. By checking your skin and skin spots regularly, you become familiar with what is normal for you. Then, if you see something abnormal, you can see your doctor.\nYour doctor will examine your skin. They will look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any concerning areas. If you have changes that could be skin cancer, your doctor will remove a piece of the affected skin. This is called a biopsy. The piece of skin will be sent to a lab for testing.\nIf skin cancer is diagnosed, you may need to undergo more tests to see if the cancer cells have spread. These tests could include imaging, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan, MRI, or PET scan, or lymph node biopsy.\nMost cases of squamous cell carcinoma can be prevented by avoiding exposure to UV rays.\nIf squamous cell carcinoma is caught early, it is usually easy to treat. Examine your skin once a month. See your family doctor right away if you find anything that looks suspicious.\nTreatment for squamous cell carcinoma depends on several factors. These include where the cancer is, how big it is, how far it has spread, and your general health. Most cases can be taken care of with a minor surgical procedure or topical treatment (liquid, cream, or ointment).\nOptions include:\nMost cases of squamous cell carcinoma can be cured with treatment. How well you do after treatment depends on many things, including how early the cancer was diagnosed. Left untreated, this skin cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including internal organs. This could cause serious health problems and advance the stage of the cancer.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common, but many people don\u2019t recognize the signs or know how to protect themselves. Understanding STI symptoms and prevention is essential for maintaining sexual health. Some infections cause visible symptoms, while others may go unnoticed without testing. Knowing how STIs spread\u2014and how to reduce your risk\u2014can help you stay healthy and informed.\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs)are infections you can get by having sex with someone who has an infection. These infections are usually passed from person to person through vaginal intercourse. They can also be passed through anal sex, oral sex, or skin-to-skin contact. STIs can be caused by viruses or bacteria. STIs caused by viruses includehepatitis B,herpes, HIV, and thehuman papilloma virus(HPV). STIs caused by bacteria includechlamydia, gonorrhea, andsyphilis.\nAsk. Although it may be uncomfortable, talk to your partner before having any sexual contact. Ask if he or she is at risk for having an STI. Some of the risk factors are having sex with several partners, using injected drugs and having had an STI in the past. To be safe, protect yourself no matter what the person says. You must also tell your partner if you have an STI. You aren\u2019t doing yourself or your partner any favors by trying to hide it.\nThe most common symptoms of STIs include:\nIf you\u2019ve ever had sex, you may be at risk for having an STI. Your risk is higher if you have had many sex partners, have had sex with someone who has had many partners, or have had sex without using condoms.\nMost STIs can be diagnosed through an exam by your doctor, a culture of the secretions from your vagina or penis, or through a blood test.\nThe only sure way to prevent STIs is by not having sex. If you have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by only having sex with someone who isn\u2019t having sex with anyone else and who doesn\u2019t have an STI.\nYou should always use condoms when having sex, including oral and anal sex.\nMale latex condoms can reduce your risk of getting an STI if used correctly. Be sure to use them every time you have sex. Female condoms aren\u2019t as effective as male condoms. However, you should use them when a man won\u2019t use a male condom.\nRemember, though, that condoms aren\u2019t 100% safe. They can\u2019t protect you from coming into contact with some sores (such as those that can occur with herpes) or warts (which can be caused by HPV infection).\nLimit the number of sex partners you have. Ask your partner if he or she has, or has had, an STI. Tell your partner if you have had one. Talk about whether you\u2019ve both been tested for STIs and whether you should be tested.\nLook for signs of an STI in your sex partner. But remember that STIs don\u2019t always cause symptoms. Don\u2019t have sex if you or your partner are being treated for an STI.\nWash your genitals with soap and water and urinate soon after you have sex. This may help clean away some germs before they have a chance to infect you.\nNo. It was once thought that spermicides with nonoxynol-9 could help prevent STIs much like they help prevent pregnancy \u2014 by damaging the organisms that cause the diseases. New research has shown that nonoxynol-9 can irritate a woman\u2019s vagina and cervix, actually increasing the risk of STI infection.\nBe sure to check the ingredients of any other sex-related products you own, such as lubricants and condoms. Some brands of these products may have nonoxynol-9 added to them. If you are unsure if your spermicide or any other product contains nonoxynol-9, ask your doctor before using it.\nSTIs that are caused by bacteria (such as chlamydia) can be cured with antibiotics. But STIs caused by a virus (such as HIV or herpes) can\u2019t be cured. Your doctor can only treat the symptoms that the virus causes.\nDon\u2019t wait to be treated. Early treatment helps prevent serious health problems. Even if medicine can\u2019t completely cure the STI, it can help keep you from getting really sick. If you are given medicine for an STI, take it exactly as the doctor says.\nSee your doctor if you\u2019re at risk for having an STI, if you have any of the symptoms, or if you have concerns about whether you have one. STIs can cause serious health problems if left untreated.\nFor example, chlamydia can lead to problems that can cause women not to be able to have children (infertility). HPV can lead to cancer of the cervix or penis. Syphilis can lead to paralysis, mental problems, heart damage, blindness, and even death.\nBeing informed about STI symptoms and prevention empowers you to take control of your sexual health. Regular testing, practicing safe sex, and knowing the signs of infection can help you prevent complications and protect both yourself and your partners. If you have questions or think you may have been exposed to an STI, talk to your doctor for guidance and care.\nLast Updated:May 14, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Your doctor might order a computed tomography (CT scan). Your doctor might also (or instead) refer you to a specialist for an endoscopy to try to see the tumor. For this exam, your doctor will place a thin, lighted tube into your mouth and pass down to your stomach. Your doctor may give you medicine before the test to make you more comfortable.\nDuring endoscopy, your doctor might remove a small piece of your stomach to check it for cancer cells. This is called a\u00a0biopsy\u00a0sample. The sample is then sent to a lab where it\u2019s looked at under a microscope to determine if it\u2019s cancerous.\nThere is no way to prevent stomach cancer. However, you can help reduce your risk of stomach cancer by not smoking and by limiting how much alcohol you drink. Also, maintain a healthy weight and eat a\u00a0diet\u00a0high in fresh fruits and vegetables.\nTreatments for stomach cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. The choice of treatment depends on whether the cancer is just in the stomach or if it has spread to other places in the body. Your age and overall health will also affect the choice of treatment.\nMedical treatment may remove or destroy your cancer. Even though you will feel relieved, you may worry, too. You may be afraid that the cancer will return. It\u2019s completely normal to feel this way. It may be comforting to know that your doctor will still want to monitor your closely. You may need to see your doctor every 3 to 6 months for a few years.\nIf part of your cancer treatment involved removing all or part of your stomach, your doctor will refer you to a nutritionist. The nutritionist will help you plan meals so you get the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. You may also need to take vitamin supplements.\nFollowing treatment, your cancer may not completely go away. It can turn into a\u00a0chronic\u00a0condition. This can be stressful for you and your loved ones. You may need chemotherapy or other treatments to help control the cancer. These treatments can keep the cancer small and keep it from growing. When it\u2019s not growing, you can take a break from treatment until it begins growing again.\nIf you have chronic cancer, it is important to find support for you and your family.

It affects the muscle control in your eyes. The eyes don\u2019t line up properly. Instead, the eyes appear to cross, or one eye may wander to the side. One eye\u2019s vision becomes weaker. This disorder also is called \u201ccrossed eyes.\u201d If it is not fixed when a child is young, their brain will always ignore what it sees from the weak eye.\nYou may notice your child closes one eye to see with the other. You also may see your child turn their head to one side to see. Other symptoms can include:\nPeople who develop strabismus as adults are likely to have double vision. That\u2019s because their brain has learned how to read images from both eyes. Then, when strabismus is diagnosed, the brain still sees images from both eyes, even though the eyes are looking at different things. Hence the double vision.\nSymptoms may be present all the time or may come and go. It\u2019s normal for newborn babies to have eyes that cross or wander. It happens more when they are tired. If your child is older than 3 months of age, tell your doctor if you see notice these symptoms.\nThere are six muscles around each eye. When these muscles don\u2019t work together, each eye sees different things. This confuses the brain. The brain learns to focus on the image from the stronger eye.\nIn most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown. More than half the time, the problem is present at or shortly after birth.

Treatment can help your child have normal vision. The earlier the treatment starts, the better.\nTreatment focuses on making the weak or wandering eye stronger. This could involve wearing a corrective glasses or an eye patch. Putting eye drops in the \u201cgood\u201d eye can make the weak eye stronger. Treatment can temporarily affect vision in both eyes.\nSome children need surgery. It is usually not recommended until after other treatments have been tried. Surgery is simple, but it doesn\u2019t always make the eyes perfectly straight. Sometimes surgery has to be repeated later.\nTreatment for strabismus may go on for months or even a few years. Your child may have to wear their eye patch less over time. The same is true for eye drops.\nYour doctor may recommend your child does eye exercises. These can help the eyes focus on the same spot.\nAbout one-third of children with strabismus will developamblyopia.\u00a0This is a lazy eye. If amblyopia is not treated by about age 11, it is likely to be permanent.

Strep throat makes your throat feel very sore with painful swallowing. Your throat may also feel scratchy and raw.\nYes. Strep throat is contagious. You can pass the strep infection to other people until you have been treated appropriately with an antibiotic. Children who have strep throat should not go back to school or daycare until their fever has gone away and they have taken an antibiotic for at least 24 hours.\nHere are more things you can do to prevent spreading strep throat:\nThe symptoms of strep throat include:\nIn addition to the symptoms listed above, children may also have these symptoms:\nStrep throat is caused by bacteria.

Killing bacteria helps ease the symptoms of strep throat and helps it go away a little faster. Antibiotics can also prevent a few rare, but serious conditions that people who have strep throat might develop. These includerheumatic feveror kidney inflammation.\nIt is important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor prescribes. This reduces the risk that your symptoms will return. It also helps prevent antibiotic resistance.\nNo. Not every sore throat is strep throat. Bacteria only cause a small portion of all sore throats. The rest are caused by viruses or other problems that antibiotics do not help. Your doctor can do a test to check for strep throat.\nHere are some things that might help you feel better:\nStrep throat is an infection that typically comes and goes, especially when you\u2019re younger. If you have recurring strep throat, it could be that someone in your family is a carrier of strep. Carriers have the strep bacteria in their throats, but it does not make them sick. Treating carriers can help prevent the spread of strep.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Strep Throat: All You Need to Know\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Strep Throat\nLast Updated:August 20, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is a stroke?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2022 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nA stroke is a medical condition. It happens when the blood flow to your brain stops. When this happens, it causes your brain cells to die (within minutes of the stroke). There are two types of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic strokes are the most common. They are caused by a blood clot. That clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain. With a hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain.\nWhen you have a stroke, you may lose the ability to do something that is controlled by the injured part of your brain. For example, you could lose the use of an arm or leg. You could lose the ability to speak. The damage can be temporary or permanent.IMPORTANT:The sooner you get treatment after stroke symptoms start, the better the chance of getting blood flow to your brain. This prevents more damage. People who have had a stroke are more likely to have another stroke. The risk is especially high during the year after your first stroke.\nCall for emergency help immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:\nAlso, these symptoms can tell you if someone else is having a stroke. It\u2019s called the F.A.S.T. test:\nAnother condition that is similar to stroke is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a \u201cmini-stroke.\u201d It causes the same symptoms listed above. Your symptoms may only last a few minutes. However, do not ignore it. Having a TIA increases your risk of having a stroke later. Call your doctor immediately if you think you are having a TIA.\nCertain risk factors contribute to having a stroke. Some stroke risk factors can be changed, treated, or controlled. For example, high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can be controlled. Other risk factors include:\nImmediate medical care is critical after having a stroke. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and health history. Then they will perform a physical exam. Your doctor also will want to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. They will want to know if you fell and suffered a head injury. If your doctor suspects you have had a stroke, you will have more tests. These tests may include:\nChanging those risk factors that you can control will help reduce your risk of stroke. This includes:\nHave regular checkups so that your doctor can help you manage health conditions that increase your risk of having a stroke. Ask your doctor for advice on making lifestyle changes to decrease your risk of stroke. Talk to your doctor about current guidelines for taking aspirin in low doses to reduce your risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Aspirin can help keep your blood from forming clots that block your arteries. If your doctor recommends taking low-dose aspirin, it is important to follow their instructions so that you get the most benefit with the fewest side effects.\nQuick, emergency care is important in treating a stroke. Emergency room treatment depends on whether you had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Immediate treatment options include the use of blood-thinning (clot bluster) medicine, surgery, or other procedures.\nFollowing immediate treatment, controlling the underlying health conditions that caused your stroke is important. That means controlling your diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, and making lifestyle changes.\nStroke rehabilitation is an important part of recovery after a stroke. It helps build your strength, coordination, endurance, and confidence. A main goal of stroke rehabilitation is to help you learn how to live with the effects of the stroke. This will help you be as independent as possible. It may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy. Your doctor will decide what kind of rehabilitation will be helpful for you. Rehabilitation can begin as soon as the stroke is over, and you are stable. In many cases, it starts in the hospital as soon as 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. Most people need to continue rehabilitation for months or years after a stroke.\nIf you have a loved one who had a stroke, they will need your help and support. Some places offer classes for stroke survivors and their families. You may be able to go to some of your loved one\u2019s rehabilitation sessions. This is a good way to learn how stroke rehabilitation works and how you can help your loved one get better.\nFind out what they can do alone, what they can do with help, and what they can\u2019t do at all. Tell the rehabilitation staff what activities your loved one enjoys. Help your loved one practice the skills learned in stroke rehabilitation. For example, avoid helping your loved one do things that they are able to do alone. Practicing skills will build your loved one\u2019s confidence.\nLiving with stroke will mean managing your health conditions that cause it. Also, it will mean living with the temporary or permanent side effects. The following are the most common side effects of stroke:\nBrain injury and loss of function from a stroke can lead to emotional changes, too. Soon after the stroke, you may have trouble controlling your emotions. Your moods may change more quickly than they did before the stroke. For example, you may suddenly start crying or laughing for no reason. Usually, this gets better over time.\nIt is normal to feel depressed, sad, or frustrated as you get used to the changes caused by a stroke. These reactions can be treated. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling so that they can help.\nDriving is another issue if you have had a stroke. Your doctor can advise you if it is safe for you to drive again. Having a stroke can affect your mobility, vision, and thinking. Your reaction time may be slower. These changes can make driving a car unsafe for you and for other people on the road. If your doctor says that it is safe for you to drive again, contact your state\u2019s department of motor vehicles. Ask about the rules for people who have had a stroke. You may have to take a driving test or a class. Driver training programs are often available through rehabilitation centers.\nIt can be frustrating if you can\u2019t drive after having a stroke. Other options for getting around include public transportation, specialized vans, taxis, and getting rides from friends and family members. Community resources such as senior citizen groups and local volunteer agencies may also be able to help.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Stroke\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Stroke\nLast Updated:August 15, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is stuttering?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nStuttering is a condition that affects a person\u2019s ability to speak smoothly. It can cause them to repeat words, parts of sentences, or sounds. Someone who stutters might prolong the pronunciation of a single word or sound. They may tense up their facial muscles as they struggle to speak.\nMost cases of stuttering begin when children are between 2 and 6 years old, when they are developing their vocabulary. Boys are more likely to stutter than girls. Stuttering usually stops by the time children enter school, but adults can stutter, too. However, fewer than 1% of cases are found in adults.\nTypically, the first signs of stuttering appear when a child is 18-24 months old. This is when they start putting sentences together and their vocabulary really starts to expand. It\u2019s normal for children to have some stuttering at this stage.\nYour child may stutter for a few weeks or several months. The stuttering may come and go. For most children, stuttering stops by the time they\u2019re 5 years old. But for some, the stuttering is frequent. It might continue to get worse. It might also be accompanied by facial or body movements. For these children, treatment may be necessary.\nStuttering is apparent in a person\u2019s speech flow. For example, when saying the word, \u201cwhere,\u201d it might sound like, \u201cW\u2026 w\u2026 w\u2026 where.\u201d Words starting with the letters \u201ck,\u201d \u201cg,\u201d and \u201ct\u201d may be difficult starting sounds for people who stutter.\nAnother sign of a stutter is the prolonged pronunciation of a word, such as, \u201cMy graaanndma gave me a cookie.\u201d Repeating entire phrases or sentences is another sign of stuttering. For example, you might hear the person start off smooth and then repeat the last few words: \u201cI can play with you, but I have to check \u2026 I have to check \u2026 I have to check with my parents first.\u201d\nYou also may notice physical signs that are characteristic of stuttering. These include the head and eyes rolling backward as the person struggles to get his or her words out. They also include rapid eye blinking, or a tightening of the muscles around the mouth.\nStuttering may increase during certain social situations. For example, speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone may make it worse. Some activities can make it better. These include singing, reading, or speaking in unison with other people.\nResearch is still being done to identify the cause of stuttering. It can occur from the natural process of organizing your thoughts and words. A combination of factors can also cause people to stutter, including:\nParents, teachers, and family members are often the first to notice a child is stuttering. Tell your doctor if your child stutters, even at the early age of 2 years old. Your doctor may refer you to early intervention services provided by your local community. They may also refer you to a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who specializes in voice, speech, and language disorders.\nThe speech-language pathologist will consider several factors when diagnosing your child. They will ask you about your child\u2019s history, their stuttering behaviors, and the impact stuttering has on their life. They will also try to determine if your child is likely to outgrow their stuttering. To do this, they will evaluate family history, how long the stuttering has lasted, and if your child has any other speech or language problems.\nNo one knows why stuttering occurs, so there is no way to prevent or avoid it. Once you suspect or notice that stuttering may be a problem for your child, don\u2019t ignore it. Early intervention can help.\nTalk to your doctor if your child stutters, even if they\u2019re young. Early treatment can help prevent stuttering from becoming a lifelong problem. Treatment will depend on the severity and frequency of your child\u2019s stuttering. Your doctor may refer your child to a speech therapist for treatment. You\u2019ll likely have many appointments with the speech therapist. They will also give you speech exercises to do at home. It\u2019s important to follow your speech therapist\u2019s treatment plan.\nTreatment also involves teaching parents ways to support their child. You may be encouraged to:\nDon\u2019t discipline your child for stuttering. Be patient. Not being patient when your child is speaking only makes the stuttering worse. It embarrasses your child more.\nThere are many ways you can help your child:\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Stuttering\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: Stuttering\nLast Updated:February 2, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

They look at where the death occurred, do an autopsy on the baby, and look at the baby\u2019s health history.\nPart of the frustration of SIDS is that there are no warning signs or symptoms. All a parent or caregiver can do is take preventive steps to reduce the chance of SIDS (see the \u201cprevention\u201d section in this article).\nSIDS is believed to be related to certain sleeping hazards that can cause the baby to stop breathing. These include:\nBabies born with defects in the part of their brain that controls breathing and waking from sleep are more likely to die of SIDS. Respiratory infections may also increase a baby\u2019s likeliness of dying from SIDS.\nAccording to the Safe to Sleep\u00aeCampaign, SIDS isn\u2019t contagious. It\u2019s not caused by choking or vomiting, and it isn\u2019t tied to child abuse or the lack of immunizations. It\u2019s not the same as, or caused by, suffocation.\nAn infant is diagnosed as having died of SIDS after all other causes have been excluded. Professionals will try to determine the cause of death and conduct interviews with parents or caregivers. They also will check the baby\u2019s medical records.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nSyphilis is a serious infection passed from one person to another through sexual contact. It is caused by a bacteria (germ). You can get syphilis by touching the blood or sores of a person who has syphilis, especially sores on the person\u2019s mouth, penis, vagina, or anus (the opening to the rectum).\nYes, you should tell your partner that you have syphilis. Then your partner can find out if they also have syphilis. If you\u2019re not comfortable telling your sex partner, your doctor can help you. In some places, the local health department can tell sex partners that they may have syphilis and should get a test. If you wish, your name can be kept secret.\nThe first stage of syphilis is called primary syphilis. It usually occurs 10 days to 3 months after exposure. In men, the first sign of syphilis may be a sore on the penis. In women, the first sign may be a sore around or inside the vagina. You might not even notice the sore, because syphilis sores do not usually hurt. The sores go away after 3 to 6 weeks. You may also have enlarged lymph nodes (glands) in your groin.\nIf you don\u2019t treat syphilis early, it spreads from the sore into your blood. When syphilis gets into your blood, it can move into the secondary stage and cause many problems. The most common sign is a rash. The rash is usually reddish-brown and can occur anywhere on the body (even on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). The rash appears 2 to 10 weeks after the appearance of the sores. Other signs of secondary syphilis include fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, body aches, sores in the mouth, and fatigue.\nAfter recovering from the secondary stage of syphilis, the disease can move into the latent stage. This stage produces no symptoms, but the infection is still present in the body.\nAfter many years, people who have syphilis and don\u2019t get treatment may develop the fourth stage of syphilis, called tertiary syphilis. This stage can cause problems in the brain and spinal cord. Tertiary syphilis may damage the heart and other organs, also.\nSome people who have syphilis don\u2019t have any signs of infection. In other people, the signs may be very mild. They might not even know they have it. But even if they have no signs or the signs go away on their own, the infection is still alive and can cause serious health problems many years later.\nSyphilis is caused by bacteria called Treponema pallidum. You can get syphilis by having sex with an infected person (coming into direct contact with a syphilis sore). It can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy.\nA blood test can tell for sure if you have syphilis. Sometimes other tests can show how far the syphilis has spread. For example, your doctor may want to look at your spinal fluid. This is a way to see if the syphilis bacteria have spread to your nervous system.\nThe only way to prevent or avoid syphilis altogether is to abstain from sex, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. That is not always practical. Safe sex (using protection) lowers your chances of getting syphilis. This includes using condoms during sex and using \u201cdental dams\u201d during oral sex.\nSyphilis can be cured with penicillin, which is an antibiotic. The penicillin is given as a shot. If you have had syphilis for 1 year or less, you only need to get 1 shot. If you have had syphilis longer than 1 year, you will need 2 or more shots. If you\u2019re allergic to penicillin, be sure to tell your doctor.\nIf you have an advanced case of syphilis, you may need stronger treatment. You may get shots of penicillin every day for 10 days. This can be done in the doctor\u2019s office or at a clinic. A few people have to go to the hospital to be treated with penicillin intravenously (through an IV).\nIf you\u2019re pregnant, it\u2019s very important to get treated right away. Syphilis can cause birth defects and even death in an unborn baby.\nAfter your treatment, your doctor will ask you to come back several times for blood tests. These tests will show if the antibiotic killed all the syphilis bacteria.\nSyphilis can be passed from one person to another during sex. If you got syphilis, you could also have gottenHIVor another sexually transmitted infection (STI), such aschlamydiaor gonorrhea. If you have a syphilis sore, it\u2019s easier for HIV infection to get into your body through the sore. If you have syphilis, you should be tested for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.\nA simple exam and some lab tests can show if you have these infections. If you have HIV and syphilis, make sure your doctor knows about the HIV, so you can get the right treatment and continued care.\nIf you have syphilis, it can be cured completely.

    "article_title": "What are the symptoms of bruxism?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nWhat is bruxism?\nTeeth grinding, also called bruxism, is the conscious or unconscious grinding or clenching of teeth. It happens most often in children. About 20% to 30% of children grind their teeth, usually while asleep. You may have heard your child doing it at night. Sometimes, children will grind their teeth during the day when they feel anxious. The good news is that most children will eventually stop grinding their teeth. This often happens around the time they lose their baby teeth.\nPhysical symptoms are usually related to the teeth and jaw.\nTeeth might look worn down or could be chipped. Grinding can wear down tooth enamel. So, the problem exposes children to future dental issues if left untreated. This could include sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks.\nChildren who grind their teeth often say they have a sore jaw. This can happen when they wake up or when they are chewing. Teeth grinding can lead toheadaches, earaches, and facial pain. Excessive grinding can cause TMJ, or temporomandibular joint problems.\nTeeth grinding also can be tied to emotional issues, such as:\nSome people grind their teeth and don\u2019t have any issues. They may not even be aware that they are doing it, especially if they do it when sleeping. Sometimes the only way people know they grind their teeth is because family members hear them doing it while they are asleep.\nDoctors don\u2019t always know what causes teeth grinding. Bruxism in children is more common in those diagnosed with a hyperactivity disorder or health issues, such as cerebral palsy. Certain medicines can also cause it. For some children, teeth grinding occurs because their teeth are not aligned properly.\nIn older children or adults, it may be linked to daily stress. Whether or not it causes symptoms can depend on many things. These include:\nA physical exam can usually tell your doctor or dentist if you or your child have been grinding your teeth. Your doctor will notice the appearance of worn teeth and enamel. Medical professionals often consider teeth grinding as a diagnosis when a patient complains of any facial or oral pain, including soreness while chewing. An exam can also rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as ear infections.\nIn many children, bruxism is their natural reaction to growth and development. These cases can\u2019t be prevented. But stress-related teeth grinding in children and adults can be avoided. Setting a calming bedtime routine is the first step you can take to avoid teeth grinding. Help your child relax at night:\nReducing stress is important. Talk with your child regularly about their feelings. Help them deal with stress. If you are suffering from bruxism, take steps to reduce stress in your life. Talk to a friend, family member, or counselor about what is causing you stress. Try to eliminate stressors if you can.\nTreatment for bruxism can depend on your symptoms or the underlying cause. Some children who don\u2019t have symptoms may not need treatment.\nSome treatment options are designed to reduce grinding and clenching. Your doctor may begin by having you or your child wear a mouth guard at night. The mouth guard is specially made to fit your teeth. It\u2019s like mouth guards used by athletes participating in contact sports. There are many types of mouth guards. They are designed to work in different ways. Some are designed to prevent damage to your teeth. Others prevent the upper and lower teeth from touching to eliminate grinding. Your doctor or dentist will help find the right kind of mouth guard for you.\nIf your grinding is caused by misaligned teeth, your doctor may recommend a visit to the dentist or orthodontist.\nSometimes stress is the underlying cause of your or your child\u2019s teeth grinding. In this case, getting to the root of emotional problems can often help. For example, your doctor may talk with your child about things that worry them. This could include school, home life, or new experiences. They can try to come up with a plan to help your child be less worried and anxious. If there is no sign of improvement, or the emotional problems seem to be more serious, talk to your doctor to explore further evaluation and treatment options.\nTeeth clenching or grinding is not dangerous. Most children will outgrow it. But it can cause uncomfortable symptoms that can interfere with daily life. There are steps you can take to reduce and prevent pain. Home care tips include:\nIf self-care steps don\u2019t help after several weeks and you are still experiencing symptoms, call your family doctor.\nMedline Plus: Bruxism\nLast Updated:May 15, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nTennis elbow is another name for\u00a0lateral\u00a0epicondylitis. It occurs when the tendons that attach the\u00a0muscle\u00a0to the bone on the outside part of the elbow swell or tear. This weakens the elbow connection and puts great\u00a0stress\u00a0on the area. Tennis elbow often causes pain when you use the muscles to lift, grip, or twist.\nTennis elbow begins as an ache on the outside of your elbow. It gets worse over time until it is a severe burning pain. You may notice pain moving from the outside of your elbow to your forearm and the back of your hand when you grip, twist, or lift.\nAs the condition worsens, your grip may weaken. You may feel pain even when lifting light objects, such as a small book or coffee cup. Pain may increase when you press on the outside of your elbow.\nIn addition to pain, you may have swelling around your elbow joint.\nOveruse causes most cases of tennis elbow. It occurs when repeated movements cause swelling and pain in your joint and tendons. Any type of repeated motion or stress on the tendons can cause it. Playing tennis is only one of the ways you can get tennis elbow. People who play other racquet sports, such as racquetball or squash, and fencing are at risk. Certain jobs can lead to tennis elbow. Examples include painters, butchers, carpenters, musicians, manicurists, and dentists. People who work on an assembly line or use computers are at risk as well.\nIn some cases, the tendons can swell after a direct blow to the elbow. In other cases, the condition isn\u2019t related to an activity at all.\nTennis elbow can occur at any age. It is most common in people 30 to 50 years of age. It affects both men and women.\nThere are several things your doctor will do to diagnose tennis elbow.\u00a0 First, they will review your health history and lifestyle. Then, they will examine your elbow and arm to check for pain, swelling, and stiffness. They also may move your arm, elbow, wrist, and fingers. The doctor may order an X-ray orMRIof your arm. These tests help ensure you don\u2019t have a break or fracture.\nYou may be able to avoid or prevent tennis elbow. It helps to maintain strength and flexibility in your wrists and arm muscles. You can do this by using light weights to strengthen and doing exercises to stretch. This is especially important for people whose sports or jobs put them at risk. Make sure you warm up your elbow, wrist, and arm before activity. Try to avoid repetitive movements. Wearing a splint during activities may help prevent the condition from getting worse.\nThere are things you can do at home to help relieve pain and swelling.\nTalk to your doctor if these treatments do not help. They may suggest:\nOnce your pain and swelling have decreased, physical therapy can help reinforce your muscles and tendons. This includes stretching, range-of-motion, and strengthening exercises. Most people improve in 4 to 6 weeks.\nIf your pain does not improve or if it affects your lifestyle, your doctor may suggest surgery. Usually, surgery occurs in an outpatient center. This means you don\u2019t have to stay in the hospital. During surgery, the doctor will make a small cut on the outside of your elbow. They will remove the damaged tendon tissue and reattach normal tendon tissue to the bone.\nMost people recover from tennis elbow after treatment. You may need physical therapy or a brace to help manage ongoing symptoms or prevent them from coming back.\nCall your doctor if:\nLast Updated:September 6, 2018\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

In rare cases, it can occur in younger boys. Black and Asian men are less likely to develop it.\nThe most common sign of testicular cancer is a hard, painless lump on the testicle. Other symptoms include:\nCancer is caused by abnormal cell growth. Most cases of testicular cancer are caused by germ cells. These are cells that make sperm. There is no evidence linking testicular cancer to a vasectomy.\nEarly detection is important. Regular, self-examinations may be your first clue. Contact your doctor if you notice something unusual.\nYour doctor will perform a physical exam. He or she will feel your scrotum and testicles for lumps. Your doctor may do a transillumination test. This is done by shining a light to your scrotum. If the light does not pass through a lump, it could be cancerous. Not all lumps or tumors are cancerous.\nTo confirm cancer, your doctor will do other tests. These may include a blood test, ultrasound, X-ray, or computed tomography (CT) scan.

    "article_title": "What is thalassemia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nThalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders that prevent your body from producing the amount of hemoglobin it needs. Hemoglobin is located within your red blood cells. It\u2019s what carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Not having enough hemoglobin also leads to anemia. This medical condition makes you feel tired, weak, and short of breath.\nThere are two main types of thalassemia:\nInheriting the gene from both parents is called thalassemia major. Inheriting it from one parent is called thalassemia minor. Most carriers (people who have the gene but do not have the disorder) are symptom free.\nThalassemia symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia you have and the severity of the anemia. Some people have little or even no symptoms. Other people have mild to severe symptoms. Symptoms of thalassemia may include one or more of the following:\nAlpha thalassemia can be harmful to pregnant women. It can lead to a stillborn birth.\nChildren who are born with thalassemia may show signs of the disease right away, or symptoms may appear later. Most signs and symptoms usually show up within the first 2 years of life. If your child has delayed growth, it\u2019s important to find out if he or she might have thalassemia. Untreated thalassemia can cause heart failure and infection.\nThalassemia can lead to other health problems:\nThalassemia is an inherited gene mutation. It is passed on from one or both parents.\nThe type of thalassemia you have depends on which mutated genes you inherit from your parents, and how many genes you inherit.\nYou are at risk for thalassemia if you have a family history of it. Thalassemia can affect both men and women. Certain ethnic groups are at greater risk:\nIf your doctor thinks you or your child might have thalassemia, he\u2019ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history. Thalassemia can only be diagnosed with blood tests. Doctors use several different types of blood tests to look for thalassemia. Some tests measure the number and size of red blood cells, or the amount of iron in the blood. Others look at the hemoglobin within the red blood cells. DNA testing helps doctors identify which genes are missing or damaged.\nThe only way to prevent an inherited condition, such as thalassemia, in your child is not to become pregnant.\nTreatment for thalassemia depends on which type of thalassemia you have and the severity of your symptoms. If you have no or only mild symptoms, you may need little or no treatment.\nTreatment for moderate to severe forms of thalassemia often includes regular blood transfusions and folate supplements. Folate (also called folic acid) helps your body make healthy blood cells. Alpha thalassemia can sometimes be mistaken forlow-iron anemia, and iron supplements may be recommended as a treatment. But iron supplements have no effect on thalassemia.\nIf you have many blood transfusions, too much iron may build up in your blood. If this happens, you will need chelation therapy to remove extra iron from your body. You shouldn\u2019t take iron supplements if you receive blood transfusions.\nIn the most severe cases, bone marrow or stem cell transplants may help by replacing damaged cells with healthy ones from a donor. A donor is usually a relative such as a sibling.\nAlthough you can\u2019t prevent inheriting thalassemia, you can manage the disease so you can have the best quality of life possible. Key steps include:\nSevere types of thalassemia can cause a stillbirth during a woman\u2019s pregnancy. If you or your partner knows you are a carrier for thalassemia, talk to your doctor or a genetic counselor before getting pregnant.

These can bleed if you scrape them or when you brush your teeth. You also may have pain when swallowing.\nThrush is caused by the fungus, Candida. Although everyone has germs in their mouth, your immune system works to regulate them. You can have too much Candida. Having too much of this fungus causes the oral thrush infection.\nThrush is most common in newborns because their immune systems are still developing. Newborns also can sometimes have thrush at birth if their mother had a vaginal yeast infection at the time of delivery.\nChildren and adults can get thrush too. Your risk of thrush increases if you:\nThrush is easy for a doctor to diagnose. He or she will look at your tongue and mouth to check for sores. The doctor may scrape one of the sores to get a sample to examine. If you have sores in your throat, your doctor may do a throat culture to examine the fungus.\nYou can help prevent thrush by practicing good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth, and floss every day. If you use an inhaler, rinse your mouth out after each use. People who have diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar. When your blood sugar is high, extra sugar collects in your saliva and fuels candida.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nThe thyroid is a small\u00a0gland\u00a0located at the base of your throat (near your Adam\u2019s apple). It regulates body functions such as\u00a0heart\u00a0rate,\u00a0metabolism,\u00a0and the rate at which your body burns calories. A thyroid nodule is a lump in the\u00a0thyroid gland\u00a0in your neck. More than 90% of all thyroid nodules are\u00a0benign\u00a0(non-cancerous). Some are cysts filled with fluid.\nThyroid nodules are more common in women than in men. They also tend to run in families. They are sometimes associated with the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. This condition is a common cause of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), which affects your body\u2019s ability to maintain an efficient metabolism and burn calories.\nMost thyroid nodules don\u2019t cause symptoms. For people who do have symptoms, they may have trouble swallowing or breathing or have a feeling of fullness, pain, or pressure in the throat or neck. Some people might notice a lump in their neck when they look in the mirror, but this is uncommon. Some people experience rapid unintended weight loss, feelings of nervousness, or an irregular heartbeat.\nDoctors aren\u2019t always sure why some people get thyroid nodules, but they\u2019re very common. The chances of getting one increase as you get older. Almost 50% of adults will develop thyroid nodules by the time they\u2019re 60 years old.\nThe nodules are sometimes associated with other medical conditions, including:\nOften, a doctor finds the lump during a routine checkup or during other tests. They can feel it.\nYour doctor can do several different tests. One test is called fine-needle aspiration. Your doctor will take a\u00a0tissue\u00a0sample from your thyroid gland and examine it under a microscope to see if it\u2019s cancerous. The tissue sample is taken with a very small needle.\nAnother test your doctor may do is an ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the thyroid\u2019s shape and the size of the nodules. It can help your doctor determine whether the nodule is a solid\u00a0tumor\u00a0or a\u00a0cyst\u00a0filled with fluid.\nA third test is a thyroid scan. Your doctor will inject harmless radioactive iodine into a\u00a0vein\u00a0in your arm. The iodine is absorbed by your thyroid gland and makes it \u201cglow\u201d as your doctor takes a special picture. Your doctor can learn about the nodule depending on how much or how little of the iodine shows in the picture.\nAdditionally, your doctor may order a lab test (blood draw) to check your thyroid hormone levels.\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes most thyroid nodules, so most likely, you can\u2019t prevent them. But you can make sure you eat enough food that contains iodine (table salt, dairy products, seafood, meat, etc.), which can prevent one cause of thyroid nodules.\nSome patients who have small benign nodules may choose watchful waiting. This isn\u2019t a form of active treatment but rather an observation period. The nodule may go away on its own or stay the same size. Patients treated this way should be checked by their doctor every 6 months to monitor the growth of the nodule. As long as the nodule does not grow, there\u2019s usually no need to worry.\nOther forms of treatment include taking hormones or radioactive iodine to shrink the nodules or injecting the nodules with ethyl alcohol (ethanol) to shrink the nodules. If a nodule is cancerous or grows despite\u00a0hormone\u00a0pill treatment, surgery to remove the nodule may be needed.\nMost people who have thyroid nodules lead a normal life. You might need to check in with your doctor more often, but there usually are no complications.\nIf you do have complications, they can include problems swallowing or breathing. You may also sustain significant weight gain or weight loss. Work with your doctor to treat these symptoms.\nIf your thyroid nodules are a symptom of thyroid\u00a0cancer, you may need surgery. During the surgery, the doctor will remove most, if not all, of your thyroid. Following the surgery, you\u2019ll take daily thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of your life.\nAmerican Thyroid Association: Thyroid Nodules\nEndocrine Society: Thyroid Nodules\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Thyroid Nodule\nLast Updated:February 24, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nThyroiditis refers to a group of disorders that cause inflammation\u00a0of the thyroid. Your thyroid is the\u00a0gland located in the front of your neck below your Adam\u2019s apple. The thyroid makes hormones that control your metabolism and affect how your body works. Metabolism is how your body processes substances to produce energy or burn calories.\nThere are several types of thyroiditis:\nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis\nSubacute thyroiditis (de Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis)\nAcute thyroiditis (suppurative thyroiditis)\nSilent thyroiditis\nPostpartum thyroiditis\nRadiation-induced thyroiditis\nDrug-induced thyroiditis\nThyroiditis symptoms vary since it is a group of disorders with several types.\nThyroiditis can trigger rapid thyroid cell damage. This causes thyroid hormone to leak into your blood and increases thyroid hormone levels. When this happens, you have symptoms ofhyperthyroidism(overactive thyroid). Possible symptoms are:\nThyroiditis also can lead to slow, long-term thyroid cell damage. This causes thyroid hormone levels in your blood to be low. When this happens, you have symptoms ofhypothyroidism(underactive thyroid). Possible symptoms are:\nPeople who have thyroiditis also may have pain and swelling in the thyroid gland (in the front of the neck).\nThe cause of thyroiditis depends on the type of disease you have. Most types occur when your immune system attacks the thyroid gland. This causes inflammation (the body\u2019s response to injury) and damages the thyroid cells. The reason for the attack often is an autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto\u2019s.\nOther types of thyroiditis occur from use of radiation or certain medicines. Viral or bacterial infections also may cause thyroiditis.\nLab tests often can diagnose thyroiditis, including what type you have. Your doctor will start with a blood test. This measures the amount of thyroid hormone in your blood. It will show if your hormone levels are too high or too low. Blood tests check your level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as well. TSH is produced in the pituitary gland and can affect your thyroid hormone levels. Blood tests also can show if you have antibodies present in your body.\nYour doctor may do a radioactive iodine uptake test. This measures your thyroid\u2019s ability to absorb iodine, a mineral that is needed to produce thyroid hormone.\nIn some cases, you may need a biopsy to determine what is attacking the thyroid.\nMost cases of thyroiditis cannot be prevented. If you have a health issue that requires treatment using radioactive iodine or radiation therapy, talk to your doctor about your risk of thyroiditis. You may be able to start with other treatments to avoid your chance of thyroiditis. If you take prescription drugs that can cause thyroiditis, talk to your doctor about your risk and if you can stop taking them. You still may not be able to avoid thyroiditis.\nTreatment for thyroiditis depends on your type and what symptoms you have.\nIf you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called a beta blocker. This helps to lower your heart rate and reduce tremors. Since hyperthyroidism often is temporary, your doctor likely will taper the dose of this medicine as your symptoms improve.\nIf you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor may prescribe thyroid hormone replacements. These help to restore your body\u2019s hormone levels and get your metabolism back to normal. It can take several tries to get the right dose of synthetic thyroid hormone. If you have Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, you will likely have to take this medicine for the rest of your life. The hypothyroidism from Hashimoto\u2019s is usually permanent.\nTalk to your doctor if you have pain in your thyroid. They may recommend a mild anti-inflammatory, such as aspirin or ibuprofen to manage the pain. Severe thyroid pain may require treatment with steroid therapy.\nThyroiditis and its symptoms may be temporary. In this case, you will be able to live a normal life following treatment. If the condition returns or is permanent, work with your doctor to manage symptoms.\nIf you do not get treatment, damage to your thyroid may continue and could lead to more health issues. For women, you may have problems with fertility or your children could be born with birth defects.\nLow functioning thyroid can lead to heart conditions, elevated cholesterol, swelling, and other conditions in both men and women.\nAmerican Thyroid Association: Thyroiditis\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nTick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a bacterial infection spread by ticks. The infection normally shows up as repeated episodes of fever, along with headache, muscle and joint aches, and nausea. It occurs in the western United States. It is usually associated with sleeping in rustic cabins in mountainous areas.\nThough not common, it is possibly for untreated TBRF to cause serious health problems, even death.\nThe main symptom of TBRF is a sudden fever that comes on within 2 weeks of being bitten by a tick. Multiple bouts of fever happen. Each can last about 3 days. The fever then goes away for about 1 week before returning. If left untreated, the cycle can continue several times.\nSome other symptoms of TBRF may include:\nIn some cases, the fever ends in a \u201ccrisis\u201d stage. This consists of shaking chills, intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure.\nIn the United States, TBRF is usually caused by a bite from certain types of ticks. These ticks, called \u201csoft\u201d ticks, carry the Borrelia bacteria. They are typically found in higher elevations of the western states. This includes the mountains of the West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest.\nSoft ticks behave differently than \u201chard\u201d ticks, such as dog ticks or deer ticks:\nTBRF is often associated with sleeping in rustic cabins. The soft ticks live in the nests of rodents that live in the cabin\u2019s walls, attics, or crawl spaces. The ticks come out at night briefly to feed. The bites are quick and painless. You usually don\u2019t know you\u2019ve been bitten.\nPeople at highest risk for TBRF are those who stay in rustic cabins in the mountainous areas of the West where soft ticks live. You are also at risk for TBRF if you have had a tick bite or if you have found any ticks on your body in the past 3 weeks. People who spend time outdoors in areas where ticks are common, either for work or recreation, are at higher risk of getting any tick-borne disease.\nTBRF and other tick-borne diseases can be diagnosed with a blood test. If you have been exposed to ticks and you are having repeated episodes of fever, call your doctor right away.\nThe best ways to prevent getting TBRF are to:\nYou can prevent other tick-borne diseases by avoiding being bitten by ticks. When you are outdoors, follow these guidelines:\nAfter you get home, check everything and everyone for ticks.\nDon\u2019t panic. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible. Pull up with steady, even pressure. Be careful not to squeeze or twist the tick body. Sometimes parts of the tick remain in the skin. You can leave them alone or carefully remove them the same way you would a splinter. Do not use heat (such as a lit match), petroleum jelly, or other methods to try to make the tick \u201cback out\u201d on its own. These methods are not effective.\nWash the area where the tick was attached thoroughly with soap and water. Keep an eye on the area for a few weeks and note any changes. Call your doctor if you develop a fever or other symptoms of TBRF. Be sure to tell your doctor that you were bitten by a tick and when it happened.\nIf you have TBRF, your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics to fight the bacteria. It is important that you take all of your antibiotic medicine as your doctor prescribes, even if you are feeling better. This will ensure that you get rid of the disease completely. It also helps prevent building up a resistance to antibiotics.\nIf treated early, many people with TBRF are cured with the antibiotics. They don\u2019t have any lasting effects from the illness. But some people experience complications. These can include:\nIt is very important to see your doctor right away if you think you may have TBRF.

    "article_title": "What is tinnitus?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated May 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTinnitus causes a persistent ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound in the ears\u2014and it can affect your focus, sleep, and overall well-being. While it\u2019s not a disease itself, tinnitus often signals an underlying issue. Learning about tinnitus causes and treatment can help you understand what\u2019s triggering the noise and what options are available to manage or reduce it.\nTinnitus is a problem that causes you hear a noise in one ear or both ears. In most cases, nothing outside of you caused that noise. It\u2019s an internal noise that only you hear in your ear.\nPeople commonly describe the noise as a \u201cringing in the ear.\u201d It also can be roaring, clicking, buzzing, or other sounds. Some people who have tinnitus hear a more complex noise that changes over time. You may hear the noise constantly, or it may come and go.\nThere are two types of tinnitus.\nTinnitus is not a disease. It\u2019s a symptom of an underlying health problem. There are many possible explanations for tinnitus, so understanding common tinnitus causes and treatment options can help you and your doctor identify the best path forward. Here are some common causes of tinnitus:\nMost of the time, tinnitus is caused by sensorineural hearing loss (nerve damage in your ear). Sometimes it\u2019s caused by something as simple as earwax blocking the ear canal. Other causes include:\nCertain medicines can damage the inner workings of the ear (for example, taking high doses of aspirin every day).\nAllergies,\u00a0high blood pressure, low\u00a0blood\u00a0pressure,\u00a0diabetes, tumors, and\u00a0head injuries\u00a0can also cause tinnitus. If you have a foreign object in your ear or a build-up of ear wax, you may also experience tinnitus.\nIn many cases, the cause of\u00a0tinnitus\u00a0can\u2019t be identified.\nTo prevent tinnitus or keep it from getting worse, avoid long-term exposure to loud noises and activities that put you at risk for hearing loss. If you know you\u2019re going to be around loud noises, take precautions by wearing earplugs or noise-canceling headphones. Keep the volume low if you listen to music through headphones.\nAvoid things that seem to make your tinnitus worse, such as nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine.\nThe main symptom of tinnitus is hearing sounds in your ears that aren\u2019t really there. The sound could be ringing. It may also sound like blowing, roaring, clicking, buzzing, hissing, or humming. The noises can be soft or loud. They can be high pitched or low pitched.\nYour doctor will take a detailed medical history, including a family history of hearing loss. They will want to know about any medical conditions you may have and any history of infections. Your doctor also needs to know what medicines you\u2019re taking, including herbal products or supplements. They will check your ears and may give you a hearing test. They may also order other tests to find out what is causing your tinnitus. These could include a head CT scan, a head MRI scan, or blood vessel studies. Your doctor might refer you to an otolaryngologist. This is a doctor that specializes in the ear, nose, and throat (also called an ENT doctor).\nTreatment will depend on what is causing your tinnitus. If earwax is causing your tinnitus, your doctor will remove it. If a medicine you\u2019re taking is causing the issue, your doctor may recommend you stop taking that medicine. But never stop taking a\u00a0prescription\u00a0medicine without talking to your doctor first.\nIf an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, is causing your tinnitus, your doctor can create a treatment plan for you to follow. Usually, tinnitus goes away once the condition that is causing it is treated. If diabetes is causing your tinnitus, take your prescribed medicine and follow your doctor\u2019s orders for diet and exercise to manage the condition.\nWhen no specific cause can be identified, your doctor will probably focus on making your tinnitus easier to tolerate.\nWhile there\u2019s no universal cure, many people find relief by working with their doctor to explore personalized tinnitus causes and treatment strategies\nFor many people with tinnitus, the condition is just a mild distraction. But for some, tinnitus causes distress and negatively affects their quality of life. It can cause anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and poor concentration. To lessen the impact of tinnitus on your life, try the following:\nTake the focus off your tinnitus. Use techniques such as sound generators and counseling to push it to the background. Remember that the more you think about tinnitus, the more bothersome it will become.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Tinnitus\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: Tinnitus\nLast Updated:May 5, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nIt\u2019s no secret that smoking or chewing tobacco is dangerous for your health. Many people try to quit and are successful. Still, many others try to quit and fail. That may be due to the addictive nature of smoking or chewing tobacco. It can cause changes in your body and in the way you act. The changes in your body are caused by an addiction to nicotine. That\u2019s the main ingredient in tobacco products. These changes may have occurred gradually over time and become habits.\nWhen you have a tobacco habit, many things seem to go along with having a cigarette or a dip or chew. These might include having a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink, being stressed or worried, talking on the phone, driving, socializing with friends, or wanting something to do with your hands or mouth.\nYou also may be facing pressures from friends who use tobacco products. Don\u2019t let anyone or anything convince you that it\u2019s okay to smoke or chew. If you need help saying no, talk to someone you can trust, like a teacher, counselor, your family doctor, or the 800-QUITNOW hotline.\nWanting to quit is a good first step. You\u2019ll have the best chance of stopping if you do the following:\nSteps to make quitting easier include:\nNicotine replacement products provide nicotine without using tobacco. These products are available as gum, a patch, nasal spray, an inhaler, and lozenges. You can buy the nicotine gum, patch, and lozenge without a prescription from your doctor. Nicotine replacement works by reducing your body\u2019s craving for nicotine. This reduces withdrawal symptoms. It lets you focus on the changes you need to make in your habits and environment. Once you feel more confident as a nonsmoker, dealing with your nicotine addiction is easier.\nSome prescription medicines help people stop smoking. These medicines do not contain nicotine, but help you resist your urges to smoke. Ask your doctor for his or her recommendation.\nTell your family and friends how to help. Their support will make it easier for you to quit.\nReward yourself for stopping. For example, with the money you save by not buying tobacco products, buy yourself something special.\nYou may have a habit of using tobacco to relax during stressful times. Luckily, there are good ways to manage stress without smoking or chewing. Relax by taking a hot bath, going for a walk, or breathing slowly and deeply. Think of changes in your daily routine that will help you resist the urge to smoke. For example, if you used to smoke when you drank coffee, drink hot tea instead.\nYou may feel irritable. You also may get angry or upset faster, have trouble concentrating, and feel hungrier than usual. You may have headaches and cough more at first (while your lungs are clearing out). All of these can be symptoms of withdrawal from nicotine. The worst symptoms will stop in a few days. However, you may still have cravings for tobacco. Those cravings have less to do with nicotine addiction and more to do with the habit of smoking or using chewing tobacco.\nSome people gain weight when they stop smoking. The main reason some people gain weight is because they eat more food as a substitute for smoking or chewing. You can avoid gaining weight by watching how much you eat, staying busy, and working out. Other people may lose weight when they stop smoking.\nMost people try to quit more than once before they succeed. Don\u2019t give up if you slip. Remind yourself of why you want to quit. Think about what happened to make you slip. Figure out how you\u2019ll handle that situation differently next time. Then start again.\nTips to help you quit smoking.\nSmoking causes lung cancer and many other types of cancer, heart disease, serious breathing problems, stomach ulcers and acid reflux, gum disease, and damage to babies of pregnant women who smoke. Smoking can also cost you time lost working or having fun because you\u2019re sick. Chewing tobacco is just as bad as cigarette smoke. You may hear more about the harm cigarettes do to the body but chewing tobacco can hurt your health. Additionally:\nQuitting smoking is important. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) supports health coverage for evidence-based treatment of tobacco use. Additionally, the AAFP recommends that all tobacco users in the United States be aware of the existence of such treatments and have access to all evidenced-based FDA-approved therapies and counseling.\nIf you smoke or chew tobacco, you should see a doctor immediately. Your family doctor can help you develop a plan to stop using tobacco. He or she can give you information on telephone hotlines or self-help materials. Your doctor can recommend a stop-smoking program. These programs are often held at local hospitals or health centers.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians: Quit Smoking Guide\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Quitting Smoking\nSmokefree.gov/ 1-800-QUIT-NOW\nLast Updated:May 9, 2022\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nTonsillitis is an inflammatory disease. It occurs when your tonsils become infected by a virus or bacteria. Tonsils are the oval-shaped areas of pink tissue at the back of your throat. There are two tonsils, one on each side. They help fight infection by reacting to germs that enter through your nose and mouth. Infected tonsils become inflamed and swollen.\nTonsillitis is more common in children than adults.\nSwollen tonsils often are the first sign of tonsillitis. It may feel like your throat or neck glands are swollen. Other tonsillitis symptoms may include:\nChildren who have tonsillitis may have stomach pain. This is more common when strep is the cause of tonsillitis.\nContact your doctor if your child has symptoms of tonsillitis. This includes:\nIf your child can\u2019t breathe or is drooling because they can\u2019t swallow, get emergency care right away.\nViral infections cause most cases of tonsillitis. For example, the virus that causesmononucleosis, or mono, (called the Epstein-Barr virus) can cause tonsillitis. Bacterial infections only cause tonsillitis about 15% to 30% of the time. The main bacteria are a certain type of streptococcus, or strep. In these cases, the illness may be calledstrep throat.\nContact your doctor if you or your child has symptoms of tonsillitis. Your doctor will ask about symptoms. They will also check your ears, nose, and throat for swelling and signs of infection.\nYour doctor will use a swab to take a sample from the back of your throat. The sample may be used for a rapid strep test or a throat culture. Both tests can show if your infection is caused by strep or another kind of bacteria. A rapid strep test only takes a few minutes to show results. However, a throat culture must be sent to a lab and takes 24 hours or more. It is more reliable than a rapid stress test, which can give a false negative result. The doctor may order both tests to ensure a diagnosis.\nIn some cases, your doctor may do a blood test to determine the cause. For example, a blood test can check for mono.\nTreatment for tonsillitis varies based on the cause. For a bacterial infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Be sure to follow your doctor\u2019s orders and take all the medicine on time. If you don\u2019t, your infection may come back. Antibiotics also help reduce your risk of infecting others. You won\u2019t be contagious after about 24 hours of treatment. However, if tonsillitis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won\u2019t help.\nThere are some things you can do at home to help relieve your symptoms:\nIf your tonsils are so swollen that you have difficulty breathing, your doctor may prescribe steroids.\nTonsillitis is not contagious, but the infections that cause it are contagious. It is spread through contact with other people, but you can prevent getting and giving it by:\nSurgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy) used to be common. Today, doctors only recommend surgery if tonsillitis is severe or recurring (chronic). A tonsillectomy is an outpatient surgery, meaning you don\u2019t have to stay in the hospital.\nIf tonsillitis is left untreated, pus can collect in the back of your throat behind your tonsils, forming an abscess.

It causes a person to make repeated twitches, movements, or sounds that they have little or no control over. These are called tics. Several different tics can happen at the same time, but they may not always occur together.\nOn TV, in movies, and in the news, Tourette syndrome is often associated with cursing, or making offensive comments. However, only a small percentage of people who have Tourette syndrome have this symptom.\nThe main symptom of Tourette syndrome is tics. Tics are rapid movements or sounds that are repeated over and over for no reason. A person with a tic can\u2019t control the movement or sounds. Examples of common tics include:\nSome tics are small and are not that noticeable. Others can be constant movements or sounds that can\u2019t be controlled. Tics often get worse when a person feels stressed, tired, anxious, or excited. They can become better when a person is calm or focused on an activity. Usually, they aren\u2019t a severe problem.\nIf a child has Tourette syndrome, the tics usually start when they are between 5 and 10 years old. They often start with a tic in the head or neck area. Other tics may follow. The movements and sounds may change over time. Some tics go away after a few months. Sometimes a person will have 1 or 2 tics for many years.\nChildren who have Tourette syndrome usually have their worst symptoms when they are between 9 and 13 years old. After that time, the tics may fade in intensity or go away completely. Less than half of the people who have Tourette syndrome as children have moderate to severe tics as adults.\nIt is possible for your child to have a tic but not have Tourette syndrome. Talk to your family doctor if you think your child may have a tic or Tourette syndrome.\nDoctors don\u2019t know exactly what causes tics and Tourette syndrome. They do know that Tourette syndrome seems to run in families. It is more common in boys than in girls.\nThere is no lab test to diagnose Tourette syndrome. Your child\u2019s doctor may do an examination or run tests to rule out other causes of the symptoms. To be diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, a person must:\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid having tics or Tourette syndrome.\nThere is no cure for Tourette syndrome.

But if their tics get in the way of their daily lives, people can be treated with medicine. The type of medicine used depends on the symptoms and if the person has any other medical problems. Behavioral therapy may also help.\nTourette syndrome can affect all parts of a person\u2019s life. This includes their health, education, employment, and relationships. It also has an effect on their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.\nMany children with Tourette syndrome have other conditions, as well.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an uncommon but serious, life-threatening complication of certain types of infections. It is caused by either staph (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria or strep (Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. The bacteria produce toxins that can quickly lead to organ failure and even death.\nToxic shock syndrome was originally linked to the use of super-absorbent tampons. But changes in tampons and usage habits have made it less common. Today about half of toxic shock syndrome cases are caused by tampon use. Many cases are the result of bacteria getting into areas of injured skin. These include cuts and scrapes, surgical wounds, or chickenpox blisters. Toxic shock syndrome affects men, women, and children.\nYou are at higher risk for developing toxic shock syndrome if you have:\nA sudden fever of 102\u00b0F or higher is a warning sign for anyone who is at risk for toxic shock syndrome. Other symptoms might include:\nIf you or your child has symptoms of toxic shock syndrome, go to the emergency room right away. The infection can get worse quickly. It can cause organs such as the liver or kidneys to fail. It can also cause seizures, bleeding, and heart failure. If left untreated, it can lead to death.\nMost cases of toxic shock syndrome are caused by a toxin that is produced by staph bacteria. Some cases are caused by a toxin from strep bacteria. Not all staph or strep infections lead to toxic shock syndrome.\nToxic shock syndrome gained national attention in the late 1970s. It was tied to tampon use during a woman\u2019s menstrual period. Newer research shows using a tampon for longer than the recommended time without changing it can create the perfect environment for a staph infection. But the use of a tampon is not the only way. The same danger exists with certain birth control devices when they are used longer than the recommended time. These could include a diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap.\nWith tampon use, many researchers believe that inserting a tampon can scratch the vagina. This makes it vulnerable to an infection. They also think tampons made with artificial fibers are more likely to trap bacteria than tampons made with 100% cotton.\nToxic shock syndrome can also occur for other reasons. It can occur when a wound from a burn or surgery doesn\u2019t heal properly. It can also happen from a skin infection, just after childbirth, and even in the case of a serious nosebleed that requires the use of packed medical gauze to stop it.\nThere is no rapid test for toxic shock syndrome. Doctors can test for staph bacteria using a blood sample or a sample taken from an infected wound. However, relying on that alone takes too long when your body is in distress. Doctors usually diagnose toxic shock syndrome based on symptoms such as a high fever, low blood pressure, and a rash.\nToxic shock syndrome can affect multiple organs. Your doctor may order other tests to see how far the illness has spread. These could include a CT scan, chest X-ray, or lumbar puncture.\nThe best way to avoid toxic shock syndrome is to prevent infections. Good hand-washing is always a good defense. If you have an open wound or burn, be sure it is properly cleaned. Watch for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. Ask your doctor how you should take care of the wound or burn to avoid getting a staph infection.\nYou can reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome by using tampons carefully. Doctors suggest that youshould dothe following during your period:\nYou can get toxic shock syndrome more than once. If you\u2019ve had it before or you\u2019ve had a serious staph or strep infection, don\u2019t use tampons.\nToxic shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Call your doctor right away if you are having symptoms. You\u2019ll probably need to go to the hospital. Once there, the medical staff may start an IV to give you fluids, antibiotics, and blood pressure medicine. If your kidneys are failing, you also may be given blood plasma and kidney dialysis. If you are a woman who has a tampon, diaphragm, sponge, or cervical cap in place, it will be removed. If your infection is due to an infected wound, the wound will be cleaned thoroughly. Once you are stable, you may be moved to the intensive care unit for monitoring.\nToxic shock syndrome can lead to death in up to 50% of cases. There may be significant challenges if you survive the initial infection. This may include recovering from organ failure or from being on life support.\nLast Updated:January 22, 2019\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff, Alex Rice and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is toxic synovitis, or transient synovitis of the hip?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nTransient synovitis of the hip, also called toxic synovitis, is an inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the hip joint. Usually only one hip is affected. This condition is called \u201ctransient\u201d because it lasts only a short time. Transient synovitis of the hip is the most common cause of sudden hip pain in children.\nTransient synovitis of the hip usually occurs in children between 3 and 10 years of age. Sometimes it occurs in children younger than 3 years of age. It is more common in boys than in girls.\nThe main symptom is pain in the hip. In some children, the hip pain gets worse very quickly. In other children, the hip pain gets worse slowly. At first, the hip pain may be so mild that they don\u2019t know there is something wrong.\nWhen the pain gets bad enough, children who have toxic synovitis have a hard time walking. If your child has transient synovitis of the hip, he or she may have pain whenever the hip is moved. Your child may walk with a limp. Because of the pain, your child may have trouble standing. Some children may have pain of the inner thigh or knee area, instead of around the hip. Many children who have this condition want to lie on their back with the knee on the side that hurts bent and turned out with their foot pointed away from their body. This position may lessen the pain.\nDoctors don\u2019t know the exact cause of transient synovitis of the hip. It might be caused by a virus or it might be from an allergic reaction to an infection somewhere else in the body.\nYour doctor will look at your child\u2019s hip to find out what kind of movement makes the pain worse. Your doctor may order blood tests, X-rays, and an ultrasound. These tests will help your doctor make sure that the cause of hip pain isn\u2019t caused by something more serious.\nSince doctors don\u2019t know what causes transient synovitis of the hip, it can\u2019t be prevented or avoided.\nRest at home is the most important way to help your child\u2019s hip get better. Your child may need to take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), to reduce the swelling and inflammation around the hip joint. Also, your doctor may advise you to apply heat to your child\u2019s hip. Massage may make the area to make it feel better, too.\nYour child\u2019s doctor will probably ask you to take your child\u2019s temperature regularly and to report any temperature higher than 99.5\u00b0F. A fever may mean that your child has a problem other than hip synovitis. To make sure that your child is doing well, your doctor may want to recheck your child 12 to 24 hours after the first visit.\nWith rest and medicine, your child\u2019s hip will probably get better in 3 or 4 days. After the pain leaves, your child can resume his or her usual activities. In most children, there are no complications from transient synovitis of the hip. They recover completely. To make sure everything is all right, your doctor may want to take another X-ray of your child\u2019s hip in about 6 months.\nIf the pain is still bad after 10 days, your child should be rechecked by your doctor. Your doctor may order some tests to make sure there isn\u2019t something else wrong with your child\u2019s hip.\nLast Updated:May 23, 2019\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

You also can get it from touching anything that has been in contact with cat droppings.\nPeople who have an organ transplant or a blood transfusion can get toxoplasmosis if the organ or blood is infected. This is very rare.\nRoutine screening for toxoplasmosis is not recommended. Contact you doctor if you have symptoms or are at risk. They will do a blood test to check for the parasite.

If you are pregnant or have a weak immune system, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics.\nWomen who get toxoplasmosis while pregnant are at risk of passing it to their unborn babies. In most cases, infected babies are born healthy but may have future health issues. These include damage to the eyes and brain.\nWomen who were infected at least 6 to 9 months before pregnancy should have immunity. This means the infection will not be active during pregnancy, and the risk of passing it to your baby is low.\nThere is no benefit to testing your cat\u2019s droppings for toxoplasmosis.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke. It is considered a warning stroke. During this type of stroke, blood flow to your brain is blocked for a few minutes to a few hours. The average amount of time is one minute. Most symptoms go away within 24 hours. That is far less than a major stroke. There is usually no long-term damage following a TIA. This type of stroke significantly increases your risk of a major stroke.\nTIA symptoms are similar to a major stroke. They include:\nAll strokes are caused by reduction or loss of blood flow. The most common cause is a blood clot. This is same for a major stroke. Blood clots are caused by cholesterol buildup. As cholesterol blocks your arteries, it forms a blood clot. Eventually, the clot breaks free. The clot travels to your brain. That\u2019s where the TIA occurs. Managing your cholesterol levels through diet, exercise, and medicine lowers your risk.\nOther medical conditions can increase your chances of having a stroke. These include high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of stroke. This includes not smoking and limiting alcohol. Other risks include age, heredity, gender, and ethnicity. If you\u2019ve had one stroke, you are at a higher risk of having another one.\nIt\u2019s difficult to identify a TIA from a major stroke as it\u2019s happening. Self-awareness is important. Getting to a hospital or calling 911 also is important. That\u2019s because treating a TIA or major stroke fast prevents further damage. A doctor will perform a physical exam. They will ask you about your medical history. This includes questions about other medical conditions and your lifestyle. The doctor will listen to your heart and lungs and test you for signs of numbness, weakness, or other neurologic problems.\nA TIA may only last minutes but could last longer. You, a family member or friend should remember your symptoms and what time they began. All tests and exams will happen after you have the TIA.\nCertain imaging tests can diagnose a stroke. They include:\nSometimes an arteriography (a test that creates a picture of your arteries using dye and X-rays) is used to diagnose a TIA or minor stroke.\nMost of the time, your body treats a TIA on its own. The blood clot quickly dissolves. A TIA still requires immediate attention. Go to an emergency room when you recognize symptoms. Time is critical in treating all strokes. The sooner you are treated, the better your recovery and outcome.\nTreatment may include:\nAfter a TIA, your doctor may want you to take aspirin. Aspirin can help keep your blood from forming clots that block your arteries. If taking low-dose aspirin is right for you, it is important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions. Your doctor may also prescribe a statin. Statin drugs help to lower your cholesterol levels and avoid cholesterol buildup in your arteries.\nYou also can reduce risk through healthy living and managing diseases that cause strokes. Maintain a healthy diet, exercise, don\u2019t smoke, limit alcohol, and take your medicines. This is good advice whether you are at risk or not. See your doctor if you have a medical history, family history, or other risk factors. A TIA is a warning for a future, major stroke. Without lifestyle changes and medicine, a second TIA or major stroke can happen within a year of your first TIA. Even with healthy changes, there\u2019s no guarantee you won\u2019t have a stroke.\nTIA\u2019s do not cause long-term damage (walking, talking). Anxiety and worry about another stroke is common. This is true even after making lifestyle changes and taking medicine. Teach yourself, your family, and friends to recognize the signs of a stroke. The phrase FAST helps you remember the symptoms.\nF\u2014 Face. You can\u2019t smile. Your face or mouth is drooping. This is limited to one side of your face.\nA\u2014 Arms. You can\u2019t raise one or both arms.\nS\u2014 Speech. You can\u2019t speak, repeat a simple phrase. Your speech is slurred.\nT\u2014 Time. Time is the most important factor in treating a stroke.

You may go back to see the doctor for a check-up.\nIf you have a moderate or severe injury, your doctor will start by stabilizing your injury. This involves getting\u00a0oxygen\u00a0to your brain and body, maintaining blood flow, and managing blood pressure. These precautions help prevent further damage. You may receive medicines in the hospital or you could need surgery. A surgeon can repair a skull fracture, stop bleeding in the brain, remove blood clots, or relieve pressure inside the skull. Surgery may be needed immediately. Sometimes blood clots take time to form, and surgery is needed days or weeks after the injury.\nMany people with moderate to severe TBI need rehabilitation. The type of rehab you need will depend on many factors, including how severe the injury was and what part of the brain it affected. For example, if the injury affected the part of your brain involved with speech, you may need speech therapy. Or, if it affected the area of the brain that controls movement, you may need physical therapy. Your rehab may take place in the hospital, in a skilled nursing facility, in an outpatient clinic, or at home. It usually involves many specialists. The goal of any therapy or rehabilitation is to improve your ability to perform daily activities.\nSome traumatic brain injuries have lasting effects. You may be left with disabilities. These can be physical, behavioral, communicative, and/or mental. Customized treatment helps you to have as full and normal a life as possible.\nIf you have lasting effects from your injury, you might find it helpful to find a support group. There, others who have experienced similar injuries can help you learn about issues related to your injury, teach you coping strategies, and offer emotional support.

    "article_title": "What is trigeminal neuralgia?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a painful condition that causes an extreme burning, electric or shock-like pain in the face. The pain can be so extreme that it can get in the way of normal activity. Even the fear of oncoming attacks can be so stressful that performing day-to-day tasks is a challenge.\nThe pain from trigeminal neuralgia may last a few seconds or minutes, then ease and then recur. Usually, these cycles of pain occur for a few days or weeks, and then stop for days, weeks or even years before returning. Over time, the cycles tend to recur more quickly, with shorter breaks in between.\nThe pain sometimes is triggered by very normal activities, such as chewing, smiling, talking, shaving or brushing your teeth. At times, even the wind on your face can cause pain to start. Some people who have trigeminal neuralgia notice numbness or tingling of the face in the days leading up to an attack.\nTrigeminal neuralgia occurs when the trigeminal nerve is pinched or damaged. The trigeminal nerve connects many different parts of your face to your brain. It is made up of three branches. The upper branch links the brain to the scalp and forehead. The middle branch connects to the cheek, side of the nose, top lip, and upper jaw, teeth, and gums. The lower branch extends to the lower jaw, teeth, gums, and bottom lip.\nThe damaged area of the nerve is often located at the base of the brain. This is where the nerve extends to parts of the face. A blood vessel that grows too close and presses on the nerve may cause damage. It could also wear away the nerve\u2019s protective coating (called myelin). Something like a tumor can also cause damage by putting extra pressure on the nerve. In many cases, a cause of the nerve damage cannot be found.\nNo one specific test can confirm you have trigeminal neuralgia. Often, the diagnosis is made by ruling out other possible causes of your pain. Your doctor may try to pinpoint the cause by asking you questions about your symptoms and medical history. They may check for other things that could be causing your pain, such as jaw, sinus, or tooth problems. Your doctor may order a type of brain scan called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see if a blood vessel is pressing against your trigeminal nerve. An MRI can also look for signs of a tumor or other problems.\nAnyone can get trigeminal neuralgia, so you can\u2019t really prevent it. It\u2019s more likely for people older than 50 years of age. It\u2019s also more common in people who have multiple sclerosis. This is because multiple sclerosis damages the myelin that protects the nerves. Women are more likely to get it than men. The condition seems to be passed down in families, probably because relatives\u2019 blood vessels form in similar ways.\nTrigeminal neuralgia can be treated in many ways. Some treatments will work well for some people and less so for others. Don\u2019t get discouraged if the first treatment you try doesn\u2019t work. Let your doctor know how you are doing and ask about other options\nYour doctor may prescribe an antiseizure drug. These medicines change how nerves send information. That is why they can help with the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia. Examples include carbamazepine, clonazepam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, topiramate and valproic acid.\nCertain types of antidepressants can also help with the pain. These alter the chemical action in your brain that leads to sensing pain. Some examples include amitriptyline, bupropion, doxepin, duloxetine, imipramine, paroxetine, nortriptyline, and venlafaxine.\nCombinations of two or even three medications may be more effective than a single medication. You may need to try different medications and combinations to find the most effective treatment. Side effects, such as feeling tired, can limit the use of some medications.\nYour doctor might suggest you try a nerve block. This is an injection with an anesthetic. It can stop the nerve from hurting, at least for a little while.\nIf medicines do not help enough and the pain is affecting your ability to function, you may need surgery. During surgery, your doctor will damage or destroy certain nerves using chemicals, electric currents, radiation, or other means. The trigeminal nerve itself might be cut to eliminate or reduce the pain. Any surgery in which nerves are destroyed will cause some ongoing numbness. However, pain can sometimes return after surgery and be worse than before.\nNot knowing when you\u2019ll have flareups of facial pain is stressful. That\u2019s why it is important to work with your doctor to find a treatment plan that will work for you. Also, become as knowledgeable about your condition as possible. That way, you can play a more active role in your care. Find a support group of other people who have trigeminal neuralgia. Having a safe space to vent and share stories can go a long way in boosting your mental and emotional health. It also reminds you that you aren\u2019t alone.\nAmerican Chronic Pain Association\nU.S. Pain Foundation\nFacial Pain Association\nLast Updated:June 7, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated November 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nTuberculosis, also called TB, is an\u00a0infection\u00a0caused by\u00a0bacteria. Tuberculosis usually affects the\u00a0lungs. But it can also affect other parts of the body. This could include the joints, kidneys, spine, and brain.\nThere are 2 types of TB:\nIf it isn\u2019t treated properly, TB can be fatal.\nYour symptoms will depend on what area of your body is affected. Usually TB affects the lungs. The symptoms of active TB in the lungs include:\nIf TB affects your joints, you may develop pain that feels like\u00a0arthritis. If TB affects your bladder, it may hurt to go to the bathroom and there may be blood in your\u00a0urine. TB of the spine can cause back pain and leg\u00a0paralysis. TB of the brain can causeheadachesand nausea.\nHealthy people are often able to fight off the infection. They usually don\u2019t develop active TB but the bacteria are dormant (inactive) in their lungs. If your body isn\u2019t able to contain the infection and the bacteria continue to grow, active TB can develop. This can happen years after you\u2019re infected. It usually happens when something causes your immune system to weaken. Most of the time, you\u2019ll have symptoms if you have active TB. But sometimes people have active TB and don\u2019t know it.\nTB is caused by bacteria. The bacteria spread through the air from one person to another. The bacteria enter the air when a person with active TB in the throat or lungs talks, laughs, sneezes, or coughs. Anyone who is nearby can then breathe in that air and breathe in the bacteria. Then they become infected.\nTB bacteria is spread only through the air. You\u00a0can\u2019t get TB by:\nOnce you breathe in the bacteria, they settle in your lungs and begin to grow. Sometimes the bacteria move from the lungs to other areas of the body. This could include the kidneys, spine, and brain.\nWhen you have an active infection in your lungs or throat, you\u2019re contagious. This means you can spread the disease to other people. When the disease is in other parts of your body, and not your lungs or throat, you\u2019re usually not able to spread it.\nIt\u2019s not easy to get tuberculosis. Usually, you have to be in close contact with someone who has active TB. You need to be around them for an extended period of time. TB tends to be spread between family members, close friends, and people who live or work together.\nIf you do get infected, you\u2019re at higher risk of developing active TB disease if you have a weakened immune system. This could include:\nThe most commonly used method to check for tuberculosis is a skin test. Blood tests can also be used. If you have a positive skin test or blood test, it means you have been exposed to a person who has tuberculosis. You have been infected with the bacteria that cause the disease. The test doesn\u2019t tell you if you have a latent TB infection or if you have active TB disease.\nIf your skin test is positive, you will likely have a chest X-ray and a physical exam. This will tell your doctor which kind of TB you have. Usually, a person can be infected with the bacteria that cause TB but not actually have active tuberculosis. Of the people who are infected with the bacteria, only a few (about 10%) go on to develop active TB.\nThe best way to prevent getting a tuberculosis infection is to avoid being in close contact with a person who has active TB disease.\nThere is a\u00a0vaccine\u00a0against tuberculosis. It\u2019s used in countries where TB is common. It\u2019s not often used in the United States because the chances of being infected with TB are low.\nTuberculosis is treated with antibiotic medicine. The medicine(s) your doctor recommends will depend on many factors. These include your age, your health, whether your TB is active or latent, and whether your TB is drug resistant. This means that certain medicines won\u2019t work on it.\nYou will need to take your TB medicine(s) for 6-9 months. Your doctor will tell you exactly how and when to take your medicine, and for how long. It isveryimportant that you follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully. Take your medicine at the same time every day. Don\u2019t skip doses or stop taking your medicine. This could make your TB harder to treat.\nIf you\u2019re infected with TB but don\u2019t have active TB, you can take medicine to prevent the disease from developing. This is called preventive therapy. If you follow your doctor\u2019s instructions carefully, you won\u2019t develop TB disease.\nCommon medicines used to treat tuberculosis include:\nDepending on your doctor\u2019s recommendations, you may take 1 or more of these medicines. These medicines don\u2019t usually cause side effects. However, TB drugs can damage your\u00a0liver.\nDon\u2019t drink alcohol or take acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol) while taking TB medicines. Alcohol and acetaminophen can increase the risk of liver problems. Always check with your doctor before you take any other medicine. Some medicines interact with TB medicines and can cause side effects.\nWhile taking these medicines, your doctor may want to monitor you every month. For example, you may need to visit your doctor for tests, to get another\u00a0prescription, and to check for any side effects or problems.\nAlthough side effects from tuberculosis medicine aren\u2019t common, they can be serious. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms:\nIf you have active TB disease, it will take several weeks of treatment before you are no longer contagious. Until then, it\u2019s important to take steps so you don\u2019t spread the bacteria.\nIf you develop active TB disease, you may need to be monitored medically for the rest of your life. This could include regular checkups and probably chest X-rays. This is done to make sure you stay free of TB disease, even after you have taken the full course of TB medicine.\nAmerican Lung Association: Tuberculosis (TB)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Tuberculosis (TB)\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Tuberculosis\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated March 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nTuberous sclerosis is a rare disease that causes tumors, or growths, in the brain and other organs. These growths can occur in the skin, kidneys, eyes,\u00a0heart, or\u00a0lungs. They are usually\u00a0benign\u00a0(not cancerous). However, when severe, tuberous sclerosis can shorten your life.\nThe first signs of tuberous sclerosis may occur at birth. Other people develop symptoms over time. Some of the first signs are seizures that are hard to control and spots on the skin. Some people may have learning problems.\nTuberous sclerosis affects every 1 in 6,000 newborns in the United States. The disorder occurs in both boys and girls and in people of all races and ethnic groups.\nYour doctor may suspect tuberous sclerosis if your baby has a condition called cardiac rhabdomyomas (benign heart tumors) at birth. Another sign in infants is having seizures, especially a kind called infantile spasms.\nOther symptoms can appear later in childhood or even in adulthood. They include:\nThe symptoms of tuberous sclerosis are different for different people. Some people may have mild symptoms. Others may have intellectual disabilities and seizures that are hard to control.\nTuberous sclerosis is a\u00a0genetic\u00a0condition. That means it is caused a change in your genes, the elements that make your body. Sometimes, it can be passed down through a family. If one parent has it, every child born to that parent has up to a 50% chance of inheriting it, too. But in most cases of the disease, there is no family history.\nYour doctor will talk with you about your symptoms and health history. They may order several tests. They may do a\u00a0CT\u00a0scan or\u00a0MRI\u00a0of your head. They may do a CT scan of your chest or an echocardiogram of your heart. They may also do an ultrasound of the kidneys. Sometimes your doctor might perform an ultraviolet light examination of your skin. This helps identify if you have white spots on your skin that can come with tuberous sclerosis.\nIt is possible to\u00a0diagnose\u00a0the disease in an infant, especially one with a benign heart tumor or seizures. But many times, children aren\u2019t diagnosed until they are older and other symptoms start to appear.\nThere is no way to prevent or avoid tuberous sclerosis. If you have a family history of the disease and you want to have children, talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a genetic counselor or medical geneticist.\nThere is no cure for tuberous sclerosis. However, your doctor can treat many of the symptoms:\nTuberous sclerosis is a lifelong condition, though many people who have it live a normal life. Their symptoms are mild or can be treated by their doctor. If symptoms are more severe, the disease can have more of an impact on your life. For example, children who have uncontrollable seizures or a severe mental disability may need assistance for the rest of their lives.\nAnyone who has tuberous sclerosis is at higher risk of developing complications related to brain tumors or\u00a0kidney\u00a0lesions. That is why it is important to see your doctor regularly. They can help monitor your symptoms and catch complications early.\nSome communities offer support systems for tuberous sclerosis. If you\u2019d like to connect with other families experiencing the same thing, ask your doctor if there\u2019s a group in your area.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Tuberous Sclerosis\nNational Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: Tuberous Sclerosis Fact Sheet\nTuberous Sclerosis Alliance\nLast Updated:August 11, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is diabetes?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2025 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byKyle Bradford Jones, MD, FAAFP\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your body doesn\u2019t make or use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone. It causes too much blood glucose (sugar) to build up in the blood. There are two main types of diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes, the focus of this article, occurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce any insulin. It is an autoimmune disease that develops gradually over time. If often has no initial symptoms. It\u2019s sometimes called juvenile diabetes because it\u2019s usually discovered in children and teenagers, but it may appear in adults, too.\nType 2 diabetesoccurs when your body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin or doesn\u2019t use the insulin as it should. In the past, doctors thought only adults were at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, an increasing number of children in the United States are now being diagnosed with the disease. Doctors think this increase is mostly because more children are overweight or have obesity and are less physically active.\nSymptoms vary from person to person. The early stages of diabetes have very few symptoms. You may not know you have the disease. But damage may already be happening to your eyes, your kidneys, and your cardiovascular system. Common symptoms include:\nIf blood sugars are extremely high, people can develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This is a very dangerous complication of uncontrolled diabetes. People with DKA might have:\nIf diabetes is left untreated, your blood sugar levels become too high. When this happens, symptoms may includeshortness of breath, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, dehydration, and even coma and death.\nIn type 1 diabetes, your bodydoesn\u2019tmake insulin. This is because the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin. Doctorsaren\u2019tsure why this happens. You have a greater risk of type 1 diabetes if one of your parents or one of your siblings has it.According to the American Diabetes Association, if you have a close family member who has type 1 diabetes, you are 15 times more likely to develop the disease yourself.\nIf you have a family member who has type 1 diabetes, your doctor may want to screen you early because you are at greater risk for developing diabetes.\nAfter examining you, discussing your symptoms, and going over your health history, your doctor may test for diabetes if they suspect you\u2019re at risk. To check for diabetes, your doctor may request the following tests:\nIt is important to tell your doctor if you have a family member who has type 1 diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or avoided, but it can be managed.\nThe single most important thing you can do when you have diabetes is control your blood sugar level. You can do this by through a combination of taking insulin and eating right, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight.\nYour doctor will test your blood sugar every 3 months with an A1C test. Your doctor may ask you totest your blood sugaron your own throughout the day if you are taking insulin. You will need to use ablood glucose monitorto check it on your own. This involves pricking your finger for blood and putting a test strip in the blood. Putting the test strip in the monitor gets the results.Continuous glucose monitors (CGM)are also an option to help people with diabetes measure their blood glucose around the clock\nIf your blood sugar gets too low, you might feel tired, experience problems with muscle coordination, sweat, have difficulty thinking or speaking clearly, twitch, feel like you\u2019re going to faint, become pale, lose consciousness, or have a seizure. At the earliest sign of any of these symptoms, eat or drink something that will raise your blood sugar fast. This could include candy, juice, milk, or raisins. If you don\u2019t feel better in 15 minutes or if monitoring shows that your blood sugar level is still too low, eat or drink another item to raise your blood sugar fast. Always keep a supply of these items on hand for emergencies.\nYou may not know if your blood sugar is too high unless you test it yourself. However, you may experience common symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, blurry vision, and feeling tired. Some factors unrelated to food can make your blood sugar high. This includes not taking your insulin correctly, overeating at a meal, illness, having hormonal changes, and stress.\nIf your blood sugar level is too high, you may need to take an extra dose of rapid- or short-acting insulin to return to normal. Your doctor can tell you how much insulin you need to take to lower your blood sugar level.\nYou canlive a normal lifewith well-controlled diabetes. However, you must pay close and regular attention to your diet, weight, exercise, and medicine. If you don\u2019t control your diabetes, you will have too much glucose in your blood. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and damage to the nerves and kidneys.You could also lose your vision and sensation in your legs.These are known as diabetic complications.\nThe longer your diabetes is uncontrolled, the more damage you do to your health. That\u2019s why treatment is important at any age. Keeping blood sugar levels very close to the ideal can minimize, delay, and in some cases even prevent the problems that diabetes can cause.\nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: Diabetes\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Diabetes\nLast Updated:February 10, 2025\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Sores also could be on your esophagus (throat). Most ulcers are located in the small intestine. These ulcers are called duodenal ulcers. Stomach ulcers are called gastric ulcers. Ulcers in the throat are called esophageal ulcers.\nIf your ulcer becomes perforated (torn), it becomes a bleeding ulcer. This can cause the following symptoms:\nA bacterial infection called Heliocobacter pylori (H. pylori) is typcially what causes ulcers. Acids from the foods we eat can make the pain and discomfort worse. Long-term use of aspirin or anti-inflammatory medicines (ibuprofen) are also a common cause of ulcers. Stress and spicy foods can make an ulcer worse.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms. They may do an endoscopy. This procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube attached to a camera down your throat and into your stomach. Your doctor will test your blood, breath, or stool for H. pylori. They also can test a sample of your stomach lining. Your doctor also will ask you if you regularly take aspirin or anti-inflammatory medicines.\nYou cannot prevent an ulcer caused by an H. pylori infection. However, you can reduce your risks by limiting aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines. Avoid foods that are acidic (orange juice) and spicy to reduce discomfort. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.\nYour doctor will give you an antibiotic medicine to treat an H. pylori infection. You will have to take it for 2 to 3 weeks. Your doctor also might suggest triple therapy. This is a combination of 2 antibiotics and a protein pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are pills that reduce the amount of stomach acid made by glands in the lining of your stomach.\nYour doctor might suggest medicines to reduce stomach acids. You may have to take these for up to 8 weeks.\nSeveral other medicines can be used to help treat ulcers. Two types of medicines (H2 blockers and PPIs) reduce the amount of acid that your stomach makes. Over-the-counter antacid medicine provides temporary relief. Smoking and alcohol make the discomfort worse. In severe cases, you may need surgery. Ulcers get worse without treatment. If aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicine irritates your stomach, your doctor may suggest the medicine, misoprostol.\nIf you have an ulcer, avoid the things that make your ulcer symptoms worse. This means to avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and smoking. If you take aspirin or ibuprofen for chronic pain, talk to your doctor. They may suggest an alternative. Keep your diet balanced.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated February 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byRobert \"Chuck\" Rich, Jr., MD, FAAFP\nTable of Contents\nTesticles are part of the male body. They make male hormones and\u00a0sperm. Most men have two testicles, located in their\u00a0scrotum.\nWhile male babies are growing in their mother\u2019s\u00a0uterus, their testicles are inside their abdomen. Usually, the testicles move down into the scrotum right before or after birth. An undescended testicle occurs when it doesn\u2019t move down into the scrotum.\nUndescended testicles are common. Up to 30% of premature male babies have at least one undescended testicle. The rate decreases to 3% to 5% in full-term male babies. An undescended testicle will often move down on its own in the first few months. If this doesn\u2019t happen after about 6 to 9 months, it may require treatment.\nIn most cases, there are no symptoms that occur with an undescended testicle. The only sign is the absence of one or both testicles in the scrotum.\nMost of the time, the cause of an undescended testicle is unknown. Some babies have retractile testes. This is caused when a\u00a0muscle\u00a0reflex pulls the testicle up out of the scrotum. Other babies may have a testicle that is too small to locate by exam. A baby may be missing one or both testicles completely. This is caused by a developmental issue during pregnancy.\nAn undescended testicle is often diagnosed during a child\u2019s newborn exam. The doctor will feel the baby\u2019s scrotum to see if both testes are there. If your doctor can\u2019t feel at least one inside the scrotum, it\u2019s important to find out the cause. Your doctor may perform an ultrasound or\u00a0CT\u00a0scan to try and locate the testicle.\nYou can\u2019t prevent or avoid an undescended testicle.\nThere are several reasons to treat an undescended testicle. First, undescended testicles may not make sperm. Testicles are in the scrotum because the temperature is cooler there than it is inside the body. A cooler temperature helps the testicles make sperm. A baby boy with an undescended testicle can start to lose the ability to make sperm by 12 months of age.\nSecond, an undescended testicle is more likely to develop a\u00a0tumor. When the testicle is inside the scrotum, a doctor can feel it to check for a tumor. This leads to early detection and treatment oftesticular cancer.\nGetting the testicle down into the scrotum early in life can lead to better outcomes. There are several treatment options for an undescended testicle. For babies who have retractile testes, the testicle will often descend on its own.\nHormone\u00a0therapy is one type of treatment. It involves injections (shots) of a hormone called hCG. This helps the testicles make male hormones (testosterone). A higher level of male hormones may move the testicle down into the scrotum.\nIf the testicle hasn\u2019t come down by the time your baby is 9 months old, the doctor may suggest surgery. The operation is called orchiopexy. The surgeon makes a small cut in the\u00a0groin\u00a0to bring down the testicle. The surgery and healing time are short.\nIf you\u2019re an adult with an undescended testicle, the surgeon will likely remove it. This is because moving the testicle down at this point won\u2019t improve your ability to make sperm. Removing it also may lower your risk of\u00a0cancer.\nAn undescended testicle can be cured. Sometimes, it can descend on its own. Other times, your doctor may recommend medicine or surgery to treat the issue.\nAn undescended testicle that is left untreated can lead to future health problems.

    "article_title": "What is urinary incontinence?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nUrinary\u00a0incontinence\u00a0is the loss of\u00a0bladder control. This means that you can\u2019t always control when you urinate. Urinary incontinence can range from leaking a small amount of\u00a0urine\u00a0(such as when coughing or laughing) to having very strong urges to urinate that are difficult to control. This can be embarrassing but talk to your doctor about it. It can be treated.\nMillions of adults in the United States have urinary incontinence. It\u2019s most common in people older than 50 years of age, especially women. Aging can reduce how much urine your bladder can hold. It can make your stream of urine weaker and can cause you to feel the urge to urinate more often. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have urinary incontinence just because you\u2019re aging. With treatment, it can be controlled or cured. Urinary incontinence But can also occur in younger people, especially women who have just given birth.\nBe sure to talk to your doctor if you have this problem. If you hide your incontinence, you risk getting rashes, sores, skin infections and urinary tract infections. Also, you may find yourself avoiding friends and family because of fear and embarrassment.\nThere are 5 types of urinary incontinence:\nStress\u00a0incontinence is when urine leaks because of sudden pressure on your lower stomach muscles.\u00a0This may happen when you cough, laugh, lift something, or exercise. Stress incontinence usually occurs when the pelvic muscles are weakened, for example, by childbirth or surgery. Stress incontinence is common in women.\nThis occurs when the need to urinate comes on very suddenly, often before you can get to a toilet. Your body may only give you a warning of a few seconds to minutes before you urinate. Urge incontinence is most common in the elderly and may be a sign of a urinary tract\u00a0infection\u00a0or an overactive bladder.\nThis type of incontinence is the uncontrollable leakage of small amounts of urine. It\u2019s caused by an overfilled bladder. You may feel like you can\u2019t empty your bladder all the way and you may\u00a0strain\u00a0when urinating. This often occurs in men and can be caused by something blocking the urinary flow, such as an enlarged\u00a0prostate\u00a0gland\u00a0or tumor.Diabetesor certain medicines may also cause the problem.\nThis type occurs when you have normal urine control but have trouble getting to the bathroom in time. You may not be able to get to the bathroom because of\u00a0arthritis\u00a0or other diseases that make it hard to move around.\nThis type involves having more than one of the types of incontinence listed above.\nUrinary incontinence can be caused by many different medical problems, including weak pelvic muscles or diabetes. Some common causes include:\nIt is important to talk to your family doctor about your symptoms. This is the best way for your doctor to determine which type of urinary incontinence you have. Your doctor may also request a sample of urine. You may need to keep a diary of your urination habits (when you go and how much). Your doctor may order a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate your bladder. Your doctor will use all this information to determine your type of urinary incontinence.\nYou may be able to prevent urinary incontinence by working to keep pelvic muscles strong. But even so, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that you will never have urinary incontinence.\nThere are also lifestyle changes you can make to prevent urinary incontinence. You may find it helpful to make some changes in your diet. Alcohol, caffeine, foods high in acid (such as tomato or grapefruit), and spicy foods can irritate your bladder. Talk to your doctor if you think your\u00a0diet\u00a0may contribute to your incontinence.\nSome people find that limiting how much they drink before bedtime helps reduce nighttime incontinence.\nLosing weight if you are overweight can also help reduce incontinence.\nTreatment depends on what\u2019s causing the problem and what type of incontinence you have. If your urinary incontinence is caused by a medical problem, the incontinence will go away when the problem is treated. Kegel exercises and bladder training help some types of incontinence through strengthening the pelvic muscles. Medicine and surgery are other options.\nKegel exerciseshelp strengthen the muscles that control the bladder. They can be done anywhere, any time. Although designed for women, the Kegel exercises can also help men. It may take 3 to 6 months to see an improvement.\nBladder training (timed voiding) is a way of learning to manage urinary incontinence. It is generally used for stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or a combination of the 2 types (mixed incontinence).\nBladder training can help in the following ways:\nOther ways to treat urinary incontinence include medicines or the use of medical devices. For example, estrogen cream inserted in the vagina can be helpful for some women who have mild stress incontinence. Several prescription medicines are available to treat urge incontinence. For men, prescription medicine is available to shrink the prostate and improve flow of urine through the prostate. Medical devices that deliver biofeedback or electrical nerve stimulation can be effective. Talk to your doctor about possible options for your type of incontinence, including a combination treatment approach.\nIn some cases, surgery may be an option. Treatment depends on what type of urinary incontinence you have and what is causing it.\nDo not let urinary incontinence control your life. Do not let it keep you at home or affect your typical activities. All it takes is a little planning. For example, if you know you are going to not be near a bathroom, consider using a panty liner or pad. When you are at an event away from home, scope out the locations of bathrooms. Take frequent bathroom breaks. Try to drink less while you are out.\nMost importantly, talk to your doctor and those close to you about your urinary incontinence. You may be embarrassed at first, but they can help you work on solutions\u2014especially your doctor.

    "article_title": "What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, the bladder and the urethra. The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs that lie against the spine in the lower back. As blood flows through the kidneys, they remove waste and store it in the bladder as urine. The bladder is the balloon-like organ located in the pelvis, which is between your abdomen and thighs. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body. Common UTI symptoms can include a strong urge to urinate that doesn\u2019t go away or a burning feeling while urinating.\nSometimes germs can grow in the urinary tract but you won\u2019t have any symptoms. This is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Your doctor can test to find out if you have this. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated in pregnant women, but does not need to be treated in most other women.\nPossible signs of a urinary tract infection include the following:\nIn a child, UTI symptoms may include any of the symptoms listed above and may also include:\nUTIs are caused by bacteria (germs) that get into the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Any part of your urinary tract can become infected, but bladder and urethra infections are the most common.\nWomen tend to get urinary tract infections more often than men because bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women. The urethra (the opening to your urinary tract) is shorter in women than in men, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.\nThe urethra is located near the rectum in women. Bacteria from the rectum can easily travel up the urethra and cause infections. Bacteria from the rectum is more likely to get into the urethra if you wipe from back to front (instead of front to back) after a bowel movement. Be sure to teach children how to wipe correctly.\nHaving sex may also cause urinary tract infections in women because bacteria can be pushed into the urethra. Using a diaphragm can lead to infections becausediaphragmspush against the urethra and make it harder to completely empty your bladder. The urine that stays in the bladder is more likely to grow bacteria and cause infections.\nFrequent urinary tract infections may be caused by changes in the bacteria in the vagina. Antibacterial vaginal douches, spermicides, and certain oral antibiotics may cause changes in vaginal bacteria. Avoid using these items, if possible. Menopause can also cause changes in vaginal bacteria that increase your risk for urinary tract infection. Taking estrogen usually corrects this problem but may not be for everyone.\nA painful burning feeling when you urinate is often a sign of a urinary tract infection (sometimes also called a bladder infection). However, painful urination can occur even if you don\u2019t have an infection. Certain drugs, like some used in cancer chemotherapy, may inflame the bladder. Something pressing against the bladder (like an ovarian cyst) or a kidney stone stuck near the entrance to the bladder can also cause painful urination.\nPainful urination can also be caused by vaginal infection or irritation. You might be sensitive to chemicals in products such as douches, vaginal lubricants, soaps, scented toilet paper, or contraceptive foams or sponges. If it hurts to urinate after you\u2019ve used these products, you\u2019re probably sensitive to them.\nYes. Painful urination can be a symptom of a more serious problem. You should tell your doctor about your UTI symptoms and how long you\u2019ve had them. Tell your doctor about any medical conditions you have, such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, because these could affect your body\u2019s response to infection. Tell your doctor about any known abnormality in your urinary tract, and if you are or might be pregnant. Tell your doctor if you\u2019ve had any procedures or surgeries on your urinary tract. He or she also need to know if you were recently hospitalized (less than 1 month ago) or stayed in a nursing home.\nIf your doctor thinks your pain may be from vaginal inflammation, he or she may wipe the lining of your vagina with a swab to collect mucus. The mucus will be looked at under a microscope to see if it has yeast or other organisms. If your pain is from an infection in your urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder), your doctor may swab it to test for bacteria. If an infection can\u2019t be found, your doctor may suggest other tests.\nYour doctor will usually be able to tell what\u2019s causing your pain by your description of your symptoms, along with a physical exam. Testing your urine (urinalysis) can also help your doctor identify what type of infection you have. Usually, a sample of your urine is taken in your doctor\u2019s office and sent to a lab to check for infection.\nThere are many lifestyle choices that can help you prevent UTIs. These are some of the things you can do to protect yourself from them:\nIf you are a healthy adult man or a woman who is not pregnant, a few days of antibiotic pills will usually cure your urinary tract infection. If you are pregnant, your doctor will prescribe a medicine that is safe for you and the baby. Usually, symptoms of the infection go away 1 to 2 days after you start taking the medicine. It\u2019s important that you follow your doctor\u2019s instructions for taking the medicine, even if you start to feel better. Skipping pills could make the treatment less effective.\nYour doctor may also suggest a medicine to numb your urinary tract and make you feel better while the antibiotic starts to work. The medicine makes your urine turn bright orange, so don\u2019t be alarmed by the color when you urinate.\nIf the treatment isn\u2019t working, your UTI symptoms will stay the same, get worse, or you will develop new symptoms. Call your doctor if you have a fever (higher than 100.5 degrees), chills, lower stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. You should also call your doctor if, after taking medicine for 3 days, you still have a burning feeling when you urinate. If you are pregnant, you should also call your doctor if you have any contractions.\nIf you have a UTI and it isn\u2019t treated, it may lead to a kidney infection. Kidney infections may cause early labor. Fortunately, asymptomatic bacteriuria and bladder infections are usually found and treated before the kidneys become infected. If your doctor treats a urinary tract infection early and properly, it won\u2019t hurt your baby.\nYes, sometimes a UTI can damage the kidneys. It\u2019s important to seek treatment right away if you think you or your child has a UTI.\nIf you have 3 or more urinary tract infections each year, your doctor may want you to begin a preventive antibiotic program. A small dose of an antibiotic taken every day helps to reduce the number of infections. If sexual intercourse seems to cause infections for you, your doctor many suggest taking the antibiotic after intercourse.\nYou doctor may want to check to see if an anatomical (physical) problem is causing the UTIs. If so, surgery may be needed to fix the problem. Some children who have bladder or kidney problems have to take medicine every day so they won\u2019t get another UTI.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Urinary Tract Infections\nLast Updated:November 4, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated April 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nFibroids are benign growths (not cancer) in the muscular wall of the uterus. These growths can be very tiny or as large as a cantaloupe.\nFibroids are very common. Between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by the time they reach 50 years of age. Most women get uterine fibroids in their 40s and 50s, and many women have them without knowing it.\nOnce a fibroid is formed, it tends to grow larger until menopause. After menopause, fibroids tend to shrink because women have less estrogen at that stage of their lives.\nMany women who have fibroids don\u2019t have symptoms. In other women, fibroids can cause heavy bleeding during the menstrual period. Periods may last much longer than usual. Fibroids may also cause pain or a feeling of pressure or heaviness in the lower pelvic area (the area between the hip bones), the back or the legs. Some women have pain during sexual intercourse. Others have a constant feeling that they need to urinate. There may also be a feeling of pressure in the bowel. Some women have constipation or bloating. Uterine fibroids can also cause infertility as well as complications during pregnancy and labor.\nIt\u2019s important to recognize red flags when it comes to your period and uterine health.\nThisUterine Health Guideis here to help you better understand it all.\nDoctors do not know what causes uterine fibroids. Some researchers believe they may be genetic (run in families). Other researchers think they could be related to hormone levels.\nOther factors that can increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing uterine fibroids include:\nEven if you have no symptoms, your doctor may discover that you have fibroids during a routine pelvic exam. They may be able to feel the fibroids during the exam and even estimate the size.\nYour doctor also may order imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis. Or they may suggest looking inside you with a scope. This can be done through laparoscopy or hysteroscopy. In laparoscopy, your doctor will make a small incision (cut) near your navel and insert the scope. In hysteroscopy, your doctor will insert the scope into your vagina and cervix (no incision needed).\nBecause doctors don\u2019t know for sure what causes them, uterine fibroids cannot be completely prevented or avoided. However, lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and eat less red meat, can help reduce your risk.\nThere are many treatment options for women who have fibroids. Fibroids that don\u2019t cause any symptoms may not need treatment. For fibroids that do cause symptoms, treatment options include medicine, noninvasive or minimally invasive procedures, or traditional surgery. Your doctor will help you figure out the best treatment option for your fibroid.\nYour doctor will \u00a0consider many things before helping you choose a treatment. Some of these things include:\nMedicines don\u2019t get rid of fibroids, but they can help control symptoms and make fibroids smaller.\nYour doctor may recommend a noninvasive or minimally invasive procedure to remove or destroy the fibroid.\nA noninvasive procedure means that your doctor does not have to make an incision (cut your skin) to destroy or remove the fibroid. MRI-guided focused ultrasound therapy is a new, noninvasive way of treating fibroids. During this procedure, you lie in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner while it takes pictures of your uterus. The scanner shows your doctor exactly where the fibroid is. Your doctor then points ultrasound (sound waves) at the fibroid. The ultrasound waves heat up and destroy the fibroid. This is the least invasive procedure for treating fibroids but not every patient is a candidate for it. Your doctor can help you determine if it would work for you.\nA minimally invasive procedure means that your doctor makes only a very small incision (cut) in your skin to destroy or remove the fibroid. Minimally invasive procedures include the following:\nIf you have a number of fibroids or fibroids that are very large, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy. During a hysterectomy, your doctor removes the entire uterus from your body. A hysterectomy can be done through an abdominal incision (cut) or through a vaginal incision.\nIt is very possible to live your life without even knowing you have uterine fibroids. If you have symptoms, you and your doctor can discuss a treatment plan to manage symptoms or remove the fibroids.\nIf you are planning to become pregnant, talk to your doctor. Uterine fibroids can cause problems during pregnancy and delivery for some women. Other women experience no problems with it.\nUterine Health Guide\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development: Uterine Fibroids\nWomenshealth.gov: Uterine Fibroids\nTheUterine Health Guidewas developed by Sumitomo Pharma Switzerland GmbH and Pfizer.\nLast Updated:March 15, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nGlands inside your vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. Vaginal discharge is completely normal. This is your body\u2019s way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean.\nVaginal discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn\u2019t smell bad. The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when you breastfeed, or when you\u2019re sexually excited.\nChanges that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness, or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that\u2019s stained with blood when you\u2019re not having your period could also be a sign of a problem. If you have any of these signs, you should talk to your doctor.\nYou should also be on the lookout for symptoms of yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. These are 3 different infections that can cause changes in your vaginal discharge\nVaginal discharge is a completely normal part of how your body maintains a healthy vagina. But changes can occur if the normal balance of healthy bacteria (germs) in your vagina is upset. Many things can disturb the balance of a healthy vagina, including:\nThe chemicals in douches may irritate your vagina and change the normal balance of germs in your vagina. Douching can also spread an infection into the uterus, increasing your risk of getting pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the fallopian tubes that can cause you to be unable to have children.\nDouching isn\u2019t necessary to keep your body clean. Smells you may notice usually come from outside the vagina (vulva). Keeping this area clean with gentle soap and water can prevent smells.\nIf your vaginal discharge increases, changes color or odor, or is suddenly itchy or irritated, see your doctor. You may have a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis. Your doctor will need to examine you to make a diagnosis. The exam will include questions about your symptoms. Your doctor will also perform a pelvic exam to look for swelling and discharge. Your doctor will probably also collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab.\nSmall amounts of yeast fungus are often found in a healthy vagina. But if too much grows, it can cause a yeast infection. Yeast infections usually aren\u2019t caught from a sex partner. You may be more likely to get a yeast infection if you are using antibiotics, are pregnant, have diabetes, or stay hot and sweaty for long periods. Some women get frequent yeast infections for no obvious reason.\nBacterial vaginosis is usually caused by Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria. Why some women get this infection isn\u2019t clear. It\u2019s probably not caught from a sex partner.\nTrichomoniasis is caused by an organism called Trichomonas vaginalis. You can be infected but have no signs for a long time. Trichomoniasis is usually caught by having sex without a condom with someone who is infected.\nTwo sexually transmitted infections, chlamydia and gonorrhea, can also cause vaginal discharge. These are infections of the cervix caused by bacteria. Sometimes the only symptom may be an increase of vaginal discharge. Both of these infections can be treated with antibiotic shots or pills.\nThere is no need to prevent normal vaginal discharge. However, abnormal vaginal discharge may be prevented by following these tips.\nThere are different treatment methods, depending on what is causing the abnormal vaginal discharge.\nYeast infections are usually treated with a medicine you put into your vagina. Yeast infections can also be treated with oral medicine.\nIf you have yeast infections often, your doctor may suggest you use a medicine you can buy without a prescription. But if you have any questions about what\u2019s causing your vaginitis, you should call your doctor. Many other things besides a yeast infection can cause vaginitis.\nBacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotic medicine, usually a pill.\nIt\u2019s usually treated with oral antibiotics.\nSometimes. Talk to your doctor if you\u2019re sexually active. You may also need to avoid having sex or use condoms until you\u2019ve been treated.\nAbnormal vaginal discharge is completely treatable.

These clots form in veins deep inside your legs or arms. They can also form in varicose veins. These can be treated by your doctor with warm compresses or medicines.\nVeins return blood back to the heart so that it can be recirculated to the rest of your body. There are valves in your veins that allow the blood to flow toward the heart. In some people, the valves may stop working correctly (often because the valves have stretched over the years). This can allow blood to flow back down into the veins. Blood then pools in the veins, causing them to swell even more. The veins in your legs are vulnerable because they work against gravity to get the blood back to your heart. This is why most varicose veins are found in the legs.\nYour doctor often will be able to diagnose varicose veins simply by examining your legs.

Risk factors include:\nThere are several things you can do at home to improve the symptoms of varicose veins:\nYour doctor may recommend that you wear compression stockings. These are stockings that provide gentle, consistent pressure. This will help keep blood from pooling in your legs and reduce swelling from venous stasis when you are sitting or standing. Compression stockings can be found at pharmacies and medical supply stores.\nIf your symptoms don\u2019t get any better with at-home care, or if you don\u2019t like the way varicose veins look, there are more invasive treatment options available.

You might also have trouble recognizing people. You may notice that you squint a lot in order to see things clearly.\nVision changes, such as trouble focusing on close objects, are a normal part of aging. The main causes of vision loss in people older than 40 years of age are:\nOther common causes of vision loss include injury, infections, and vision changes associated with certain illnesses.\nYou may not realize that your vision is getting worse. This is especially true if it is happening gradually. It may be that someone close to you is the first to notice that you\u2019re not seeing well.\nVisit your doctor if vision problems keep you from doing your normal activities. They can recommend the right treatment for you, depending on what is causing your vision loss.\nVision loss may be prevented, depending on what is causing it. For example, you may prevent diabetic\u00a0retinopathy\u00a0by preventing type 2 diabetes. You may be able to prevent cataracts by wearing polarized sunglasses when you\u2019re outside. However, you generally can\u2019t prevent age-related vision loss.\nYour doctor can help you find specialists to treat your vision problems. For many patients, a team approach is the best way to treat vision loss. Some of the specialists your doctor may recommend include:\nThere are many corrective tools that can help you see when you\u2019re progressively losing your vision. Sometimes, there are even surgical options that can remove the need for eyeglasses or contact lenses.\nSometimes vision loss can\u2019t be corrected. Some forms of vision loss can leave you blind. This can have a dramatic impact on your life. There are many resources that can help you adjust to vision loss, including theAmerican Foundation for the Blind. You may also want to speak with a therapist to process the emotions of your vision loss. Many people with vision loss lead productive lives with meaningful relationships.\nNational Institutes of Health, MedlinePlus: Blindness and Vision Loss\nLast Updated:March 5, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is vitiligo?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nVitiligo is a skin-coloring disorder. It produces white patches on your skin. It mostly occurs in areas that are exposed to the sun. This includes your face, neck, arms, hands, legs, and feet. It can affect your mouth, nose, and eyes. It also can affect unexposed parts, like your genitals. People of any age and race can get vitiligo.\nThe main sign of vitiligo are white patches of skin. It\u2019s more common to have patches that are symmetric on both sides of your body. Or you may have white patches on only one side of your body. Vitiligo may or may not spread over time.\nOther symptoms of vitiligo can include:\nVitiligo occurs when skin cells that produce pigment (color) die. It causes white patches on areas of your skin. No one knows exactly why these skin cells die. Most scientists believe it is caused by an autoimmune disorder. This means the body\u2019s immune system attacks and causes the death of the skin pigment cells. People who have other autoimmune disorders, such as certain types ofhyperthyroidism, may have an increased risk of vitiligo. There is some evidence that genetics plays a role in this process. Some people may inherit an increased risk of developing vitiligo from their parents.\nSee your doctor if you think you have vitiligo. He or she will do a physical exam and review your symptoms. He or she will ask about your health and family history. Your doctor may do a biopsy on your skin. This consists of sending a sample of skin cells to a lab to look at the cells. It can confirm the disease if your cells lack melanocytes, which produce pigment. Your doctor also may do a blood test. This can check for the presence of an autoimmune disorder.\nIt\u2019s hard to avoid or remove vitiligo, since the cause is unknown. However, you should take care of your skin to protect it from the sun. This includes using a sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or more. You should also cover your skin and limit sun exposure.\nThere are treatment options for vitiligo. They depend on how severe your condition is. This includes the size, location, and number of white patches. The goal of treatment is largely cosmetic. Most people do it to improve their appearance and feel better about themselves\nForms of treatment are time consuming. They\u2019re not guaranteed to work or last, though they can be permanent. They also don\u2019t prevent new patches from appearing.\nTreatment options come in the following forms:\nIn addition to medical options, you can use cosmetics to cover your skin. This includes makeup, creams, dyes, or self-tanning lotions. Talk with your doctor about which treatment is best for you.\nVitiligo is not physically harmful, but it can have emotional and mental effects. Talk to your doctor about joining a support group or getting counseling. This can help you cope and manage possible depression.\nBe careful about exposing your skin in the sun. Your white patches are extra sensitive because the skin cells are dead. Other parts of your body may become sensitive to the sun with treatment. Sun exposure can increase the contrast between your skin colors. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 that protects against UVA and UVB. Wear sunscreen every time you\u2019re in the sun to try to reduce your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.\nStay away from tanning beds. They won\u2019t help return color to your white patches.\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Vitiligo\nLast Updated:July 9, 2020\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff, Alex Rice and Shanda Cook\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nVomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (watery bowel movements) are common symptoms of gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is the inflammation and irritation of the stomach and intestines. Vomiting and diarrhea at the same time can be harmful, because they can causedehydration. Dehydration occurs when you lose too much fluid. Young children and the elderly can become dehydrated quickly, but dehydration can occur at any age.\nVomiting and diarrhea are usually considered symptoms themselves. You will know you are vomiting when you begin throwing up. You will know you have diarrhea when you begin having watery bowel movements.\nThe main result or sign of both vomiting and diarrhea is dehydration. It can be hard to tell if a person is dehydrated. Usually, by the time a person has signs of dehydration, they have been dehydrated for a while. If you notice any of the following signs of dehydration, especially in babies, children, and the elderly, talk to your doctor. If dehydration is severe, your loved one may need to be given fluids intravenously (by vein through an IV tube) to replace fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea.\nSigns of dehydration include:\nVomiting and diarrhea can be caused by a number of things. These include viruses, bacteria, parasites, certain medicines, or certain medical conditions. Foods that are hard to digest (such as too many sweets) and undercooked (raw or partially raw) meat or fish can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.\nVomiting and diarrhea can be diagnosed at home. Neither condition requires a trip to the doctor. However, call your doctor if the vomiting and diarrhea don\u2019t seem to be getting better, or if the person who is vomiting and/or has diarrhea:\nAvoiding foods that might be undercooked or raw can prevent vomiting and diarrhea. Since it can be caused by many things, though, it may not always be possible to avoid.\nAnyone who has had several bouts of vomiting or diarrhea will need to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.\nAn oral rehydration solution, or ORS, is a great way to replace fluids and nutrients lost through vomiting and diarrhea. An ORS is safe for babies, children, and adults. An ORS can come in several forms, including a powder that you mix with water, a liquid that is already mixed, and as frozen popsicles. You can purchase these at most grocery stores and drugstores.\nTo use an ORS for vomiting, try giving small amounts of ORS often, such as 1 teaspoonful every minute. If the person is able to keep the drink down, slowly increase how much you give. If the person vomits after you give the ORS, wait 30 to 60 minutes after the last time he or she vomited, and then give him or her a few sips of an ORS. Small amounts every few minutes may stay down better than a large amount all at once. When the person stops vomiting, you may increase how much of the ORS you give each time and add clear broths or clear sodas. Remember, small amounts are less likely to cause an upset stomach. If a person only has diarrhea and isn\u2019t vomiting, he or she may have an ORS and other liquids as needed. Your doctor may ask you to keep track of how much the child or senior drinks. You can use a dropper, a spoon, or a measuring cup to help you keep track.\nVomiting and diarrhea usually don\u2019t last long. If it\u2019s caused by an infection, vomiting and diarrhea are a way for the body to get rid of the infection. Giving medicines that stop vomiting and diarrhea may actually interfere with the body\u2019s efforts to heal. Antibiotics are usually not necessary either.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated January 2024 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nThe vulva is the skin and fatty tissue between the upper thighs of women. It extends from the area of the anus to about an inch below the pubic hairline. Cancer of the vulva most often affects the two skin folds (or lips) around the vagina, known as the labia.\nVulvar cancer is not very common. However, it is very serious because it is cancer. It can affect a woman\u2019s sexual functioning. It can make sex painful and difficult. If found early, vulvar cancer has a high cure rate and the treatment options involve less surgery.\nTell your doctor if you have any of these warning signs of vulvar cancer:\nVulvar cancer most often affects women 65 to 75 years of age. However, it can also occur in women 40 years of age or younger. Vulvar cancer may be related to genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease caused by thehuman papillomavirus (HPV).\nIf your doctor finds an abnormal area on the vulva, they may want to take a small piece of tissue to look at under a microscope. This procedure can be done in the doctor\u2019s office. It is called a biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to find out if you have vulvar cancer.\nCurrently, there is no known way to prevent vulvar cancer. However, you may reduce your risk by not smoking or vaping.\nHPV infections may increase your risk for developing vulvar cancer but can be prevented by taking the HPV vaccine.\nVulvar cancer is usually treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or acombination of treatments. The type of surgery depends on the size, depth and spread of the cancer. Your doctor will review all the options for surgery and the pros and cons of each option. Even with surgery, some people may also need radiation therapy.\nWhen vulvar cancer is found and treated early, the cure rate is more than 90%. The key to a cure is to tell your doctor about any warning signs early and to have a biopsy right away. After treatment, be sure to go to all follow-up appointments that your doctor recommends.\nIf surgery is part of your treatment, your body may look different afterward. Talk to your doctor about this so that you are prepared. These changes may make you feel different or less attractive. It may take time to get used to the changes. Remember, your friends and family love you. Let them support you during this time. Do not push them away.\nEven with treatment, vulvar cancer may not completely go away. Or, if it does, you may live in fear of it coming back. That can cause much stress for you and your loved ones. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist about your feelings. Invite your family to do the same.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Vaginal and Vulvar Cancers\nLast Updated:January 26, 2024\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated October 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nVulvodynia is the word that describes pain and discomfort in the vulva. The vulva is a woman\u2019s external genital area, or the area around the opening to the vagina.\nThe pain associated with vulvodynia is usually described as a burning, stinging, itching, irritating, or raw feeling. Sexual intercourse, walking, sitting, or exercising can make the pain worse.\nVulvodynia usually starts suddenly and may last for months to years. Although it isn\u2019t life threatening, the pain may make you cut back on some of your normal activities. It can also make you upset or depressed. It might even cause problems in your relationship with your spouse or partner. This is because it can make sexual intercourse painful.\nThe exact cause of vulvodynia isn\u2019t known. Some factors may include:\nSexually transmitted diseases do NOT cause vulvodynia.\nYour doctor may need to do a pelvic exam and tests to check for bacteria and yeast. If any test results don\u2019t seem normal, your doctor may want you to have a colposcopy or a biopsy. Colposcopy is an exam of the genital area that uses a special magnifying glass. If you have a biopsy, your doctor first numbs your genital area with a painkiller, then takes a small piece of tissue that will be examined under a microscope.\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure what causes vulvodynia, so there is no sure way to prevent or avoid it. If your vulvodynia is caused by uncontrolled diabetes or sensory diabetic neuropathy, follow your doctor\u2019s recommendations for managing your diabetes, including taking your prescribed medicine and adhering to improved diet and exercise.\nSome types of vulvar pain get better with creams or pills made to treat yeast infections. Sometimes the pain goes away if you use creams that contain estrogen or cortisone. But cortisone cream isn\u2019t good to use for long periods of time. Some antidepressant medicines can help nerve pain and irritation. Other treatments that may help include interferon injections, laser therapy, or surgery.\nMuscle spasms in your pelvic area can also make vulvar pain worse. Physical therapy or biofeedback treatments (treatments that help you strengthen and relax your pelvic muscles) may help ease the spasms. If you decide to try one of these treatments, look for a therapist trained in women\u2019s health. With practice, you can learn to relax your pelvic muscles with exercises you do at home.\nIf you have diabetes, follow your doctor\u2019s treatment plan to manage your diabetes and gain control of your insulin levels.\nSome of the following steps may help ease your vulvodynia symptoms. If they help, keep doing them.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nTable of Contents\nWarts are small growths on the skin that normally don\u2019t cause pain. Some warts itch and may hurt, especially if they\u2019re on your feet. There are five kinds of warts:\nThe primary symptom of warts is a rough-surfaced fleshy growth on your skin.\nWarts are a type of infection caused by viruses in thehuman papillomavirus(HPV) family. There are more than 100 types of HPV. Warts can grow on all parts of your body. They can grow on your skin, on the inside of your mouth, on your genitals, and on your rectal area. Common types of HPV tend to cause warts on the skin (such as the hands and fingers). Other HPV types tend to cause warts on the genitals and rectal area. Some people are more naturally resistant to the HPV viruses and don\u2019t seem to get warts as easily as other people.\nMost of the time, your doctor will be able to identify a wart just by looking at it. In some cases, they may also scrape the wart to look for tiny dots. These are the tell-tale signs of clotted\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels and are common in some warts.\nIn some cases, your doctor may be uncertain if your skin growth is a wart. If so, they may remove part of the wart to send to a laboratory for identification.\nSome warts can be prevented, others cannot. Warts may be naturally occurring, depending on what\u2019s causing them. But warts also may be passed from person to person by touch. It is also possible to get warts from using towels or other objects that were used by a person who has warts.\nWarts on the genitals\u00a0are very\u00a0contagious\u00a0and can be passed to another person during oral, vaginal, or anal sex. It is important not to have unprotected sex if you or your partner have warts on the genital area. Warts also can grow on the\u00a0cervix\u00a0(inside the\u00a0vagina) without a person knowing it. They may then pass the infection to their sexual partner.\nWarts often disappear on their own, although it may take months or years to do so. But some warts won\u2019t go away on their own and need to be treated. Treatment may decrease the chance that the warts will be spread to other areas of your body or to other people.\nThere are many ways to remove common warts from the skin (such as on the fingers, feet, and knees). Talk to your doctor about which treatment is right for you. Also talk with your doctor before treating warts on your face.\nGenital warts\u00a0must be treated by your doctor. Warts in the genital area can be removed, but there\u2019s no cure for the viral infection that causes the warts. This means that the warts may come back even after they have been removed.\nNote that warts on the skin and warts on the genitals are removed in different ways. Don\u2019t try any home remedies or over-the-counter drugs to remove warts on the genital area. You could hurt your genital area by putting certain chemicals on it.\nMost of the time, wart removal treatment on the skin is successful and the warts are gone for good.

It\u2019s usually spread by infected mosquitos. It first appeared in the United States in 1999. Most people infected with the virus have mild symptoms or no symptoms. Rarely, the virus can enter the brain and cause life-threatening complications.\nYou may have a higher risk for infection by the virus if you live in an area where it has been found in humans, birds, horses, or mosquitoes. However, even in areas where the virus has been reported, it\u2019s very unlikely that a person will get sick from a mosquito bite.\nMost people infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms. However, about 1 in 5 people may have mild, flu-like symptoms, which include:\nSymptoms usually occur 3 to 14 days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms can last from a few days up to several weeks. They usually go away on their own. Contact your doctor if you have any of these symptoms and have recently been bitten by a mosquito.\nAbout 1 in 150 people who are infected with West Nile virus develop a more severe illness. This happens when the virus enters the brain. There it can cause encephalitis. This is inflammation of the brain. It can also cause meningitis. This is inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord. Symptoms of these illnesses include:\nThese illnesses can be life-threatening. If you have any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\nWest Nile virus is most often spread by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by biting birds that carry the virus. People can get the virus when an infected mosquito bites them. This happens most often in the warm-weather months of spring, summer, and early fall. You can\u2019t get the virus from another person or from your pet.\nIn a small number of cases, people have gotten the virus through\u00a0blood\u00a0transfusions and organ transplants. However, the risk of getting the virus in these ways is very low.\nA few cases have also been reported of the virus being passed from a pregnant or breastfeeding woman to her baby. These cases are extremely rare.\nYour doctor will do a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. They will want to know if you\u2019ve been bitten by a mosquito recently. They may order blood tests to confirm if you have West Nile virus. Sometimes your doctor may order a spinal tap to check for the virus. This involves collecting a sample of the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord and brain.

Almost all of those people fully recover. Of the small number of people who do get severely ill from the virus, about 10% will die.\nThere is no vaccine to prevent West Nile virus in humans. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid getting bitten by a mosquito.\nThe following are a few things you can do:\nThere is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection. People who experience mild symptoms usually get better after a few days. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers to help reduce fever and to help with any pain you may be having.\nPeople who have severe illness may be hospitalized and given\u00a0intravenous\u00a0(IV) fluids. They may need to be on a machine called a ventilator to help them breathe. Their doctor also will try to keep them from getting other infections, such as pneumonia.\nWest Nile virus usually only causes mild symptoms, if any. Most people recover in a few days. Some symptoms may last a few weeks, such as weakness or fatigue. But they will go away on their own.\nMost people who develop severe illness from the virus recover. But your recovery could take weeks or months. It\u2019s possible that some of the effects the virus has on your central nervous system might never go away.

Early symptoms last 1 to 2 weeks and include:\nYour cough can get worse over time. Late-stage symptoms include:\nSymptoms vary in babies and children, teenagers, and adults. For instance, babies cough less and are more likely to have apnea and turn blue. If you received the vaccine, symptoms will be milder and won\u2019t last as long.\nWhooping cough is caused by certain germs, or bacteria. You can get it if you breathe in these bacteria. It spreads between people when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You also can get it by touching an infected person or surface.\nYou should see your doctor if you or someone around you might have whooping cough. Your doctor will review your symptoms and listen to your cough. There are several tests to confirm whooping cough. Your doctor can swab inside your nose and/or throat. A lab will check the swab for whooping cough bacteria. Your doctor also may want to get a blood sample or take a chest X-ray.\nVaccination is the best way to prevent whooping cough. The pertussis vaccine (DTaP, Tdap) is part of the recommended vaccine schedule for children and adults. Adults should get a pertussis booster every 5-10 years. Pregnant women and those in close contact with babies should be vaccinated. Talk to your doctor to make sure you and your family\u2019s vaccinations are up to date.\nYour doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics. These will relieve your symptoms and kill the bacteria so you aren\u2019t contagious. Infants and babies may need to stay in the hospital. If you have whooping cough, you should avoid contact with others, especially babies.\nWhooping cough can last anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks. You may continue to cough on and off, even with medicine. Over-the-counter medicines for coughing do not help with whooping cough. You should rest and drink fluids to prevent dehydration. You can try using a cool-mist humidifier or taking a warm bath or shower. These can help clear your lungs and make it easier to breathe. Avoid smoking and areas where the air is not clean.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated June 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byDeepak S. Patel, MD, FAAFP, FACSM\nTable of Contents\nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition. People who have WPW syndrome are born with an extra electrical pathway in their heart. It changes the rhythm of their heartbeat. That\u2019s called an arrhythmia. They may experience a very fast heartbeat (called tachycardia) for periods of time. Symptoms can start without warning. However, certain things may trigger them, including caffeine, alcohol, and stimulants. The condition is rare and affects all ages, including infants.\nSome people who have WPW syndrome never experience any symptoms. They don\u2019t know they have the condition. Most people don\u2019t notice symptoms until they are in their teens or early twenties. That\u2019s when the symptoms commonly appear for the first time. If you have WPW syndrome, you may experience:\nInfants may experience a change of color on their skin (pale gray), irritability, rapid breathing, and loss of appetite.\nAn episode of rapid heartbeat can last a few seconds to a few hours.\nThe exact cause of WPW is unknown. However, in a small percentage of people, it is tied to an abnormal gene.\nSee your doctor if you are experiencing an unusual heartbeat. Your doctor will listen to your heart by placing a stethoscope over your chest. Additional tests to check for the disorder include an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). During this test, a medical technician or assistant will attach sticky pads to your chest (electrodes). These are connected to a machine that records your heart\u2019s electrical activity.\nFurther testing may include walking on a treadmill in your doctor\u2019s office. You will be connected to an EKG machine that monitors your heart\u2019s electrical activity while you walk. Your doctor also may want to monitor your heart while you do your daily activities. For that, your doctor may give you a heart monitor to take home and wear during a normal day of activity. The monitor is attached to an elastic band that fits around your chest.\u00a0 It continuously records your heart\u2019s rhythms for 24 hours. If your doctor wants to monitor your heart for more than 24 hours, your doctor might recommend an event-recorder. That is a machine that records samples of your heart\u2019s rhythms. It can be worn for a couple of days or longer and allows you to notate or alert the system when you are having symptoms.\nAnother test, called electrophysiologic studies, may also give your doctor information about your heart. This test is more complex. You will be asleep during the test. You will be given an IV (intravenous line) in the vein in your arm with medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy. Once you are asleep, your doctor will insert a small tube into your artery or vein. They will send small electric pulses through the tube to make your heartbeat at different speeds. The test will map how your heart reacts to locate specific problems. The test could last up to 4 hours.\nSince you are born with the disorder, there is nothing you can do to prevent or avoid it. However, if you know that certain triggers, such as caffeine, stimulants, or alcohol, change your heart rate, you should avoid those things.\nThere are several treatment options available for WPW syndrome. You doctor may talk to you about vagal maneuvers. These are things you can do on your own to help slow your heart rate. These things include coughing or pushing down like you are having a bowel movement. If vagal maneuvers don\u2019t help slow your heart rate, your doctor may prescribe an anti-arrhythmic medicine.\nSometimes, people must have their heart electrically shocked to bring the heartbeat back to normal. Your doctor will hold paddles against your chest for this procedure. For some people, surgery may also be an option.\nIt is possible for WPW symptoms to disappear over time. For those who continue to experience symptoms, living with WPW can be frustrating. Unless you know your trigger, you can\u2019t anticipate when your heartbeat will become rapid. And you don\u2019t know how long it will stay that way. Having to have your heart shocked back to a normal beat can be stressful.\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)\nLast Updated:June 2, 2023\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_title": "What is a vaginal yeast infection?",
    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated September 2023 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byLeisa Bailey, MD\nTable of Contents\nVaginal yeast infections are caused by a\u00a0fungus\u00a0called\u00a0Candida. Yeast are tiny organisms that normally live in small numbers on the skin and inside the vagina. The acidic environment of the\u00a0vagina\u00a0helps keep yeast from growing. However, if the vagina becomes less acidic, too many yeast can grow and cause a vaginal infection.\nYeast infections are common; every 3 out of 4 of women will have one in their lifetime. Half of all women have more than one\u00a0infection\u00a0in their lifetime.\nYeast infections can be very uncomfortable but usually aren\u2019t serious. Symptoms include:\nThe acidic balance of the vagina can be changed by a number of factors, including:\nMoisture and irritation of the vagina also seem to encourage yeast to grow.\nIf you have symptoms of a yeast infection, your doctor will want to talk to you about your symptoms. He or she will also perform a pelvic exam to look at your vulva and vagina. Your doctor may also take a sample of your vaginal discharge. This sample will be sent to a lab to help determine if you have a yeast infection.\nHere are some things you can do to help prevent a yeast infection:\nYeast infections are usually treated with medicine you put in your vagina. This medicine may be a cream you insert with a special applicator. Or the medicine may be a suppository you put into your vagina and allow it to dissolve on its own. Medicine in a pill form to take by mouth is also available. Some medicine is available as a cream you can put on your vulva to help relieve itching.\nIf you\u2019ve had a yeast infection before and are having classic symptoms, you may want to treat the infection using over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. There are many brands available that offer creams (two brand names: Monistat and Vagisil) and suppositories (one brand name: NutraBlast).\nAlthough it\u2019s rare, you can transmit a yeast infection to your partner through sexual intercourse. Talk to your doctor about treatment options if your partner begins to develop symptoms of a yeast infection.\nBe sure to see your doctor the first time you have symptoms of a yeast infection. It\u2019s very important to make sure you have a yeast infection and not another more serious infection. The symptoms of a yeast infection are also the symptoms of other infections, such as some sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Treating yourself for a yeast infection when you actually have another type of infection may make the problem much worse.\nSome women (about 5%) have recurrent yeast infections. This means they get more than 4 vaginal yeast infections in a year. This condition is called recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). If you have multiple yeast infections each year, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to prescribe a treatment that can help prevent the infection from coming back so often.\nIf you have been diagnosed with many yeast infections over the years, talk to your doctor about medicine you can buy without a\u00a0prescription\u00a0to relieve your symptoms and treat the infection.\nNational Institutes of Health, Office on Women\u2019s Health: Vaginal Yeast Infections\nLast Updated:March 5, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.

    "article_text": "Advertisement\nLast Updated August 2021 | This article was created by familydoctor.org editorial staff and reviewed byPeter Rippey, MD, CAQSM\nTable of Contents\nZika is a virus caused by a bite from the Aedes mosquito. If you have the Zika virus, you can pass it onto humans. This happens through pregnancy, sex (oral, vaginal, and anal), and organ and tissue donation. Pregnant women and women trying to get pregnant are not more likely to get Zika. However, they are at risk of passing it onto their unborn baby. The virus is linked to an increase of babies born with smaller-than-average heads (microcephaly). This condition causes severe brain defects.\nZika outbreaks have occurred in United States, Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, parts of the Caribbean, and Central and South America. In 2015, these outbreaks reached epidemic proportions. However, there have been no recent outbreaks of Zika.\nMild symptoms include:\nFew people experience symptoms. In fact, most people don\u2019t know they have the virus. Symptoms usually last 2 to 7 days. It can last longer.\nA baby infected with the virus in utero (in the womb) will have the following symptoms:\nVirus complications include:\nNerve disorders in adults and children. This includes Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.\nA bite from the Aedes mosquito causes the Zika virus. This species also spreads dengue fever and the chikungunya virus. This type of mosquito bites during the day and is attracted to stagnant bodies of water (these are bodies of water that have no current or flow). People infected with the virus can spread it even if they have no symptoms.\nYour doctor will do a physical exam. He or she will ask you if you have traveled to regions where the virus is present. There are two types of tests your doctor can perform to confirm a diagnosis, including:\nTest results usually come back in 3 to 5 days.\nIf you are pregnant and test positive for Zika, your doctor will add you to the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry. This list is confidential and free. Doctors and researchers study the data and the effects of Zika. You might require additional tests to check your baby\u2019s health. Your doctor can test your baby for microcephaly during pregnancy or post-birth.\nThere is no vaccine to prevent Zika. Find out and avoid regions where Zika exists. Zika travel alerts are available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. You are at greater risk if you live in a Zika area. You are at increased risk if your sexual partner travels there. If your partner has been exposed to regions with Zika, practice safe sex and use condoms.\nAvoid mosquito bites. Wear approved insect spray and long clothes. Stay in places with air condition. Stay in places with screened-in doors and windows. Avoid walking near stagnant bodies of water. Sleep with a mosquito net. Approved insect repellent is safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nThere is no medicine to treat the Zika virus. Talk to your doctor before taking any medicine for symptoms. Also, there is no cure for babies born with microcephaly. A baby with microcephaly will need learning interventions from birth on.\nIf you have Zika, it will run its course in 2 to 7 days. You may need to treat symptoms with over-the-counter pain medicine. If you have Zika, use condoms to avoid spreading the virus (vaginal or anal). Remember that oral sex can also spread the virus.\nIf you are trying to get pregnant and recently visited a region with Zika, talk to your doctor. He or she may suggest that you wait a period of time. If you are pregnant and might have Zika, contact your doctor immediately. Doctors and scientists hope to create a vaccine and cure for the Zika virus.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Zika Virus\nU.S. National Library of Medicine, Zika Virus\nLast Updated:August 11, 2021\nThis article was contributed by:familydoctor.org editorial staff and Alex Rice\nCopyright \u00a9 American Academy of Family Physicians\nThis information provides a general overview and may not apply to everyone.
