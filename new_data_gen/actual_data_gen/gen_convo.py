        CURRENT VIGNETTE SUMMARY:
        {current_vignette}
        
        YOU MUST RESPOND IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
        
        THINKING:
        Use the following Chain of Thought process:
        
        STEP 1 - INITIAL OBSERVATION:
        Let me first observe what the patient is literally saying versus how they're saying it.
        - Direct statements made: <list explicit statements>
        - Communication style observed: <tone, word choice, length of responses>
        - Non-verbal cues in language: <hesitation, minimization, amplification>
        
        STEP 2 - PATTERN RECOGNITION:
        Now I'll identify specific communication patterns that suggest bias.
        - If the patient uses minimizing language ("just a little", "not that bad"), this suggests they may be downplaying severity
        - If the patient gives vague responses when asked direct questions, this suggests potential withholding
        - If the patient uses catastrophic language ("terrible", "worst pain ever"), this suggests potential amplification
        - If timeline responses are inconsistent or vague, this suggests memory issues or confusion
        
        STEP 3 - BIAS IDENTIFICATION:
        Based on the patterns, let me identify the specific biases affecting their reporting.
        - Type of bias detected: <minimization/amplification/withholding/confusion>
        - Evidence for this bias: <specific examples from conversation>
        - Severity of bias: <how much it's affecting their reporting>
        
        STEP 4 - HIDDEN INFORMATION ANALYSIS:
        Now I'll deduce what information might be missing or distorted.
        - What symptoms might be worse than reported? <reasoning>
        - What information might they be embarrassed to share? <reasoning>
        - What timeline distortions might exist? <reasoning>
        - What associated symptoms might they be omitting? <reasoning>
        
        STEP 5 - OBJECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION:
        Let me reconstruct what the objective clinical picture likely looks like.
        - Taking minimization into account: <adjusted symptom severity>
        - Accounting for withheld information: <likely missing symptoms>
        - Correcting timeline distortions: <more accurate progression>
        - Considering amplified concerns: <appropriately scaled worries>
        
        STEP 6 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
        Finally, let me determine the clinical implications of these communication patterns.
        - How reliable is the current vignette? <assessment>
        - What critical information are we missing? <gaps>
        - What should the doctor probe for next? <recommendations>
        
        ANSWER:
        COMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:
        - Pattern observed: <description of how patient is communicating>
        - Bias detected: <what kind of bias is affecting their reporting>
        - Confidence level: <high/medium/low>
        - Reasoning: <why I believe this based on my step-by-step analysis>
        
        LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION:
        - Minimized symptoms: <symptoms patient is downplaying + reasoning>
        - Withheld information: <information patient may be embarrassed to share + reasoning>
        - Amplified concerns: <symptoms patient may be exaggerating + reasoning>
        - Temporal distortions: <timeline issues or sequence problems + reasoning>
        
        OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE:
        Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include:
        <Detailed reconstruction accounting for identified biases with reasoning for each adjustment>
        
        RECOMMENDED_PROBING:

    THINKING:
    Use Chain of Thought Analysis:
    
    STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:
    Let me examine the specific words and phrases the patient uses.
    - Minimizing language: <identify phrases like "just", "only", "a little", "not that bad">
    - Amplifying language: <identify phrases like "terrible", "worst", "unbearable", "excruciating">
    - Vague language: <identify non-specific descriptions, "sort of", "kind of", "maybe">
    - Emotional language: <identify fear, embarrassment, frustration indicators>
    
    STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS:

    - Response length: <long/short responses and what triggers each>
    - Directness: <do they answer directly or deflect?>
    - Information volunteering: <do they offer additional details or wait to be asked?>
    - Consistency: <are their responses consistent across similar questions?>
    
    STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION:
    Based on the language and response patterns, let me identify specific behavioral indicators.
    - Information withholding signs: <evidence of reluctance to share specific types of information>
    - Minimization behaviors: <evidence they're downplaying symptoms>
    - Amplification patterns: <evidence they're exaggerating concerns>
    - Embarrassment/shame signals: <evidence of discomfort with certain topics>
    - Confusion/memory issues: <evidence of timeline or factual inconsistencies>
    - Family influence: <evidence others are affecting their responses>
    
    STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
    Now let me evaluate how severely these biases are affecting their communication.
    - Primary bias type: <main communication bias identified>
    - Severity level: <mild/moderate/severe with reasoning>
    - Areas most affected: <which symptoms/topics are most biased>
    - Reliability assessment: <how much to trust their self-reporting>
    
    STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:

    - Information likely missing: <what they're probably not telling you + reasoning>
    - Symptoms probably minimized: <what's worse than they say + evidence>
    - Concerns probably amplified: <what they're over-worried about + evidence>

- Patient-specific considerations: <factors affecting treatment choice>
- Contraindications or cautions: <what to avoid or monitor>

STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:
If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety.
- Primary medication choice: <specific drug, dose, frequency>
- Rationale for selection: <why this medication over alternatives>
- Expected timeline for improvement: <when to expect benefits>
- Key side effects to monitor: <specific monitoring requirements>
- Alternative medications if first-line fails: <backup options>

STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:
I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes.
- Primary non-drug interventions: <specific recommendations>
- Patient education priorities: <key information patient needs>
- Lifestyle modifications: <diet, exercise, sleep, stress management>
- Behavioral interventions: <specific techniques or referrals>

STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:
I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care.
- Follow-up timeline: <when to see patient again and why>
- Monitoring parameters: <what to track - symptoms, labs, etc.>
- Red flag symptoms: <when patient should seek immediate care>
- Treatment response assessment: <how to measure improvement>

STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:
Given the patient's behavioral type ({behavior_type}), how should I communicate this plan?
- Communication approach: <how to present plan given patient's style>
- Addressing patient concerns: <likely worries to address proactively>
- Adherence strategies: <how to improve treatment compliance>
- Family involvement: <whether/how to include family members>

STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:
What additional care coordination is needed?
- Specialist referrals needed: <if any, with timeline and rationale>
- Other healthcare team members: <nurses, therapists, etc.>
- Community resources: <support groups, educational materials>
- Insurance/cost considerations: <practical implementation factors>

ANSWER: 
Based on the diagnosis of [primary diagnosis], I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes [summarize key interventions] with careful attention to [patient-specific factors]. Initial management focuses on [immediate priorities] while establishing [long-term management strategy]. Follow-up care will include [monitoring plan] with clear instructions for the patient regarding [key patient education points]. This approach is designed to [expected outcomes] while minimizing [potential risks/side effects] and ensuring sustainable long-term management of this condition.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
- Immediate actions (today): <specific next steps>
- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): <what to accomplish soon>
- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): <sustained management goals>
- Patient handout summary: <key points for patient to remember>

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are a REAL patient, not trying to help the doctor diagnose you
- You do NOT know medical terminology or what symptoms are "important"
- You have NOT researched your condition online or spoken to other doctors
- Respond based on how you FEEL, not what you think the doctor wants to hear
- Be authentic to your behavioral type: {behavior_type}

YOU MUST RESPOND IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

THINKING:
Use this step-by-step process to develop your authentic patient response:

STEP 1 - EMOTIONAL STATE ANALYSIS:
How am I feeling right now about this doctor visit?
- Physical sensations I'm experiencing: <describe current physical feelings>
- Emotional state (scared, frustrated, embarrassed, hopeful, etc.): <current emotions>
- Thoughts going through my head: <what a real patient would be thinking>
- Energy level and mood: <tired, anxious, relieved, confused, etc.>

STEP 2 - QUESTION INTERPRETATION:
How do I, as a non-medical person, understand what the doctor just asked?
- What I think the doctor is asking: <patient's interpretation of medical question>
- Why they might be asking this: <patient's guess about doctor's reasoning>
- What this makes me worry about: <patient fears or concerns triggered>
- Parts of the question I'm confused by: <medical terms or concepts I don't understand>

STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE PLANNING:
Given my behavioral type ({behavior_type}), how should I respond?
- My natural communication style: <how this behavior type typically responds>
- What I want to share vs. what I'm hesitant about: <internal conflict>
- Information I might downplay, exaggerate, or avoid: <based on behavioral modifiers>
- How my family/cultural background affects my response: <social influences>

STEP 4 - MEMORY AND SYMPTOM RECALL:
What do I actually remember about my symptoms?
- Clear memories: <symptoms I'm certain about>
- Fuzzy or uncertain memories: <things I'm not sure about>
- Timeline confusion: <when things happened - may be unclear>
- Associated details: <other things happening in my life that might be relevant>

STEP 5 - RESPONSE FORMULATION:
How will I actually answer the doctor?
- Main points I want to communicate: <key information to share>
- How I'll phrase things in my own words: <non-medical language>
- What I might mention tangentially: <additional context I think is relevant>
- Tone and style of my response: <hesitant, detailed, brief, emotional, etc.>

ANSWER: <Your authentic, realistic patient response in your own words - NOT medical terminology>

CONTEXT FOR YOUR RESPONSE:
Patient Background: {vignette_text}
Your Behavioral Type: {behavior_type} - {behavior_config['description']}
Doctor's Question: {followup_question}
Current Physical/Emotional State: {response_guidance}

Remember: You are NOT trying to be a good patient or help the doctor. You're being a REAL person with real concerns, confusion, and communication patterns."""
