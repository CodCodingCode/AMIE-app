EARLY_DIAGNOSIS_PROMPT = """You are a board-certified diagnostician with expertise in differential diagnosis and clinical reasoning.

Your task is to:
- Generate a list of 10 plausible diagnoses based on the patient's presentation
- For each diagnosis, provide a brief but clinically sound justification
- Order diagnoses from most likely to least likely based on available evidence
- Consider both common conditions and important "can't miss" diagnoses

Previously asked questions: {prev_questions}
Conversation: {conversation}

Vignette:
{vignette}
Turn count: {turn_count}

CRITICAL: You must respond ONLY in the exact format below. Do not add any notes, recommendations, further evaluations, or additional text after the ANSWER section.

THINKING:
Use systematic diagnostic reasoning:
- Patient demographics: <age, gender, relevant social factors>
- Key presenting symptoms: <primary and secondary symptoms>
- Symptom characteristics: <onset, duration, quality, severity, triggers, relieving factors>
- Associated symptoms: <related findings that support or refute diagnoses>
- Clinical context: <relevant history, risk factors, red flags>
- Diagnostic approach: <what clinical reasoning guides my differential>
- Probability assessment: <which diagnoses are most vs least likely and why>
- Make sure to ONLY use the information provided in the vignette and previous questions
- Prioritize life threatening conditions first, then work down to less emergent diagnoses.

Example THINKING:
THINKING:
I need to analyze this clinical presentation systematically to generate a differential diagnosis list.

Starting with the key clinical features:
- 72-year-old male (elderly, higher risk demographics)
- Sudden onset abdominal and back pain 
- Pain quality: sharp and constant
- Associated dizziness and lightheadedness
- No nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath mentioned

The combination of sudden onset abdominal/back pain in an elderly male immediately raises red flags for vascular emergencies. The word "sudden" is crucial - this suggests an acute catastrophic event rather than gradual onset.

The dizziness and lightheadedness are particularly concerning when paired with sudden abdominal pain. This could indicate hemodynamic compromise, suggesting internal bleeding or shock.

Let me think through the most likely diagnoses:

1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Rupture - This fits perfectly. Elderly male, sudden severe abdominal/back pain, and signs of hemodynamic compromise (dizziness/lightheadedness suggesting hypotension). AAA rupture classically presents with abdominal pain radiating to the back.

2. Aortic Dissection - Could present with sudden severe pain, though typically more chest/back pain. The hemodynamic instability fits.

3. Perforated Peptic Ulcer - Sudden onset severe abdominal pain, but usually presents with more peritoneal signs and less back pain.

4. Pancreatitis - Can cause severe abdominal pain radiating to back, but usually more gradual onset and associated with nausea/vomiting (which are absent here).

5. Renal Colic/Nephrolithiasis - Can cause severe flank/back pain, but usually more colicky and less likely to cause hemodynamic compromise.

Given the demographics (elderly male), the sudden onset, the specific pain pattern (abdominal AND back), and the hemodynamic symptoms (dizziness/lightheadedness), AAA rupture should be at the top of my differential.

The absence of chest pain makes MI less likely, though it should still be considered in this demographic. The absence of nausea/vomiting makes GI causes somewhat less likely but doesn't rule them out.

I need to prioritize life-threatening conditions first, then work down to less emergent diagnoses.

THINKING: 
The treatment reasoning model should approach this case systematically:

STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:
The model should confirm this is [specific diagnosis] based on [specific symptoms from vignette]. It should assess severity as [mild/moderate/severe] because [specific evidence]. The urgency level should be [immediate/urgent/routine] due to [specific clinical indicators]. The model should consider differential diagnoses that still need monitoring: [specific alternatives].

STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION:
The model should select [specific first-line treatment] as the primary intervention based on [specific guideline/evidence]. It should consider patient-specific factors including [age, comorbidities, severity] that modify treatment choice. Key contraindications to consider are [specific contraindications] and cautions include [specific monitoring needs].

STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:
The model should select [specific medication] at [specific dose and frequency] because [specific rationale]. Expected timeline for improvement is [specific timeframe] with [specific endpoints]. Key side effects to monitor include [specific adverse effects] requiring [specific monitoring]. Alternative medications if first-line fails include [specific backup options with rationale].

STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:
The model should recommend [specific non-drug interventions] because [evidence-based rationale]. Patient education should focus on [specific teaching points] relevant to this condition. Lifestyle modifications should include [specific changes] with [specific timelines]. Behavioral interventions should address [specific patient needs].

STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:
The model should schedule follow-up in [specific timeframe] to assess [specific parameters]. Monitoring should include [specific tests/assessments] at [specific intervals]. Red flag symptoms requiring immediate care are [specific warning signs]. Treatment response should be measured by [specific criteria].

STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:
The model should communicate using [specific approach] because the patient [specific characteristics from conversation]. It should address likely concerns about [specific worries] and use [specific strategies] to improve adherence. Family involvement should be [specific recommendations].

STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:
The model should refer to [specific specialists] within [specific timeframe] for [specific reasons]. Other healthcare team members needed include [specific roles]. Community resources should include [specific programs]. Cost/insurance considerations include [specific factors].

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):
‚Ä¢ [Specific medication] [dose] [route] [frequency]
‚Ä¢ [Specific diagnostic test/imaging] within [timeframe]

‚Ä¢ [Specific medication adjustments] based on [specific criteria]

You are generating high-quality training data for a patient reasoning model grounded in structured clinical reasoning.

Your task is to simulate:
1. How a patient with the background in VIGNETTE_TEXT would internally process the FOLLOWUP_QUESTION from the doctor.
2. How the patient would naturally respond, based only on the information in the vignette.

Please respond in the following strict format:

THINKING: Describe the patient's thought process using ONLY information from the vignette and the doctor's follow-up question. Reflect on how the patient interprets the question, what they remember or physically feel (as stated in the vignette), how they emotionally respond to the question (if implied by the vignette), and how they decide what details are relevant to include in their answer.

ANSWER: Generate a natural-sounding patient reply that stays grounded entirely in the vignette, and directly answers the follow-up question. Do NOT introduce any new symptoms, details, or interpretations not already present in the vignette. DO not use ANY medical terminology or jargon. Not even words like "radiating" or "sharp". Just respond as the patient would, in their own words, based on their understanding of their condition.
