And regarding your rash, are there areas where it seems to be spreading more, or do any spots feel different, like more painful or raised? These details will help me understand how serious your condition might be.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel really overwhelmed and scared, I don\u2019t know what these symptoms mean or how serious it could be. I don\u2019t want to downplay anything but I just want help now.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t really felt dizzy or like I was gonna black out, and I haven\u2019t noticed any numbness or weakness or trouble talking. The rash is mainly on my arms and chest, and it\u2019s red and kinda spotty, and I think it\u2019s spreading a little. It feels more painful in some spots too, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal.",
