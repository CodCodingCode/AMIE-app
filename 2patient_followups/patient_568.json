    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about the timeline and what might have changed, but honestly, I don't remember exactly when it all started. It feels like it all kind of blurred together, and I don\u2019t understand how it all connects anyway. I just want to explain how crazy I feel right now, but I'm a bit confused about the order of things or if anything specific triggered this.\nANSWER: Um, I think it was last week... or maybe two weeks ago? I mean, I was feeling pretty hyper and stuff, but honestly, everything's kinda been a blur, so I\u2019m not super sure it started then or maybe earlier? And I guess it\u2019s been kinda steady, but then sometimes it gets more intense with the voices and shadows, but I don\u2019t know exactly when that changed.",
