Can you tell me if your itching tends to happen more at certain times of the day or after specific activities, like using your computer or being outside? Also, have you ever noticed any swelling around your eye or eyelids, or any new sensitivities to things like perfumes, dust, or pollen? Lastly, how much do these symptoms affect your daily activities or comfort, and what do you think might help if anything? This will help me be sure we're on the right track.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a bit overwhelmed, honestly. The doctor is asking about my eyes, but I don\u2019t really get how that connects to how I\u2019m feeling or what I\u2019m experiencing day to day. I don\u2019t remember noticing anything specific about when it gets worse or if it\u2019s more in the morning or at night. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any swelling or sensitivities. It just kind of feels itchy sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because of allergies or something else. It doesn\u2019t really stop me from doing much, but it\u2019s annoying and makes me uncomfortable. I guess I just want to be normal again.\nANSWER: Um, well, I don\u2019t really know if it happens at certain times of the day or after I do stuff, I just notice it sometimes. No swelling or new sensitivities that I\u2019ve seen. It doesn\u2019t stop me from doing things, but it\u2019s pretty irritating and I just want to feel better.",
