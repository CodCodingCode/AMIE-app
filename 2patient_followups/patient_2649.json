    "input": "2. A 9-month-old male infant is brought to the neurology clinic due to hypotonia and delayed motor milestones. His parents note poor feeding habits and frequent vomiting episodes since birth, accompanied by intermittent swelling of the lower extremities. Physical examination reveals facial dysmorphism including a broad nasal bridge and prominent forehead, as well as inverted nipples and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations show elevated liver enzymes and persistently low blood glucose levels. Serum transferrin electrophoresis demonstrates a type 1 pattern consistent with a defect in glycosylation. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic mutation in the ALG9 gene, confirming the diagnosis of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Ip. Neuroimaging highlights mild cerebellar hypoplasia, correlating with his ataxic movements. The medical team initiates multidisciplinary care including nutritional support, seizure management, and physical therapy to address his multisystemic involvement.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 9-month-old infant, so their responses will likely be limited and vague. They might express some discomfort or concern indirectly through their parents' observations, and I should keep the tone gentle, worried, and slightly confused about the situation.\n\nANSWER: I'm really worried because he's been not feeding right and keeps throwing up, and he's not hitting the things babies usually do at this age. Sometimes his legs look swollen, and he just seems... different, like he's struggling more than he should."

    "output": "Um, his feeding used to be okay, but now he seems to get tired easily and sometimes he\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, he just doesn\u2019t want to eat much, and he spits up a lot now. He\u2019s also been kind of quiet, and I sometimes notice his color looks a little weird\u2014I don\u2019t know, maybe pale or sweaty? His movements are not like before, and I worry about him not being as active as he should be."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been kind of different since he was born, I guess. He doesn\u2019t eat as well anymore, and he\u2019s been more tired than before. Sometimes he gets really fussy and throws up a lot, and his legs swell up sometimes, which worries me. I just don\u2019t know if what\u2019s happening is normal or if it\u2019s gotten worse."

    "output": "Um, they've said he's always been kind of not right since he was born, and nothing really seems to make it better or worse really, but sometimes he gets more tired or more fussing. It's just been like this since he was little."
