For example, how long do these episodes usually last? Are they usually in the same part of your vision or do they change places? Do you notice any other symptoms happening at the same time, like weakness, numbness, or speech difficulty? And when these episodes happen, do they tend to come after feeling tired or stressed, or do they seem to happen randomly?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about all these strange things happening, and honestly I don\u2019t quite understand what my body is doing, but I want to tell him everything so maybe he can help. I keep thinking about how I felt last week when I was helping my daughter with her homework and suddenly my vision kind of flickered and everything looked weird\u2014like spots popping up or blurring out, and I was so dizzy I had to sit down. I guess it happens sometimes if I get really tired or stressed, but it\u2019s been happening more often and lasting longer now.\nANSWER: Well, uh, sometimes when I\u2019m really tired or stressed, my vision kind of blurs or I see like these flashing spots, like little lights or something. It doesn\u2019t last very long, maybe a few seconds, and it kind of comes and goes, but recently it\u2019s been happening more and more, and I feel even weaker and more dizzy when it happens. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s all connected, but I just don\u2019t feel right.",
