I want to know what\u2019s wrong and if it\u2019s serious, but I\u2019m also scared to hear bad news. I just want someone to fix this and make it better.\nANSWER: Well, I started feeling real tired and weak a couple of weeks ago, and then I began sweating at night real bad, like I was burning up even when I wasn\u2019t doing anything. It\u2019s been happening almost every night now. The fever feels like it\u2019s been there all the time, even when I sit still. I\u2019ve also lost a lot of weight \u2014 I think over ten pounds \u2014 and I can feel my spleen getting bigger, like right here on my left side. I don\u2019t sleep well, and I feel dizzy and pale, like I might fall over. I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with me, but I know I feel worse every day.",
