Maybe I should mention something, but I don't want to seem like I'm making a big deal or being overly worried. I just want to get better somehow.\nANSWER: Uh, I haven\u2019t really noticed my skin feeling different or my hair thinning, but I do feel colder than I used to, even when it\u2019s warm outside. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not.",
