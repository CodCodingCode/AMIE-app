    "input": "2. A 45-year-old male accountant presents with a four-month history of persistent upper back stiffness and intermittent sharp pains radiating around the chest wall. He also notes progressive weakness in his legs, experiencing difficulty climbing stairs and frequent falls. Over the past two weeks, he has developed numbness and a burning sensation below the mid-thoracic region, accompanied by subtle urinary urgency but no incontinence. Neurological examination reveals spastic paraparesis with increased tone and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, along with decreased vibration and pinprick sensation below the T7 dermatome. MRI of the thoracic spine identifies a 2.5 cm well-defined, homogeneously enhancing intradural extramedullary mass ventral to the spinal cord at T6, consistent with a meningioma. The patient denies fevers, weight loss, or systemic symptoms, and has no history of malignancy or trauma. Given the progressive neurological deficits and imaging findings, the neurosurgery team recommends elective surgical resection to decompress the spinal cord. Postoperatively, the patient is started on a rehabilitation program focusing on ambulation and sensory recovery.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should express a general sense of concern or worsening symptoms, without sounding overly confident or precise. They should mention the back problems and new symptoms that are bothering them, showing that they're worried but unsure what\u2019s happening.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 45-year-old guy, and I\u2019ve been having this stiff feeling in my upper back for like four months now. It\u2019s also kind of sharp sometimes, and it\u2019s been bothering me more lately. I\u2019ve started having trouble with my legs \u2014 I fall more often and can\u2019t climb stairs as easily. It\u2019s pretty confusing and kinda scary."

    "output": "Well, I guess it\u2019s been really tough. I can\u2019t do things like I used to, and climbing stairs feels exhausting now. Sometimes I fall when I try to walk, and I get this weird burning and tingling down there, like it won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m kind of scared about what\u2019s going to happen next and if I\u2019ll get better."

    "output": "Um, yeah, uh, it's been harder to walk, like I feel more wobbly and kinda unsteady on my feet lately. I also notice like a weird tingling and sometimes sort of burning feeling in my legs and back, and it's been going on for a while but I didn't think much of it at first. Lately, I feel like I can't really feel things the way I used to, and I get pain or tightness sometimes. It's kind of scary because it feels like things are changing, but I don't really understand what\u2019s happening."

    "output": "Well, um, the pains and stiffness have kind of just stuck around, and I think it's gotten worse somehow. Climbing stairs is harder now, and I keep stumbling a bit. Sometimes I feel numb or burning below my chest and it kind of scares me. I used to like working out and playing with my kids, but now I\u2019m worried I\u2019m losing strength and can\u2019t do much anymore."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes the pain gets worse when I move in certain ways, and I feel like it\u2019s a bit worse in the evenings.

And, uh, I don\u2019t have headaches that I\u2019ve noticed. It just feels like things are getting a bit \"off\" down there."
