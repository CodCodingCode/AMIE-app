Has been trying to stay sober but struggles with cravings and mood swings.\n**SCENARIO:**\nStimulant dependence including amphetamines, methamphetamine or methcathinone, sustained partial remission \u2013 typical presentation\n---\n**CHARACTER BACKGROUND:**\n- **Occupation/school/life situation:**\nWorks sporadically in construction; mostly unemployed or working temp jobs. Life feels unstable.\n- **Family situation:**\nEstranged from family; no close contact, some history of substance use in family members.\n- **Personality traits:**\nQuiet, somewhat guarded, anxious when discussing his past. Has a sarcastic sense of humor but can appear withdrawn.\n- **Relevant medical/social history:**\nChronic high-dose stimulant use over several years, currently in partial remission.
