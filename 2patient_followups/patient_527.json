Have you noticed any other new or changing spots or patches elsewhere on your skin, or any other symptoms like increased soreness, tenderness, or additional bleeding? Also, can you describe whether the lesion's borders are irregular or rough, and if you see any areas that seem ulcerated or have a crust? This will help me better understand whether it has some of the features we look for in skin cancers.baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about other spots or symptoms, but honestly, I haven't really looked everywhere and I get a bit nervous talking about these things. I just want to explain what I've noticed about this one, but I guess I should try to answer honestly without overthinking it.\nANSWER: No, I haven't really seen anything else new, just that one spot. It\u2019s kind of irregular and rough around the edges, I think. It sometimes looks like it\u2019s ulcerated or crusted, I\u2019m not sure. I haven\u2019t seen any other spots or anything else that\u2019s changed.",
