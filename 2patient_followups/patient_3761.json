    "input": "2. A 34-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of excessive daytime sleepiness and difficulty awakening in the mornings. She also describes new-onset polyuria and polydipsia, which started alongside irregular menstrual cycles. Neurological examination reveals mild ptosis and impaired upward gaze. Her cognitive function appears intact, though she complains of occasional headaches. Brain MRI demonstrates a homogenously enhancing suprasellar mass causing slight compression of the optic chiasm without hydrocephalus. Endocrine workup shows central diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is negative for malignant cells, but biopsy confirms a diagnosis of CNS germinoma. She is commenced on combined chemoradiation, with endocrinology initiated for hormone replacement therapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely feeling overwhelmed and maybe a bit scared since she has been dealing with multiple new symptoms that seem serious. She might be confused about what's happening, and her responses should reflect her emotional state and uncertainty.\n\nANSWER: I guess I wasn\u2019t feeling right for a couple of months, and I just keep feeling really sleepy all the time. I also keep needing to pee a lot and drinking tons of water, and my periods are all over the place now. Honestly, I just feel a bit lost and not sure what\u2019s wrong with me."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling pretty exhausted most of the time, even after sleeping a lot.
