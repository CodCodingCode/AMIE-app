    "input": "1. A 4-year-old female toddler is brought to the pediatric neurology clinic by her parents due to delayed developmental milestones and significant speech impairment. She has a history of feeding difficulties during infancy, marked hypotonia, and poor head control noted since 6 months of age. The child exhibits distinctive facial features, including a broad forehead, wide-set eyes, and a thin upper lip. Her parents report frequent episodes of irritability and poor sleep patterns. On examination, she demonstrates global developmental delay, absent speech, and autistic-like behaviors such as hand-flapping and limited social interaction. MRI of the brain reveals mild cortical atrophy without structural malformations. Genetic testing identifies a de novo pathogenic variant in the ASXL3 gene, confirming the diagnosis of Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome. Multidisciplinary management including physical therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral interventions is initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The child is very young and cannot speak, so the parents are probably worried about her development and behavior. I should respond in a way that indicates concern and that I'm here for evaluation, without assuming too much. \n\nANSWER: My daughter is 4 years old, and she\u2019s been having a lot of trouble with her development. She doesn't really talk or do the things other kids her age do, and she gets easily upset. We just want to understand what\u2019s going on and if there\u2019s anything we can do to help her."

    "output": "Um, she mostly just kind of sits or plays with her toys, but she doesn\u2019t really look at us or anyone much. Sometimes, when new people come, she gets really upset or just kind of fusses and turns away. She doesn\u2019t seem happy or sad in a way I can tell \u2014 she just gets upset or irritated, and she doesn\u2019t really play much with others. We try to cheer her up, but it\u2019s hard to tell what she likes or dislikes."

    "output": "Um, she doesn\u2019t really like when things change suddenly. If someone new comes in or if we go somewhere she\u2019s not used to, she gets really upset or starts flapping her hands a lot. Sometimes she just seems overwhelmed without a clear reason, but other times, if she\u2019s tired or hungry, she seems worse. I\u2019m not always sure what exactly sets her off or makes her feel okay."

She also doesn\u2019t like certain textures, like if something feels rough or sticky, and she might start crying or flapping her hands. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell exactly what sets her off, but those things seem to bother her a lot."

    "output": "Um, sometimes she seems like she notices things, but it's hard to tell if she's really understanding, I guess. She might look at a toy or give it to us, but not all the time. It's kind of unpredictable."
