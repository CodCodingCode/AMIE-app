The patient\u2019s mother mentions he has had similar but milder intermittent pain in the same testicle over the past few months. On examination, the left testicle is swollen, elevated, and extremely tender on palpation, with an absent cremasteric reflex on the affected side. There is no evidence of fever or dysuria. The right testicle appears normal without tenderness. Urinalysis is unremarkable. Doppler ultrasound of the scrotum shows decreased blood flow to the left testicle, confirming testicular torsion.\nWhat brings you in today?",

It\u2019s really swollen and tender, and I feel like I want to throw up. I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t think it would get this bad so fast."
