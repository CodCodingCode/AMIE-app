And how has the pain or itching changed since they started?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried, and I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s gotten so bad so fast. I just want it to stop hurting and look better. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, and I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to talk about it, but I guess I need help.\nANSWER: I first saw a few bumps a couple of weeks ago, but they didn\u2019t look this bad, you know? Now, they\u2019re everywhere, real sore, and there\u2019s pus and crusting, and I\u2019ve been scratching all the time. I\u2019ve been using my hair gel and wearing caps a lot\u2014maybe I made it worse? I don\u2019t know.",
