I\u2019ve been having some bleeding when I go to the bathroom, and I\u2019m worried about it. The blood is bright red, and it just happens when I have a bowel movement. It\u2019s not heavy, but I do see it every time I go now. There\u2019s also a lump near my anus that I can feel sometimes, especially if I wipe. I\u2019ve been feeling itchy and uncomfortable down there, and I think I\u2019ve been constipated since I had my baby a few weeks ago.

When your lump appears after a bowel movement, does it go back in on its own, or does it stay out most of the time? And regarding the bleeding\u2014does it only happen during or after you go to the toilet, or do you notice it at other times? Also, about the mucus you mentioned\u2014do you notice more of it when you're straining or having diarrhea? Lastly, how are you feeling about these symptoms overall\u2014are they affecting your daily activities or causing you any particular concern?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to remember if the lump stays out or goes back in, but honestly I\u2019m a bit confused about when exactly it appeared or what I noticed first. The bleeding happens when I go, I think, but then I see it on the toilet paper later too? The mucus seems to show up more after straining, but I\u2019m not sure if that means more than usual. Overall, I just feel a bit worried and embarrassed and worried it\u2019s something serious or that I\u2019ll need something done, but I don\u2019t really understand all these details.\nANSWER: Um, I think the lump sort of stays out most of the time, but sometimes it goes back in on its own, I guess? The bleeding only happens when I go to the toilet, I believe, but I also see blood on the paper sometimes afterwards. The mucus seems to come more after I\u2019ve been straining a lot, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not. Honestly, it\u2019s been bothering me enough that I don\u2019t want it to get worse or something, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening or what I should do.",
