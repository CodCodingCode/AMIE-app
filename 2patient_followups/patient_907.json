Can you tell me whether these hallucinations happen every day or only some days? When they do happen, do they last for a few seconds, minutes, or longer? Are they more noticeable at certain times of the day or in particular situations? Also, besides hearing voices or seeing shadows, have you ever had any strong beliefs about what these experiences mean or any unusual thoughts that seem different from your usual thinking? Understanding these details can help me see if your experiences fit typical patterns for certain conditions.information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and a little scared. I don\u2019t really understand why it\u2019s happening or what it means, and I don\u2019t want to sound crazy, but I also know I need help. I\u2019m not sure how often it\u2019s happening or how long, but it\u2019s been more often lately, and it\u2019s really confusing.\nANSWER: Um, I guess I hear the voices almost every day now, and they can last a while, like a few minutes maybe. Sometimes I see shadows sometimes, but it\u2019s not just at night, it\u2019s also during the day. I don\u2019t really have strong thoughts about what they mean, I just feel\u2026 weird, like I\u2019m losing control or something.",
