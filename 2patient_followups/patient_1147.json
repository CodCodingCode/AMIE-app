    "input": "2. A 52-year-old man notices an abrupt enlargement of his left breast over the course of one month, accompanied by intense redness and warmth. He describes the skin as tight and shiny, with a prominent peau d\u2019orange texture, and reports persistent aching discomfort. The nipple has recently become flattened and retracted, and he has felt a lump under his left arm. He denies any fever or chills but feels generally fatigued and has lost 5 pounds unintentionally. On examination, the entire breast is swollen, erythematous, and tender, with peau d\u2019orange changes and palpable axillary lymph nodes. There is no history of trauma or prior breast issues, though he is currently undergoing treatment for type 2 diabetes. Imaging with mammography shows diffuse skin thickening and increased breast density without a discrete mass, and ultrasound reveals dermal edema with irregular hypoechoic areas. A skin biopsy combined with a core needle biopsy confirms invasive carcinoma consistent with inflammatory breast carcinoma.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely overwhelmed and unsure about how to explain his symptoms clearly. He might be feeling worried but also embarrassed about his changing appearance and the symptoms he's experiencing. He probably just wants to communicate that something doesn't feel right and it's been happening for a little while.\n\nANSWER: Well, doc, I don\u2019t really know how to say it, but my left breast just suddenly got so big and red, and it\u2019s really sore and tight. It\u2019s been like this for about a month, and now the skin looks funny, kind of shiny and lumpy. I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and I lost a little weight too, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on."
