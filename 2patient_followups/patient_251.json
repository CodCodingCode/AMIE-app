Will I be okay?\u201d\n---\n**ROLEPLAY FOCUS:**\n- Show distress and urgency in breathing difficulty\n- Indicate symptoms have significantly worsened over recent days\n- Express fear about serious complications like lung infections or cancer later in life\"Lucas, when you think back further, even a while ago, did you ever notice feeling a little funny or having a cough, chest tightness, or shortness of breath that you might have just thought was no big deal or didn\u2019t last long? Sometimes, people have small breathing issues that they don\u2019t really notice at the time. Do any of those kinds of times ring a bell for you?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a little confused about if I\u2019ve felt this before. I do remember sometimes feeling like I couldn\u2019t breathe right after playing soccer or running around, but it didn't last long and I thought maybe I was just tired. Now, it\u2019s worse, and I don\u2019t really know what it means. I just want to breathe better and not feel scared all the time.\nANSWER: Yeah, I guess I sometimes felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe good after running or playing, but it just went away fast. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal then, but now it\u2019s really bad.",
