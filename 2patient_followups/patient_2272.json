    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy presents with delayed motor milestones, difficulty walking, and progressive muscle weakness primarily affecting the proximal muscles. His parents report frequent falls and trouble climbing stairs over the past year. On examination, he exhibits calf hypertrophy, mild joint contractures, and hypotonia. Serum creatine kinase levels are moderately elevated. Brain MRI reveals subtle cerebellar hypoplasia, and muscle biopsy shows dystrophic changes with abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Genetic testing identifies a homozygous mutation in the FKRP gene consistent with Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy, Type C, 5. Cardiac evaluation is normal, but respiratory function testing indicates mild restrictive patterns. Supportive care with physical therapy has been initiated, and multidisciplinary follow-up is planned.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain simply what\u2019s been happening and how I\u2019m feeling. I should mention the trouble with walking and falling a lot, and maybe some worries about my muscles and how they\u2019re feeling. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overthinking it, but I need him to understand what\u2019s been going on.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019m here because I\u2019ve been falling a lot and it\u2019s harder for me to walk like I used to. Sometimes I feel really weak and tired in my muscles, especially in my legs, and I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s been bothering me for a little while now, and I just want to understand what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been falling more than before, and he has trouble climbing stairs and sometimes has a hard time standing up straight. He doesn\u2019t really complain about numbness or tingling, but he gets tired really quickly, especially during play. Sometimes he looks a bit wobbly when he tries to walk, and I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s not as steady as other kids his age."

    "output": "Um, well, he's been kinda wobbly and falling more lately, and it\u2019s been hard for him to climb stairs like before. It started a while ago, and I think he\u2019s gotten worse, but I\u2019m not sure exactly when. Sometimes his muscles feel kinda stiff, and he seems tired more often. No idea about other illnesses\u2014just worried about how he's been."

    "output": "Um, his muscles sometimes feel really stiff or tired, especially when he's trying to stand up or climb stairs. He seems to get more shaky or wobbly if he tries to run a lot, and I guess he\u2019s a bit better when he\u2019s just sitting or resting, but not always."

    "output": "Um, well, he\u2019s still pretty floppy sometimes, and I think he mostly feels like that, but I\u2019m not really sure if his reflexes have changed or if they\u2019re supposed to be like that. As for family history, I don\u2019t really know if anyone else in the family has had anything like this."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think so... I haven\u2019t really noticed any rashes or anything like that. Sometimes I feel kind of tired, but I don\u2019t remember having fever or anything. My joints sometimes bother me a bit when I try to play, but nothing really hurts a lot."

    "output": "Yeah, he seems to be having a tougher time lately, like he gets tired faster and falls more often, especially when trying to stand up or go up the stairs. He's not as steady as he used to be, I think."

    "output": "Yeah, it\u2019s been harder for him to do basic stuff like climbing or walking properly. Sometimes he falls more often, and he gets tired really quick. It feels like it\u2019s been worse over time, like he\u2019s struggling more than before."
