These details can help us get a clearer picture of what might be going on.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my eye pain, but I don\u2019t really understand all the details they want. I just know my eye\u2019s been sore and dull, not really red or anything, and I don\u2019t pay close attention to what makes it worse or better. I hope they can figure it out, but I\u2019m worried it might be serious since I\u2019ve had other health issues.\nANSWER: It\u2019s just a dull ache in my eye, more or less all the time now. It\u2019s not red or sensitive or anything, and I haven\u2019t noticed any floaters or blurriness. It doesn\u2019t really change much, and I don\u2019t think anything makes it worse or better, really.",
