    "input": "2. A 35-year-old man presents to the endocrinology clinic with progressive muscle weakness, hypertension, and new-onset diabetes over the past year. He also reports persistent fatigue, mood swings, and recent episodes of acne and excessive hair growth on his chest and back. Physical examination reveals a plethoric face, proximal muscle atrophy, and elevated blood pressure. Laboratory studies demonstrate elevated serum cortisol unresponsive to dexamethasone suppression, increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and suppressed ACTH levels. Abdominal MRI reveals a 7 cm mass arising from the right adrenal cortex with evidence of local invasion. The patient\u2019s family history is significant for early-onset cancers, including a sister diagnosed with adrenal carcinoma in her twenties. Genetic testing identifies a germline TP53 mutation indicating Li-Fraumeni syndrome, consistent with hereditary adrenocortical carcinoma. He is scheduled for adrenalectomy and enrolled in a multidisciplinary surveillance program for associated malignancies, with genetic counseling offered to relatives.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to keep it simple and honest, but also mention my feelings and what\u2019s been going on physically. I should avoid overly detailed or technical terms, since I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong or what to expect.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 35-year-old man, and I\u2019ve just been feeling really tired and kind of weak all the time. I\u2019ve also noticed my face looks puffier than usual, and I started getting these strange mood swings and some breakouts lately. It's been pretty confusing and kind of scary, honestly."

    "output": "Um, I think the stuff with my muscles and feeling really tired has been happening for a while, maybe over the past year or so. It\u2019s gotten worse lately, and I\u2019ve been feeling more out of sorts\u2014like mood swings and just not having energy. Sometimes I notice spots on my skin or get these weird feelings in my chest. Honestly, I\u2019m kind of scared because I don\u2019t really understand why all this is happening."
