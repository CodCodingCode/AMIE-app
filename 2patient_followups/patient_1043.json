For example, was there any redness, warmth, or unusual sensations? And do you remember how long it was from the moment you first noticed it until things seemed to get worse? Also, at that early stage, did you experience any other symptoms like chills, fever, or feeling unwell\u2014either then or just before the sore started? I want to understand what your toe was like in those very first days, to get a clearer picture of how this began.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know what I saw and felt at the very beginning, but honestly, it wasn\u2019t anything dramatic then. It was just a little sore and maybe some redness, but I thought it would go away on its own. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting, but I guess I do remember feeling a bit warm and tired before it got worse.\nANSWER: Well, I think it started with just a small sore on my toe, there was some redness, but not too bad. I did feel a little feverish and tired, but I thought it was nothing, just a little something I had to handle.",
