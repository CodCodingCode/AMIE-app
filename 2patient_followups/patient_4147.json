    "input": "2. A 68-year-old male with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica presents with acute vision loss in his left eye that began abruptly two days ago. He describes a dull, throbbing pain around his temples and reports recently experiencing difficulty swallowing and occasional low-grade fevers. On examination, there is a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye and decreased color vision. Fundoscopic exam reveals a pale, swollen optic nerve head with cotton wool spots. Laboratory tests demonstrate an elevated ESR of 85 mm/hr and CRP of 45 mg/L. The patient also notes stiffness and aching in his shoulders and hips over the previous month. Temporal artery palpation reveals tenderness and reduced pulsation on the left side. A temporal artery biopsy is scheduled to confirm suspected giant cell arteritis causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and corticosteroid therapy is urgently started.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling confused and worried, possibly overwhelmed by the symptoms and the sudden change in vision. They probably want to explain their experience but might struggle with clear details, emphasizing their discomfort and the severity of the symptoms.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I really didn\u2019t think much of it at first, but then suddenly my eye went really blurry, and I started feeling this dull ache around my head and temples, and it\u2019s been bothering me pretty much all the time now. I\u2019ve also been having a hard time swallowing and feeling kind of feverish off and on, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, the vision thing just kind of came on all of a sudden, like one day I was fine and then suddenly I couldn\u2019t see very well with that eye. The pain around my temples has been there off and on, and I feel like it\u2019s worse when I try to move my head or if I stay in one position too long. I don\u2019t think anything really makes it better, and it doesn\u2019t seem to get better on its own, no."

    "output": "Well, I guess it\u2019s been kind of hard to do things like I used to. My vision problems make it hard to see clearly, and I feel a bit all over the place with my strength sometimes. I\u2019ve also been feeling more tired than usual, and I think I\u2019ve been a bit colder or maybe just achier overall. I just\u2014 I don\u2019t know, everything\u2019s been a bit confusing and it\u2019s kinda scary not knowing what\u2019s going on."

It\u2019s been like that for a couple of days now, and I don\u2019t really know why or if it\u2019s gotten worse. I\u2019ve also been feeling some pain around my head and temples, and I\u2019ve been kinda tired and not myself, but I can\u2019t figure out if that\u2019s related or not."

    "output": "No, I don't think I've been around anyone sick or noticed anything like that. I just feel kind of tired and like my head is heavy sometimes, but I don\u2019t really know if that counts."

Also, how old are you, and have you experienced any scalp tenderness or jaw claudication?",
    "output": "It's kinda hard to describe, but I think I\u2019ve lost more in that eye, like parts of my vision are just gone or fuzzy now. The other eye feels alright for now, but the whole thing seemed worse at first. I\u2019m 68 years old. Umm, my scalp\u2019s been kinda sore, and sometimes I get pain when I chew or open my mouth wide."

    "output": "Well, I do feel like... maybe my vision is kind of worse, or at least it feels different today. My jaw doesn\u2019t really hurt when I chew, but sometimes I get a weird ache in my head, especially on the side that's affected. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s getting more or different, but I just feel like things are not the same as before."
