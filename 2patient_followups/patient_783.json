    "input": "1. A 9-year-old female is referred to the genetics clinic due to progressive difficulty with night vision and increasing truncal obesity noted over the past few years. Her parents also report that she has had difficulty with school performance and exhibits subtle learning disabilities. On physical exam, she has post-axial polydactyly on her right foot and mild facial dysmorphism. Ophthalmologic evaluation reveals early signs of retinitis pigmentosa, including peripheral visual field constriction. Renal ultrasound demonstrates cystic changes and mild cortical thinning bilaterally. A history of nocturnal enuresis prompts evaluation, which shows evidence of mild chronic kidney disease. Neurodevelopmental assessment confirms mild intellectual disability and coordination difficulties. Genetic sequencing identifies a pathogenic mutation in the BBS16 gene, confirming the diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 16.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep it simple and honest, focusing on what\u2019s been bothering me lately without over-explaining. I want to tell the doctor what's really bothering me without sounding confused or like I don\u2019t understand.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 9, and I guess I\u2019ve been having a hard time seeing at night and my tummy feels bigger than before. I also sometimes worry about school and stuff, but I don\u2019t really understand why."
