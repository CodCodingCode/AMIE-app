But then yesterday, out of nowhere, it just switched and became super painful\u2014like a knife stabbing me when I blinked, and it got really red and bloodshot. I mean, I wear contacts pretty often and sometimes I forget to clean them well, but I\u2019ve never had anything this bad. My eye keeps tearing up, even though it hurts, and it feels like there\u2019s something stuck in there I can't get out, like dust or a tiny hair. And now I can't see clearly at all, and I\u2019m just so worried. I mean, I\u2019ve heard of corneal abrasions or ulcers, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening now. My sister had eye problems once and her eye looked pretty bad, so I\u2019m scared it could be serious. I was just working late yesterday, trying to finish a design, and I think I might\u2019ve touched my eye without washing my hands \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s why it\u2019s gotten this bad.",

I guess I want the doctor to understand how sudden and bad it\u2019s gotten, but I also feel nervous and overwhelmed.\nANSWER: Uh, well, it sort of just started with my eye feeling a bit itchy and red, like I had a tiny straw or something in it, you know? I was working late, trying to finish a design, and I was wearin\u2019 my contacts all day without really thinking about it. Then, yesterday, out of nowhere, it just got way worse\u2014super sharp pain, and I kept crying because it hurt so much.

For instance, have you noticed any kind of pus or discharge from your eye, especially when you wake up or during the day? Also, as your symptoms have worsened, have you seen any new spots, such as white or grayish areas on the cornea, or felt a gritty sensation that might suggest an epithelial ulcer? And regarding your contact lens use\u2014can you tell me how often you clean your lenses or if you\u2019ve worn them longer than recommended lately? These details will help us confirm whether this might be an infection or something else needing urgent care.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really scared and trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t really know what all these signs mean. I just know my eye hurts so much and I can\u2019t stop crying and blinking.

I keep wiping tears\u2014I mean, it won\u2019t stop\u2014and it feels like there\u2019s something in my eye I just can\u2019t get out. My vision\u2019s all blurry now too, and I keep worrying if this is going to ruin my eye or make me lose my sight or something. I wear contacts all the time, and I guess sometimes I don\u2019t clean them as well as I should because I\u2019ve been busy with work, and I\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately, working late and all that. Should I keep wearing them? Or should I just take them out?",
