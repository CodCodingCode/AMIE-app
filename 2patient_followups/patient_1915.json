    "input": "2. A 9-year-old girl is brought to the neurology clinic due to slowly progressive weakness and numbness in her legs that began around age 5. Her parents note she has always had a waddling gait and has recently started to have difficulty climbing stairs and rising from the floor. On neurological examination, she exhibits areflexia, distal muscle wasting in the lower limbs, and claw toes deformities. Sensory exam reveals impaired pain and temperature sensation in a stocking distribution. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate diffusely slowed motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, suggestive of a demyelinating process. A sural nerve biopsy shows Schwann cell proliferation with onion bulb formations, confirming hypertrophic changes. Genetic analysis identifies a mutation in the MPZ gene, consistent with the diagnosis of Hypertrophic Neuropathy of Dejerine-Sottas. Management includes supportive care with physical therapy and orthotic devices to improve mobility and prevent contractures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, so her response should be simple and emotional, possibly showing she is concerned or worried but also maybe a little scared or confused about what's happening to her. She might not fully understand the questions or be able to explain clearly what she's feeling.\n\nANSWER: I'm 9 years old, and I pretty much started feeling weird in my legs a long time ago, like they\u2019re really tired and sometimes I can\u2019t move them good. I don\u2019t know exactly why I need to come here, but I keep having trouble walking and climbing stairs, and it sorta feels like my legs are getting weaker."

    "output": "Um, sometimes it feels really heavy, and it's like my legs don\u2019t want to move the way they used to. Climbing stairs is kind of hard now, and I worry I might trip or fall sometimes. I\u2019ve also been a little more tired, and I don't know... I get scared that I maybe can\u2019t do things like I used to."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes when I walk around or play, my legs feel kind of like... funny, like numb or tingly, and they get really tired faster than before. And other times, it's harder to stand or climb, like my legs just don\u2019t want to do what I ask."

    "output": "I think it started a long time ago, maybe when I was little, and it\u2019s just been getting worse little by little. Sometimes it\u2019s really hard to climb stairs or get up from the floor, and I get tired faster than other kids. I feel kind of sad or frustrated about it, but I don\u2019t really understand why it\u2019s happening or what\u2019s going to happen next."

    "output": "Um, I don't really have pain or swelling, but sometimes my legs feel kind of stiff when I get up. I don't know if that's normal or not."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think so? I haven\u2019t really noticed any rashes or anything on my skin, and I don\u2019t feel feverish or have any weird weight changes or anything like that."

    "output": "I think I do feel a little unsteady sometimes when I try to run, and I guess I might have trouble standing on my toes or heels, but I\u2019m not exactly sure. I just feel kind of wobbly and get tired easily."
