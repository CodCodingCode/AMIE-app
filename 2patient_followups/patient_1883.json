    "input": "2. A 12-year-old female presents with progressive muscle weakness and exercise intolerance that started several years ago. Her parents notice that she tires easily during physical activities and has difficulty climbing stairs. She also has a history of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes during overnight fasting, often accompanied by dizziness and sweating. On examination, she has a moderately enlarged liver and mild hepatomegaly, but no splenomegaly. Laboratory studies reveal elevated transaminases, hyperlipidemia, and elevated creatine kinase, suggesting muscle involvement. A fasting test shows hypoglycemia with low insulin and normal ketone production. Electromyography demonstrates myopathic changes, and genetic testing confirms a mutation in the AGL gene, consistent with Glycogen Storage Disease III. Nutritional management with frequent meals enriched with complex carbohydrates and cornstarch therapy is initiated, alongside a referral to physical therapy to maintain muscle strength.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young and probably feels worried or unsure about her symptoms but might also be embarrassed or scared to fully explain. She could be experiencing discomfort or frustration with her physical symptoms, so I need to encourage her to share without feeling pressured or judged.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really tired all the time, and sometimes I get these weird dizzy spells, especially if I go a long time without eating. My mom said I should come see someone about it."

    "output": "Well, I guess I eat pretty much the same stuff most days, like snacks and meals, but sometimes I get really tired even if I just played for a little while. I don\u2019t always feel good after fasting, especially overnight \u2014 I get dizzy and sweaty, and I don\u2019t know why. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling like my muscles are weaker, and I can\u2019t do as much without getting tired or sore quick."

    "output": "Um, I think I feel the most tired after I play or run around for a while, and then I get really out of breath and my legs feel heavy. Sometimes, I get dizzy or start sweating, especially if I haven't eaten in a while. It\u2019s kind of worse if I don\u2019t rest enough or if I try to do too much."

Additionally, have you experienced any other symptoms such as changes in your mood, hair, or skin, or any recent illnesses or stresses?",
    "output": "Um, I usually eat maybe when I feel hungry, but sometimes I don\u2019t really feel like eating much. I think I\u2019ve been losing a little bit of weight, but I don\u2019t really pay attention to it. My mood is okay mostly, I guess, but I do get really tired sometimes, especially after running around. No one\u2019s really said anything about my hair or skin being weird, and I haven\u2019t been sick lately, just tired more than usual, I think."
