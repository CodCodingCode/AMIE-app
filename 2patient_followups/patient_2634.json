    "input": "1. A 3-year-old female presents with global developmental delay and hypotonia noticed since infancy. Her parents report feeding difficulties and frequent vomiting episodes during the first year of life. Physical examination reveals distinctive facial dysmorphisms including a broad nasal bridge and large forehead, along with inverted nipples and abnormal fat distribution on the trunk. Laboratory investigations show elevated serum transaminases and hypoglycemia during fasting. Electroencephalogram displays mild slowing without epileptiform discharges. A brain MRI reveals delayed myelination but no structural malformations. Genetic testing confirms a pathogenic mutation in the SRD5A3 gene, consistent with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Ir. The patient is started on supportive therapies including physical and occupational therapy, with close monitoring for metabolic complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is very young and likely isn't able to express her symptoms directly. The parents will probably describe ongoing concerns or new issues, such as increased irritability, feeding problems, or anything unusual they've noticed lately. I should keep her response simple and focus on any recent changes or worries they've mentioned.\n\nANSWER: Um, she's been acting a bit fussy and not eating quite right lately, and she seems a little more tired than usual. Sometimes she vomits after feeding, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just something she ate or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just worried because her condition doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better."

    "output": "Well, she's been kinda more tired than usual, I think. Sometimes she seems more sleepy and doesn't want to play as much, but then other times she gets a bit fussy or more irritable. There haven't been any big new things, but I just feel like she's not herself."

    "output": "Um, well, she doesn\u2019t really play the same as other kids maybe. She gets tired pretty easily, and sometimes she doesn\u2019t want to do stuff she used to like. She\u2019s been making weird sounds lately, like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, like she\u2019s confused or upset but she can\u2019t tell us why. It\u2019s all a bit hard to explain."
