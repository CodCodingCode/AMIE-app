For example, did they come on gradually over time, or did they seem to happen suddenly? And do you notice whether these symptoms appeared before, at the same time as, or after your eye symptoms began? Understanding this timing can really help clarify what's going on.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to recall how everything started, but honestly, it\u2019s all kind of jumbled in my head. I think it was maybe last week I started noticing my face looking puffier, or maybe it was a few weeks ago? Same with the weight gain, I can\u2019t really remember exactly when it got so rapid. The dark streaks and the cramps just kinda came along with the other stuff, but I\u2019m confused about which came first and if they\u2019re related or not. I just want to understand what\u2019s wrong with me.\nANSWER: Honestly, I think it all started maybe a few weeks ago, but I can't be sure \u2014 one day I just looked in the mirror and saw I was looking different, and then everything else kind of just, I don\u2019t know, followed after that.",
