I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and some-what calm, even if I feel nervous inside.\nANSWER: Like I said, doctor, I\u2019ve had this sore throat for about a month, and it\u2019s just not getting better. It\u2019s sore all the time now, and I find it pretty hard to swallow. Yesterday, I saw a little blood when I spit, not a lot, but enough to worry me. My breath\u2019s been pretty bad too, and I\u2019ve been noticing that my voice sounds kinda different sometimes, like I\u2019m hoarse or something. I don\u2019t usually go to doctors, but a few people told me I should come in, so here I am.",
