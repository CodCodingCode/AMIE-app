She appears anxious and underreports systemic symptoms but may be experiencing early systemic signs like fatigue. Her language indicates a possible serious infection like necrotizing fasciitis, but she minimizes her experience, so probing for objective signs of systemic illness and tissue compromise is critical before final confirmation. The physical exam should evaluate for skin crepitus, bulla formation, bullae, anesthesia, or signs of systemic instability, which will guide urgent management decisions.stoic_minimizer",
