    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my temperature and how I feel when I get chills or hot flashes. I\u2019m really worried this could be something serious like an infection that's going to spread or worse. I haven\u2019t checked my temperature, but I feel hot and shivery sometimes, like I\u2019m burning inside but then I also get really cold and sweaty. It feels horrible and makes me think maybe I have a fever or something systemic going on, which terrifies me. I just want to know if I need antibiotics, or if it could be something more dangerous like sepsis or losing my toe.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t taken my temperature, but I feel hot and sweaty sometimes, then really cold and shivery, like my whole body is flipping out. It\u2019s been like this before, but it\u2019s worse now with my toe. I\u2019m really scared it\u2019s more than just an infection\u2014like, what if it\u2019s spreading or I get really sick?",
