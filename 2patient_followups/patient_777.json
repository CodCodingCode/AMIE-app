    "input": "2. A 7-year-old female is brought to the clinic by her mother, who is concerned about her daughter\u2019s excessive appetite and rapid weight gain since infancy. The child exhibits marked hyperphagia, often sneaking food between meals, and has a BMI well above the 99th percentile for her age. Developmental milestones are normal, and there is no dysmorphic features or syndromic appearance. On examination, she has acanthosis nigricans on the neck, consistent with early insulin resistance. Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum leptin levels but poor response to leptin signaling, raising suspicion for leptin receptor dysfunction. Her family history is notable for consanguinity but no known obesity or endocrine disorders. Genetic analysis identifies a homozygous mutation in the LEPR gene, confirming leptin receptor deficiency. The clinical team emphasizes the importance of strict dietary management and considers enrollment in clinical trials evaluating targeted treatments for leptin receptor mutations.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to keep it simple and honest, just describe my feelings and what\u2019s been bothering me. I might feel a little worried or embarrassed about how much I eat and all the changes I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019m here because I feel really hungry all the time, like I can\u2019t stop thinking about food. And I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight quickly, more than other kids I know."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know... I just feel kind of tired sometimes, even when I sleep good, and I get really hungry all the time, no matter what I eat. Sometimes I get annoyed 'cause I want to do other stuff but I just think about food mostly."
