I\u2019d like to understand better\u2014are you experiencing any persistent pain or discomfort in your abdomen that feels especially severe or different from before? Also, have you been having any episodes of fever, chills, or nightsweats? These kinds of symptoms can sometimes tell us more about what's happening inside, and knowing about them can really help us figure out the next best steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor asked about the pain and discomfort, and I guess I should describe it clearly, but honestly, I keep feeling like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s important anymore. My chest is tight, and I feel like I can\u2019t breathe properly, but I also keep thinking about my wife\u2019s old friend who had something similar and didn\u2019t make it. I'm worried, but I also feel like I should just tell everything because maybe it all ties together somehow.\nANSWER: Well, yes, the pain in my belly is still there, and it\u2019s gotten worse \u2014 now it feels really hard and sorta like a big ball in there, you know? And I keep feeling this pressure in my chest, like I can\u2019t get enough air, especially if I walk around even a little. I mean, I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight lately, and I don\u2019t really have an appetite anymore, and honestly, when I was with my daughter last weekend, she said I looked terrible, so I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s more than just a stomach thing?",
