    "output": "THINKING: I'm trying to remember when things started, but everything's kind of mixed up in my mind. I know the patches and sores have been there a while, but now it feels worse, and I keep thinking maybe it's gotten more serious recently. I feel really anxious and worried, but I can't quite remember if it was last week or a little longer ago.\nANSWER: Well, I think the mole on my arm, it changed shape and color maybe like, I don't know, within the last few weeks? Or maybe it's been a bit longer? And the sore\u2014I feel like that\u2019s been there a while, but lately it\u2019s been more sore and sometimes bleeds a little. It\u2019s all a bit confusing, really.",
