Then, I remember my cousin had a similar thing, and they said it was just like, the way their nose was shaped or something? And I\u2019ve been using nasal sprays a lot because I thought it would help, but then I started hearing myself breathe when I inhale and exhale, like, sounding all weird, and sometimes I get a whistling noise that\u2019s pretty loud. My face also hurts in this dull way around my nose and cheeks, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or what.",

    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so I guess he\u2019s asking about my eye swelling and\u2026 uh, I think I just remember playing soccer and then my eye was kinda red and puffy, and I didn\u2019t really hit it hard. I was running a lot, and maybe I didn\u2019t see the ball coming or something, but it wasn\u2019t like a punch or anything, more like it just got irritated. Since then, it\u2019s kinda stayed swollen and red, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse or the same, because I don\u2019t really check my eye that much, but it still bothers me when I blink or move it around.\nANSWER: Well, I was playing soccer and I remember near the end, I kinda got bumped or maybe I hit my eye on my hand or maybe someone\u2019s elbow\u2014I don\u2019t really remember exactly, it just happened. And after that, my eye looked really red and kinda puffy, but I didn\u2019t feel much pain, just a little weird when I blink or move my eye, and it\u2019s still sort of like that now. It\u2019s hard to tell if it got worse or not \u2018cause I\u2019ve just been kinda worried about other stuff too, like my nose and all that.",
