    "input": "1. A 10-year-old male presents to the pediatric clinic with complaints of progressive vision loss and night blindness over the past year. His parents also report delayed developmental milestones and difficulty with coordination. On physical examination, he has central obesity, polydactyly on both hands, and mild intellectual impairment. Fundoscopic examination reveals retinal dystrophy consistent with rod-cone degeneration. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral cystic changes without overt dysfunction. The patient exhibits hypogonadism with micropenis and undescended testes noted on examination. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the TTC8 (BBS8) gene consistent with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 14. Multidisciplinary management is initiated, including ophthalmology, nephrology, and endocrinology follow-up.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 10-year-old boy who might be feeling overwhelmed, confused, or embarrassed about his symptoms and condition. He might struggle to articulate exactly what's wrong or understand the doctor's questions fully, so I should encourage him to share his feelings and symptoms in his own words without pressure.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been having trouble seeing stuff, especially at night, and my eyes get kinda blurry sometimes. My parents say I\u2019m a bit slower than other kids, and I feel like my body doesn\u2019t do what I expect, like I get tired easily or things feel weird in my tummy. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m here, but I don\u2019t feel right."

    "output": "Well, he seems to have a hard time seeing things close up, especially at night, and he keeps bumping into stuff. He looks tired a lot and doesn't seem very interested in playing or doing anything active like before. Sometimes he forgets things or gets confused, and I notice he's not quite himself sometimes."

    "output": "Well, I think it started a long time ago, maybe like when I was really little, I didn't notice much at first, but then recently it just kinda got worse, especially at night. It\u2019s like I can't see properly in the dark now, and everything seems blurry sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I don't think so? Like, sometimes I don't hear things right away, but I usually ask people to say it again or I just sort of guess what they said. I don't really know if it's a real problem, I guess."
