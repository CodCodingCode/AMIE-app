I\u2019ll try to keep my tone worried but cooperative.\nANSWER: Doctor, I\u2019m 29, and I\u2019m a biological female. I\u2019ve been feeling really exhausted, and I\u2019ve noticed some bruises I don\u2019t remember getting. I just feel so drained all the time, and lately I\u2019ve been feeling dizzy especially when I stand up quickly. These bruises kind of came out of nowhere, and I\u2019m really worried because they\u2019re all over my arms and legs. I also get short of breath sometimes, especially when I climb stairs or do anything active. It\u2019s been happening for about two weeks now, and I\u2019m really scared it might be something serious, maybe related to my autoimmune history or\u2014 I don\u2019t know\u2014something else.",
