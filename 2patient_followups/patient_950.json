Can you tell me, during these times, do you ever notice if your face feels weak or if you have trouble speaking? Also, do you sometimes lose awareness of what\u2019s happening around you, or feel like you're not in control of your movements? When these episodes happen, do they ever spread or involve other parts of your body? And are there any warning signs you notice before they start, like strange sensations or feelings? Lastly, have you ever experienced episodes where you suddenly can\u2019t remember parts of what happened afterward, or feel confused for a while? I want to get a clear picture to help understand exactly what\u2019s happening during these episodes.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking very detailed questions, and I feel a bit overwhelmed but also worried I might leave something out that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t want to sound crazy or make a big deal out of it, but I know I need help. I should be honest but still hesitant about revealing too much at once.\nANSWER: Uh, yeah, sometimes I feel like my face is weird or like I can\u2019t really talk right, and I get these moments where I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening around me. When it starts, I think I just feel really fuzzy, and then my body feels kinda\u2026 not really mine, you know? It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself but I don\u2019t control it.",
