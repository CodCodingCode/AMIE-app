I just want to find out what\u2019s going on so I can maybe fix it or at least know if it\u2019s something terrible. I feel like I should give details but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s important.\nANSWER: Well, the hoarseness has been there pretty much all the time since I first noticed it about a month ago, and yeah, it\u2019s gotten really bad now\u2014sounds almost like I have a cold that won\u2019t go away, but I don\u2019t. The trouble swallowing started a little after that and it\u2019s just worse now, especially with solids, and I\u2019ve been losing weight without trying, like I said. It\u2019s hard to swallow sometimes and it hurts, and I don\u2019t really notice any breathing problems or lumps, but I keep worrying it might be something really bad, like cancer.",
