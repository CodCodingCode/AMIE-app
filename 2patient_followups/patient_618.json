    "output": "THINKING: I feel like I need to explain everything clearly, even though I\u2019m a bit nervous and maybe rambling a little. I worry that I might have something serious, and I want the doctor to understand how worried my family is, especially my husband, who keeps telling me to get it checked out. I\u2019m scared, but I also want to know what\u2019s going on, especially for my family\u2019s peace of mind.\nANSWER: Well, the sore on my vulva, it\u2019s kind of gotten bigger, I think, maybe a little faster than before. The bleeding I have done is bright red, like fresh blood, and it comes and goes, but lately it\u2019s been more often and a bit more than just little spots. No fever or chills that I\u2019ve noticed, and I haven\u2019t lost any weight or anything, but I just feel worse about it all.",
