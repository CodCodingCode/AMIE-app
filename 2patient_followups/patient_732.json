Thank you for seeing me. Well, I\u2019ve been feeling a bit off lately, you know? I noticed these spots on my legs\u2014very red and purple, like bruises, but they don\u2019t seem to go away. I didn\u2019t hurt myself, I swear. And I\u2019ve been losing weight, maybe about ten pounds or so\u2014I don\u2019t quite understand why.

I haven't noticed any bleeding or dizziness, but sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up quickly.
