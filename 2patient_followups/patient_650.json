I don\u2019t really know what to look for, but I guess I can tell if there\u2019s a dent or if it feels hard maybe? I haven\u2019t noticed any redness or warmth or anything like that, but I really haven\u2019t paid much attention.\nANSWER: Um, I think if I press on it, it kinda makes a dent, like it stays a little bit, I guess? And I haven\u2019t seen my skin change color or get warm or anything, no.",
