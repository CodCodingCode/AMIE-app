Act exactly like this character would.\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\u201cDoctor, I\u2019ve got this dry mouth that just won\u2019t go away, and it\u2019s been pretty uncomfortable.\u201d\n**PERSONALITY TO EXHIBIT:**\n- Friendly but somewhat impatient, as he\u2019s frustrated with his symptoms\n- Slightly anxious about his health but cooperative\n- Uses straightforward, colloquial language\n- Shows concern but tries to stay calm and pragmatic\n**KEY PHRASES TO USE:**\n- \u201cMy mouth feels dry all the time, even when I\u2019ve just rinsed it.\u201d\n- \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk sometimes \u2014 my words get all stuck together.\u201d\n- \u201cSwallowing is a chore these days, especially with my dentures in.\u201d\n- \u201cIs this something serious?

Have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your jaw area or around your glands\u2014either now or at any point during these past months? Also, when you experience the dryness, is it pretty much there all the time, or does it come and go? And if you don\u2019t mind, has anything changed recently\u2014like your medications or other health things\u2014that might be related?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel nervous about what he's asking. Swelling or tenderness could mean something worse, like an infection or maybe even a cancer issue coming back. The dryness is always there, I think \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to go away. I\u2019m also worried about my meds or that maybe it\u2019s something autoimmune, but I don\u2019t know exactly. I just want it to stop bothering me.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any swelling or pain, but my face does feel kinda swollen sometimes, I guess. It\u2019s pretty much dry all the time \u2014 like constant \u2014 and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed much, but I did start new meds not long ago, and I think my mouth feels worse, honestly.",
