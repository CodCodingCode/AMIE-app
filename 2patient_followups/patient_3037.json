    "input": "2. A 15-year-old female is brought to the clinic by her parents due to progressive difficulty walking and frequent falls over the past 18 months. She complains of persistent foot pain and cramps, especially after physical activity, alongside a noticeable weakness in her lower legs. Her medical history is unremarkable, but her maternal uncle was diagnosed with a hereditary neuropathy. On physical exam, she exhibits high arches (pes cavus), mild foot drop, and absent ankle reflexes. Sensory testing reveals decreased vibration and proprioception in the distal lower extremities. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes with relatively preserved conduction velocities, consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the gene linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal type 2w. The patient is started on a multidisciplinary management plan including orthotic support and neuromuscular rehabilitation.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to understand what's been bothering me and why I came to the clinic. I should explain my symptoms honestly and clearly, even if I feel a little embarrassed or unsure about what I\u2019m experiencing. I need to mention the main problems with my walking, pain, and any other weird feelings I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nANSWER: I guess I just started having more trouble walking and I keep falling a lot, like I haven't been able to do things the same way anymore. My legs feel weak and sometimes I get these weird cramps or pains in my feet after I run around or play. It\u2019s been going on for a while and I\u2019m kind of worried about it."

    "output": "Um, it kind of just gradually got worse over time, I think. Like, I didn\u2019t really notice anything sudden, and I don\u2019t remember feeling numb or tingly anywhere else, but my feet started hurting more and I kept falling. My legs feel weaker too, but I haven\u2019t seen anything different with my eyes or anything... I just feel kind of off when I walk or stand for a while."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been kinda confusing because I think I\u2019ve gotten more tired and wobbly lately, especially after I run around or do a lot of walking. Some parts, like my feet, hurt more sometimes, and I get more cramps or weakness then. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse at certain times of day, but I do notice it\u2019s harder to stand or move normally than before."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes when I walk a lot or do stuff like run around, it feels worse, like my legs get more tired or shaky. But then I rest and it kind of eases up? I'm not really sure, it just feels like it goes up and down."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes when I stand or walk for a long time, I feel like I get more wobbly or weak, especially after I\u2019ve been on my feet a lot. When I sit down or bend forward, I think it feels a little better, like I can balance more? But I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s always like that."

    "output": "Um, I think my reflexes are pretty weak, yeah, like they\u2019re not really there sometimes. I don\u2019t really notice any stiffness or spasm stuff, but I do see my muscles look a bit smaller or weaker, especially in my legs. I haven\u2019t really seen any twitching or jumping or anything like that."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019m not really sure what all that means. The stuff about activity and therapy sounds okay, but I don\u2019t really get what the injections or surgery would do or when I\u2019d need that. I\u2019m kinda scared I won\u2019t get better or, I dunno, something might go wrong."
