    "output": "THINKING: I know the doctor wants to know about my contact lens habits, but honestly, I\u2019m not exactly sure how often I wore them overnight or if I swam with them in. I think I wear them most days, but maybe a few times I forgot to take them out at night? And I don\u2019t remember swimming recently, or maybe I did but I can\u2019t really say for sure. I just know I keep wearing them and now my eye hurts a lot.\nANSWER: I think I maybe slept with my contacts in a couple of nights, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly how many. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone swimming with them, but I might have worn them longer than I should sometimes.",
