    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m not entirely sure how often my eye symptoms happen; I just notice them coming and going. Sometimes, I\u2019ll be reading or on my phone and suddenly everything looks blurry or my eyes feel itchy, but other times it\u2019s fine. I guess bright lights or being outside in the sun might make it worse\u2014I just remember feeling more uncomfortable when I was at the park with my kids last weekend, and I hate using eye drops all the time, it\u2019s so annoying.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t know exactly how often, but sometimes I get redness or itching in my eyes, especially if I\u2019ve been on my phone a lot or outside. It kind of comes and goes, and I think it lasts for a bit, but I don\u2019t really keep track. Bright sunlight seems to make it worse, and I do feel more sensitive to light when it happens\u2014like everything\u2019s brighter than it should be.",
