And regarding the dull ache in your eye, how would you describe its intensity\u2014would you say it\u2019s a mild discomfort, or more of a deep, persistent pain that\u2019s hard to ignore? Understanding these details will help me get a clearer picture of how serious this might be, and how best we can support you.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I don't want to make a big deal about it, but I guess the blurry spots can be a bit annoying, especially when I try to focus. The dull ache isn\u2019t really painful, more like a constant ache that I just sort of tolerate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gotten worse recently, but I\u2019m worried about that dark spot and all the vision stuff they\u2019re saying.\nANSWER: The blurry spots don\u2019t make it impossible to do things, but they\u2019re definitely noticeable and sometimes I have to stop and blink to see better. The pain is more like a dull ache, not really sharp, and it\u2019s been there for a little while but it\u2019s not extreme, just enough to bother me.",
