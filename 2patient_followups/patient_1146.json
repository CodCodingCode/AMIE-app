    "input": "1. A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a rapidly enlarging, painful swelling of her right breast over the past six weeks. She reports the skin has become erythematous, warm, and taut, with a distinct peau d\u2019orange appearance. There is noticeable nipple retraction and the area feels heavy and tender to touch. She denies any fever or systemic symptoms but mentions a recent unintended weight loss. On physical examination, the breast is diffusely swollen without a discrete palpable mass, and palpable axillary lymphadenopathy is present. She has no prior history of breast disease or hormone replacement therapy use. Mammography reveals diffuse skin thickening and increased breast density, while ultrasound shows extensive dermal edema with underlying irregular hypoechoic areas. A skin punch biopsy and core needle biopsy of the breast tissue confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should explain her symptoms clearly but in a way that shows she's worried and confused. She might mention the rapid growth, pain, and skin changes, and express her concerns about what it might be. It\u2019s also good to include some emotional cues like feeling scared or overwhelmed.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 45, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been feeling this really strange, heavy feeling in my right breast for a few weeks now, and it\u2019s gotten worse really fast. It\u2019s painful, and the skin looks kind of red and feels tight and weird, like an orange peel or something. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening, but I just knew I had to come in because it\u2019s been so strange and uncomfortable."

    "output": "Um, no, I don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t had any falls or bumps or anything like that. It\u2019s just been getting worse, and this heaviness and redness just won\u2019t go away."

    "output": "Well, it just... I started noticing it getting bigger and more uncomfortable really quickly, and the skin there looked different, sort of tight and bumpy. It\u2019s been making everything harder to do, and I feel kind of heavy and a bit scared or overwhelmed trying to deal with it."

    "output": "No, I haven't seen any pus or the kind of thing where it looks like there's a pocket of infection. It just feels really red, warm, and heavy, and it hurts so much, but I haven't felt any like fluid or anything coming out."

The redness is there all the time, and it\u2019s pretty tender, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like a pimple or anything. It just feels heavy, you know?"

    "output": "Yeah, it feels like it's kind of changing a little, like the redness is a bit more or something. The skin still looks the same, but I just keep feeling like it's getting more tight and heavy, and the nipple still seems a little more pulled in. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if it\u2019s worse than before."
