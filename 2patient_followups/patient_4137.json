    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female was referred to neurology due to gradually worsening involuntary movements and subtle cognitive changes over 18 months. She initially noticed irregular, brief jerks in her fingers and occasional facial grimacing that progressed to more generalized chorea. Her family also reported newfound episodes of anxiety and depressed mood, which were previously absent. Neurological exam revealed choreiform movements predominantly in the upper limbs along with bradykinesia and mild dystonia. Cognitive testing demonstrated difficulties with attention and executive functioning, although memory remained relatively preserved. There was no known family history of Huntington disease, and HTT gene testing was negative. Brain imaging showed mild frontal lobe atrophy and increased T2 signal in the putamen, aligning with Huntington Disease-Like 3 features. Subsequent genetic analysis identified a mutation in the gene associated with Huntington Disease-Like 3, confirming the diagnosis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know what's been bothering me most lately. I should explain my symptoms clearly but honestly, without trying to sound like I understand too much about medical stuff. I might mention the involuntary movements and how they make me feel confused or worried.\n\nANSWER: I'm 35, and I\u2019m a woman. Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having these strange movements\u2014like twitching and stuff\u2014in my hands and face, and it\u2019s been getting worse over time. I also feel kind of off in my head, like I\u2019m having a hard time focusing, and I\u2019ve been feeling more anxious and sad than usual."

    "output": "Well, it started with just some little jerks in my fingers here and there, kind of random. Now, it\u2019s like, more all over, and I can\u2019t really control it sometimes, especially my arms and face. It makes me feel kind of worried and overwhelmed, and I guess it\u2019s hard to do everyday stuff like typing or even just sitting normally."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes in the mornings I feel really anxious, and then I notice my hands start to kind of jerk around a bit, and it\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t control it. Other times, I guess when I\u2019m more tired or stressed, it seems worse, but then later in the day, it maybe calms down a little? It\u2019s kind of all over, really."

    "output": "I guess I feel kind of overwhelmed sometimes, like I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s coming next. And I think when I get really stressed or anxious, my movements feel worse, but I\u2019m not always sure if that\u2019s true or if I\u2019m just imagining it."

    "output": "Um, I think they sort of happen randomly most of the time, like I can't really tell when they're going to come or go. Sometimes it gets worse when I'm just sitting or trying to focus on something, but then they kind of stop for a little while and then start again. It's all pretty unpredictable."

    "output": "Um, I guess when I\u2019m really stressed or tired, it seems like the movements get worse, and sometimes when I\u2019m just trying to relax, they kinda settle down a little. But honestly, I\u2019m not really sure what makes it better or worse most of the time, it just kind of happens."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes when I'm really anxious, my movements seem to get worse, like more noticeable or shaky. When I try to sit still or do something to relax, they don't always get better right away, but I feel like I\u2019m more aware of them then."
