    "input": "1. A 22-year-old male college athlete presents with recurrent episodes of numbness and weakness in his right hand, specifically after prolonged leaning on his elbow during weightlifting. He reports that these episodes resolve spontaneously within a few days but have become more frequent over the past year. Physical examination reveals mild atrophy of the hand muscles with decreased sensation over the ulnar nerve distribution. Nerve conduction studies show conduction block and focal slowing consistent with demyelination of the ulnar nerve. His father and paternal grandfather had similar transient limb weakness episodes following minor compression injuries. Genetic testing confirms a deletion in the PMP22 gene, consistent with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). He is counseled to avoid repetitive pressure on vulnerable nerves and referred to occupational therapy for protective strategies. Follow-up at six months shows fewer episodes with proper preventive measures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should explain my main issue clearly but simply. I want to describe my symptoms without overloading with medical details, and I might feel a bit embarrassed or uncertain about how to explain everything.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been having these weird feelings in my hand that come and go, mostly after I\u2019ve been lifting or leaning on it for a while. It\u2019s like it gets numb and weak, and it worries me because it\u2019s been happening more often lately."

    "output": "Um, I guess I do a lot of lifting at school and sometimes I lean on my elbows when I\u2019m studying or just hanging out. I\u2019ve noticed that if I push or rest on the same spot for a while, it gets numb or tingly, and then my hand feels weak. It\u2019s been happening more often lately, especially after those times."

    "output": "Um, it's like, out of nowhere sometimes, and then I start feeling numb or weak in my hand, especially if I\u2019ve been leaning on my elbow for a while or if I keep pressing on that part. Usually I notice it more after I finish lifting or if I\u2019ve been in the same position for a long time. Changing position helps a little, but I don\u2019t really know exactly what triggers it."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been trying not to lean on that hand too much, but it\u2019s kind of hard because I need it for stuff like lifting or writing. Sometimes, when I wake up or after I\u2019ve been sitting a while, my hand feels weird\u2014like it\u2019s a bit cold or tingly, but I don\u2019t really notice anything colored. It\u2019s more like numbness and weakness that just kinds of come and go."

Additionally, do your symptoms worsen with neck movement, such as turning your head or tilting?",
    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my neck feels a little stiff or sore, like when I\u2019ve been studying or whatever, but I haven't really noticed clear stuff going down my arm or shoulder or anything, and I\u2019m not sure if moving my head makes it worse. It just kind of happens sometimes."

    "output": "Um, it's mostly on the side of my hand, like around my pinky and the side of my ring finger, but sometimes I feel it in other parts too, kind of numb or tingly. It's hard to say exactly which ones all the time."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, sometimes when I like, hold my phone or lean on stuff with my arm, it feels kind of worse for a little while. During sleep, I think I notice something too, but I can't really tell exactly when or how much it makes it worse."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes if I change how I sleep or hold my arm, it feels like a little better for a bit, but then it happens again pretty quickly. I guess I haven't really noticed if it\u2019s worse at night or anything specific."
