    "input": "2. A 47-year-old male presents with a four-month history of progressive gait instability and occasional hand clumsiness. He reports intermittent neck discomfort, worse with extension, and numbness radiating into the left arm, particularly affecting the thumb and index finger. Family members have noticed subtle changes in his voice and occasional difficulty swallowing. Neurological examination reveals mild weakness in the intrinsic hand muscles of the left hand, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the upper and lower limbs, and a positive Hoffman\u2019s sign on the left. Sensory testing shows impaired proprioception and diminished vibration sense below C5. Cervical spine MRI demonstrates a well-circumscribed, homogeneously enhancing intradural extramedullary lesion anterior to the spinal cord at the C3-C5 levels, causing significant cord compression and signal changes indicative of myelopathy. He has no prior history of neurological disorders or trauma. After multidisciplinary evaluation, surgical excision is recommended to prevent further neurological deterioration.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms without sounding too worried or confusing. I should mention the main things that have been bothering me and how long they've been happening, but keep it simple and honest.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of off in my neck and hands for a few months now. Sometimes my balance feels a little strange, and I notice my voice isn\u2019t quite right or I have some trouble swallowing. It\u2019s all been kind of creeping up on me, and I just wanted to get it checked out."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been a bit more noticeable lately, like things have gotten worse slowly, and I feel more unsteady on my feet. Sometimes, it feels worse when I try to look up or extend my neck, and if I use my hands a lot, they get more clumsy. Maybe resting helps a little, but I\u2019m not sure if it really makes a difference."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s gotten a little harder to do some things\u2014like writing or holding things properly, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of tired more often.

    "output": "Well, I guess I started noticing that I was feeling a bit unsteady when I walk, and my hands sometimes feel clumsy, especially with things I do a lot. It\u2019s been slowly getting worse over these past few months. I\u2019ve also felt some discomfort in my neck, especially when I extend it, and sometimes I get numbness that goes down my arm and into my fingers, like maybe the thumb and index finger. My voice feels a little different sometimes, and I\u2019ve had some trouble swallowing now and then, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or not. I just feel more tired and a little worried about it all."
