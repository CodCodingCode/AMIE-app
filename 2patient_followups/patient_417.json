Can you tell me exactly how often you hear these voices each day, what they usually say, and whether they comment on your worth or make you feel more hopeless? Also, how long have you been noticing these hallucinations, and have there been particular times or situations when they seem to get worse or better? Understanding these details will help me see if your experiences fit with a diagnosable pattern of a psychotic disorder, and we'll also discuss how this is affecting your daily life and safety.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to tell him about the voices, but I\u2019m not sure how often I hear them or exactly what they say, and I keep mixing up when they started. I don\u2019t really remember if they got worse at certain times \u2014 it all feels like a blurry mess. I feel scared and confused, like I can\u2019t keep track of what\u2019s real or not.\nANSWER: Well, I think I hear them maybe every day now, but sometimes it feels like I just start hearing them without knowing when, and they say stuff about me being worthless or that nobody cares. It\u2019s like they started up last week or maybe two, but honestly, I\u2019m not really sure anymore, and they seem worse when I\u2019m alone or trying to sleep\u2026 or maybe when I\u2019m just sitting here.",
