    "output": "THINKING: Hmm, okay, so the doctor\u2019s asking about bleeding or soreness or anything like that. Well, I did notice a tiny bit of scaly stuff lately, but it\u2019s kind of hard to tell if it\u2019s bleeding or just dried skin. I guess I\u2019m also worried because I\u2019ve been so busy with my garden and the neighborhood kids still come by sometimes, asking about my roses, and I\u2019ve kind of been distracted. Anyway, I don\u2019t really want to scare myself more, but I\u2019d like to know if this is dangerous or if I should be worried about it spreading or something. I keep thinking about my friend Susan who had something similar and then found out it was melanoma, but she didn\u2019t say much about it afterwards, so I didn't really get details.\nANSWER: Well, I have noticed a little scaly part on it, like just lately, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any blood or anything. It\u2019s still kind of firm and smooth most of the time, but I saw a tiny scab or dryness and got worried, especially since it\u2019s been growing, like I said. I\u2019m not sure if I should be worried or if it\u2019s just something minor because it looks strange now, and I\u2019ve read about skin cancers, and I\u2019m sort of scared it might be serious.",
