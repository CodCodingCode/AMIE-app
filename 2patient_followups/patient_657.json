    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he\u2019s asking about the lumps and how fast they\u2019ve grown, plus systemic symptoms. Well, I remember I first saw them about two weeks ago; at first, I thought they were just some bug bites or maybe irritations from my gardening, but then they started getting bigger and more tender. I also noticed I\u2019ve been sweating at night and losing weight, which I didn\u2019t mean to, and I did have a fever last week but maybe it was just a small cold. The lumps, I think there are about three or four now, and they\u2019re different sizes\u2014some the size of a grape, others more like a walnut\u2014and they sometimes bleed and are really sore to touch.\nANSWER: Well, I first saw one of the lumps about two weeks ago, and since then, a few more have come up pretty quick, like in just a week or so, and they\u2019re tender and sometimes bleed when I touch them. I\u2019ve also been sweating a lot at night, lost some weight without doing anything special, and I\u2019ve had a low-grade fever off and on. I don\u2019t know, doctor, I\u2019m really scared it might be something serious, maybe cancer or something, because it all just came on so fast and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening to me.",
