    "input": "2. A 22-year-old individual assigned female at birth presents with concerns about infertility after one year of unprotected intercourse. The patient reports normal breast development during puberty but has noticed sparse pubic and axillary hair. Menstrual periods have never occurred, and there is no history of pelvic pain or swelling. Physical examination reveals well-formed external female genitalia with a short, blind-ending vaginal pouch. Pelvic imaging reveals absence of the uterus and ovaries, and the presence of bilateral gonads located near the inguinal canals. Laboratory tests demonstrate elevated serum testosterone levels in the male range and increased luteinizing hormone, with normal follicle-stimulating hormone. Chromosomal analysis identifies a 46,XY karyotype. These findings support a diagnosis of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS).\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling a mix of confusion and maybe some frustration or anxiety about her situation. She might not fully understand everything but just knows she's worried about not being able to have children and what this all means. Keep the response simple, vague, and honest about her feelings and concerns.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been really upset and confused about everything, especially because I\u2019ve never started my periods or anything, and I don\u2019t really know why. It\u2019s just been a lot to think about, and I wanted to sort of talk to someone about it."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kinda confused and maybe a little worried. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s wrong, but I feel different inside, and I keep thinking about why I\u2019ve never had a period or why I don\u2019t look like most people, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I think I grew okay, like, taller and stuff, but I don\u2019t really remember much about my breasts. They\u2019re kinda small or maybe not there much, and I don't really have the pubic hair I see other people have. I guess my body didn't change like I thought it would."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed any smell things or really any weird feelings about temperature or sweating. I\u2019ve always felt like I was a little smaller than some of my friends when I was a kid, but I don\u2019t remember anything really unusual. No one in my family has told me about anything like this, and I don\u2019t think anyone had similar issues, but I\u2019m not really sure."

    "output": "Um, I think they said my LH was higher than usual, and FSH was kind of normal? I don\u2019t really remember the exact numbers, but it seemed different from what I expected. And I didn\u2019t get much info about estrogen, just that it was maybe okay or normal? Honestly, I don\u2019t really get what it all means."
