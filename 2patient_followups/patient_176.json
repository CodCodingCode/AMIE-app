I keep forgetting recent conversations and where I put things around the house. Sometimes I feel disoriented, especially in unfamiliar places, and I find it hard to follow new instructions. I also notice I can't remember details from events that happened just days ago. It\u2019s been really confusing, and I keep feeling like I\u2019m losing my grip on what\u2019s happening around me.\"Can you tell me if, during these brief episodes of dizziness or visual disturbances, you experienced specific things like weakness on one side, trouble speaking, numbness, or other focal symptoms\u2014that is, symptoms that affected only part of your body or one side\u2014and how they compared to the other symptoms you\u2019ve described? Also, did these episodes come on suddenly and last only a few minutes, and did they leave you feeling back to normal afterward?\"baseline",
