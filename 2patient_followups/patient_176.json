    "output": "THINKING: I feel so scared about these hallucinations. I keep seeing shadows and sometimes I think I see people or things that aren\u2019t real. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to me, and it makes me panic more because it feels so strange and frightening. I worry it might be something terrible, like a brain problem or a very bad infection.\nANSWER: I see shadows moving, and sometimes I think I see people looking at me or talking, but I know it\u2019s not real\u2014I\u2019m sure of it, but it\u2019s so scary. The headache is like a horrible throb, and it\u2019s worse when I move my head or if I try to think. Nothing seems to make it better, and the dizziness just keeps getting worse.",
