    "input": "1. A 72-year-old female presents with sudden, painless vision loss in her right eye upon waking. She reports a new, persistent headache localized to her temples over the past two weeks and scalp tenderness when combing her hair. On examination, her right pupil is sluggishly reactive, and there is a relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundoscopy reveals a pale, swollen optic disc with peripapillary hemorrhages. She also complains of jaw claudication and general fatigue. Blood work shows an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Temporal artery biopsy confirms granulomatous inflammation consistent with giant cell arteritis. Prompt initiation of high-dose corticosteroids is planned to prevent further vision loss.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient seems quite worried and seems to be experiencing serious symptoms, but I need to be gentle and clear. I want to mention the main issues without adding confusion and show that I'm genuinely concerned and seeking help.\n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m a 72-year-old woman, and I woke up today and couldn\u2019t see out of my right eye at all. I\u2019ve had this bad headache on my temples for a couple of weeks, and it\u2019s been really sore when I try to comb my hair. I feel kind of tired and maybe a little strange overall."

    "output": "It was really sudden, like one moment I could see fine and the next thing, my right eye was just all blurry and dark. And I\u2019ve been feeling more tired and kind of achy, especially around my head and jaw, like when I chew."

    "output": "Well, the headache has kind of been there most days, and it\u2019s gotten a little worse, I think. It\u2019s right here in my temples, and sometimes it feels like a throbbing, but other times it\u2019s just a dull ache. I also notice my jaw gets tired or sore when I chew, and I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired overall. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s gotten any worse or if I\u2019ve just been paying more attention to it."
