    "input": "2. A 19-year-old female is referred to the endocrinology clinic for evaluation of delayed menarche and primary amenorrhea. She reports normal breast development and regular pubic hair growth but has never experienced menstruation. Physical examination reveals a normal external vulva with a shortened vaginal canal. Pelvic MRI demonstrates an absent uterus and upper vaginal agenesis with normal ovaries bilaterally. Hormonal assays, including estradiol, FSH, LH, and prolactin, are within normal ranges, confirming normal ovarian function. Renal ultrasound uncovers a unilateral renal agenesis on the left side. The patient denies any cyclic abdominal pain or urinary symptoms and has no significant family history of congenital anomalies. She is diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome and counseled regarding reproductive options and vaginal reconstructive approaches.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young, female, and has never gotten her period but has normal developments in other areas. She might be feeling nervous or confused about her situation, maybe embarrassed to talk about it. I need to express the main concern clearly but simply, showing she's unsure about what's wrong.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I haven't started my period, and I\u2019ve always kind of wondered why. I don\u2019t really feel any pain or anything, but it just feels strange not to have it happen. I was really worried about that and wanted to find out what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been growing normally, kind of, but I don\u2019t really know if everything\u2019s right. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m a bit different compared to my friends, but I\u2019m not sure if that matters. I\u2019ve just been a little worried about all of this, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel fine most of the time, but sometimes I wonder why I never got my period or why things look a little different down there.
