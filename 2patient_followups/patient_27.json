    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to remember when exactly this started because it seems like it was a little while ago, but maybe not right now, maybe last week or a bit earlier? Things are so mixed up in my head about when it got worse. I feel anxious and a bit overwhelmed, and I keep worrying about what might be happening behind all this. I should tell the doctor about it all but I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m saying it in the right order or if I\u2019m missing anything.\nANSWER: It\u2019s hard to say exactly when it started, but I think it was maybe last week, or maybe two weeks ago? It sort of came on gradually, and now it\u2019s just gotten worse all the time. It\u2019s most days now I think, and sometimes after I eat, I get that burning feeling pretty bad, and then I end up regurgitating sour liquid. It\u2019s also hard to swallow food sometimes, and I keep coughing at night, which won\u2019t let me sleep. Sorry, I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve lost weight or if there\u2019s blood\u2014things are all jumbled in my head.",
