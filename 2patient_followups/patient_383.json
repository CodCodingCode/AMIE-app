The voices used to come and go but now they\u2019re more constant, and I swear they\u2019re more aggressive. Sometimes I\u2019m walking around and I just feel like everyone\u2019s watching me, but I don\u2019t see anyone. It\u2019s hard to tell when I\u2019m not using, \u2018cause I\u2019ve been so messed up for days\u2014my head is just pounding, and I keep thinking about that one time my cousin said he saw stuff too, but maybe it was drugs or whatever.\nANSWER: Uh, well, I guess it\u2019s kind of the same, but it feels like it's worse now \u2019cause, like, the shadows and whispers do come even when I haven\u2019t been doing anything, or at least I think so. It\u2019s hard to keep track\u2014sometimes I\u2019m just walking around, and I notice I keep hearing stuff like people talking when no one\u2019s there, but then other times, I don\u2019t hear anything for a while, and I wonder if it\u2019s all just in my head or if it\u2019s because I, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m losing control or something.",

Sometimes, in cases like yours, symptoms can change over time, so I\u2019d like to know if they come and go or if they\u2019re persistent even when you're not using anything. Can you tell me how often you experience these hallucinations now and if they\u2019re affecting you during certain times or situations?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, this question is a bit confusing because I don\u2019t really know if the shadows and whispers are coming and going or if they\u2019re just always there now. I keep feeling like they\u2019re watching me, even when I try to ignore it, but I think yesterday I didn\u2019t see as much stuff \u2014 or maybe I just didn\u2019t notice? I get distracte, I guess, and it\u2019s like my head is just full of noise all the time, but I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s less or more sometimes, especially when I\u2019m stressed or think about my past and stuff.\nANSWER: Uh, I guess it kinda comes and goes, but sometimes I keep seeing shadows moving all around even when I don't wanna think about it. Like earlier, I saw that guy outside, and then I started hearing whispers, and now I just feel scared it might never stop \u2018cause it\u2019s always worse when I get mad or stressed about work. I mean, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the drugs or if it\u2019s just always in my head now.",
