    "output": "THINKING: She\u2019s asking if I\u2019ve noticed anything weird with my eyes, but honestly, I\u2019ve been so overwhelmed with everything else, I haven\u2019t paid attention. Still, I worry if that means something terrible is happening to me, like my eyes are failing or I\u2019m going blind or something. I don\u2019t want to miss something important, but I feel so anxious and mixed up right now.\nANSWER: No, I don\u2019t think so.
