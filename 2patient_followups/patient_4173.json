    "input": "2. An 11-year-old girl was referred to the genetics clinic for evaluation of global developmental delay and distinctive physical features. She has exhibited delayed speech and motor skills since infancy, with persistent difficulty in learning and social interaction. On examination, she has a slightly elongated face, mild ptosis, and low-set ears, accompanied by hypotonia and occasional tremors. Cognitive testing revealed moderate intellectual disability, and behavioral assessment noted episodes of anxiety and repetitive behaviors. Her mother reported a family history of intellectual disability in male relatives on her maternal side, raising suspicion for an X-linked syndrome. Brain imaging was within normal limits, and metabolic workup was unremarkable. Genetic analysis identified a pathogenic variant in the gene associated with Syndromic X-Linked Intellectual Disability Type 10. The patient is currently engaged in special education programs and receives supportive therapies including speech and physical therapy, with ongoing monitoring for potential neurological complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to be honest about how I\u2019ve been feeling, but I also don\u2019t really understand everything, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. I might feel nervous or like I don\u2019t know what to say because I\u2019ve been having some strange feelings or things happening that I can\u2019t explain. \n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just\u2026 I\u2019ve been feeling kind of different recently. Like, sometimes, I get these weird feelings in my head or my body, and I don\u2019t really know what they mean. It\u2019s been kind of confusing and I thought I should tell someone about it."
