I\u2019ve noticed that the lesions are tender when I touch them, and the swelling makes it hard to walk. I\u2019ve also had some fever and feel more tired than usual, but I thought it was just a minor infection at first. I\u2019ve been HIV-positive for several years, with my CD4 count below 200, and I know my immune system is weak. I\u2019m worried because the skin lesions are getting worse, and I\u2019m feeling more short of breath.",
