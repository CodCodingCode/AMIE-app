To help me understand better, could you tell me\u2014when you noticed these changes in your testicles and breasts\u2014how big the breasts are compared to before, and whether your testicles still feel small or different in size? Also, have you ever had any medical check-ups or blood tests about these changes? And how are these changes affecting the way you\u2019re feeling emotionally, like your mood or how confident you feel about yourself?\u201danxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I guess I should try to answer honestly, but I feel really overwhelmed and kinda scared about what this all means. I'm worried about how serious it might be and whether this is going to be permanent or if there's something they can do.\nANSWER: Um, well, the breasts, they\u2019re like, kind of noticeable now, and I think they\u2019re bigger than before. The testicles, yeah, they\u2019re definitely smaller than other guys\u2019; I can tell. I haven't really had any regular check-ups about this stuff before. It\u2019s just making me feel really bad, like I\u2019m not normal or I\u2019m sick or something bad is gonna happen to me.",
