Has anything changed when you move around or play?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, she asked if I feel wobbly or like I might fall over or if I notice anything different with my legs or eyes. I do feel really tired and sometimes my legs are like jelly when I try to stand up, but I don\u2019t know if that's because I\u2019ve been lying down a lot or maybe because I haven\u2019t eaten much. I saw my mom looking worried too and she kept saying I need to rest, but I wanna feel better so I can go back to playing, even though I hurt everywhere now and my head really hurts.\nANSWER: Um, my legs feel kinda wobbly sometimes and I feel like I might fall if I stand too long, but I don\u2019t really know why. My eyes don\u2019t feel different, but I did get short of breath when I was crying earlier. I guess my head still hurts really bad and I just want it to go away so I can go back to playing with my dolls.",
