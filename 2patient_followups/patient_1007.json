    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m honestly pretty scared and overwhelmed. I keep thinking that maybe it\u2019s something serious, like cancer or whatever my dad had, and I wonder if I\u2019m going to get worse or if they can do anything about it. I try to focus on what the doctor is asking about the lump, but my mind jumps to all sorts of things\u2014my job, family issues, my health\u2014so I might mix up the details a little.\nANSWER: Well, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how big it is, but it feels kind of like a big grape or maybe a small melon, and it\u2019s definitely firm when I touch it. It\u2019s been there a few weeks now, and it seems like it\u2019s gotten a little bigger, or maybe it\u2019s just that I notice it more now. It hurts sometimes, especially when I press on it or when I move certain ways, and I\u2019ve been having these fevers and chills with it, like I\u2019m freezing cold but sweating all over and can\u2019t shake it. Honestly, it\u2019s just all very confusing and frightening\u2014I keep thinking about what if it\u2019s something really bad?",
