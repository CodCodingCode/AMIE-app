And, with your bowel habits changing from diarrhea to constipation, how often are you experiencing these shifts? Do you feel these symptoms are getting worse over time, and have you noticed any more systemic feelings like increased tiredness or weakness that you haven't mentioned yet?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking for details about the blood and the changes in my bowel habits, but I\u2019m a bit confused about what exactly they want to know. I feel nervous and don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m exaggerating, but I also worry it could be something serious. I just want to explain what I see and feel honestly, without overthinking it too much.\nANSWER: Well, the blood is usually just a little streak on the toilet paper, but sometimes I see it in the stool itself, like red lines. The diarrhea and constipation go back and forth kind of a lot, like maybe a few times a week. It\u2019s been getting a little worse lately, I think, and I haven't really felt more tired or anything\u2014just the pressure and all.",
