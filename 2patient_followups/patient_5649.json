    "input": "2. A 5-year-old girl is referred to the neurology clinic for evaluation of progressive weakness in her legs and urinary incontinence. Her parents noticed a soft, translucent swelling on her upper back shortly after birth, which they assumed was benign until motor symptoms developed. She has difficulty climbing stairs and often trips due to lower limb weakness and spasticity. Physical examination reveals a 3 cm cystic mass over the T2-T4 vertebral levels with overlying skin dimple and subtle pigmentation. Sensory testing shows diminished light touch and temperature sensation below the upper thoracic region. Reflexes are brisk in the lower limbs, and Babinski\u2019s sign is positive bilaterally, suggesting upper motor neuron involvement. MRI imaging demonstrates a spina bifida cystica with a myelomeningocele at the upper thoracic spine, causing spinal cord compression and tethering. The child is admitted for surgical repair to decompress the spinal cord and close the defect, followed by intensive rehabilitation to optimize neurologic recovery.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, so I need to speak softly and simply. She might be scared or confused. I should describe her symptoms honestly but vaguely, showing that she feels unwell and unsure.\n\nANSWER: I don't really feel right. My legs are, like, really weak, and I trip a lot more than before. I also keep having to go to the bathroom all the time, and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Um, I guess at first I didn't notice much, but then I started tripping a lot more and I can't climb the stairs like before. Sometimes my legs feel all tingly or heavy, and I get tired easily. It\u2019s hard to do the things I used to do, and I feel kind of worried because I can't keep up with my friends."

    "output": "Um, I guess it started like a while ago, I don\u2019t really remember when, but I started tripping more and I can't climb stairs like before. Sometimes my legs feel really wobbly, and I get kind of worried because I can't move them very well sometimes. I also feel like I need to go to the bathroom a lot more, and it\u2019s hard to hold it. It\u2019s making it tough to do things I used to do, and I get tired really quickly."
