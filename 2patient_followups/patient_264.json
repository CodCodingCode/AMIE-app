    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about how quiet and weak he\u2019s been, and my husband keeps saying it\u2019s not right. I just want him to be okay, but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening or if he\u2019s getting worse. I keep thinking maybe I should have taken him to the doctor sooner, but I didn\u2019t know what to do.\nANSWER: The blue around his lips happens quite a lot, especially when he\u2019s sleeping or sometimes when I try to feed him. It seems like he gets even more tired and sometimes he doesn\u2019t breathe right after those times. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse or better than before, but I worry it\u2019s getting worse.",
