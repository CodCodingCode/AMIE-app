    "output": "THINKING: I should explain that I noticed something unusual, it\u2019s been there for a little while, and it\u2019s been making me uncomfortable, especially when I sit or walk. I want to be honest about how it\u2019s been bothering me without overcomplicating things or saying I\u2019m worried about more than it looks or feels. Keep it simple and real.\n\nANSWER: Um, I noticed a bump down there about two weeks ago, and it's been getting kind of bigger and a little tender when I sit or walk. It\u2019s just been bothering me, and I was worried I should get it checked out."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s on the outside, near the lower part of my labia, kind of towards the side? It\u2019s like a bump that sticks out a little, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s connected to anything or just sitting there. It kinda feels separate from the other parts around it."
