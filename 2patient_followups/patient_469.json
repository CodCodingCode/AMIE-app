    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to remember when I first started feeling all this, but it\u2019s all kind of a blur. I know it\u2019s been getting worse over the last few weeks, maybe longer, but the pain was less intense at first, and I just thought it was normal or I was overdoing it. Now I feel like everything changed suddenly last week, with the big swelling and the vomiting, but I can\u2019t remember exactly when or how it all started. I also don\u2019t really know if I should tell the doctor about every little thing or just the worst parts, and I\u2019m scared I might forget something important.\nANSWER: Um, I think it was maybe last month or so that I started feeling kind of bloated and had some pain in my belly, but it wasn\u2019t too bad at first. Then suddenly last week, it got much worse, and I started throwing up more and couldn\u2019t keep anything down. My stomach kind of looks bigger now, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s from the pain or what, but it just keeps getting worse, I guess. I haven\u2019t noticed blood or fever, but I feel awful all the time.",
