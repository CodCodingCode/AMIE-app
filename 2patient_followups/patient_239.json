Can you tell me more about when you first noticed her eyes become red or swollen? Did you see her develop any rashes, changes in her lips or mouth, or swelling in her hands or feet? If you're unsure about the exact time, that\u2019s okay\u2014just tell me what you remember happening and how her symptoms have changed since they first appeared.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to remember, but it\u2019s all mixed up. She didn\u2019t have anything like that before, I think, or maybe I didn\u2019t notice? It might have been around the same time she started feeling sick or maybe a little earlier, but I\u2019m not sure exactly when her eyes got red or swollen. Everything is kind of blurring together, and I just want her to feel better.\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really remember seeing her eyes get red or swollen, or any rashes or anything like that. It\u2019s all kind of jumbling together\u2014like, I think it was around the same time she started acting fussier and not eating, but I\u2019m not really sure which came first or if it\u2019s all the same?",
