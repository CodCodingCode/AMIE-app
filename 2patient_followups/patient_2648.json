    "input": "1. A 2-year-old female presents to the pediatric clinic with global developmental delay and feeding difficulties since infancy. Her parents report frequent episodes of hypoglycemia and failure to gain weight appropriately despite adequate caloric intake. On examination, she has hypotonia, inverted nipples, and mild hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests reveal abnormal transferrin isoelectric focusing patterns suggestive of a glycosylation disorder. Further genetic testing confirms a diagnosis of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Ip (CDG-Ip). The patient also demonstrates episodes of ataxia and strabismus, complicating her neurological assessment. Cardiac evaluation shows mild pericardial effusion without significant functional impairment. Supportive management including nutritional support, physical therapy, and regular metabolic monitoring is initiated to improve her overall development and quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why we're here today, so I need to explain our worries clearly but simply. I should mention the main issues that have been bothering us without overloading with technical details. I want to be honest and show we're concerned about her health and development.  \nANSWER: I'm worried because my baby girl, she's not growing or eating like she should. She's been having trouble with her muscles and sometimes she gets very sleepy or unsteady. We just want to understand what's going on and make sure she's okay."

    "output": "She's been struggling a lot with feeding, like she gets tired really easily and sometimes doesn\u2019t want to eat much, even if she's hungry before. Sleep's been a bit up and down, and she seems more fussy or makes strange movements sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal."

    "output": "Well, um, she used to move pretty almost normally, I guess? But recently, she sometimes seems less responsive, like she\u2019s just staring or not really reacting when we call her or try to get her attention. And there have been a few times where she seems really floppy and not like herself, like she\u2019s just not awake enough. I\u2019m just worried because she hasn\u2019t been her usual self, you know?"
