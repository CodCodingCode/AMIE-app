I\u2019d like to ask a few more specific questions to better understand what you're experiencing. When you notice bleeding from your nipple, how much do you typically see\u2014would you say it's a small amount, or more than that? Does the bleeding happen spontaneously, or only when you press on the lump? Also, have you noticed any changes to the skin over your breast, like redness, warmth, swelling, or dimpling? Regarding the lump itself, is it hard or tender when you touch it? Does it seem to move easily under your skin, or does it feel fixed or stuck in one place? These details will help us understand how the condition has progressed and what further steps might be needed.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really scared and worried about what this all means. I don\u2019t understand all the medical words, but I know something isn\u2019t right. I just want to know if I\u2019m going to be okay and what\u2019s going to happen next. I feel overwhelmed and a little embarrassed about how much my body has changed. I hope the doctor can help me.\nANSWER: Well, the bleeding, it\u2019s like a little more than a drop sometimes, and it just comes out without me doing anything about it. The lump feels really hard and sore, and it doesn\u2019t move when I press on it \u2014 it feels stuck. The skin looks a bit different, darker maybe, and it\u2019s swollen now, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not. I just feel so confused and scared.",
