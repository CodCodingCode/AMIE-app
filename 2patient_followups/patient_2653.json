    "input": "2. A 2-year-old girl is referred for evaluation due to failure to thrive and global developmental delay noted since infancy. Her parents also report frequent episodes of seizures and intermittent episodes of hypoglycemia. On physical examination, she has strabismus, broad nasal bridge, and pectus excavatum. Liver ultrasound reveals mild hepatomegaly without evidence of fibrosis, and laboratory tests show elevated serum transaminases along with decreased coagulation factors. Electromyography indicates mild peripheral neuropathy, and a head MRI demonstrates mild cerebral atrophy. Metabolic screening is significant for abnormal transferrin isoform patterns consistent with a type I CDG pattern. Genetic sequencing confirms a pathogenic mutation in the ALG3 gene, establishing the diagnosis of congenital disorder of glycosylation type III. The child is enrolled in a multidisciplinary care program including neurology, hepatology, and nutrition support, with ongoing monitoring of metabolic status and developmental interventions.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain what\u2019s been going on without sounding like I know too much, and I want to make sure I mention everything that\u2019s been bothering us about her, even if I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s all related. I should also express my worries and how confusing it all feels.  \nANSWER: She\u2019s been not growing like she should, and she\u2019s been having these scary episodes where she seems to get really stiff or limp. Sometimes she gets really sleepy or acts different, and we\u2019re just worried because it\u2019s all been happening for a while now."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s kind of hard to say exactly. Sometimes she just seems to get more tired or confused, especially after eating certain things, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related. She\u2019s been a little more fussy and less responsive lately, and I\u2019ve noticed she has these weird somersaults or jerks that come and go."

    "output": "I... I don't really know. Sometimes she just suddenly gets really upset or stiff, and her eyes look strange. I think she feels funny before it happens, but I\u2019m not sure what causes it. Afterward, she seems tired or like she\u2019s not herself."

    "output": "Well, she kind of gets really quiet and just stares, and sometimes her face looks a little weird, like she\u2019s not really responding. During, she might make some strange noises or twitch a bit, and she sometimes jerks her arms or legs. Afterward, she seems sleepy or confused, and it\u2019s hard to get her to wake up properly. I haven't noticed anything specific that sets it off, but they sometimes happen when she\u2019s tired or if she skips her usual snack."

    "output": "Um, we haven't done anything very recent, but I think maybe we should, uh, look into more tests or someone who knows about those things? I just want to make sure she gets better and that we understand what's going on."
