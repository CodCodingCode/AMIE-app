    "input": "2. A 15-year-old male is brought to the neurology clinic due to a three-year history of progressive gait instability and frequent stumbling. He has also developed difficulty with fine motor tasks like buttoning his shirt and handwriting, which has become increasingly illegible. His parents report that he began experiencing unsteady movements and slurred speech around age 12, without any preceding injury or illness. On examination, he demonstrates limb ataxia, dysarthria, and reduced deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, along with mild distal muscle wasting. There is no known consanguinity or family history of similar neurological conditions. Brain MRI reveals prominent cerebellar atrophy, while nerve conduction studies indicate a sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy. Genetic sequencing confirms pathogenic biallelic mutations consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Autosomal Recessive 5. Multidisciplinary management including occupational therapy and nutritional support has been recommended to address his evolving neurological deficits.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is here because he's been having these worsening movement and coordination problems for a few years. He might feel worried or upset about how things are changing, but he's probably not sure what to say exactly or how serious it is. I should keep his explanation simple and focus on what he's feeling now.\n\nANSWER: I'm 15, and I guess I just feel like I\u2019m not really as steady on my feet as I used to be. It\u2019s like I keep stumbling and I can\u2019t do some of the stuff I used to do easily, even like buttoning my shirt or writing. It\u2019s been happening for a while, and I don\u2019t really know why."

    "output": "Um, I guess I've been feeling kinda wobbly sometimes, and my hands don\u2019t work like they used to, especially when I try to do small things. My speech has sounded weird sometimes too, like I can't say words right. It\u2019s been hard to do stuff I used to do easily."

Sometimes I feel like my hands shake more when I try to do stuff like write or button my shirt, but I don\u2019t know if that counts. Oh, and I\u2019ve been more tired than usual, and my speech feels kinda off sometimes, but I didn\u2019t think it was related."
