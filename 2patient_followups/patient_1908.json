    "input": "1. A 12-year-old boy presents with a history of frequent painless injuries, including burns and cuts, that he does not seem to notice. His parents report he often walks barefoot and has delayed response to temperature changes. On examination, decreased pain perception is noted, though his touch and vibration senses remain intact. Autonomic symptoms include anhidrosis and episodes of unexplained hyperpyrexia. Family history reveals similar symptoms in a paternal uncle. Nerve conduction studies show reduced small fiber function, and genetic testing confirms a mutation in the SCN9A gene. Despite normal motor function, the child's repeated injuries have led to chronic skin ulcers and infections. Management focuses on injury prevention, wound care, and monitoring for autonomic crises.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is very young, so I want to keep my explanation simple but also hint at the main issue. He might be feeling confused or scared, so I should be gentle and not overwhelming. I need to find out what he is experiencing that makes him come to the doctor now, without assuming too much.  \nANSWER: I don't exactly know, but I keep getting hurts like I don\u2019t feel it when I get cuts or burns, and I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m hot or cold sometimes. I came because I think something's wrong, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I think I started to notice that I didn\u2019t really feel pain or when I was hot or cold, like it was all weird. Sometimes I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019ve hurt myself until it\u2019s already bad. I don\u2019t really remember feeling anything else different though."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really notice any muscle weakness or anything like that, but I guess I don\u2019t really feel the sweat happening sometimes, like I don\u2019t sweat when I should, and I\u2019ve had some weird hot flashes or feeling really hot. My dad\u2019s brother had some things like this too, but I don\u2019t exactly know what."

    "output": "Sometimes I feel really hot out of nowhere, even if everyone else isn\u2019t. Or I get dizzy when I stand up fast, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s kinda scary 'cause I don\u2019t always notice when things change."

Also, are there any other systemic symptoms such as kidney issues, skin changes, or visual disturbances that you've experienced?",
    "output": "I think I\u2019ve had it for as long as I can remember, like forever, but I don\u2019t really remember exactly when it all started. I don\u2019t notice anything else weird with my kidneys or my eyes or anything like that. Just the feeling stuff and getting burned or hurt without feeling it."
