These help me get a clearer picture of how your health has been changing.\"baseline",

I don\u2019t really keep track, but I think I have lost some weight \u2014 maybe around 10 pounds \u2014 and I\u2019ve been sweating at night and feeling cold sometimes, even when it\u2019s warm. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s important.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I have lost some weight, maybe around 10 pounds, and yeah, I do feel very tired and sick all the time. I\u2019ve been sweating a lot at night, and sometimes I get chills even when I shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if that helps, but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been.",
