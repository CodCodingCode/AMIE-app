It wasn\u2019t like this before \u2014 it used to be small and soft, but now it\u2019s really big and red, and it hurts even more. I don\u2019t remember hurting it, but I did scratch it yesterday 'cause it was really itchy, and then it started bleeding more.

I was just playing at school and then I saw it and it was smaller in the morning, but then I think it got bigger because I was running and I fell down, but I didn\u2019t hurt myself much, I don\u2019t think.
