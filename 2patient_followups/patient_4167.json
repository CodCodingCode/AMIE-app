    "input": "2. A 27-year-old female presents to psychiatry with sudden onset of visual hallucinations, vivid nightmares, and severe anxiety lasting one week. She recently began taking high doses of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis after a positive PPD test. Family members report that she has become increasingly withdrawn and paranoid, accusing them of poisoning her food. She denies any prior psychiatric history. On examination, she is alert but visibly distressed, exhibiting pressured speech and persecutory delusions. Vital signs are stable, and neurological examination is normal. Laboratory tests, including liver function and serum drug levels, are within normal limits, and a brain MRI shows no abnormalities. The clinical picture suggests a drug-induced mental disorder due to isoniazid neurotoxicity, leading to initiation of vitamin B6 supplementation and gradual withdrawal of the causative agent.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient seems distressed and confused, probably feeling overwhelmed by her symptoms. She might struggle to explain clearly, so I should encourage her gently and acknowledge her feelings without pushing for details. I need to be understanding and reassuring.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t know exactly, I\u2019ve just been feeling really weird lately, like I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t there and can't really sleep. I\u2019m just so anxious all the time and kind of paranoid \u2014 like everyone\u2019s out to get me or something."

    "output": "I\u2019ve been feeling really on edge, like I\u2019m always worried about something bad happening. My thoughts are kind of racing, and I keep seeing things that don\u2019t seem real, like shadows moving. I feel more alone and scared than usual, and I\u2019ve started to believe people around me might be poisoning my food or trying to hurt me. It\u2019s really confusing."

    "output": "It's like everywhere I go, I feel really on edge, and sometimes I see things that aren\u2019t there, like shadows or people that aren't really around. It makes me scared to be alone, and I keep thinking people are talking about me or trying to hurt me. Nothing really makes it better; in fact, I think it gets worse when I try to ignore it or when I get really worried about everything."

    "output": "Um, I think it started about a week ago, maybe a little longer, and at first it was just like, strange dreams and feeling really anxious, but now it's, uh, pretty intense. I haven't used anything else, but I did start taking this new medicine for that TB thing, and I guess it might have something to do with it? Everything feels kind of overwhelming lately."

    "output": "I started those pills\u2026 I think it was about a week ago? The ones they gave me for the TB\u2014there were a lot of them, but I can\u2019t really remember the exact doses. As for before this, no, I\u2019ve never felt like this or had anything like this happen before. It\u2019s all very strange and frightening."

    "output": "No, I haven't really talked to them about it yet. I mean, I didn't want to bother them, and I wasn't sure what to say, so I just kind of kept quiet. I guess I was hoping it would go away or maybe get better on its own."
