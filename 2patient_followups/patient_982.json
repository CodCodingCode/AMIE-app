    "output": "THINKING: I feel so worried because he feels really hot and sweaty all over, and I keep thinking maybe something serious is happening. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s normal or not, but he just doesn\u2019t seem right today, and I\u2019m scared it\u2019s worse than just being hot outside.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t actually measured his temperature with a thermometer. I just feel him, and he\u2019s so hot, especially on his forehead and his skin feels clammy, and he\u2019s been sweating a lot, even when he\u2019s just lying there. It\u2019s been like this all day and he\u2019s been fussier than usual and not acting like himself.",
