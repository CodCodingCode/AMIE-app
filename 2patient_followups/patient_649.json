    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really scared and trying to process all these sudden symptoms. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, and I keep worrying I might be dying or having a stroke. I want to tell the doctor everything clearly, but I feel overwhelmed and a bit muddled.\nANSWER: Um, well... it all just hit me really fast, this headache and the room spinning, and I guess my vision blurred all of a sudden. It wasn\u2019t gradual\u2014it just came on quickly. When my arms and legs get numb or weak, they feel like they\u2019re going in and out, but I don\u2019t know if they stay that way or if it stops. My speech, it\u2019s all garbled\u2014like I can\u2019t say the words right or understand what people are saying. And yeah, these things keep coming and going, it\u2019s not just constant.",
