Can you tell me if you're still seeing any flashes of light or tiny spots drifting in your vision, and if so, when you first noticed these? Are they constant, coming and going, or only happening at specific times? Also, do your symptoms feel worse when you look in certain directions, or when you're in bright light? Your experience can help me better understand what might be going on and how to support you.\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my vision, but honestly, I\u2019m really scared about my cancer and all these symptoms I\u2019ve got, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s all related. I don\u2019t understand eye stuff very well, and I keep thinking maybe I\u2019m going blind or something horrible. I feel overwhelmed and don\u2019t know if I should mention my other worries, but I want the doctor to understand how scared I am.\nANSWER: No, I don\u2019t see any flashes or tiny spots or anything like that. My vision\u2019s just been blurry sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s from tiredness or if it\u2019s worse when I look in certain ways. Honestly, I\u2019m just worried it\u2019s all part of something terrible happening with my body.",
