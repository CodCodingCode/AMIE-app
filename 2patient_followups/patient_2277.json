    "input": "2. A 7-year-old girl was referred to neurology for evaluation of progressive muscle weakness and visual impairment. Her parents noted she had struggled with delayed motor skills since infancy and had recently begun to experience frequent falls and difficulty with balance. Ophthalmologic assessment revealed congenital cataracts, restricted eye movements, and retinal abnormalities. On neurological examination, she exhibited hypotonia, mild limb contractures, and dysarthria. Brain MRI demonstrated hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem alongside abnormal white matter signal changes. A muscle biopsy showed abnormal glycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan, consistent with a dystroglycanopathy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous mutations in the POMT2 gene confirming Muscle Eye Brain disease. The multidisciplinary team started interventions focusing on motor rehabilitation, visual support, and seizure monitoring.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 7-year-old girl, so she may not be able to articulate complex feelings or reasons clearly. She might be feeling worried about her muscles, her eyes, or how she\u2019s been falling. I should keep her explanation simple and emphasize any recent changes or concerns she might have.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t feel right\u2026 I\u2019ve been falling more and my eyes feel weird sometimes. My arms and legs feel really tired and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Um, I think she\u2019s had problems with moving and seeing for a long time, but it\u2019s been getting worse recently. She falls more often now and seems more tired, and she struggles a lot with playing and running around like other kids."

    "output": "Well, I fall sometimes even when I try not to, and my eyes feel funny, like I can't see straight and everything is a little blurry. It\u2019s hard to do some things, and I get tired really fast."

    "output": "Um, I guess I get tired really fast when I try to do things like play or walk around, and sometimes I can\u2019t see things clearly, especially if they move a lot. I\u2019ve fallen a few times more than before, and it makes me scared to move too fast or be anywhere with lots of people. I feel kind of tired and worried a lot."

    "output": "Well, sometimes her eyes seem to get a bit more flickery, and she does get tired really easily, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she\u2019s just tired or something else. She hasn\u2019t really said she lost her vision suddenly or anything like that, and she doesn\u2019t complain about being numb or weak in her arms or legs, as far as I know. No headaches or fevers that I\u2019ve noticed, and no one in the family has anything like that, at least not that I know of."
