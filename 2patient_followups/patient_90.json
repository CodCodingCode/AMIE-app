Also, has the amount of pus increased\u2014are you seeing more than before or a different color? When you feel the warmth or touch the area, does it feel very warm or just a little warm?

    "output": "THINKING: Oh my gosh, I hope I\u2019m giving the right details, but I\u2019m really worried because it feels worse and worse, and I don\u2019t want it to be something deadly. I keep thinking what if it\u2019s an infection that can get worse so fast, and I just want to know if I need urgent help or if I can wait or take something to feel better.\nANSWER: Well, I do see some redness around my incision, and it\u2019s kind of a bigger spot now\u2014maybe like a few inches? And there\u2019s some pus that\u2019s been increasing, kind of thick and yellowish. When I touch it, it feels really warm, like a hot spot on my skin. My fever and chills keep coming and going all day, and I just feel terrible, like I might faint or something bad is going to happen.",
