I mainly see a lot of blood when I go, and it can be a lot or just a little, I guess. I don\u2019t really pay attention to if it\u2019s different from before. I guess I just want to know if all this is really bad.\nANSWER: Umm, yeah, I do sometimes wake up feeling kind of sweaty and more tired than usual. As for the blood, it\u2019s pretty much with every bathroom visit lately, and sometimes it\u2019s a lot, other times just a little. I haven\u2019t really noticed if it\u2019s changed much, but it\u2019s been like this for a while now.",
