    "input": "1. A 9-month-old male infant was brought to the pediatric clinic due to frequent episodes of tonic-clonic seizures starting at 4 months of age, despite being on standard antiepileptic medications. The seizures were characterized by a sudden stiffening of the body followed by jerking movements lasting 1-2 minutes. Developmentally, he exhibited delayed motor milestones, including poor head control and inability to sit unsupported. Family history was unremarkable for epilepsy or metabolic disorders. Physical examination revealed hypotonia and minimal visual tracking. Initial metabolic work-up, including serum and CSF folate levels, showed low CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the ALDH7A1 gene associated with folinic acid-responsive seizures. Upon initiation of high-dose folinic acid therapy, the seizures and developmental progress improved significantly over the following months.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to tell the doctor what's been going on, but I'm still worried and not sure what to say. I want to explain that my little boy has been having these strange spells and that sometimes he's not as active as he used to be. I hope the doctor can help us figure out what's wrong.\n\nANSWER: I'm here because my baby, he's nine months old, and he's been having these episodes where he kind of stiffens up really suddenly and then jerks around. It happens pretty often, and I\u2019m worried because he\u2019s not reaching some of his milestones and seems a little weaker than before. I just want to make sure he\u2019s okay."

    "output": "Sometimes he suddenly stiffens up really hard, kinda like he's stuck or fighting his own body, and then he jerks a little. It happens pretty quick, but it's happened a lot, and I worry because he doesn\u2019t seem to act like himself afterward, kind of tired or out of it. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s affecting him long-term, but I just feel worried all the time."

    "output": "Um, well, he suddenly gets super stiff, like, his whole body, and then he jerks around really quick\u2014I think for about maybe a minute or two? Sometimes he makes small noises or sounds during it, but I\u2019m not sure if I remember right. After it stops, he often looks kind of dazed or just tired and doesn\u2019t really respond the same for a little while."

    "output": "Um, I don't really know if it happens more at certain times or because of anything I do. Sometimes, I just start stiffening up, and I can't stop it, I think. I haven't seen anything specific that triggers it or helps to make it stop."

    "output": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure if anything specific causes it or if it happens more at certain times. Sometimes it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I don\u2019t see any warning signs before. It\u2019s really upsetting to watch."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t heard of anyone else in the family having seizures or having neurological issues or anything like that. It\u2019s all kind of confusing for us."

For example, do they seem to go \"blank\" or appear unresponsive?",
    "output": "Sometimes he just kind of stares and doesn\u2019t really react to us, like he\u2019s not paying attention, but other times he\u2019s stiff and jerking, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s aware of anything at all during that. It\u2019s really confusing to tell."

    "output": "Sometimes he looks kind of sleepy or just not really awake right after, and I think he might be a little different than before the seizures, but I'm not exactly sure what \"not fully responsive\" means. He sometimes makes odd movements or seems kind of out of it for a bit."

I haven\u2019t seen him do anything specific before the seizures, but I\u2019m worried I might not notice if something is different."
