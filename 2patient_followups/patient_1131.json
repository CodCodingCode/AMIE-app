    "input": "2. A 10-year-old girl is referred to a developmental pediatrician due to learning challenges and social anxiety. She struggles with attention deficits, frequent mood swings, and tactile defensiveness during daily activities. Physical examination shows mildly elongated facial features, large ears, and a high-arched palate, though macroorchidism is absent due to her gender. Her verbal skills are below age expectations, and she avoids eye contact, often showing repetitive rocking movements when stressed. The patient\u2019s early motor milestones were slightly delayed, and she has difficulty with flexible thinking and adapting to changes in routine. Her mother reports that a maternal cousin has been diagnosed with Fragile X syndrome, prompting genetic evaluation. Molecular testing identifies a full mutation in the FMR1 gene, confirming the diagnosis. The care team initiates an individualized education plan and recommends occupational therapy alongside counseling to support social skills and anxiety management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, so I should keep my tone gentle and simple. She might feel nervous or unsure, so I need to be patient and reassure her without expecting clear explanations. I should focus on listening to her feelings and what she\u2019s experiencing, not trying to diagnose anything right now.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019ve been having a hard time at school and I don\u2019t like talking to people. Sometimes I get really upset or I feel like I can\u2019t do things right. My mom said I should come in today."

    "output": "Um, I dunno, I guess I feel okay sometimes, but other times I get really upset or keep doing the same things over and over. My day\u2019s kind of the same, I go to school, but I don\u2019t like when things change. I usually sit by myself and rock a lot, and I don\u2019t like when people get too close or touch me. It\u2019s kind of bumpy inside my head sometimes."

    "output": "I think I do the rocking and stuff because it somehow makes me feel a little less nervous or overwhelmed, but I'm not really sure if it's because I want to or if I just like how it feels."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I, I guess I like to rock sometimes, and I can, um, hum that same tune over and over. But I don\u2019t always do it, only if I feel kind of weird or if everything\u2019s just too loud or different. It kind of helps, I think."
