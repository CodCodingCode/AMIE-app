Have you noticed if your symptoms, like the burning or discomfort, happen mainly around your periods, or do they also appear on days when you're not having your period? Additionally, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, unintentional weight loss, or gastrointestinal changes like diarrhea or constipation, that worry you or might suggest something else going on?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about when my pain is worse and if there are other symptoms like fever or weight loss, which makes me a bit nervous. I\u2019m not sure if my pain follows my cycle exactly or if it\u2019s there all the time, and I don\u2019t really know about other weird stuff happening, but I do feel worried. I just want to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\nANSWER: Honestly, the pain is pretty much there all the time now, but it does get worse around my period. I haven\u2019t noticed any fever or weight loss really, but my stomach\u2019s been a little weird sometimes\u2014like I go, I don\u2019t know, more often than usual or I get constipated. I guess I just feel like something\u2019s really off.",
