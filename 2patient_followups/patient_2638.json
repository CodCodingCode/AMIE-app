    "input": "1. A 3-year-old female toddler is brought to the pediatric neurology clinic by her parents due to progressive developmental delay and generalized hypotonia noted since infancy. She has frequent episodes of failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and chronic diarrhea. Physical examination reveals dysmorphic features including a thin upper lip, high-arched palate, and inverted nipples. Laboratory tests show elevated transaminases and hypoglycemia with persistent lactic acidosis. Brain MRI demonstrates cerebellar atrophy and delayed myelination. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the COG1 gene, consistent with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Iu. The child also experiences frequent respiratory infections and exhibits mild coagulopathy. Supportive management is initiated, focusing on nutritional support, physical therapy, and monitoring for multisystem involvement.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to express that I'm worried about her overall condition and how she's been feeling lately, but I don\u2019t really have the words to explain everything clearly. I should mention her recent behaviors and concerns to make sure the doctor understands she's not doing well.  \nANSWER: Well, she's been not eating well again, and she seems all tired and floppy more than usual. Sometimes she gets sick more often and just isn\u2019t her happy self, I guess. We\u2019re really worried because it's been like this for a while now."
