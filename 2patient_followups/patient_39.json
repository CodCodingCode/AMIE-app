    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little nervous answering this, but I guess I can try. I haven\u2019t fallen recently, but I do worry about falling, especially in the cluttered hallways. I do feel safer in certain rooms, like my bedroom\u2014I keep that more organized than the rest of the house.

I haven\u2019t fallen lately, but I do worry I might, especially if I trip over something.
