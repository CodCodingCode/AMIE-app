To make sure I understand fully, can you tell me if you've experienced any pain or discomfort during or after your bowel movements, especially near that lump? Also, are you noticing bleeding happening every time you go, or only sometimes? And beyond the lump and bleeding, have you noticed any other symptoms like a feeling of incomplete evacuation, discharge, or any other changes\u2014like weight loss, night sweats, or feeling unusually tired? This way, I can better understand what might be going on and help you with the next steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain clearly, but honestly, I\u2019m a bit distracted trying to remember everything. I also want to make sure I sound serious enough without overreacting. Maybe I should include some extra details about my stress at work or something from my family history that might be related, even if I don\u2019t think it is.\nANSWER: Well, um, I haven't really felt pain exactly, but I do feel this fullness or pressure, especially after I go and stuff. And, about the bleeding, yes, it\u2019s happening almost every time now, not just sometimes. Oh, and I also noticed, like, a lump at my opening sometimes and it\u2019s itchy and irritated around there, which I think is what\u2019s bothering me more. My sister had something similar once, but she never really talked about it much, and she was afraid it was something serious too. I guess I just want to know if I should be worried about it being, I don\u2019t know, maybe cancer or something, because I\u2019ve been feeling pretty stressed lately with work and my kids, and I just want it gone.",
