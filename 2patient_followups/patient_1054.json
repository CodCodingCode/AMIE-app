Have you noticed any other sensations in your legs\u2014like tingling, pins-and-needles, or feelings of warmth or cold\u2014that come and go? Even very mild sensations are important for us to understand. Also, have you experienced any changes in your ability to control your bladder or urination, like feeling urgency or having leakage, even if you weren\u2019t fully aware of it? And, overall, since your symptoms started, have your weakness or any sensations in your legs improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse?\"worried_family_involved",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm feeling really scared and a bit overwhelmed. I want to explain clearly but also worry I might not have all the right words. My daughter is always telling me to get checked out if anything feels off, so I guess I came because I\u2019m worried about the weakness and pain. I wonder if this will hurt my ability to take care of myself or my grandkids soon.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t remember feeling anything like tingling or warm or cold feelings before, but the pain was so sudden and sharp, right in my lower back. And now, my legs just feel floppy and so weak, I can't seem to move them well. I haven\u2019t really noticed if I\u2019ve lost control of my bladder or anything, but I do feel like my legs are numb and they\u2019re not doing what I want them to do. I\u2019m worried it might be getting worse.",
