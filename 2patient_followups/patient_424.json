    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to talk about my drinking, but I guess it\u2019s still occasional, maybe like a couple of drinks now and then. I haven\u2019t really been able to keep track because I\u2019ve been so worried about my stomach. I haven't noticed any yellowing or my skin looking different, but I lost some weight and I feel more tired. I do worry it\u2019s something serious, especially with all these new symptoms.\nANSWER: Well, I still have some drinks now and then, maybe a couple of times a week, but I don\u2019t drink a lot like I used to. I haven\u2019t seen any yellow in my skin or eyes, and I\u2019ve lost about 10 pounds without trying \u2014 I just don\u2019t feel like eating much. I\u2019ve been really tired and scared about all this.",
