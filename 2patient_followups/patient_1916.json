    "input": "1. A 32-year-old woman presents with progressive difficulty swallowing and chronic diarrhea over the past year. She reports significant weight loss and persistent fatigue that has worsened despite adequate nutrition. Neurological examination reveals ophthalmoplegia and mild peripheral neuropathy with diminished reflexes in the lower limbs. Past medical history is notable for mild cerebellar ataxia diagnosed two years ago. Laboratory studies show elevated serum lactate and alanine levels, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Imaging reveals leukoencephalopathy and diffuse atrophy in the cerebral white matter. Gastrointestinal motility studies indicate marked slow transit consistent with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Genetic testing confirms mutations in the TYMP gene, confirming a diagnosis of Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalopathy Disease.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I came in today, so I should explain my recent issues, but I might feel a bit overwhelmed or embarrassed about all the symptoms. I need to keep it simple and focus on the main things bothering me now.\n\nANSWER: I am 32, and I am a woman. Lately, I\u2019ve been having a really hard time swallowing and my stomach doesn\u2019t feel right\u2014like I can\u2019t move things through. I just feel more tired and weak than usual, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s been bothering me a lot."

    "output": "Um, it's been really hard, honestly. I get stuck sometimes when I try to eat or drink, and it feels worse if I try to do too much at once. I haven't really noticed anything that makes it better, but it just makes me tired and frustrated all the time."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really get chest pain or anything like that, but sometimes I feel like my throat is just... weird, like it's hard to say certain words or I get kind of hoarse for no reason. And I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more tired and everything is kinda worse than before, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Honestly, most days I feel pretty tired and it\u2019s hard to do much without feeling worse afterward. Some mornings are a little better, but then later my throat feels strange when I try to swallow, and I get tired more easily. I don\u2019t really notice a clear pattern, but sometimes if I rest a lot, I don\u2019t feel as bad."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, I think I sometimes have trouble keeping my eyes open, like they feel heavy or lazy, especially when I\u2019m tired. As for the tingling and the vision, it sort of seems to come and go, not always the same, and it\u2019s gotten worse slowly over time."
