    "input": "1. A 16-year-old phenotypic male was referred to endocrinology for evaluation of delayed puberty and gynecomastia. Despite having normally developed male external genitalia, he reported absence of facial hair and lack of voice deepening since early adolescence. His past medical history was unremarkable, and there were no signs of Mullerian structures on pelvic ultrasound. Genetic analysis revealed a 46,XX karyotype with SRY gene translocation, consistent with 46,XX Sex Reversal 1. Hormonal studies demonstrated elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) with low testosterone levels. He exhibited small testes on physical exam, and his height was within normal limits for age. Gonadal biopsy confirmed testicular tissue without evidence of malignancy. The patient was counseled regarding fertility potential and started on testosterone replacement therapy to induce secondary male characteristics.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain things clearly but also honestly without sounding like I know too much. I should mention my feelings and the main reasons I came, just to tell the doctor what's been bothering me without going into too many details.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 16, and I guess I just feel kind of confused and a little worried. I haven\u2019t really started some of the usual things guys do, like growing facial hair or having my voice change, and I don\u2019t know why. My chest even feels kind of weird sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kinda different sometimes, like I\u2019m not really sure how I\u2019m supposed to feel. Sometimes I get worried about stuff and I don\u2019t really know why, and it\u2019s hard to ignore it. It\u2019s maybe messing with how I go about my day or how I think about things."

    "output": "I don\u2019t know, I guess I feel kind of weird sometimes. Like, I don\u2019t really see much change in my body, and I don\u2019t have the voice deepening or facial hair like some guys do. It kind of makes me feel like I\u2019m not really normal, and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s been bothering me because I feel different from my friends, and I get a little scared sometimes because I don\u2019t really understand why."

Also, have you experienced any issues with your sense of smell, or noticed any differences in your height or growth patterns compared to your peers?",
    "output": "Um, I guess I haven\u2019t really noticed much facial hair or a deep voice... and my testes are a little smaller than I thought they\u2019d be. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t have as much body hair or stuff like some of my friends. My height\u2019s okay, I think, but I\u2019m not sure if I grew the same or as fast as others. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything with my sense of smell."

Also, does he identify as male solely based on external genitalia and gender identity, or are there any concerns or differences in gender development?",
    "output": "No, I haven\u2019t done any genetic testing myself, I don\u2019t think. I just see myself as a guy, and that\u2019s how I feel most of the time. Sometimes I get confused or think about stuff that doesn\u2019t quite match up, but I do consider myself male."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had all those tests recently. I mean, I remember they checked some hormones before, but I\u2019m not really sure about the exact numbers. I guess maybe they should check my testosterone and those other things again? I\u2019m kind of worried about what they\u2019ll find."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don't really know what to expect or if I want to start right now. I kind of feel a little nervous about it, and I want to think about it more before making a decision."
