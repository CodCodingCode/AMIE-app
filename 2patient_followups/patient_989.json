Everything's been so strange lately\u2014I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight, but I\u2019m still always hungry. My hands won\u2019t stop trembling, especially when I try to hold something, and I just can\u2019t sleep no matter what I do. I keep feeling so exhausted but restlessness won\u2019t let me relax. I guess I came because I\u2019m really scared there is something serious going on\u2014like maybe a tumor or something with my thyroid.",
