    "output": "THINKING: Okay, the doctor is asking about my eye now\u2014well, honestly, I\u2019m a bit caught up in my chest and belly pain and that weird pulsating thing. But I do remember my uncle had some eye issues once, and he had that feeling of light sensitivity, like stuff blinding him even when it wasn\u2019t bright outside. I haven't noticed anything really yellow or sticky or any discharge, but I did notice sometimes when I blink, it feels like there's a little scratch or something, and my vision gets a bit blurry if I look at something for a while, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related or just my glasses acting up.\nANSWER: Uh, yeah, I guess my eye\u2019s been kind of sensitive to light sometimes\u2014like if I go outside or turn on the bright kitchen light, it feels, I don\u2019t know, sharper than usual. No thick or yellow discharge or anything like that, but I did notice once or twice that my eye looked a little red, and it\u2019s been kind of blurry now and then, especially when I\u2019m reading or looking at the TV for too long, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hurting or anything.",
