    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female accountant presents with a six-week history of persistent dizziness and intermittent headaches localized to the occipital region. She has also developed progressive hoarseness and difficulty swallowing, accompanied by subtle weakness on her right side. Family members have noticed her speech becoming slightly nasal and uncoordinated hand movements, particularly when writing. On examination, there is nystagmus, diminished gag reflex, and mild right-sided hemiparesis. Brain MRI reveals a heterogeneously enhancing lesion centered in the pontine region of the brainstem, with mild surrounding edema and compression of the fourth ventricle. Lumbar puncture shows no malignant cells, but CSF protein is elevated. A stereotactic biopsy confirms the presence of a low-grade ependymoma arising from the brainstem. The patient is being evaluated for maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to optimize local control.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be confused about her symptoms and is probably worried about her health. She could be hesitant to fully explain or might try to downplay how serious her symptoms feel. She\u2019s likely overwhelmed and uncertain about what is happening to her.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m not really sure how to explain it. I\u2019ve just been feeling all dizzy and weird for weeks, and then I started having these headaches and, um, trouble swallowing and talking properly. It\u2019s all kind of scary and hard to describe, and I just wanted to see if you might know what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, well, it's been really hard to do things like I used to, especially with my balance and sometimes swallowing feels weird. I\u2019ve noticed that my voice sounds different, and I get tired more easily now, even just sitting and working. Sometimes I feel more off than usual, like my words don\u2019t come out right, and I\u2019m feeling kind of anxious about it all."

    "output": "Well, I think it started a few weeks ago, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly when. It feels pretty much the same most of the time, but sometimes it feels a little worse, especially when I\u2019m trying to do things like talk or write. I can\u2019t really tell what makes it better or worse, it just kind of is how it is."

    "output": "Um, I guess my vision sometimes gets a little blurry, especially when I look to the side. And my hearing feels a bit different, like I hear muffled sounds now and then. I haven\u2019t been really sleepy or anything different consciousness-wise, but everything feels kinda off sometimes."

    "output": "Um, yes, actually, I think I\u2019ve felt a little strange in my arms and maybe my face? Like, numb or tingly sometimes, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s always the same or if it\u2019s in the same places. It\u2019s kind of confusing."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I do feel kind of weak sometimes, but it\u2019s not like I suddenly pass out or anything. And I haven\u2019t really had any blackouts that I remember. It\u2019s mostly just the dizziness and stuff that\u2019s been going on."

    "output": "Um, I think my speech is a bit muffled sometimes, like I sound funny, and swallowing feels weird, like some things go down okay but others get stuck or feel strange. It's not always the same \u2014 sometimes better, sometimes worse."
