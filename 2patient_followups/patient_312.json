I feel a bit embarrassed and unsure about how much detail I should give but realize I need to be honest if I want help.\nANSWER: Well, the vomit\u2019s mostly stomach acid, like a bitter stuff, and I haven't seen blood or anything like that.

No fevers or chills that I\u2019ve noticed, but I do feel pretty weak and dehydrated sometimes.",
