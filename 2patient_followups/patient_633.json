I\u2019d like to ask a few more specific questions to better understand what\u2019s going on\u2014have you noticed any redness, warmth, or changes in the skin over the lumps? Do you feel any pain or numbness around the area or anywhere else? Also, have you noticed any difficulties with swallowing, breathing, or any new weakness? Understanding these details can help us figure out whether these lumps might be related to things like infections, benign conditions, or something more serious. Are you comfortable sharing if you\u2019ve seen or felt anything like that?\"baseline",

I feel a bit overwhelmed and worried, trying to remember if I\u2019ve noticed anything else but might be forgetting or not understanding what\u2019s important.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t seen any redness or warmth, and the lumps don\u2019t hurt or anything. I do feel kind of stuffy, and I guess I\u2019ve been having a little trouble swallowing sometimes, but everything else feels the same.",
