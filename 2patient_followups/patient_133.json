It started a few weeks ago, but it\u2019s gotten a lot worse lately. I see double or ghost images all the time, and bright lights are just terrible.

To help me understand better, can you tell me if your vision has become blurry or distorted in particular situations, and whether you've experienced any pain, redness, or sensitivity in your eye? Also, how quickly have these symptoms changed recently \u2014 do they seem to have gotten worse suddenly or gradually over time?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so the doctor is asking about how my vision is and if there\u2019s any pain or redness or if it just suddenly got worse. I guess I should focus on how strange it looks and how everything\u2019s been kind of blurry and ghostly lately, but I also keep thinking about my mom\u2019s eye problems and how she said her sight changed over time. I\u2019m really nervous I might be losing my sight completely, but I also want to tell the whole story because it all feels connected somehow.\nANSWER: Well, yeah, the vision definitely feels weird, like everything\u2019s all blurry and sometimes I see double or ghost images, especially when I\u2019m trying to focus. And my eye\u2019s kind of sensitive to light, like it hurts when I look at bright things, but there\u2019s no real pain deep in my eye, just this weird glare. It\u2019s been getting worse pretty fast \u2014 I mean, over just a few weeks, it\u2019s like everything is more broken up and I can\u2019t hardly read anything now.",
