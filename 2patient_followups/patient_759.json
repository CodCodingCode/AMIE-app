    "input": "2. A 14-year-old female is referred to a multidisciplinary clinic for evaluation of poor school performance and difficulty seeing in dim light. Her mother reports that she has had extra digits on her feet since birth, and her stature is shorter than her peers. Physical examination notes central obesity and postaxial polydactyly on the left foot, along with subtle facial dysmorphism. Visual field testing shows significant peripheral constriction, and ophthalmologic assessment reveals signs of retinitis pigmentosa. Cognitive testing indicates mild intellectual disability, and gait analysis demonstrates ataxia. Renal function tests reveal borderline elevated creatinine, prompting renal ultrasonography which identifies cystic changes in both kidneys. Endocrine evaluation is unremarkable, but there is evidence of mild insulin resistance. Genetic analysis subsequently identifies a pathogenic variant in the BBS15 gene, confirming Bardet-Biedl Syndrome type 15.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and probably feels overwhelmed or nervous about talking about her symptoms, so I should encourage her to share what\u2019s been bothering her without making her feel pressured or judged. I need to keep her comfortable and listen carefully to her description of things she\u2019s experiencing.  \nANSWER: Um, I'm 14 and a girl. I guess I just feel like things are really hard, especially with school and stuff. Sometimes I can\u2019t see well in the dark, and I\u2019ve always had extra toes, but I don\u2019t really understand all of this. It just all feels... strange and kind of scary."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know... sometimes I feel kind of tired, and I have trouble keeping my balance, especially if I stand for a long time. I guess I feel a little off, like I stumble a lot, and I don\u2019t have much energy most days. It\u2019s kind of confusing 'cause I don\u2019t really know what's going on with me."

    "output": "I guess I feel kind of tired a lot, and sometimes everything looks weird or like blurry, especially in dim lights. It\u2019s hard to keep up with school and stuff, and I sometimes feel really upset or frustrated because I can't do things like other kids."

Additionally, has she experienced any other developmental delays, scoliosis, or cardiac issues?",
    "output": "Umm, I don\u2019t really know if anyone else in my family has stuff like my feet or vision or anything. My mom says my sister doesn\u2019t seem to have the same things, but I guess I haven\u2019t really asked much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had scoliosis or heart stuff, but sometimes I feel kinda off or tired, and I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve ever been told about delays or anything like that."

Also, at what age did she achieve her developmental milestones such as walking, talking, and her motor skills?",
    "output": "Um, I don't really remember having any seizures or like, if I ever felt really weak or numb anywhere. Sometimes I get shaky, but I think that's just when I'm tired or something. I started walking when I was about two, I guess, but I don't know if that was late or normal. My speech was okay, I think, but I do struggle a bit with some movements and keeping steady now."
