    "output": "THINKING: I feel pretty overwhelmed and worried, but I don\u2019t really want to make a big deal out of it. Maybe I\u2019ve been more tired than usual, but I try to handle pain and discomfort \u2014 it\u2019s probably nothing serious. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting, but I know I can\u2019t just ignore how bad I feel now.\nANSWER: Well, I think the pain\u2019s been the same, maybe a little worse yesterday, but I\u2019ve had this tiredness for about a week and it\u2019s just been getting harder to handle. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had fever or chills or anything like that, and my urine is darker sometimes, I guess, but I haven\u2019t looked too close. I mostly feel more worried now because it feels worse and I don\u2019t want to risk anything with the baby.",
