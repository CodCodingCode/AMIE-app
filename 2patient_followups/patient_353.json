    "output": "THINKING: I want to answer honestly, but I don't want to freak out or make a big deal out of it. I\u2019m pretty used to handling pain and don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the worst shape, but I guess I should mention the dizziness just in case. Still, I don\u2019t want to look like I\u2019m overreacting either.\nANSWER: Yeah, I do feel a little more dizzy, especially when I stand up quick, and my lips seem kind of dry, I guess. But I don\u2019t really feel confused or anything, and I haven\u2019t really checked if I\u2019m extra thirsty or anything.",
