It healed okay, but over the past year, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s been getting worse.\"\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \"The pain is mostly a dull ache, but sometimes I feel a sharp twinge. The swelling isn\u2019t huge, but I can feel it around the joint.\"\n- \"I\u2019ve tried resting it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help much. I sometimes take over-the-counter pain medicine, but it only takes the edge off.\"\n- \"I don\u2019t have any other joint pains, just the wrist.\"\n- \"My wrist gets stiff\"Based on what you've told me about your eye feeling kind of weird, with some discomfort after playing soccer, I\u2019d like to understand more about what you're experiencing right now\u2014do you notice any redness, discharge, or any worsening of symptoms when you blink or move your eye? Also, how comfortable do you feel about your eye now, and do you have any specific worries about what might be going on or how serious it could be?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm really worried this could be something serious, maybe an infection or even something worse like a tumor or nerve problem. I don't understand eye stuff very well, and that discomfort after playing soccer just makes me think it\u2019s all getting worse or something terrible is happening. I feel anxious and want to get it checked out, but also a little embarrassed about how worried I am.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t see any redness or discharge right now, but my eye still feels kind of weird, and it gets uncomfortable after I play soccer. Sometimes it hurts when I blink or move my eye, and I\u2019m just scared it\u2019s something bad or more serious than I realize.",
