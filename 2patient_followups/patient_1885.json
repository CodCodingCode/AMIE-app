    "input": "1. A 22-year-old female college student complains of recurrent episodes of muscle stiffness and cramping during her morning jogs, typically within the first 5 minutes of running. She describes the cramps as painful and accompanied by rapid fatigue that forces her to stop exercise early. She also notes feeling muscle weakness and occasional swelling in her calves after exertion, with no associated joint pain or systemic symptoms. On examination, her muscle tone appears normal at rest, but mild tenderness is elicited in the gastrocnemius muscles after exertion. Laboratory work reveals elevated resting creatine kinase levels, which rise significantly following exercise, along with transient myoglobinuria after prolonged activity. A non-ischemic forearm exercise test shows a failure to increase lactate levels post-exercise, while ammonia levels rise appropriately. Muscle biopsy demonstrates subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation with reduced activity of muscle glycogen phosphorylase. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation in the PYGM gene, confirming the diagnosis of Glycogen Storage Disease V (McArdle disease).\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep it simple and honest, describing my main symptoms without overexplaining. I want to sound like I\u2019m genuinely worried but not trying to show off any medical knowledge.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 22-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve been having these really painful cramps in my calves when I go for my morning jogs. It\u2019s like, just a few minutes into running, and then I feel super tired and weak, like I can\u2019t keep going. It\u2019s pretty confusing, and I\u2019m just not sure what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I usually wake up and go for a run in the mornings like I\u2019ve been doing for a while. Sometimes I don\u2019t really think about what I eat or drink before, I just start jogging. I guess I drink water most days, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m drinking enough. And I\u2019ve noticed that I feel really tired and sometimes get these weird cramps, especially early on, and my legs feel kind of heavy. It\u2019s kind of scary because it\u2019s never like this before, and I don\u2019t really know why I feel so weak or why my muscles hurt."

    "output": "Um, yeah, when I have those cramps, it kind of makes my legs feel really heavy and tired, like I just can't keep going. Sometimes it\u2019s worse in the mornings, and I feel more sluggish than usual, even after I wake up. I haven\u2019t really had any big changes in my sleep, but I guess I just feel more tired overall, like I just don\u2019t have much energy, even for simple stuff."

    "output": "Um, during my runs, my legs start feeling really stiff and painful pretty quickly, like they tighten up and I just can't go on, and then I get super tired really fast. After I stop, they often feel weak and sometimes swollen, especially in my calves. It\u2019s been kind of a pattern lately, and I don't know, I just feel like something's not quite right with how my muscles react, especially in the mornings."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really think about it much when I\u2019m running.

    "output": "Um, I usually try to drink some water before I go, and I'll have a little sports drink if I'm planning to run longer, but sometimes I forget or I don't really think about it. I feel like when I don\u2019t hydrate well, the cramps and weakness seem. I don't know, like worse or more intense, especially if I\u2019ve gone a while without drinking much."
