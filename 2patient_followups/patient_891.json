Lastly, is there anything else you\u2019ve noticed that worries you about these symptoms or how they\u2019re affecting you day to day?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking for more details, which makes me feel a little overwhelmed because I don\u2019t really keep track of all that stuff in a precise way. I just know the nosebleeds last a long time and the spots and bruises are just... there. I guess I should try to tell the truth about how often and how long the bleeding is, but I\u2019m not sure I remember. I also worry about how this has suddenly gotten worse and if I should be worried or go somewhere right now.\nANSWER: The nosebleeds last a long time, usually more than an hour, and I can\u2019t get them to stop sometimes. The red spots and bruises pop up suddenly, and I don\u2019t really feel dizzy or tired after, but I\u2019m just worried about how fast it\u2019s gotten worse and what it might mean.",
