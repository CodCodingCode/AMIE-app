I want to understand better how often this actually happens throughout your day\u2014would you say it's nearly always present, or does it come and go? Are there particular times when they seem worse or better, like when you're alone or around others? And when you notice these experiences, do they usually stay the same, or do they tend to get stronger or weaker at different moments?\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed to talk about how often I see and hear things. I guess I notice it all the time, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s worse at certain times, like when I\u2019m alone or around others. I just want to say it\u2019s constant, but I\u2019m nervous to say it out loud.\nANSWER: It\u2019s pretty much all the time. Sometimes it feels a bit worse when I\u2019m alone, but I can\u2019t really tell if it gets better or worse at different times. It just kind of\u2026 stays there most of the day.",
