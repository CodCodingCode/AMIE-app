    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents with a gradual, painless swelling of her left lower leg that started around puberty and has progressively worsened over the past three years. She reports a family history of leg swelling affecting her mother and maternal aunt, both diagnosed in adolescence. On physical examination, there is non-pitting edema extending from the foot to just below the knee, with a thickened, peau d\u2019orange appearance of the skin. Stemmer\u2019s sign is positive, indicating involvement of the toes. No history of trauma, infection, or venous insufficiency is reported. Doppler ultrasound reveals no evidence of deep vein thrombosis, and lymphoscintigraphy shows delayed lymphatic drainage, supporting lymphatic dysfunction. Genetic testing identifies a mutation consistent with hereditary lymphedema type II. The patient is started on compression therapy and referred for physiotherapy to manage symptoms and prevent progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my situation clearly, even though I feel a bit nervous and unsure. I should mention my leg issue and how long it\u2019s been happening, and maybe mention my family history to give the doctor some background. I want to be honest about what I\u2019ve noticed and how it\u2019s affecting me.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 16, and I\u2019m a girl. My left leg has been swelling up slowly over the last few years, and it\u2019s gotten worse. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s pretty uncomfortable and looks kind of weird now, and I\u2019m worried about it."

    "output": "Um, well... it makes it hard sometimes to wear certain shoes or do stuff with my leg because it feels heavier than before, and I get tired more easily. Sometimes it feels a little achy or like, tingly, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing, but I worry about how it looks too, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s just been getting bigger, I think. The skin on my leg looks kind of thick and sorta bumpy, like it\u2019s got this weird dimpled look. I don\u2019t really feel much pain, but I do notice that it feels kinda heavy and weird sometimes, especially at the end of the day. It doesn\u2019t change color much, I think\u2014it\u2019s kind of the same, but it looks dull or something."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s kind of hard sometimes. I don\u2019t really want people to see my leg, and it makes me feel a little shy or everything looks weird. I can\u2019t run or do a lot of the things I used to because it gets really heavy and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve also noticed my skin looks different, kind of thicker, like rough or bumpy, especially around the ankle. Sometimes it feels kind of tight or itchy, and I worry about messing it up even more."

    "output": "No, I haven't had any injuries or infections or anything like that recently. As for my family, my mom and aunt have had similar swelling, so I think it runs in the family. I'm not sure if that helps, but that's what I know."
