I keep getting all this yucky, gooey stuff coming out of them, and it hurts when I try to open them in the morning. I think it started maybe two days ago with some redness, but today it\u2019s worse, and I woke up with a lot of gunk. I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s so sore and I don\u2019t want my brother to get it too. I just want it to go away soon.",

I keep thinking about if I can still go to school or if I might give this to my brother, and I want to be honest but also not sound too worried or confusing.\nANSWER: Um, well, my eyes are really red and swollen, and they feel sore and kinda sting sometimes. There\u2019s like goo all the time coming out, and it\u2019s really yucky. I think it started maybe two days ago? Or maybe last week? I don\u2019t really remember exactly, but it\u2019s worse now. It hurts when I blink or look at bright lights, and I don\u2019t know if I can see well or if anything changed with my vision. My mom said I should come because my eyes look really bad and I keep rubbing them. Also, I keep thinking if I can give it to my brother or not? And is this something serious? How long do I have to stay like this?",
