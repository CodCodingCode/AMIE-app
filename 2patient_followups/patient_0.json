She reports occasional dizziness and blurry vision, particularly after long work hours. Initially attributing her symptoms to stress and extensive screen time, she tried managing them with over-the-counter pain relievers and reducing caffeine intake, which provided minimal relief.\n\nMedical History:  \nSarah has no significant past medical history. She does not take any regular medications and has never been hospitalized.\n\nFamily History:  \nHer father was diagnosed with hypertension in his 50s, and her mother has type 2 diabetes.\n\nSocial History:  \nSarah leads a sedentary lifestyle due to her job demands.

She smokes occasionally, about five cigarettes a week, and drinks socially, two to three glasses of wine on weekends.\n\nPhysical Examination:  \nBlood pressure is 152/94 mmHg in both arms on multiple measurements.

    "output": "THINKING: I need to be honest but also a little cautious since I don't really understand what's happening. I should mention my symptoms clearly and honestly, and maybe hint at how worried or confused I feel. I also want to show that I\u2019m trying to get help because I know I should, even if I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about.  \n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m a 37-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of off for a few months. I keep getting these dull headaches, and sometimes I feel dizzy or see a little blurry when I\u2019ve been working a lot. It\u2019s like a tight feeling around my head, and I don\u2019t really know why. I thought maybe it was just stress or too much time on the computer, but it\u2019s not really getting better.",
