    "input": "\nWhat brings you in today?A 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and a 40-pack-year smoking history presents to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe abdominal and back pain. He describes the pain as sharp and constant, radiating to his groin, accompanied by dizziness and a feeling of lightheadedness. On examination, his abdomen is tender, and a pulsatile mass is palpable in the mid-abdominal region. Vital signs reveal hypotension and tachycardia, raising concerns for hemodynamic instability. He reports no prior abdominal symptoms but admits to feeling generally fatigued over the past few months. His family history is notable for cardiovascular disease, and he has not undergone any recent imaging studies. The clinical presentation suggests a leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, necessitating urgent imaging and surgical consultation. Immediate management focuses on stabilizing his blood pressure and preparing for possible operative repair.",
