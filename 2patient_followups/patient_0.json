I\u2019ve been having these headaches that are pretty constant, and sometimes I feel dizzy or see blurry stuff after I\u2019ve been working a lot.

Sometimes I notice they get worse after I\u2019ve been working on my computer for a long time or if I haven't slept well. As for the dizziness, it mostly happens when I stand up quickly or after a really long day. I can't always tell if there's a specific trigger, but they seem to happen randomly sometimes.",
