    "input": "1. A 28-year-old man presents to the clinic with a two-year history of infertility despite regular unprotected intercourse. He reports no previous significant medical issues and has normal secondary sexual characteristics. On physical examination, his testes are small and firm, without signs of varicocele. Semen analysis reveals azoospermia, and hormonal studies show elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with normal luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. He denies any history of cryptorchidism, infections, or trauma. Genetic testing identifies a mutation consistent with Spermatogenic Failure 5. Testicular biopsy demonstrates Sertoli cell-only syndrome with an absence of germ cells. The patient is counseled on assisted reproductive options, including testicular sperm extraction.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I am here today, so I should explain what\u2019s been bothering me or what I\u2019m worried about. I need to keep it simple and honest, even if I feel a bit nervous or unsure about what\u2019s wrong.\n\nANSWER: I guess I just, um, I\u2019ve been trying to have a baby with my partner for a while, and it\u2019s not been working. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong, but I keep feeling kind of worried about it."
