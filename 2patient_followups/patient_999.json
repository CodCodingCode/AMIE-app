Do I need to worry?\"\n- \"I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve waited too long to see someone.\"\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- Gestures of pointing to affected areas, especially the arms or hands.\n- Slight fidgeting or scratching, especially when describing itching.\n- Body language showing concern\u2014leaning forward, avoiding eye contact at times.\n- Pausing frequently, reflecting uncertainty or worry.\n- Nods when listening, seeking reassurance through expression.\n---\n**INFORMATION FLOW:**\n**VOLUNTEER IMMEDIATELY\"I understand that recalling exactly when these patches first appeared can be tricky, especially since the timeline feels a bit muddled. Could you tell me, as best as you remember, whether the patches started as small spots, and if they gradually grew larger or changed in appearance over time? Were there any particular times when they seemed to get worse or better? Even if you're unsure about the exact timing, any details about how they evolved or what else might have happened around that time could really help us understand what's going on.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I find it hard to remember exactly when they started or how they changed, and I keep mixing up the order of things. I just know they've been there for a while and seem to be getting worse lately, but I can\u2019t quite say when or how it all happened.\nANSWER: Well, I think they showed up maybe a few months ago, but I\u2019m not really sure. They were small at first, and then they sort of grew bigger, or maybe just looked different, but I honestly don\u2019t remember exactly when or what made them worse.",
