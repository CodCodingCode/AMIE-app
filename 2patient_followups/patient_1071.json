    "output": "THINKING: I feel really frightened, like this might be something serious, maybe even deadly. I keep thinking about how it could be cancer coming back or something worse, and that makes me even more anxious. I want to explain everything without sounding crazy, but it\u2019s hard to stay calm when I feel like I\u2019m suffocating and my voice is terrible.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, when I try to eat or talk for a bit, it kind of gets worse, like I can't swallow right and I keep feeling like something's stuck or I might choke, and the episodes seem to last a while, not just a second or two, and sometimes I start to cough a lot after. I don't know if it\u2019s just me stressing out, but I really think it\u2019s more than just anxiety, like something\u2019s blocking me or squeezing my throat or something.",
