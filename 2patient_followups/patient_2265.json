    "input": "2. A 45-year-old female presents with a 10-year history of slowly worsening distal weakness and sensory loss affecting her feet and hands, leading to difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning clothes. She recalls frequent ankle sprains in her late 30s and now experiences a high-stepping gait due to foot drop. Her father and paternal aunt reportedly had similar symptoms in middle age, including clawed toes and muscle wasting. On neurologic examination, there is prominent atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and anterior lower leg muscles, with decreased pinprick and proprioception distally. Deep tendon reflexes are absent at the ankles and diminished at the knees. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate reduced amplitudes consistent with an axonal neuropathy, with mild slowing of conduction velocities. Genetic analysis reveals a pathogenic variant in the TFG gene, establishing the diagnosis of autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. The patient is currently managed with supportive therapies, including ankle-foot orthoses and occupational therapy, and has been referred for genetic counseling for family planning.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should express some concern or discomfort that prompted her to seek medical advice, even if unsure exactly what\u2019s wrong. She might feel a bit embarrassed or worried about her symptoms worsening. She should mention her main issue in a vague way that reflects her emotional state and physical symptoms.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling more unsteady on my feet and my hands feel weaker than they used to. It\u2019s been going on for a while, but lately it\u2019s been harder to do small things like buttoning clothes or tying my shoes, and I\u2019m worried about falling or hurting myself."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been kind of slow over the years. Like, I started noticing my feet feeling kinda numb and weak in my early 30s, but it\u2019s gotten a lot worse now, especially in my hands. Sometimes I get those weird sensations in my legs, like tingling or something, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal. It just worries me because I feel like I\u2019ve been losing more control over my movements."

    "output": "Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having a little more trouble doing things I used to do easily, like buttoning my clothes or opening jars. My feet and hands feel kind of numb and weak sometimes. I haven't really noticed anything with my vision or coordination that I can think of, but I do get tired more quickly, I guess. It\u2019s all just kind of slow and frustrating."

    "output": "Um, I dunno, I haven\u2019t really noticed anything with my hearing or vision, but I guess some family members have had similar issues, like my dad and aunt. As for illnesses or accidents, I don\u2019t think so \u2014 I haven\u2019t been around anything unusual or hurt myself recently."

    "output": "Um, no, I don't think so. I mean, it\u2019s kinda the same as always, I guess. Sometimes I feel a little more tired or out of it maybe, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just because I\u2019m tired or something else. My bladder and bowels seem fine, I think. I haven\u2019t noticed anything really different like that."
