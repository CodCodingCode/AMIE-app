    "input": "2. A 9-year-old male is referred to neurology after experiencing recurrent nocturnal seizures over the past eight months. The seizures typically involve brief periods of unresponsiveness accompanied by lip-smacking and right hand automatisms. His parents report normal growth and development without any prior neurological issues. Physical and neurological exams show no abnormalities, and cognitive function is intact for his age. Brain MRI reveals a well-demarcated cortical lesion in the left frontal lobe with a characteristic multinodular \"bubbly\" appearance on T2-weighted images and no surrounding edema. An interictal EEG shows focal epileptiform discharges originating from the left frontal region. Based on imaging and seizure semiology, a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor is suspected. Neurosurgical consultation is arranged for lesion resection aimed at seizure control and definitive diagnosis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young boy, so I need to keep it simple and relatable. He's probably worried but might not understand all the medical details. I should focus on describing what he's been experiencing without overloading him with technical terms.\n\nANSWER: I'm a 9-year-old boy, and I keep having these weird spells at night. I kind of just zone out for a little bit and do the lip-smacking thing and move my hand strangely, like I don\u2019t really control it. My parents say I\u2019ve been doing it a lot lately, and it\u2019s making them worried."

    "output": "Um, well, I kind of space out for a little bit, and then I might make some weird moves with my mouth or my hand, but I don\u2019t really know why. Sometimes it happens when I\u2019m sleeping or just sitting there, and I don\u2019t think anything makes it start or stop. It feels like it just happens and then goes away."

    "output": "Um, I don't really know if there's a certain time or thing that makes it happen more. It kind of just happens, mostly maybe when I\u2019m trying to sleep or when I\u2019m just sitting around. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like, because I\u2019m stressed or tired \u2014 I don\u2019t always feel that way."

Also, do you notice any confusion or tiredness afterward, or any other symptoms before or after these episodes?",
    "output": "Um, sometimes they seem the same, but other times, I feel like they\u2019re a little different, like maybe a bit longer or shorter. Afterward, he looks tired and kind of out of it, like he's not really himself. Before or after, I don't really see anything special, but he sometimes seems more sleepy or kind of dazed."

    "output": "Um, they happen kind of a lot, like a few times a week, maybe? Sometimes it feels like they just come out of nowhere, and I worry they make it hard for him to do stuff or focus, especially at school."
