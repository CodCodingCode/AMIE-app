    "input": "2. A 45-year-old female presents with insidious onset of fatigue, palpitations, and mild chest discomfort over two months. She denies prior cardiac disease but notes a recent unexplained weight loss and occasional night sweats. Physical examination reveals a faint diastolic murmur and mild jugular venous distension. Electrocardiography shows nonspecific ST-T changes, while transthoracic echocardiogram identifies a large, heterogeneous mass encasing the posterior wall of the left ventricle. Cardiac MRI demonstrates a poorly defined lesion with infiltrative borders involving the epicardial nerves and myocardium. The patient has no family history of neurofibromatosis or other hereditary syndromes. A percutaneous biopsy reveals malignant spindle-shaped cells with increased mitoses and S-100 positivity, confirming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor originating from cardiac nerves. Multidisciplinary evaluation plans for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical excision due to the tumor\u2019s location and aggressive features.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has a complex medical history with serious findings. They might be feeling anxious or overwhelmed, and might not fully understand their condition. I should keep the response simple and focus on how they feel and what symptoms bother them most.\n\nANSWER: I'm a 45-year-old woman. I've been feeling really tired all the time and my heart's been racing sometimes, kind of like it skips or thumps hard. I've also noticed I lost weight without trying and sometimes I feel kind of sweaty at night."

    "output": "Well, I guess I feel really tired all the time, like I can't shake it even after resting. Sometimes I get these weird feeling in my chest and it kinda worries me, especially when I'm just doing normal things. And there are moments when I feel a little worse or better for no real reason, but mostly I just feel worn out."

    "output": "Um, I guess it kind of just started out of nowhere, really slowly.

I don\u2019t think anything specific makes it better or worse, but I notice it more when I\u2019m trying to rest or if I\u2019m a bit anxious."

Also, do you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, or fainting episodes when these symptoms occur?",
    "output": "I don\u2019t know if they happen at certain times or when I\u2019m doing something specific.

I haven't fainted or felt really dizzy or chest pain from them, but the palpitations make me feel kind of anxious, I guess."
