I might be nervous or shy about explaining, but I should keep it simple and real.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really know how to start, but um, I\u2019ve been having trouble in my ears and my teeth, and I get these really hard times learning stuff and sometimes I feel kinda out of it\u2026 I guess I just wanted to see what\u2019s going on with all of this."
