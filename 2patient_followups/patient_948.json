Can you tell me exactly how much weight you've lost and over what period? Also, during this time, have you experienced any fevers, night sweats, or chills that you haven't mentioned yet? These details are important so we can determine the best next steps for your care.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm a bit nervous about revealing too much, but I guess I should be honest if I want to find out what's going on. I don't want to seem overly worried, but I can't help feeling like it might be something serious. I keep thinking about how weight loss is a big deal, but I don't remember exactly how much, and I\u2019m not sure about the other stuff like fevers or night sweats.\nANSWER: I guess I've lost maybe around 10 pounds or so, but I didn't really notice at first, just seemed like I was getting thinner. I haven't had any fevers or night sweats that I can remember, just the cough and feeling more tired all the time.",
