    "output": "THINKING: Okay, the doctor wants to know about my eyes, but honestly, I haven't really thought about my eyes much. I just feel so sick everywhere. I guess I do notice my eyes get dry sometimes when I wake up, and maybe they look a little red in the mornings? But I don\u2019t really see any discharge or anything. Honestly, I just want to get better or find out what\u2019s wrong.\nANSWER: Yeah, my eyes, I guess they\u2019re kind of dry, especially when I wake up. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really red or anything, and I don\u2019t see any discharge, just dry sometimes.",
