    "input": "2. A 22-year-old male presents with chronic swelling of both lower extremities, first noticed during late childhood but worsening significantly after a recent growth spurt. He describes a sensation of heaviness and intermittent aching in his legs, without redness or warmth. His paternal grandfather had a history of similar leg swelling beginning in adolescence. On exam, there is bilateral, non-pitting edema from the ankles to mid-calf, with thickened skin and mild hyperkeratosis but no signs of infection. Stemmer\u2019s sign is positive bilaterally, and there is limited dorsiflexion of the ankles due to skin tightness. Duplex ultrasonography rules out venous reflux or deep vein thrombosis, while lymphoscintigraphy demonstrates delayed and asymmetric lymphatic transport. Genetic analysis confirms a mutation in the FLT4 gene, indicating hereditary lymphedema type II. Conservative management including manual lymphatic drainage, compression stockings, and skin care education is initiated to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young, male, and has had swollen legs for a long time, getting worse recently. He's probably worried or confused about why it's happening again or what it means. I should keep it simple and honest, sharing how it\u2019s bothering me without assuming too much.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi. I\u2019m 22, and my legs have been swollen for a long time, but it\u2019s gotten worse recently. They feel really heavy and kind of achy, and I don\u2019t know what I should do about it."

    "output": "Um, well, it's kinda been bothering me a lot, especially when I walk or stand for a while. My legs get really heavy, and sometimes they ache.

    "output": "Well, my legs have just been getting bigger and heavier over time, especially after I had that growth spurt recently. The skin feels thick and kinda rough, and I sometimes get this aching feeling, but there's no redness or warmth or anything like that.

    "output": "Um, so most days my legs just feel really heavy, like they\u2019re super weighed down and sore, especially by the evening.

I\u2019ve also been worried because they look bigger than before, and I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not."

Did you experience any swelling or developmental issues with your legs or other parts of your body during childhood?",
    "output": "Um, yeah, my grandpa had kind of the same swelling in his legs when he was younger, so I guess it runs in the family. As for me, I don\u2019t remember anything really specific, but I did notice my legs looked a bit bigger than other kids when I was little, and it kind of got worse as I grew up. I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not."
