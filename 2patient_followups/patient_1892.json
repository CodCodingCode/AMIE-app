    "input": "1. A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic with episodes of early morning irritability and lethargy. His parents report that he has difficulty staying awake before breakfast and occasionally vomits during these periods. There is no history of seizures, but they note that his appetite is poor, and he seems to crave frequent snacking throughout the day. Physical examination reveals mild hepatomegaly without signs of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests show fasting hypoglycemia with low insulin and ketones, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. A fasting test demonstrates precipitous drops in blood glucose within 6 hours of fasting. Genetic testing reveals a mutation in the GYS2 gene, consistent with Glycogen Storage Disease Type 0. A dietary regimen rich in complex carbohydrates and frequent meals is initiated to prevent fasting hypoglycemia and improve his symptoms.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain that the little boy has been acting strange in the mornings and seems really tired. I want to mention the vomiting and how he doesn\u2019t want to eat much, but he keeps asking for snacks. I also need to say he's not acting like himself, maybe more irritable or lethargic than usual.\n\nANSWER: My 3-year-old son has been waking up really upset and sleepy before breakfast. He sometimes vomits and doesn\u2019t want to eat much, but he keeps asking for snacks all the time. He just doesn\u2019t seem like himself lately."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been really cranky in the mornings, more than usual, and he just seems so tired, almost like he's sleepy but can't quite wake up properly. Sometimes he\u2019s throwing up after he eats, or he just seems... off, I guess, like he\u2019s not himself. His appetite isn\u2019t great, but then he keeps asking for snacks all the time, even when he just ate. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related, but he\u2019s also been fussier and not playing as much."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been acting kind of funny in the mornings, real cranky and not his usual happy self, and he seems tired, even after sleeping. He doesn\u2019t eat as much as he used to, and sometimes he just kinda sits there and looks lost or sad. I just worry because he\u2019s been vomiting sometimes too, and I don\u2019t really know why."

    "output": "Um, not really, I guess. He\u2019s been kinda fussy in the mornings, more than usual, and he doesn\u2019t want to eat much before breakfast. Sometimes he seems really tired and sleepy, and he\u2019s been throwing up a little when he wakes up. Nothing else strange I can think of, just the same old stuff, I think."

    "output": "Um, not that I can think of. No one at daycare is sick or anything like that, at least not recently. But he\u2019s been a bit fussy and tired, I guess, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s related or not."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gained any extra weight or seemed to grow slower than before. We haven't really talked about any family diseases or anything like that, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything like that running in the family."

    "output": "He\u2019s usually really tired and cranky when he first wakes up, like before breakfast. Sometimes, he just seems kind of out of it or just wants to be held. After he eats, he sometimes feels a little better, but not always, and he still looks tired. I guess the mornings are the hardest for him."

    "output": "Well, he seems a little better right after he eats, like he\u2019s not so upset or tired for a little while, but it doesn\u2019t last very long. Sometimes he still feels yucky even if he\u2019s just rested or played a bit."
