    "input": "2. A 32-year-old female software engineer presents with a 1.5-year history of progressive slowness in movement and subtle resting tremor in her left hand. She also notes stiffness in her limbs and difficulty with fine motor tasks such as typing and buttoning clothes. Her symptoms began insidiously and have gradually impacted her daily activities and work performance. She denies any significant mood changes but admits to mild sleep disturbances and occasional drooling. There is no known family history of Parkinsonian disorders. Neurological examination reveals asymmetrical bradykinesia, rigidity more pronounced on the left, and decreased arm swing while walking. Brain imaging is normal, but functional imaging with DaTscan demonstrates reduced tracer uptake in the right striatum. Genetic analysis confirms a mutation linked to Parkinson disease 20, supporting the diagnosis of early-onset Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I came in today, I should explain what\u2019s been bothering me lately. I\u2019ve been noticing things happening slowly and some twitching I can\u2019t really control. I might be a little worried about what it all means, even if I\u2019m not sure how to say it properly.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 32, and I\u2019m a girl. It\u2019s just that for the past year or so, I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019m moving really slowly sometimes and my hand on the left just keeps trembling a bit. It\u2019s been getting worse, and I guess I\u2019m a little scared because it\u2019s messing with my work and how I do everyday stuff."

    "output": "Yeah, it\u2019s been pretty tough. I keep dropping things or messing up details I used to do quickly, and I feel kind of sluggish all the time. Sometimes I get worried about what\u2019s gonna happen next, and I don\u2019t really feel like myself anymore. It\u2019s messing with my work and just everyday stuff."

    "output": "Um, well, I think it's been a little worse than when it started. I\u2019ve been having a hard time doing stuff like typing or buttoning my clothes, and sometimes my hand feels all shaky, especially when I try to do something precise. It kind of makes me nervous because I\u2019m worried it\u2019s not just gonna stay the same or get worse. I\u2019m also sometimes tired or restless at night, and I feel a bit worried about how this will go in the future."

    "output": "Um, I think they don\u2019t really get better or worse at certain times. Sometimes when I just rest, it feels a little the same, but other times it\u2019s like it\u2019s worse, especially in the mornings. I haven't really found anything that helps, nothing I\u2019ve tried seems to make it better or worse, really."

    "output": "Um, I think I might have some stiffness still, especially when I try to move certain parts, and I seem to kind of shuffle a bit more when I walk. Sometimes my face feels a little, I dunno, less expressive, and I\u2019ve noticed I sweat more than before, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Well, I did feel a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up quickly, but it\u2019s not all the time. I haven\u2019t noticed much with my digestion or anything with my bathroom habits, really."
