    "input": "1. A 32-year-old woman presents with progressive gait instability and frequent falls over the past 3 years. She reports stiffness and tightness in her legs, making walking increasingly difficult, along with difficulty coordinating fine motor tasks like buttoning her clothes. There is a family history of similar symptoms in her father and paternal grandfather, both of whom experienced wheelchair dependence by their fifth decade. On examination, she has spasticity in the lower limbs, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign, alongside limb ataxia characterized by dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia. Her speech is mildly slurred with a scanning quality, and she exhibits nystagmus on lateral gaze. Brain MRI shows cerebellar atrophy predominantly affecting the vermis, while genetic testing confirms a pathogenic CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Routine blood tests are unremarkable, and no other systemic abnormalities are found. The diagnosis of autosomal dominant spastic ataxia type 7 is established, and she is referred to neurorehabilitation and genetic counseling.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling worried or unsure about her symptoms getting worse or maybe wanting to understand what\u2019s happening. She probably feels a bit embarrassed about her gait and coordination issues but knows she needs help. She might also be overwhelmed because her family history is coming into her mind.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m not really sure how to say it, but I\u2019ve been having a hard time walking and my legs feel really tight. It\u2019s gotten worse over the last few years, and I keep falling, even when I don\u2019t expect to. Sometimes my speech is a little off, and I just felt like I needed to come see someone about it."

    "output": "Well, walking has gotten really hard\u2026 I sometimes feel like I might fall even just standing still. I have to hold onto things a lot and really concentrate just to get around. And my speech\u2026 I notice it\u2019s kind of slurred, like I\u2019m not saying words clearly, especially when I try to speak longer sentences. It\u2019s all making me nervous and I guess I\u2019ve just been trying to get through each day without things getting worse."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes my eyes feel a bit funny, like they don\u2019t always move smoothly, and I\u2019ve noticed I get more wobbly when I\u2019m on uneven ground or in a crowded place. I haven\u2019t really paid attention to my bladder or bowels, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything there. As for thinking, I guess I feel a bit more foggy or slow sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just me being tired."

    "output": "Well, I guess it\u2019s been getting worse, like, I stumble more and can\u2019t do things I used to do easily. Sometimes I feel really off when I walk, and I worry about losing more control or if it\u2019s going to keep getting worse and what that even means. I don\u2019t really understand all of this, but it\u2019s just kind of scary."

And I haven\u2019t had any sudden vision loss or anything like that, as far as I remember."
