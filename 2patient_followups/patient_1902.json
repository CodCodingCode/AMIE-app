    "input": "1. A 14-year-old male presents to the neurology clinic with a history of progressive numbness and tingling in his hands and feet since early childhood. His parents report frequent injuries to his fingers and toes, which often go unnoticed and become infected. On examination, he has absent pain and temperature sensation in a glove-and-stocking distribution but preserved vibration and proprioception. Muscle strength is normal, but he demonstrates decreased deep tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. He also has early signs of painless skin ulcers and bone deformities in his feet, consistent with Charcot arthropathy. Family history reveals a maternal uncle with similar symptoms but no definitive diagnosis. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the SPTLC2 gene, consistent with hereditary sensory neuropathy type Ie. Supportive management including wound care, protective footwear, and physical therapy is initiated to prevent further complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm a bit nervous, but I need to tell the doctor what's been going on. I keep feeling weird tingly stuff in my hands and feet, and it's been happening for a long time. Sometimes I get scared about hurting myself and not noticing.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just... I feel these weird numb and tingling feelings in my hands and feet, and it\u2019s been happening pretty much forever. I keep worried I might hurt myself but I don't always notice until it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s kind of been getting worse lately, I think."

    "output": "Um, it's been sorta gradually getting worse, I think. Sometimes, it feels really numb and kinda tingly all over my hands and feet, like pins and needles, and it doesn\u2019t seem to go away. I haven't noticed much that helps or makes it worse, honestly. It just kind of feels the same most of the time, but sometimes it gets a little worse when I\u2019m tired or if I accidentally hurt myself without realizing."

    "output": "Well, it's kinda hard to explain, but my hands and feet feel numb and tingly all the time, and sometimes I don\u2019t really notice if I hurt myself until it\u2019s worse. Lately, I feel like my toes and fingers get worse, and I worry because I don\u2019t feel pain when I get cuts or bumps. It\u2019s been making everything more difficult, and I keep worrying about if it\u2019s going to get any worse."

I don\u2019t really notice anything with my vision or feeling super tired or anything, but I dunno, sometimes I just feel kinda off, but I can't really say why."
