    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female presents with a 7-year history of progressive weakness in her hands and feet, making it difficult to perform fine motor tasks such as buttoning clothes and frequently causing her to trip when walking. She describes a persistent tingling sensation and numbness in her fingertips and toes, worsening over the last two years. On examination, there is noticeable muscle wasting in the intrinsic hand muscles and distal lower leg muscles, along with bilateral foot drop and hammer toes. Sensory testing reveals diminished proprioception and pinprick sensation distally, with absent ankle reflexes. Her gait is unsteady, and she demonstrates difficulty with heel and toe walking. Electrophysiological studies show markedly reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes with relatively preserved conduction velocities, indicating an axonal neuropathy. Family history is significant for a father with similar symptoms who lost ambulation in his 50s, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Genetic analysis identifies a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the DNAJB2 gene, confirming Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal type 2u, and she is referred for genetic counseling and begun on supportive physical therapy and orthotic management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling worried about her worsening symptoms and maybe embarrassed to keep coming back with more problems. She could also be uncertain if her symptoms are serious or just a part of aging, so she might be hesitant or nervous in her response. I should keep her comfort in mind and respond with understanding, encouraging her to share her concerns honestly.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been, you know, feeling like my hands and feet are not really working right anymore, and it\u2019s been getting worse over the years. Sometimes I trip or drop things without warning, and I\u2019m really worried about that. It\u2019s pretty frustrating and a little scary."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been kind of a slow thing, I guess. Some days I feel more numb or tingly, and my hands and feet get more unsteady. I don\u2019t really notice changes in my thinking or mood much, but sometimes I feel kind of down or frustrated, especially when I can\u2019t do things like I used to. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, everything\u2019s been a bit weird or harder lately."

    "output": "Uh, well, walking has become harder, especially when I try to go for a walk or stand for a while. Sometimes I stumble or feel really unsteady, and it gets worse if I\u2019ve been on my feet a lot. Dressing is tricky too, especially buttoning clothes or just using my hands\u2014my fingers feel numb and weak. It seems worse in the evenings, or when I've been active; I don't know exactly why, but it's like everything just gets a bit more sluggish and uncomfortable."

    "output": "Well, um, it\u2019s made everyday things kinda tricky, like even just holding stuff or walking. Sometimes I trip or drop things without meaning to, and I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse\u2014I just notice it\u2019s gotten more noticeable over time. It\u2019s kind of frustrating and makes me feel a little worried I\u2019ll keep getting worse."

    "output": "Hmm, I guess I haven't really noticed anything clear like double vision or blurred vision, but sometimes I feel a little blurry in the corner of my eye, and I haven't had any pain or anything that sticks out. It's all kind of confusing to tell."

    "output": "Umm, I guess my muscles feel weak especially in my hands and feet, but I haven\u2019t really noticed anything with speaking or swallowing.

My job\u2019s mostly sitting at a desk, and I haven\u2019t really been around any chemicals or anything like that, at least not intentionally. As for my diet, I try to eat decent, but I don\u2019t really pay attention to vitamins or anything specific."
