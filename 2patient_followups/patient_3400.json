    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy presents to the pediatric neurology clinic with unsteady gait and frequent falls that have progressively worsened over the past two years. His parents report delayed developmental milestones, including sitting and walking later than his peers. On examination, he shows significant truncal and appendicular ataxia, dysarthric speech, and mild intellectual disability with difficulties in school. There is no family history of neurological disorders, but consanguineous parents raise suspicion for a genetic syndrome. Brain MRI reveals cerebellar hypoplasia, particularly affecting the vermis. Neuropsychological testing confirms moderate cognitive impairment. Laboratory tests and metabolic screening are normal, ruling out acquired causes of ataxia. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant consistent with Cerebellar Ataxia, Mental Retardation, and Dysequilibrium Syndrome 4 (CAMRQ4).\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why we're here today, so I need to explain what\u2019s been bothering us. I should mention the ongoing problems with his walking and balance, as well as how it\u2019s been getting worse. I might also talk about how he's been struggling in school and the delays we've noticed.\n\nANSWER: Well, my son is 7, and he\u2019s been really unsteady when he walks, and he keeps falling, especially lately. It\u2019s gotten worse over the past couple of years, and he also screws up words sometimes when he talks. We\u2019re worried because he\u2019s been behind other kids and it just doesn\u2019t seem right."

    "output": "Well, he used to walk a little better when he was younger, but lately he keeps falling more and it's really hard for him to stand steady. His talking is not as clear as before, and he seems to get frustrated more easily. There are some days he just seems more tired or upset for no obvious reason."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s really unsteady when he tries to walk, and he falls a lot, even just walking inside the house. He gets frustrated because he can\u2019t do things like other kids, especially with school and playing. Sometimes he seems upset or tired, and I worry about what\u2019s going to happen as he gets older. I guess I\u2019m just worried about everything\u2014if he\u2019ll keep having these problems or if it\u2019s going to get worse."

    "output": "Um, I think he\u2019s still kind of quiet like always, but sometimes he gets really frustrated when he can\u2019t do things right away. He hasn\u2019t been saying much about feeling sad or upset, but he does seem kind of more tired than usual. It\u2019s been hard to tell if he\u2019s doing okay inside."

    "output": "Um, he's been kinda different, I think. Maybe more upset than before, like he gets really cranky sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t really want to play or talk as much. He\u2019s been kind of quiet, and I guess he\u2019s not sleeping as well either."

    "output": "No, we don\u2019t really know of anything like this in our family. No one has talked about anything similar before."

    "output": "Um, sometimes he seems to look a little weird, like he's squinting or blinking a lot when he's trying to look at things, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s actually trouble seeing or just how he looks at stuff. As for hearing, he doesn\u2019t really pay attention when we call him, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because he can\u2019t hear well or just not listening."

    "output": "Um, sometimes he squints more than before, and he seems to blink a lot, like he's trying to strain or something. He's also been acting like he doesn't hear us sometimes, even when we're right next to him, and he looks away or ignores us."
