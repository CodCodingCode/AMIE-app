    "input": "2. A 45-year-old male presents with sudden onset of rhythmic shaking in both legs that started two months ago following a divorce and job loss. He describes the movements as intermittent, worsening in stressful situations and almost absent during sleep or distraction. On examination, the tremor has an irregular frequency and amplitude, and there is a notable inconsistency in its presentation during different tasks. Neurological exam reveals no muscle weakness, sensory deficits, or abnormalities in reflexes and coordination. Brain CT scan and routine blood panels, including thyroid function tests, are within normal limits. The patient has a history of anxiety and depressive symptoms that have intensified recently but no prior neurological illness. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate atypical tremor characteristics inconsistent with essential tremor or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Given the pattern of symptom variability, normal investigations, and psychological background, a diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder is established, and the patient is advised to pursue psychotherapy along with stress management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling nervous or unsure about discussing their symptoms openly, so I should keep my response simple and reassuring. They may be experiencing some emotional stress manifesting as physical symptoms, so I should acknowledge their discomfort.  \nANSWER: I'm a 45-year-old man, and I guess I came because of these things happening to my legs. They've just started, and I don\u2019t really understand what's going on, but it's been bothering me, especially when I get stressed or upset. Sometimes they feel weird or shaky, and I just want to figure out what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Uh, it\u2019s kinda all over the place, I guess. Sometimes it\u2019s worse when I\u2019m pretty stressed or nervous, but then other times it\u2019s kind of there even if I try to ignore it. It makes things like, you know, holding a cup or typing kinda difficult and it just makes me feel kind of off, like I can\u2019t really control it. It\u2019s almost like I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming or how bad it will be."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s hard to really explain, I guess. Sometimes it feels like my legs are just kind of shaky or tingly, but it\u2019s not really a pain or anything. When I try to do something to distract myself, it seems to get a little better, but then it can come back. I don\u2019t know if anything I do makes it worse or better for sure, but stress definitely makes it worse sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I think they happen more when I get really upset or nervous, but sometimes it's just random, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, lately, I feel worse when I\u2019m trying to concentrate or when I\u2019m about to get angry or upset."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I don\u2019t feel any weakness or really strange sensations, but sometimes I do feel kind of off with my balance or just... weird in my head, I guess. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s all connected."

    "output": "Yeah, I guess I\u2019ve had some stuff I\u2019ve been going through \u2014 feeling pretty anxious and down, especially lately, but I\u2019ve never really been officially told I had anything."
