    "input": "2. A 45-year-old man comes to the endocrinology clinic complaining of decreased libido and erectile dysfunction over the past year. He also notes progressive fatigue and occasional headaches localized to the frontal region. His wife has noticed mild galactorrhea, which he had not initially reported. On examination, there is no significant visual field deficit, but mild bitemporal upper quadrant loss is detected on detailed perimetry. Blood tests reveal elevated serum prolactin levels at 250 ng/mL, and testosterone is low. An MRI scan identifies a 2.2 cm pituitary macroadenoma without cavernous sinus invasion. The patient denies medications or thyroid disease that might account for hyperprolactinemia. He is started on cabergoline and scheduled for follow-up hormone monitoring and visual field assessment.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should mention the main symptoms that brought him to the clinic but in a way that reflects his confusion and feelings of uncertainty. He shouldn't overthink what to say but should honestly explain what he's experiencing.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 45, and I\u2019ve been feeling really tired all the time, like I don\u2019t have much energy, and I\u2019ve noticed I don\u2019t feel interested in things anymore. My wife said I\u2019ve been leaking some milk-like stuff, and I\u2019ve been having some headaches that come and go. It sort of just all snuck up on me, and I guess I wanted to see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, um, it started maybe about a year ago, I think? Things just started feeling off\u2014less interested in stuff I used to enjoy, and I guess I\u2019ve been really tired, like always. Sometimes I get headaches, especially in the front, and I\u2019ve noticed my wife mentioning stuff about milk coming out, which I didn\u2019t think much of at first. It\u2019s making things kinda hard at work and around the house. I\u2019m kind of worried about it all, but I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "I guess I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired all the time, even when I sleep enough. Sometimes I just don\u2019t feel like doing much, and I\u2019ve noticed I don\u2019t have the same energy I used to. It\u2019s also kind of annoying because my head hurts sometimes, and I\u2019ve been a bit worried about what all this means."

    "output": "Um, I've just been feeling kind of more tired than usual, like I don't have much energy, and I sometimes get these headaches \u2014 especially in the front. I don't really feel like myself, and everything feels a bit heavier or harder to do. My mood's been a little up and down, and it's affecting how I go about my day, I guess."

My vision feels kind of funny now and then, especially on the sides, like it's harder to see out of the corners. And the headaches, they're there but not super strong, just kind of nagging."
