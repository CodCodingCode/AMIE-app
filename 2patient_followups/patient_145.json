I need to understand how severe his discomfort is, but he's also likely scared, so I should be gentle. His expression and words might reveal if his sight is significantly affected or if he's just in discomfort. Since he's only 9, I want to reassure him yet gather enough info to figure out how serious this might be.\nANSWER: My eyes have been hurting and getting worse for a few weeks now. They're really red and sticky, especially when I wake up.",
