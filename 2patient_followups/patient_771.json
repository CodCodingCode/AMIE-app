    "input": "2. A 12-year-old male presented with complete absence of the nose and significant visual impairment due to bilateral microphthalmia, first noted in infancy. He had a history of chronic mouth breathing and episodic cyanosis during sleep, suggestive of upper airway obstruction. Developmental evaluation revealed delayed language acquisition and mild intellectual disability. Physical examination confirmed total arhinia with no external nasal structures, alongside small, malformed eyes with limited visual acuity. Endoscopic assessment showed severely narrowed nasal passages with no functional airway. Brain MRI revealed absent olfactory bulbs and hypoplasia of the optic nerves, correlating with his sensory deficits. No cardiac, renal, or limb abnormalities were noted, supporting isolated Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome. The patient was enrolled in a multidisciplinary care program focused on surgical airway reconstruction, ocular prosthetics, and speech therapy to optimize functional outcomes.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young boy, so I need to be gentle and clear, but also honest about what he's feeling. He's probably confused or worried, maybe embarrassed, so I should focus on how he\u2019s been feeling and what\u2019s been bothering him lately.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 12, and I\u2019m a boy. Uh, I don\u2019t really know\u2026 I\u2019ve been feeling like I can\u2019t breathe good sometimes, especially when I sleep. My nose is all weird, and I get kinda scared when I wake up and I can\u2019t breathe right away."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, I guess sometimes I don\u2019t think I breathe right, like I wake up and I feel kind of panicky or like I can\u2019t get enough air, especially if I wake up suddenly. And I\u2019ve noticed I snore a lot, or it\u2019s like, I stop for a little bit, but I don\u2019t know why or how long. It kind of makes me scared to fall asleep sometimes."

Also, how do you feel during the day\u2014are you more tired or irritable than usual?",
    "output": "Um, I think sometimes I make really loud noise when I sleep, and I feel like I can\u2019t breathe good, but I don\u2019t always wake up, I guess. During the day, I feel pretty tired and cranky more often than before, I think."

I don\u2019t really remember any bad colds or throat stuff lately, though."

    "output": "Yeah, sometimes he makes sounds like he's choking or gagging, especially when he's trying to breathe or when he's lying down. He also coughs a lot, and it seems worse at night or when he's on his back. It kind of scares me because I don't know if it's normal or not."
