I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about how often these swallowing episodes happen and how they\u2019ve been affecting you overall. For instance, do you notice if they occur mostly with certain types of food or if they happen more frequently now compared to when they started? Also, have you ever had times when food or liquids seem to go down silently without you noticing immediately, or any episodes where you felt you might have inhaled or choked but weren\u2019t sure? This will help me get a clearer picture of what's really happening and ensure we consider all possibilities.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to answer honestly, but I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I think maybe it\u2019s not that bad, but I guess I should give some details to help the doctor. I\u2019m also a little worried, but I don\u2019t want to scare myself over nothing.\nANSWER: Well, it happens a bit more now and then, and I mainly notice it when I try to eat something that\u2019s a little tougher or dry. Sometimes I just feel like I can\u2019t get the water down easily without coughing or choking a little, but I don\u2019t think I ever really aspirated or anything. It\u2019s probably nothing serious.",
