    "output": "THINKING: I guess he's asking about what caused this or what I was doing when it started. Honestly, I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but I do remember that I was working overtime last month, really stressing over some construction project. Then, I started noticing this burning after I\u2019d eat greasy food or maybe spicy stuff, but lately it\u2019s been almost all the time, not just after eating, and it\u2019s making me pretty anxious. Sometimes I think maybe all the stress and the drinking on weekends might be making it worse, but I\u2019m not sure \u2014 just feels like everything\u2019s piling up.\nANSWER: Well, mostly I think it started after I had been working long hours and eating out a lot, sometimes fast food or greasy sandwiches, I guess. I was also drinking more on weekends lately, trying to unwind, and I\u2019ve had some back pain so I\u2019ve been taking those NSAIDs pretty regularly. It\u2019s like this burning in my stomach, especially after meals, and I\u2019ve been feeling bloated too. I haven\u2019t been sleeping well because the pain gets bad at night, and now I\u2019m kind of worried it might be something serious or I\u2019ve got an ulcer or something.",
