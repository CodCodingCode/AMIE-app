Over the last few weeks, it\u2019s gotten bigger, and now it\u2019s painful, swollen, and I just feel so tired all the time.\"\n- **SH\"Thanks for sharing all of that. To make sure I fully understand, could you tell me if you've experienced any night sweats that kept you waking up soaked or made you uncomfortable, even if you didn\u2019t mention it before? Also, over these past few months, have you noticed your weight changing more than you initially thought\u2014like losing a significant amount without trying\u2014or feeling any new fevers or chill episodes? And regarding your family, do you remember if any relatives had cancer, especially lung or other serious types? These details really help clarify what might be going on and how best to support you moving forward.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m nervous about all this, especially about the sweat and weight loss part. I don\u2019t really talk about my family\u2019s health much, but I guess I should tell him if I remember right. I feel like I need to focus on what\u2019s most important but also worried about saying too much or sounding like I\u2019m overreacting.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t really remember night sweats, but I do lose weight pretty fast, I think. And, uh, my uncle had lung cancer, I think. Sorry, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.",
