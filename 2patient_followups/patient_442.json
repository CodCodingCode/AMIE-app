    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little confused by the question. I think about how sometimes I zone out or forget what I was doing, and I\u2019m not sure how long those moments last. I don\u2019t really notice feeling dizzy or seeing things weird, but I do feel kind of drawn into my head, like everything slows down. I\u2019m worried I might forget these things, so I try to pay attention, but it\u2019s hard.\nANSWER: Well, um, I guess they last maybe a little while, like a few minutes? Sometimes I get kind of turned around, but I don\u2019t really feel dizzy or see strange things. It\u2019s just like my mind goes blank for a bit, and then I come back.",
