    "input": "2. A 52-year-old woman presents with a two-month history of worsening fatigue, episodic low-grade fevers, and new-onset focal seizures involving her left leg. She also reports intermittent headaches and recent difficulty with concentration and memory. Neurological examination reveals mild left-sided hemiparesis and hyperreflexia. Blood tests show elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, while cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals moderate pleocytosis and elevated protein without infectious organisms. Brain MRI demonstrates multiple patchy T2 hyperintense lesions with contrast enhancement in the right frontal and parietal lobes. Conventional cerebral angiography identifies irregular narrowing and segmental dilatations of medium-sized intracranial arteries. A leptomeningeal and brain biopsy discloses granulomatous inflammation involving the vessel walls, confirming granulomatous angiitis. The patient is promptly started on intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral immunosuppressive therapy, resulting in clinical stabilization.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be confused or worried about her symptoms, possibly feeling overwhelmed by the recent changes. She could be unsure what to focus on, so I should encourage her to describe her main concerns clearly but gently.  \nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really tired all the time, and I get these weird fevers that come and go. And, um, lately, I\u2019ve been having these strange feelings in my leg, like it\u2019s not quite right, and my head has been kind of foggy."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been pretty hard to do things like I used to. I get tired easily and sometimes I forget things or feel a bit dizzy, especially when my head hurts. I notice I get worse if I try to do too much, but I haven\u2019t really figured out what makes it better, honestly."
