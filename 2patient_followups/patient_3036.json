    "input": "1. A 28-year-old male presents with a gradual loss of muscle strength in his lower legs, accompanied by frequent tripping and difficulty running over the past three years. He reports numbness and tingling sensations in his feet, progressing slowly to his hands. Family history reveals that his father experienced similar symptoms in his 30s. On examination, he has distal muscle atrophy, pes cavus deformities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. Electromyography shows reduced amplitude of motor responses consistent with axonal neuropathy. Genetic testing confirms a mutation associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal type 2w. He denies any significant sensory loss or autonomic symptoms, maintaining intact proximal muscle strength. The patient is referred to physical therapy to improve mobility and prevent contractures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I came today, so I need to explain my main concerns. I should mention how I've been feeling physically and aim to be honest about anything that's bothering me, even if it sounds complicated or embarrassing. I want to focus on what\u2019s been getting worse over time.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 28, and I\u2019m a guy. Well, I guess I just feel like my legs are weaker all the time, and I keep tripping more and more. It\u2019s kinda scary because I also get these weird tingling feelings in my feet and hands, and it\u2019s been happening for a few years now."

    "output": "Well, it started kind of gradually \u2014 I just noticed I was tripping more than usual and running felt weird, like my feet didn\u2019t feel quite right. Over time, it\u2019s been worse, and I sometimes feel tingling in my feet, and now my hands are kind of weird too. I don\u2019t really know exactly when it got worse, it just kind of happened slowly."

    "output": "It\u2019s been kind of hard to do some things I used to do easily, like walking or running without tripping\u2026 and I guess I feel more tired than before, even just from little tasks. Sometimes I notice my feet feel weird, like numb or tingly, and it sort of comes and goes. It\u2019s hard not to worry about what it all means."

    "output": "Well, it's been pretty tough just trying to do things like walking or running, 'cause I trip a lot and feel really unsteady. Sometimes I get these weird tingling feelings in my feet and hands, and I think it\u2019s getting worse. I haven't noticed anything totally new lately, but I worry about what might happen as it goes on."

    "output": "Um, I guess my arms don\u2019t feel as weak as my legs, but sometimes I feel like my hands  \n*shrug*  \n. I haven't really noticed anything weird with my muscles getting stiff or my balance being worse, and I haven\u2019t seen any changes in my eyes or anything like that. Maybe I\u2019m just not noticing?"
