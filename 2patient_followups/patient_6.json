Leading Diagnoses: 1. Hematuria from urinary tract cause (infection, stones, trauma). 2. Coagulopathy or bleeding disorder. 3. Kidney pathology (glomerulonephritis). 4. Less likely: systemic conditions causing vascular fragility.  My goal now is to gather precise details about the hematuria to differentiate between these possibilities, especially focusing on quantity, timing, associated urinary symptoms, and relevant family history.baseline",

I'm not sure how much blood is \"too much\" or even what I really should be paying attention to.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I just see a little blood when I pee, usually after I go, and it\u2019s bright red. Sometimes it\u2019s there pretty much every time, but not all the time. It\u2019s not a lot, more like streaks, I think.
