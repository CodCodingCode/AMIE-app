    "input": "1. A 32-year-old male presents to the fertility clinic with a 2-year history of inability to conceive with his partner despite regular unprotected intercourse. He reports no significant past medical history and denies systemic symptoms such as weight loss or fatigue. On physical examination, his testes are small and firm, measuring below the normal range. Semen analysis reveals azoospermia with no spermatozoa detected on multiple samples. Hormonal evaluation shows elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, while luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone are within normal limits. Genetic testing identifies a mutation in a gene known to cause Spermatogenic Failure 6. The patient denies any history of cryptorchidism, infections, or exposure to gonadotoxic agents. Counseling focuses on assisted reproductive techniques and possible sperm retrieval options.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I am here, so I should explain my concern honestly but simply. I should mention my trouble with fertility and maybe my physical findings or feelings without going into too much detail or medical jargon. I want to be clear enough to communicate my main issue but not overwhelmed.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 32, and I guess I\u2019ve been having a hard time trying to have a baby with my partner for the past couple of years. My testes feel different, and we\u2019ve done some tests but nothing really clear. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m really worried and don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong."
