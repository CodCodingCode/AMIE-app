    "input": "2. A 28-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of worsening balance difficulties and intermittent slurred speech. He notes that he occasionally experiences tremors in his hands, especially when performing precise tasks like writing or using utensils. His family reports subtle personality changes and occasional mood swings over the past year. Neurological examination reveals wide-based gait, intentional tremor, and mild nystagmus on lateral gaze. Deep tendon reflexes are normal, and sensory examination is unremarkable. Brain MRI demonstrates moderate cerebellar atrophy predominantly affecting the vermis. His mother had a similar illness with gait difficulties starting in her early 30s. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic mutation in the GRM1 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia 44.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely worried about their worsening symptoms and the possible genetic link, so I should be gentle and allow them to express what\u2019s going on without feeling rushed or judged.\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling more unsteady when I walk and my hands tremble a lot, especially when I try to do things carefully. It\u2019s been happening for a while now, and I\u2019ve noticed I get more tired, and my mood has been weird sometimes."

    "output": "Well, uh, I guess it\u2019s kind of hard to do things like I used to. Sometimes I drop stuff or feel off balance more than usual, especially when I\u2019m trying to do things carefully. It seems worse when I\u2019m tired or stressed, but I\u2019m not really sure why."

    "output": "Umm, I think I started feeling kind of unsteady maybe a couple of years ago, and it's just been getting worse, especially when I try to do things like write or use utensils. The tremors come and go, but they get worse sometimes. I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse, it just kind of happens and I feel more off balance."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s kind of gotten worse over time, I think. Like, I trip sometimes even just walking normal, and stuff I used to do easily, like writing or holding things, feels harder. Sometimes, when I try to concentrate or do something precise, it gets worse, but I\u2019m not really sure what makes it better or worse, honestly."

Also, are there any other neurological changes you've observed, such as difficulty speaking, swallowing, or noticing numbness or tingling?",
    "output": "Um, I think I feel a bit off all the time, but sometimes when I try to do stuff like write or stand still, it feels... worse? Like my balance gets really shaky. And I dunno, my speech sometimes gets weird, like I stumble over words or feel like I can't say things right. I haven't noticed much about swallowing or tingling or numbness, but I do get pretty anxious about it all."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel a bit more wobbly if I tilt my head or if I just stand up quickly. It kinda feels like everything shifts a little or I get more unsteady, but I can't really tell if it's always the same or if it happens in a certain way."
