I know you mentioned a bit of yellowish discharge and some feeling of fullness, but I\u2019d like to understand better\u2014would you say the amount of discharge has been increasing or staying about the same? Is it a tiny bit, or has it been quite a lot? And when you move your head or touch your eye, does the pain feel worse?

    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking for specifics that I\u2019m not really sure about, but I guess I should try to answer. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting, but maybe I should give some details so they take it seriously. I\u2019m worried but also embarrassed about how long I waited.\nANSWER: The discharge has kind of stayed the same, not like a lot more, just a little more sometimes. When I move my head or touch around my ear, it does hurt a bit more, maybe like a 4 or 5? And no, I haven't noticed any dizziness or really any problems with my vision or balance.",
