I don\u2019t really understand what the eye stuff means, but I\u2019ve noticed some redness and sometimes my vision gets blurry, especially when I\u2019m tired. It\u2019s been getting worse, I guess, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s all connected. I just want it to stop and to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\nANSWER: Well, my eyes, they get red and sometimes blurry, especially when I feel tired or if I stare at something too long.
