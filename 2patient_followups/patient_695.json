    "output": "THINKING: I know I should try to explain clearly, but honestly I\u2019m not really sure when it all started, like if it was last week or maybe two weeks ago. I think it was a little while ago, but then it got worse and now I keep thinking maybe it was earlier, I don\u2019t really remember exactly.
