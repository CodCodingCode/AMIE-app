Also, have you had any recent infections, like urinary, genital, or other illnesses, that could help us understand what might be triggering these symptoms?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to be honest and tell her everything, but I also feel overwhelmed and nervous about all of this. I keep thinking about my friends who got sick from stuff like this, and I wonder if it\u2019s something really bad. I keep touching my skin and moving around a lot because I feel restless, which maybe isn\u2019t helpful but I just can\u2019t sit still.\nANSWER: Well, the spots on my arms and legs\u2014they\u2019re kind of raised, and some of them are pus-filled, like little blisters or bumps, I guess. They weren\u2019t there before I started feeling really feverish, but I think I noticed them yesterday evening, and now they\u2019re spreading fast. And about the infections\u2014yeah, I did have unprotected sex recently, like a few weeks ago, and I know I should\u2019ve gotten tested, but I didn\u2019t. I just feel like everything is going wrong all at once, and now my joints are just so swollen and sore, especially around my wrists and ankles. I\u2019m worried it might be something dangerous or serious, but I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me.",
