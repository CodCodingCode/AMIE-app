    "input": "2. A 27-year-old male presents to the outpatient clinic with concerns about infertility after trying to conceive with his partner for 18 months. He denies pain or swelling in the scrotal area and reports normal pubertal development and sexual function. Physical examination shows small, firm testes bilaterally, but no palpable abnormalities or varicoceles. Semen analysis reveals severe oligospermia with very low sperm motility and abnormal morphology. Serum hormone levels indicate elevated FSH and borderline low inhibin B, while testosterone and LH remain within normal limits. There is no history of infections, trauma, or exposure to gonadotoxins. Genetic screening identifies a pathogenic mutation associated with Spermatogenic Failure 4. Counseling focuses on fertility options, including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) after attempting testicular sperm extraction.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain in a way that shows I'm concerned but not exactly sure what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ll mention my main issue with trying to have a kid and how I feel about everything. I want to keep it simple but honest, showing I\u2019m worried I guess.\n\nANSWER: Hi, um, I\u2019m here because my partner and I have been trying to have a baby for quite a while now, and it\u2019s not been happening. I\u2019ve just been worried that something might be wrong with me, I guess, and I don\u2019t really understand all the things they\u2019ve been testing."
