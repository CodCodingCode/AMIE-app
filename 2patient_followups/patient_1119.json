Can you tell me exactly how much blood you saw during these times\u2014for example, was it a small amount or more\u2014 and how often these episodes have occurred recently? Also, when you've felt confused after meals, how long does that confusion usually last\u2014just a few minutes or longer\u2014and what things seem to make it better or worse? Understanding these details can help me see how serious these symptoms are and what we need to do next to keep you safe.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he's asking about the blood and the confusion, but honestly, I'm still pretty overwhelmed. I remember opening my eyes last night and seeing the blood, it was kind of dark and thick, and I was so scared because I coughed a little too hard earlier that day. The confusion after meals\u2014it's like, I just forget stuff, and it feels like my head's not clear for maybe half an hour or so, and I can't really think straight. Nothing seems to make it better, and honestly, I just want it all to stop happening.\nANSWER: Well, the blood I saw last night was like, a lot, I guess? I mean, it just came up in the sink and looked like dark coffee or something. And it was enough to scare me, I almost fainted. The confusion\u2014it's really disorienting, I forget where I am or what I was just talking about, and it sticks around for a while after I eat or drink something, I think mostly after I eat. Nothing really helps, and I keep thinking maybe I should go to the hospital or something, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me anymore.",
