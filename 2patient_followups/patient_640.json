I want to understand if you've noticed any persistent or worsening neurological symptoms, even if you haven\u2019t mentioned them before.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my vision and neurological symptoms, which I haven't really thought much about \u2014 I mostly just feel the pain and the blisters. But I guess I should tell them if I\u2019ve noticed anything strange like blackouts or weakness... even if I\u2019m kind of scared to talk about it.\nANSWER: Well, I haven\u2019t really noticed anything like blackouts or seeing double, but I do feel a bit off, like my head isn\u2019t quite right sometimes, but I didn\u2019t know if that was normal with this... or if it\u2019s something worse.",
