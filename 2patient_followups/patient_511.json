I need to reassure him while getting more details about his symptoms and encouraging him to get checked thoroughly.\nANSWER: Well, doc, I\u2019ve had this lump on my face for a few months now, and it\u2019s been getting bigger, like a lot bigger. There\u2019s also some sore patch near my jaw that keeps bleeding and scabs over but doesn\u2019t seem to heal. I\u2019m worried it might be something serious, maybe even cancer.
