Do you notice if your symptoms get worse at any particular time, like when you're active or when you're lying down? Also, have you found that anything helps or makes your breathing feel more comfortable, such as using an inhaler, changing your position, or avoiding certain environments? Sharing these details can help us better understand what's going on.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm nervous about all this, especially because I can't breathe properly and my cough just won't go away. I want to tell the doctor everything but I\u2019m worried about sounding silly or overreacting. I just need to make sure I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best and not missing something serious.\nANSWER: Well, the cough is pretty much nonstop, and my throat\u2019s sore all the time now. It gets worse at night when I\u2019m lying down, and I wake up feeling like I can't get enough air, even though I don\u2019t think I have a fever. Sometimes I hear wheezing when I breathe deeply, and it feels like something\u2019s really tight in my chest. I don\u2019t know if I should be worried about pneumonia or something worse. Should I be worried about my breathing?",
