And the lump, it\u2019s about the size of a little marble, kind of firm but moveable\u2014at least, I think it is.

I\u2019d like to ask a few more focused questions to better understand the specifics of your symptoms\u2014could you tell me exactly how much bloody nipple discharge you notice when you squeeze, like if it\u2019s just a few drops or more? Also, has the size or firmness of the lump changed since you first noticed it\u2014has it gotten bigger, smaller, or more tender? Regarding the skin dimpling, has it been there from the start or has it developed recently? And finally, do these symptoms come and go, or are they persistent most of the time? Your detailed responses will help me understand whether these features suggest something that needs urgent evaluation or could be less serious.\u201dtangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit overwhelmed but also curious about what he's asking. I want to be honest but sometimes I get sidetracked talking about other things in my mind, like my garden or my kids. I hope I can explain clearly, even if I\u2019m a bit nervous and maybe rambling a bit.\nANSWER: Well, um, I\u2019d say when I squeeze my nipple, I see a few drops, like maybe less than a teaspoon, but it\u2019s kind of bloody, and it\u2019s been happening off and on. The lump feels about the same size, maybe a little firmer now, and it still hurts, especially when I press on it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gotten much bigger. The skin around it, especially near the nipple, has sort of started to dip in a little, but I don\u2019t know if that was there at first or if it just kind of came up recently. The whole thing, it\u2019s pretty much there most of the time, not really going away, and I keep thinking about my sister who had breast issues, so I\u2019m worried it\u2019s serious.",
