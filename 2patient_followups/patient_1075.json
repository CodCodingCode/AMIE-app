    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about my eyes and what\u2019s happening to me. I don\u2019t understand all the medical stuff, but I know my eyes are red, itchy, and they water like crazy\u2014like I\u2019ve got something in them, and it\u2019s just worse now. I\u2019m scared it\u2019s something serious, maybe from the birds, and I don\u2019t want it to get worse and end up in the hospital or something terrible. I\u2019m also feeling way more exhausted than I should be, and all these symptoms together just don\u2019t make sense to me.\nANSWER: My eyes are still red and really itchy, and I can\u2019t stop watering them; it feels like they\u2019re irritated all the time now. It\u2019s been like this for a few days, and it\u2019s worse today.",
