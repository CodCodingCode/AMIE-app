I should mention my history and why I\u2019m generally anxious about it, especially since I\u2019ve had skin issues before and my family history.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m 67, and I\u2019m a woman. I have this spot on my face that\u2019s been there for a few months, and I\u2019m a bit worried about it. It started as kind of a small, flat bump, but now it\u2019s bigger and kind of looks waxy, like shiny or pearly, I guess. The borders aren\u2019t very clear anymore, and there\u2019s a little scar-like area around it that\u2019s been there a while. It doesn\u2019t really hurt, just feels firm when I touch it, and sometimes it itches or irritates a little. I\u2019m concerned because I know sun exposure isn\u2019t good, and my family has skin cancer in our history. Could this be something serious?",
