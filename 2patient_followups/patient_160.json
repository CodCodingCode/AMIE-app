If so, can you tell me more about when those episodes started, how long they lasted, and what, if anything, you noticed changing during those times? Also, how did these episodes affect your daily activities or decisions?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit anxious hearing about these episodes because I haven't really noticed anything like that myself, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m hiding something. I also wonder if that\u2019s linked to how I feel overall, but I\u2019m not sure what exactly fits that description.\nANSWER: Uh, no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt super energetic or irritable for days or needed less sleep or anything like that. I usually just feel tired, honestly, and kind of off, but nothing like acting wild or super different.",
