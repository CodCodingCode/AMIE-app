My sister had similar skin issues but hers looked different, more like rashes, but she also has allergies. I\u2019ve just been really tired from work lately, staring at the screen all day, and the weather\u2019s been super dry and cold, which I read can make skin worse. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s gotten worse and I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore.\nANSWER: Well, um, it sort of started a few months ago, mainly on my arms and elbows. I think it got worse when I was cleaning the apartment last weekend because I was around a lot of dust, and it\u2019s been dry and cold outside, so that might be part of it. My sister had something like this too, so I was thinking maybe it\u2019s from allergies or something, but I\u2019ve been trying moisturizers and stuff, but it doesn\u2019t help much anymore.

The patches are mostly on my elbows and forearms, and they look red and really scaly, like they\u2019re thick or something, and sometimes they crack open, which I guess is not good.

For example, have you noticed if the patches are crusted or have any pus, or if they feel warm or tender to touch? Also, when you mention cracking or scaling, do you ever see any open sores or dried-out areas with oozing? Understanding these details can really help me confirm what's going on and the best way to help you.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Well, the doctor wants details about how my skin looks when it\u2019s really bad, but that\u2019s kind of tricky because I mostly focus on how itchy and uncomfortable it feels. I\u2019ve noticed sometimes the patches seem to get crusty and maybe a little oozy, and when I scratch too much, they can crack open or get sore, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re infected or anything. I guess I should mention if they\u2019re tender or warm, but mostly I just want relief from the itching and hope it\u2019s not something serious.\nANSWER: When my skin is at its worst, the patches can look kind of crusty, and sometimes I see flaky scales and dryness. If I scratch too much, they might crack or become a bit sore, but I haven\u2019t noticed any pus or anything like that. They don\u2019t really feel warm or tender, just really itchy and irritated, and I worry about making them worse by scratching.",
