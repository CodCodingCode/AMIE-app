Can you tell me exactly how big it feels now\u2014maybe using your fingers or comparing it to something? Also, has the amount of pus you see or feel changed over the days? When you look for or feel the swelling, does it feel firm or soft to you? And regarding your systemic symptoms, like fever or chills\u2014are they still there, or have they gotten better or worse? Lastly, how are you feeling about all of this\u2014are you worried that it might be something serious?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I worry because the swelling has definitely gotten bigger and feels hard now, like a lump I can press but it's not squishy. The pus seemed a little more when I looked today, and I still have a fever and chills, but I\u2019m so scared it\u2019s something really bad. I just want it to stop hurting and go away, but I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s serious and I didn\u2019t notice sooner.\nANSWER: Well, the swelling\u2019s definitely bigger\u2014like, I\u2019d say it's about the size of a golf ball now, maybe a little more. The pus feels like it\u2019s come and gone, but it\u2019s still there sometimes when I swallow. It\u2019s hard and firm when I press on it. My fever and chills are still here, and honestly, I\u2019ve been very worried it\u2019s something that could be really dangerous.",
