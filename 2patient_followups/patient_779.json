    "input": "2. A 7-year-old boy was referred to pediatric urology for evaluation of abnormal genital development and recurrent episodes of urinary dribbling. The parents reported that since infancy, his urine stream was not only weak but also consistently directed downward between his scrotal folds rather than from the penile tip. On physical examination, the urethral opening was located near the perineoscrotal junction, accompanied by a bifid scrotum and a midline skin fold resembling a pseudovaginal cleft. The penile shaft appeared dorsally hooded and somewhat shorter than expected for his age. No palpable gonads were absent, and secondary sexual characteristics were appropriate for his age. Renal ultrasound was unremarkable, with no evidence of hydronephrosis or bladder abnormalities. Based on the clinical presentation, the diagnosis of pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias was established, necessitating staged surgical correction. The care team planned preoperative endocrine evaluation and counseling regarding postoperative urinary and reproductive function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 7-year-old boy, so I need to keep my explanation simple and focus on what\u2019s been bothering him or his family. I should mention his urinary issues and concerns about his development to give the doctor a clear idea without going into too much technical detail.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi doctor... I guess I came because my pee doesn\u2019t come out right and it kind of dribbles all the time, like I always have to wipe or something. And my parents say there\u2019s something weird down there, but I don\u2019t really get it."

    "output": "Well, the way he pees\u2026 it\u2019s been weird since forever, I guess. It\u2019s always gone down between his legs instead of straight out, and it\u2019s kind of weak too. It used to be worse, I think, but sometimes I notice that it\u2019s even more tricky or slow when he\u2019s been holding it a while. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s gotten better or worse because I don\u2019t understand if it\u2019s supposed to change. And as for things around his genitals, it\u2019s kind of hard to say if anything looks strange\u2014I just remember his opening being in a different spot and the skin thing, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not. It\u2019s all kind of confusing to me."

    "output": "Well, I guess he's always had it, like, kinda different when he tries to pee. It\u2019s been that way forever, I think, but I don\u2019t really remember when I first noticed it. It just sort of was always there. And he doesn\u2019t seem to complain much, but sometimes he seems to be having trouble or looks kind of upset about it. He's also been dribbling after he\u2019s done, and I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not. That\u2019s about all I can think of right now."

Sometimes it\u2019s a little dribbly after he goes, and I notice he has a bit of trouble aiming or finishing. It\u2019s been like that for a long time, I think. He\u2019s been acting okay, but I just noticed the way he pees and the way his parts look, and it makes me nervous."

    "output": "Um, there's this skin fold or maybe a little extra skin near where the pee comes out, and it's sort of in the middle, like between my legs. It looks different from the rest of my skin and I haven't really seen it change much, but sometimes I feel a little weird or self-conscious about it."

    "output": "Well, uh, the doctor said his penis looks kind of hooded and maybe a little shorter, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s bent or anything. The opening is not at the tip, it\u2019s more near the bottom, closer to the middle, I think. It kinda points downward, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."
