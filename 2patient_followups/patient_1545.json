    "input": "2. A 5-month-old male infant is brought in for evaluation of chronic coughing, noisy breathing, and recurrent pneumonia since birth. The parents note frequent episodes of choking and gagging during bottle feeds, along with excessive drooling and failure to thrive. Physical examination reveals biphasic stridor and mild intercostal retractions. Oxygen saturation intermittently drops during feeding, and there is audible wet-sounding breathlessness. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrates a defect extending through the posterior laryngeal and upper tracheal wall into the esophagus, consistent with a type 2 laryngotracheoesophageal cleft. Swallow study confirms aspiration of thin liquids into the airway. There are no cardiac or other anomalies apparent on echocardiogram and ultrasound. Early surgical repair is planned to prevent ongoing pulmonary complications and facilitate safe feeding.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my baby\u2019s issues clearly but simply. I should mention the main problems, like the coughing and trouble feeding, and how it\u2019s been going on for a while. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting, but I do feel worried.\n\nANSWER: My baby is five months old, and he\u2019s been coughing a lot and making weird noises when he breathes. He chokes and gags during feeds, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be growing enough. Sometimes his breathing sounds wet or crackly, and he gets tired easily."

    "output": "Um, he's been kinda not himself during feeds, I think. Sometimes he chokes or gags a lot, and he sounds like he's struggling to breathe, especially when he\u2019s eating. He gets tired easily too and doesn\u2019t seem to gain weight like he should. We\u2019re worried because he seems to get more tired and fussy, and it\u2019s been really hard to see him like this."

    "output": "Um, he's been kind of fussy, especially when he's eating, and sometimes he chokes or gags more than before. He gets tired really fast and seems to breathe weirdly when he\u2019s upset or feeding. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not quite himself, and I\u2019ve just been really worried because it\u2019s been happening for a while now."

Also, has there been any change in the severity or timing of the noisy breathing or choking episodes\u2014such as worsening when lying flat or during certain activities?",
    "output": "Um, yes, sometimes he sort of turns a little blue when he\u2019s crying or eating, like he doesn\u2019t breathe right. And the noises, they seem to come and go, but I guess they get worse when he\u2019s lying on his back or if he\u2019s upset. It\u2019s scary to watch him struggle like that."

    "output": "Um, he doesn\u2019t really have a fever that I\u2019ve noticed, but he does sound wheezy sometimes and makes a lot of mucus. We haven\u2019t been around anyone sick recently that I know of."

    "output": "Um, I guess he seems to get a little worse when it's colder or if he\u2019s been around other kids or something. Sometimes, it\u2019s just really noisy and hard to breathe, especially after eating, and I think he might have had a cold a few times recently."

If so, can you describe how often these happen and what seems to trigger them?",
    "output": "Yes, sometimes he gets a sort of bluish color on his face during feeding, like he\u2019s struggling to breathe or something. It happens maybe a few times a week, but I don\u2019t really know what causes it \u2014 he just coughs or chokes and then it turns like that. It\u2019s really scary to watch."

    "output": "Um, sometimes when he\u2019s on his back, it seems like he sound gets worse, but I\u2019m not sure if raising his head really helps or not. He sometimes chokes more when he\u2019s lying down, though."
