    "input": "1. A 52-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of progressive headaches and occasional episodes of nausea. She also reported subtle changes in her vision, including blurred peripheral vision, and mild difficulty concentrating at work. Neurological examination revealed slight papilledema but no focal deficits. MRI of the brain showed a well-circumscribed, extra-axial mass along the left frontal convexity causing mild surrounding edema. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted images and showed homogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. Surgical resection was performed, and histopathological analysis confirmed a meningothelial meningioma, characterized by lobulated growth and whorled patterns of meningothelial cells. The patient\u2019s postoperative course was uneventful, with gradual improvement of symptoms. Follow-up imaging at six months showed no recurrence.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today. I should mention my ongoing symptoms but keep it simple and honest. I might feel a little embarrassed or unsure about how much to say, but I want to be clear about what's been bothering me.\n\nANSWER: I'm 52, and I\u2019m a woman. Well, I guess I'm here because I\u2019ve been having these headaches for a long time, and they\u2019re getting worse. Sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach, and my vision isn\u2019t quite right\u2014like I see things blurry on the sides, and it makes me nervous."

    "output": "Um, well, the headaches come and go, but when they do, they kind of make everything feel blurry or out of focus, and I find it hard to concentrate like I used to. It\u2019s like, sometimes I just can\u2019t get them to go away, and it makes doing my normal stuff really frustrating."

    "output": "Well, they kind of come and go, I guess. Some days they\u2019re worse than others, and sometimes I feel like I just can't concentrate or focus on stuff like I used to. It\u2019s kinda making everything harder, especially at work."

    "output": "Um, sometimes they just come on really suddenly, like a pressure or a tightness in my head, and it kind of stays for a while. I feel a bit dizzy or like a little dizzy, and my eyes get sort of fuzzy, especially on the sides. I might feel sick, but I don\u2019t always vomit or anything. It\u2019s been happening more often lately, and I get worried because it feels different sometimes."
