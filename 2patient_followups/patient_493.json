You are experiencing the following symptoms:\n- Fatigue, weakness, and pallor\n- Shortness of breath when climbing stairs\n- Feeling light-headed or woozy when standing up quickly\nThese symptoms came into fruition gradually over the past three weeks. You\u2019ve noticed that you tire easily and feel more out of breath than usual, even with light activity. You also sometimes feel dizzy when you stand up suddenly, which worries you a bit. Your medical history includes a partial gastrectomy performed five years ago for stomach ulcers, and you\u2019ve been concerned about your diet lately because you don\u2019t eat many fortified foods.",
