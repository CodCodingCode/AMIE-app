    "input": "2. A 10-year-old female was referred to the genetics clinic due to her noticeably large corneas and learning difficulties noted since early childhood. On examination, her corneal diameter measured 14 mm bilaterally, consistent with megalocornea, and she exhibited mild nystagmus without signs of corneal clouding or elevated intraocular pressure. Developmental evaluation indicated moderate intellectual disability, including impairments in language acquisition and social interaction skills. Additional neurological signs included mild hypotonia and delayed gross motor milestones, though no seizures or movement disorders were present. Facial features included a high forehead, broad nasal bridge, and slightly downturned corners of the mouth. There was no significant family history of ocular or neurodevelopmental disorders, and genetic testing revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Brain MRI showed mild cerebral atrophy with no focal lesions. A coordinated care approach including special education, vision therapy, and regular ophthalmologic monitoring for glaucoma was initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 10-year-old girl, so I need to keep my response simple and honest, describing her main concerns without overloading her with medical details. I should also express some feelings of worry or confusion, as she might be overwhelmed by the visit.  \nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of funny... like, my eyes feel weird, and I get tired easier than before. Sometimes I can\u2019t really focus or remember things very well, and it\u2019s making school hard for me."

    "output": "Well, uh, school is kind of hard sometimes, especially with reading or focusing long enough, and I get tired pretty quick.
