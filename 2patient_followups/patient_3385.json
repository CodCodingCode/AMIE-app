    "input": "2. A 10-year-old female is brought to the neurology clinic due to a two-year history of increasingly unsteady walking and frequent tripping. Her parents note that she has developed stiffness and tightness in her legs, making it difficult for her to run or climb stairs without assistance. Additionally, she has experienced mild dysarthria and occasional hand tremors. On neurological examination, she demonstrates spasticity in the lower limbs, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and a wide-based, unsteady gait with evident limb ataxia. Sensory examination is intact, and there are no signs of cognitive impairment. Her developmental milestones were normal until symptom onset, and there is a history of consanguinity in the family. MRI of the brain reveals cerebellar atrophy, predominantly affecting the vermis. Genetic testing identifies biallelic mutations in the SYNE1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia 2.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep my answer simple and focus on what I feel. I want to mention the main things that have been bothering me without sounding too worried or confusing the doctor. I also need to include my age and gender as the instructions say.\n\nANSWER: I am a 10-year-old girl. I\u2019ve been feeling really unsteady when I walk, and I trip a lot more than I used to. My legs feel stiff, and I sometimes have trouble talking and using my hands, like my tremors are worse now."

    "output": "Um, I guess it's been kind of like that for a while, and I don\u2019t really notice much change, but sometimes I feel more tired or out of breath when I try to do stuff. I haven\u2019t really had headaches or anything like that, but I sometimes get a little blurry or foggy, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or what it means."

    "output": "Um, I think it started maybe like two years ago? I just noticed I was falling more and having a hard time walking straight. Sometimes it feels worse if I try to run or climb stairs, and I don\u2019t really know if anything helps, but it just sort of stays the same or gets a bit worse, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I guess everything feels a bit harder now. I trip a lot more, and I can't run or climb like I used to. Sometimes I get tongue-tied and my hands shake, so school is really tricky, and I feel kind of left out when I can't keep up with my friends."

Additionally, has an eye examination been performed, and if so, are any rings around the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings) visible?",
    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt or seen anything like yellow skin or tummy pain. As for my eyes, I guess someone looked at them, but I don\u2019t really see any rings or anything unusual around my eyes."

    "output": "Um, my vision just kind of gets fuzzy for a little bit, like when I\u2019m looking at something and it kind of blurs out, but I don\u2019t really know how long it lasts. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or my head feels funny, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the same thing or if it\u2019s all connected."

    "output": "Um, well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse exactly, but sometimes I feel a little more wobbly, and the tremors can be kind of stronger. My speech still sounds pretty the same to me, though."
