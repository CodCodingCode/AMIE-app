    "output": "THINKING: I want to tell the doctor everything because I\u2019m really worried, but I also don\u2019t totally understand what\u2019s happening myself. I keep thinking about the rash my cousin had last summer when she was sick, and how everyone said not to forget my vitamins, but I forgot what I was doing just seconds ago. I hope the doctor knows what\u2019s wrong because I don\u2019t feel good and I want to get better fast so I can be outside again like I used to.\nANSWER: Well, I sort of feel funny sometimes, and it\u2019s like I forget stuff really quick, even what I was just saying or doing. It\u2019s like, one second I\u2019m talking, and then I\u2019m kind of off somewhere in my head, and I don\u2019t know how to explain it but it\u2019s super weird. Sometimes I get tired and then I feel weird again, and it kind of happens when I was just playing or resting, I guess.",
