To help me better understand, can you tell me if during these bleeding episodes you've noticed any symptoms like feeling faint, dizzy, or very tired\u2014things that might suggest you're losing a lot of blood or that your body isn't coping well? Also, have you observed any swelling or pain in areas inside your body, like your belly or joints\u2014you know, places that aren't obvious from the outside? Knowing these details can really help us determine how serious this is and what the next steps should be.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so he's asking if I feel dizzy or super tired, like maybe I'm losing too much blood or something. I mean, I do feel kind of out of it sometimes, but maybe that's just from all the stress and all the injuries lately, especially since my knee and ankle look so bad and hurt a lot. Honestly, I haven't really thought about inside swelling... I guess because I didn't really notice anything weird like my belly or anything, but I\u2019ve just been so worried about bleeding out and feeling super weak, especially since I keep bleeding from my nose and the swelling in my ankle. I think I might have felt a little dizzy earlier, but I was also rushing around trying to do my homework and stuff, so I don\u2019t know if that counts.\nANSWER: Well, I do feel kinda faint sometimes, like I\u2019m gonna pass out, especially if I stand up too fast, and I\u2019ve been really tired even though I sleep a lot. I haven\u2019t checked my belly or anything, but my ankle is swollen and hurts so bad it\u2019s hard to walk, and the nosebleed just keeps going no matter what I do, so I guess I feel pretty weak overall. I haven\u2019t noticed any inside swelling I can tell, but I\u2019m pretty worried I might be bleeding inside or something bad like that.",
