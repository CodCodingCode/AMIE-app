    "input": "1. A 28-year-old male software engineer presents with a two-year history of progressive unsteady gait and difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning his shirt. He has noticed frequent falls and slurred speech, which have gradually worsened, impacting his ability to work. On examination, he demonstrates truncal ataxia, dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, and mild dysarthria. There is no family history of neurological disorders, and routine blood tests are unremarkable. Brain MRI reveals cerebellar atrophy predominantly involving the hemispheres. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the gene associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 16. He reports no visual symptoms or sensory deficits, and his cognitive function remains intact. Supportive care including physical therapy and speech therapy is initiated to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I'm here today, so I should explain my symptoms but keep it simple and honest. I need to mention the main issues I\u2019ve been having without trying to overthink what they mean. I also want to express how this has been affecting me emotionally, maybe with some hesitation or worry.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 28, and I\u2019m a man. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling really unsteady when I walk, and my hands have been shaking a lot when I try to do things like buttoning my shirt or writing. It\u2019s been going on for a couple of years, but it\u2019s gotten worse, and I keep falling more often."

    "output": "Well, uh, it\u2019s like I keep losing my balance and sometimes I can\u2019t really control my hands when I try to do things like button my shirt or write. I guess I fall more often now, and I\u2019ve started to sound kind of slurred when I talk, which makes me really self-conscious. I haven\u2019t noticed much else, but it\u2019s getting harder to do stuff I used to do all the time."

    "output": "Um, I think I started noticing it maybe about two years ago? Like, I\u2019d be trying to do stuff, and I\u2019d feel kind of unsteady or clumsy, especially when I was trying to do things that need my hands or when I was walking. It\u2019s worse now, and I guess I don\u2019t really see any activity that makes it better. Sometimes when I try to focus on balancing or doing small tasks, it feels like it gets worse."

    "output": "Uh, it's just gotten really hard to do things like buttoning my shirt or walking straight, and I feel kind of off most of the time. Sometimes I get scared I might fall or mess things up more than I already do."

I guess I haven't noticed any big changes in how I feel mentally, but sometimes I do get a bit more anxious or frustrated because of how hard it is to do things now."
