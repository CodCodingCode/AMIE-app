    "input": "1. A 62-year-old male presents to the neurology clinic with a 3-week history of progressive headaches, intermittent confusion, and difficulty with speech. He reports new-onset right-sided weakness and occasional blurry vision. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and no prior malignancies. On neurological examination, he exhibits expressive aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. MRI of the brain reveals a solitary, homogeneously enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe with associated edema. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows elevated protein but no malignant cells on initial cytology. Stereotactic brain biopsy confirms diffuse large B-cell lymphoma confined to the central nervous system. Further systemic workup, including PET-CT and bone marrow biopsy, shows no evidence of systemic lymphoma.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to describe my symptoms without sounding too technical or worried. I should mention the headaches, the confusion, and my difficulty speaking, as that\u2019s what\u2019s been bothering me most lately. I also want to include the new weakness and vision issues, but keep it simple and honest.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 62-year-old man, and I\u2019ve been having these really bad headaches for a few weeks now. Sometimes I feel confused and find it hard to talk, and I\u2019ve noticed I can\u2019t move my right side very well or see properly at times. It\u2019s all been kind of overwhelming and kind of scary."

    "output": "Well, um, at first, I just had the headaches, but then it kinda got worse, and I started to forget things more and sometimes I can't really speak right. I feel like I'm not myself, and sometimes I just can't do what I used to do without help. It's been hard, and I feel pretty tired and a bit scared about everything."

    "output": "Well, it kinda started just a few weeks ago, and I thought it was just maybe stress or something, but then the headaches got worse and I started feeling more out of sorts, like I couldn't think straight or speak right. Sometimes I see blurry spots too, and I don\u2019t really know if it's getting better or worse\u2014it's all kind of jumbled in my head."

    "output": "Um, it started out kind of slow, I guess. I felt a bit off in my head, like I wasn\u2019t thinking right, and then the way I speak started to get funny. It\u2019s been happening more often and feels worse now. Nothing specific triggered it, as far as I can tell, but it just kept getting worse over those weeks."

    "output": "Well, I haven't had any seizures that I know of, but sometimes I do feel kind of confused and a bit more forgetful, especially when the headaches get worse. My sleep isn't great either\u2014I wake up a lot, and I do feel a little more tired during the day, but I can't say if it's exactly related. And I haven't noticed my headaches change much based on the time of day or anything like that."

    "output": "Um, I think things have been getting worse, but sometimes I feel a little better for a bit before they come back. As for other stuff, I haven't really noticed weight loss or night sweats or anything like that, at least not really. It's mostly the headaches and feeling confused and weak."
