    "input": "2. A 45-year-old male presents with a ten-year history of slowly worsening weakness and numbness in his hands and feet, leading to difficulty with fine motor tasks and frequent falls. He reports muscle cramps and a noticeable loss of muscle bulk in his lower legs, accompanied by high-arched feet (pes cavus) that have progressively worsened. There is no known history of diabetes or other systemic illness, but his mother experienced similar symptoms in late adulthood. On examination, he has distal muscle atrophy in both upper and lower limbs, decreased pinprick and vibration sensation distally, and absent ankle reflexes. Nerve conduction studies reveal axonal degeneration with moderately reduced motor amplitudes and normal conduction velocities, suggesting an axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy shows loss of large myelinated fibers without significant demyelination. Genetic analysis confirms a mutation in the dynactin 1 (DCTN1) gene, consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2g. The patient is started on a multidisciplinary management plan including occupational therapy to aid hand function and balance training to reduce fall risk.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be confused or unsure, avoiding specific medical terms, so I need to keep it simple and focus on how he's feeling, mentioning the long-term issues and any recent changes or worries.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess it's been a while, but lately, I just feel more all over the place with my hands and feet. They've been getting worse slowly, and I keep falling more than before, so I thought maybe I should check if there's something I should do about it."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, it\u2019s been pretty tough. I mostly just feel kind of exhausted with everything, and sometimes I get really frustrated because I can\u2019t do things I used to do easily anymore. I also feel a bit down sometimes, like I\u2019m worried about falling or messing up at work, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s caused by my body or just feeling overwhelmed. Nothing else really stands out, I guess\u2014just all these weird feelings and the muscles feeling weaker and numb sometimes."

    "output": "Well, it's like, things that I used to do without thinking now feel harder, um, like gripping or holding small things. I\u2019ve started dropping stuff a lot more, and I get really tired and shaky sometimes. Walking has gotten a bit more unsteady, especially when I\u2019m tired or on uneven surfaces. It\u2019s frustrating because I can't do some of the little things I used to do easily anymore."

    "output": "It\u2019s been really hard sometimes, honestly. I feel like my hands and feet just don\u2019t do what they used to, especially when I try to do simple things like buttoning or walking steadily. I get really frustrated, and I\u2019ve fallen a few times, which makes me nervous. I guess I\u2019ve just been trying to push through it, but it\u2019s starting to bother me more and more."

    "output": "Well, I don\u2019t really get tremors or stiff feelings, and my vision stuff, if there is any, kind of just feels blurry sometimes but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s new or related. The weakness and numbness, it\u2019s always there, I think, but it\u2019s kind of the same most of the time, not really coming and going."

I haven\u2019t had any problems with my eyes or anything, and I don\u2019t remember ever being sick with anything recent."

    "output": "Um, I think my arms and legs feel kind of weak, especially when I try to do things like grip or walk sometimes. My muscles look smaller in my legs, and I don\u2019t really have those reflex kicks back like before. There\u2019s also some muscle loss that I can see and feel. Spasticity? I\u2019m not sure what that is, but I don\u2019t really notice anything like tightness or stiffness that I\u2019d call spastic."

    "output": "Um, I think I\u2019d like to just keep it simple for now and see how things go. I\u2019m a bit nervous about all the visits and stuff, but maybe I should talk to someone who knows more about this? I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s best."
