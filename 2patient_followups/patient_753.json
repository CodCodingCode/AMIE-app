    "input": "1. A 15-year-old female is referred to the genetics clinic due to progressive loss of peripheral vision and increasing difficulty seeing at night that began around age 12. She also reports frequent urination and excessive thirst, with recent onset of mild hypertension noted during a routine check-up. Physical examination reveals postaxial polydactyly on the left foot and central obesity with a body mass index in the 98th percentile. Cognitive assessment demonstrates borderline intellectual functioning with some learning difficulties at school. Ophthalmologic evaluation identifies pigmentary retinal changes consistent with retinitis pigmentosa. Renal function tests are mildly impaired, and ultrasound reveals structural renal abnormalities including mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Endocrine workup uncovers delayed menarche and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Genetic sequencing identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in the BBS14 gene, confirming Bardet-Biedl syndrome 14, and a multidisciplinary care plan is initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly but honestly, without sounding like I have all the answers. I should mention my vision issues and the other things I\u2019ve been feeling, and maybe express how worried or confused I am about everything. I want to seem straightforward but not overthink it.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 15, and I\u2019m a girl. Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having a really hard time seeing in the dark and, like, my peripheral vision is worse, especially over the last few years. Also, I keep needing to go to the bathroom a lot and feel really thirsty all the time. Sometimes I feel kind of tired and a little dizzy, and I don\u2019t know, everything just feels more complicated than it used to."

    "output": "Um, well, my vision's been getting worse... I can't see really well in the dark anymore, and I sometimes feel like things are shadowy or blurry. It\u2019s kinda scary because I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s gonna get worse. And besides that, I keep needing to pee a lot and I\u2019m super thirsty all the time. My body feels different too, and I don\u2019t really get why\u2026 it\u2019s just a lot to deal with."

It\u2019s all kind of a lot to figure out."

    "output": "Um, I guess I started noticing that I couldn\u2019t see as well in the dark, like I\u2019d be walking and start bumping into stuff or having trouble seeing the stairs. It\u2019s been getting worse, and sometimes I see like little flashes or spots, I guess. No idea about headaches or pain, but certain lights, like really bright lights, kinda bother me sometimes. I don\u2019t really feel anything else besides just being confused about it all."
