    "input": "2. A 3-year-old girl is brought to the clinic due to progressive abdominal distension and failure to thrive over the past year. Her parents report she experiences fatigue and reluctance to walk long distances, along with occasional episodes of mild hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting. Physical examination reveals a markedly enlarged, firm liver palpable 6 cm below the costal margin and mild hypotonia in the lower limbs. Laboratory tests show elevated transaminases, mild anemia, and increased serum creatine kinase levels. Cardiac assessment is unremarkable at this time, but electromyography indicates myopathic changes. A liver biopsy demonstrates abnormal glycogen with fewer branching points, consistent with a glycogen branching enzyme deficiency. Genetic analysis identifies biallelic mutations in the GBE1 gene, confirming Glycogen Storage Disease type IV. The patient is started on frequent, carbohydrate-rich meals to prevent hypoglycemia and referred for multidisciplinary follow-up to monitor liver function and neuromuscular progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what symptoms or issues I\u2019ve been having that made me come in. I should honestly describe what\u2019s been bothering me without trying to sound like I understand everything. I might feel a little scared or unsure about sharing everything, but I need to tell the truth about what I notice. \n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really feel right lately. My tummy\u2019s been getting bigger and it\u2019s been hard to walk or do much, and I feel tired all the time. Sometimes I get poky feelings when I don\u2019t eat for a while, and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Um, I guess I just feel more tired than usual and sometimes I get a little upset or cranky, even when I don\u2019t really want to. And after I eat, I feel kind of funny, like all dizzy or cold or something. It\u2019s confusing, I don\u2019t really know how to say it right."

Additionally, have you experienced any pain, night sweats, or other new symptoms that you think might be related?",
    "output": "Um, I think I\u2019ve been a bit more tired and my tummy feels different sometimes. I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019ve been going bathroom more or less, but I feel a little warm sometimes and a bit funny in my legs."
