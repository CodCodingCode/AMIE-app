    "input": "2. A 10-month-old male infant was referred to the metabolic clinic for evaluation of persistent hypotonia, feeding intolerance, and failure to thrive. His parents reported frequent vomiting and delayed motor milestones such as poor head control and absent rolling over. Physical examination revealed mild facial dysmorphism with a flat nasal bridge, generalized hypotonia, and mild hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory analysis showed hypoglycemia, elevated serum transaminases, and abnormal isoelectric focusing of transferrin consistent with a glycosylation defect. Brain MRI demonstrated cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement without focal lesions. Electroretinography showed diminished responses, suggesting retinal involvement. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations in the COG8 gene, confirming the diagnosis of Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Iiq. Supportive care including nutritional optimization, physical therapy, and surveillance for liver dysfunction was initiated, and genetic counseling was provided to the family.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 10-month-old male infant, so I need to keep my response simple and focus on what concerns the parents have mentioned\u2014he's been having trouble eating and not growing well, plus he looks different. I should express general unease or worry without trying to specify medical details, since I might be confused about what everything means.\n\nANSWER: Um, doctor, he\u2019s been acting really funny lately. He doesn\u2019t seem to want to eat much, and he\u2019s not really growing like he should. I just feel worried because he seems kind of different and weaker than before."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s kind of just been really tired and not playing as much, and he used to smile more but now he doesn\u2019t really, like he\u2019s kinda just there, you know? Sometimes he gets really fussy and won\u2019t settle down, even when he\u2019s not hungry or anything. It\u2019s been hard to tell if he\u2019s doing okay or if it\u2019s gotten worse."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s been kind of fussy sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have the same energy as before. He\u2019s not really moving much anymore, and he gets tired easily. I\u2019ve also noticed he\u2019s been vomiting more and seems a little off when I try to feed him. It\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s getting worse or just the same."

    "output": "Um, well, he\u2019s been maybe a little more fussy than usual, and he\u2019s not really sleeping through the night like he used to. Sometimes he wakes up a lot and cries. There\u2019s been a bit more stress at home with stuff going on, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related. I just worry he\u2019s not his normal happy self."

    "output": "No, I haven't seen any new lumps or swelling or anything like that. His skin sometimes seems funny, but I don't think he's had any fever or night sweats. He's been kind of fussy, but I'm not sure if there's a pattern or what might set it off."

Are there any enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen that you've noticed during recent visits or that the doctor has examined? Additionally, has there been any history of developmental concerns noticed by caregivers or teachers before these recent changes?",
    "output": "Uh, no one that I know has been really sick around us, I think. I haven't seen him with any big lumps or anything\u2014his belly or neck have looked normal, I guess. But he's been kinda behind on stuff, not doing what other babies do, even before all this got worse. It\u2019s been hard to tell if it\u2019s normal or not, but I\u2019ve just been worried."
