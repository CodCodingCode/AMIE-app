They didn\u2019t bother me much at first, but over the last couple of months, the bumps turned purple and bigger. The stomach pain and nausea got worse about a month ago, and I\u2019ve been losing weight quickly since then.\"\n- **Pain/discomfort levels:**\n\"The stomach pain is pretty intense sometimes, like a burning, stabbing feeling. It\u2019s worse after I eat.
