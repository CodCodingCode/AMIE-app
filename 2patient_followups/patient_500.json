For example, do your knees or shoulders ever feel like they're about to slip or actually do so? Are there times when your joints feel more unstable or like they might move out of place? Also, have you noticed if your skin stretches more than usual, or if you bruise easily? And regarding your family, has anyone else experienced similar joint sensations or issues, or been diagnosed with a connective tissue condition?baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little nervous answering this because I don't really understand all the details about my joints. I just know sometimes they feel weird or loose, especially my knees, and I've never really known if that's normal or not. I'm a bit worried about whether it's serious or might cause me problems later on.\nANSWER: Well, um, my knees kind of feel like they might break or slip sometimes when I walk or run, especially if I move quickly. I haven't really noticed my shoulders doing that, but my knees do feel kind of wobbly, and I don't know if that's normal.",
