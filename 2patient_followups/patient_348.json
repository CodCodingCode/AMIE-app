I\u2019ve been feeling this strange burning and tingling in my feet and hands\u2014like pins and needles\u2014and lately, my legs feel sort of numb, especially at night. It's been going on for about three months now, but it\u2019s gotten worse recently. The burning hurts most of the day, like a 6 or 7 out of 10. It\u2019s really bothering me, especially because I can\u2019t sleep well and I have trouble using my fingers and toes like I used to. I came because I\u2019m worried it might be something serious or permanent.",
