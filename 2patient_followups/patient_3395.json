    "input": "2. A 27-year-old man presents with a two-year history of gradually worsening unsteady gait and frequent stumbling. He notices difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning his shirt and handwriting, accompanied by intermittent slurred speech. There is a family history of similar neurological issues affecting his paternal uncle, who developed symptoms in his late twenties. On examination, he exhibits scanning speech, limb ataxia, and impaired heel-to-shin coordination. Eye movement assessment reveals saccadic pursuit and mild gaze-evoked nystagmus. Brain MRI demonstrates cerebellar cortical atrophy, particularly involving the anterior lobes. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic CAG repeat expansion in the CACNA1G gene, confirming Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 9. Management focuses on physical rehabilitation and symptomatic support, with genetic counseling provided to the family.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I'm here today. I should explain that my symptoms have been getting worse over time and that I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s going on with my walking and speech. I might also mention that I\u2019ve noticed some family history, but I\u2019m probably feeling nervous or unsure about what all of this means.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 27, and I\u2019m a guy. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a bit off for quite a while now, like I\u2019m unsteady when I walk and I keep stumbling sometimes. It\u2019s been happening for about two years, and it\u2019s been getting worse, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, yeah, everything feels kind of off lately. I keep stumbling more and it\u2019s harder to do things like tie my shoes or write, and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or off-balance. My vision sometimes seems weird, like things jump around a little, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s kind of scary not knowing what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Uh, no, I haven't really noticed anything like that. Just the walking and the speech stuff, I guess. But sometimes I do feel a little foggy, like I can't think straight for a bit."

As for other things, I do get really tired sometimes, and I\u2019ve lost a little weight, but no fevers or anything else obvious. It\u2019s all kind of confusing."
