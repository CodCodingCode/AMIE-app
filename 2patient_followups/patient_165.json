I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s wrong with me and if I\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m also kind of upset because I can\u2019t do my normal stuff and I don\u2019t want to stay here long.\nANSWER: My head hurts so bad, and my neck is stiff. I threw up again and I feel super hot and cold at the same time.",
