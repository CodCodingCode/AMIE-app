For example, using a ruler or a common object, like the size of a coin, can help. Also, since you first noticed it, have you noticed any areas around it that look different\u2014like roughness, scaly patches, or changes in border? And regarding its growth, do you think it\u2019s gotten bigger quickly or slowly over the past few weeks? If possible, could you describe or estimate how much it\u2019s changed in size or shape? This will help us understand whether it\u2019s something that needs further evaluation right away.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit overwhelmed because I don\u2019t really know much about this kind of thing, and I keep thinking about my mom who had that melanoma, so I get more worried every time I look at it. I\u2019m trying to remember when it first appeared and how much it\u2019s grown, but honestly, it\u2019s difficult to tell exactly because I\u2019m bad with sizes and I keep distracted thinking about the garden and my grandkids today. I want to give a clear answer, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll understate or overstate it, and I hate feeling so unsure.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe about the size of a small pea, so I guess around 5 or 6 millimeters across? It\u2019s hard to say for sure, but I do remember it was smaller when I first saw it, maybe about the size of a pinhead, and now it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, a little bigger\u2014like maybe the size of a little button or something. I haven\u2019t really noticed any rough or scaly edges, but I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on it, and it seems pretty stable, though I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s really grown quickly or just slowly.",
