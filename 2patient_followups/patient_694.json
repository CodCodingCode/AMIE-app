    "output": "THINKING: He\u2019s asking about any changes, and I guess I should say if I noticed anything different. But honestly, I\u2019ve just been worried because I saw some of the bumps get a little redder in the summer, and I don\u2019t really know if that means anything or if it\u2019s getting worse, I guess. Also, I\u2019m kind of nervous about what it might be or if it will ever go away, and sometimes I feel weird about how my arms look when I wear shorts or sports stuff.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t know, I mean, I think they look pretty much the same, but I did notice that the bumps kind of looked more red or like inflamed sometimes when it\u2019s hot outside or when I\u2019ve been running around a lot. It\u2019s not really bothering me more or anything, but I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s getting worse or maybe I should do something before it gets worse or if it\u2019s serious or not.",
