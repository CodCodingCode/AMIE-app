Can you tell me more about your episodes\u2014specifically, how long they usually last, whether they happen more at certain times of day or in specific situations, and if you've noticed anything that tends to make them better or worse, like rest, stress, or activity? Also, during these episodes, do you ever experience other symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, dizziness, or difficulty talking or moving?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: Oh no, I hope I can explain this right. I feel like these pains come and go but sometimes, they just hit me really hard and I can\u2019t walk or stand without it hurting so much. I get really scared sometimes, thinking maybe it\u2019s something worse that I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t really notice a pattern \u2014 it\u2019s just whenever, and I don\u2019t know what makes it better or worse. And during these times, I feel so weak and tired, and I worry maybe it\u2019s more than just pain, like I might faint or something bad.\nANSWER: Um, they usually last quite a while, like maybe a few minutes or even longer, and it feels worse when I try to walk or stand for a long time. Sometimes I get really dizzy or like I might fall, and I feel super weak, like I can\u2019t move right. It\u2019s like everything gets blurry and scary during that.",
