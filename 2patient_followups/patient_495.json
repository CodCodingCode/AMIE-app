I should reassure her and listen carefully.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve had this ear problem for a few months now, but it\u2019s really gotten bad lately. The pain\u2019s been worse and more constant, and I\u2019ve noticed some sort of bump on the outside, like I said. There\u2019s been a lot of discharge too, and I hear ringing all the time. I was just putting it off, I guess, but it\u2019s been hurting a lot more and I got worried enough to finally come in today.",
