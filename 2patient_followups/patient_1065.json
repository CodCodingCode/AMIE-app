    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and really worried about what he's asking. I don\u2019t have a clear idea of how much blood I vomited\u2014just that it was a lot and frightening. I\u2019ve been feeling weak and dizzy since then, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse or the same. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had anything like this before, so I\u2019m really scared it\u2019s serious. I just want help quickly.\nANSWER: I think I vomited like, maybe a cup of blood? It was a lot and I kept spitting it out, and I haven\u2019t vomited again since then, but I feel more dizzy and weak now. I don\u2019t remember feeling this way before, and honestly, I\u2019m so scared something bad is happening.",
