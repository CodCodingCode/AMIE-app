    "input": "2. A 28-year-old female presents with a several-year history of progressive hand weakness and difficulty manipulating small objects, along with frequent ankle sprains. She also reports mild distal lower limb numbness and a tendency to develop foot deformities, such as high arches and hammer toes. On examination, she has distal muscle atrophy in the hands and feet, absent ankle reflexes, and impaired proprioception. Sensory testing reveals diminished pinprick and vibration sensations distally in a glove-and-stocking pattern. Electrophysiological studies show diffusely reduced conduction velocities in both sensory and motor nerves, consistent with a demyelinating neuropathy. Her family history is notable for a maternal uncle who had gait problems and foot deformities beginning in adolescence. Genetic analysis detects a pathogenic mutation in the LITAF gene confirming Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1c. She is referred for multidisciplinary management including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthotic device fitting to maintain functionality and prevent deformities.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling worried or unsure about her symptoms worsening or about what\u2019s causing her problems. She might also be embarrassed or uncomfortable talking about her hand weakness and foot issues, so I should keep her comfortable and encourage her to share more.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t know exactly, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more off and clumsy than usual, especially with my hands and feet. My feet sometimes get really painful or weird, and I\u2019ve been worried about all the things I can\u2019t do like I used to."

    "output": "Um, well, it sort of just started a while ago, like a few years maybe? At first, it was just some trouble with small stuff, like holding things or tying shoelaces, and then it kind of got worse gradually. I don\u2019t really know what makes it better or worse \u2014 sometimes I notice it\u2019s worse if I\u2019ve been on my feet too much, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really it. It kind of just feels like it\u2019s slowly getting more noticeable."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess I\u2019ve been having a harder time with things like using my fingers for small stuff and sometimes I feel pretty unsteady on my feet. I haven't really noticed any problems with my vision, but yeah, I do get kind of worried about falling or dropping things more than I used to."

    "output": "Um, well, walking has gotten kinda hard sometimes, especially when I feel a bit off balance or my feet just don't feel right. I worry when I try to write or do small things because my hands don\u2019t work quite how they used to \u2014 like they get weak or I can\u2019t grip things properly. I haven\u2019t noticed anything with my vision that\u2019s different, but I do feel weird sensations in my feet and legs, like tingling or numbness. It\u2019s all kind of confusing and makes me scared about what\u2019s coming next."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel like I can't really lift things properly, like my arms or legs get really tired, and I just get more clumsy, but I'm not sure if that's the same as real weakness or just feeling tired."
