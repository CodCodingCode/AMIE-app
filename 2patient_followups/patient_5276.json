    "input": "1. A 52-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of progressive headaches localized to the right frontal region, accompanied by occasional nausea and visual disturbances. She also reported subtle weakness in her left hand that developed gradually over the last few weeks. On neurological examination, mild left-sided hemiparesis and decreased proprioception were noted. MRI of the brain revealed a well-circumscribed, extra-axial mass with a dural tail sign at the right frontal convexity, showing isointense signal on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images, consistent with a fibrous meningioma. The lesion caused mild adjacent edema and slight compression of the underlying cortex without invasion. Due to progressive symptoms and radiological findings, the patient underwent a craniotomy for tumor resection. Histopathology confirmed a fibrous meningioma with abundant collagen deposition and low mitotic activity. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and symptoms improved significantly over the following months.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my situation without sounding too serious or confusing. I should mention the main issues I've been having but keep it simple and honest. I want to convey that I'm worried but uncertain about what's going on.\n\nANSWER: I'm a 52-year-old woman, and lately I've been feeling really strange. I've had this pounding in my head and sometimes I feel a little dizzy or like things are blurry. My hand has been a bit weak, and I just don't feel right overall, so I thought I should come in and see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, the headaches happen a lot, sometimes I feel them for most of the day, and they don\u2019t seem to go away completely. The nausea comes and goes, and my vision gets a little weird sometimes, especially when the headaches are worse. I haven't really found anything that makes it better, but the headaches just stay kind of constant, you know?"

    "output": "Umm, well, at first it was just the headaches, and they would come and go, but lately, they\u2019ve been more persistent and sometimes worse, especially in the right side of my head. The nausea kind of comes and goes too, and I\u2019ve noticed my vision feels off sometimes, like things are blurry or flickering. The left hand thing has been bothering me because I feel a little weaker, and I think it\u2019s been happening more often. It\u2019s kinda hard to do my usual stuff, like cleaning or even just holding things, and I feel a bit tired all the time."

Are they worsening over time or staying relatively stable?",
    "output": "I think everything kind of came on slowly, but I feel like it's been getting a little worse, especially the weakness in my hand and the vision stuff. It's like, some days are better than others, but overall, I just feel like it's edging up somehow."

Also, have you experienced any recent changes in your mood, memory, or cognitive abilities?",
    "output": "Um, the headaches are sort of a dull, throbbing feeling, I guess? They usually come and go, and I don\u2019t really know what makes them worse or better \u2014 sometimes they just happen. And, yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling kind of foggy or forgetful lately, like I can\u2019t think straight or remember things as well as I used to."

    "output": "Um, I guess the headaches can come at different times, sometimes when I'm just sitting or doing nothing special. I haven't really noticed a particular time of day or activity that makes it worse, honestly. The visual flickering happens randomly, mostly when I feel a bit more tired, but I'm not sure if it's connected to anything specific."
