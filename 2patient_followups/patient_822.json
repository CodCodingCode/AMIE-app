    "output": "THINKING: I worry a lot about blood clots and I think this could be very dangerous, maybe even life-threatening. It\u2019s gotten worse quickly, and I\u2019m really scared that something bad will happen if I don\u2019t get help fast. I don\u2019t want it to be something serious, but I feel like I need to know for sure and I\u2019m nervous about what will happen next.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t really felt anything else\u2014no trouble breathing or chest pain or anything like that. But just my leg, it\u2019s staying swollen and red and has that terrible ache. The swelling keeps getting worse, and I don\u2019t know if I should keep walking on it or stay off my feet. It\u2019s very painful and feels like a deep cramp that won\u2019t go away.",
