Have you noticed any areas in your vision that seem like a shadow, curtain, or a part that\u2019s missing or darkening? Also, has this shadow or any other part of your vision suddenly appeared or gotten worse recently? Can you tell me if you've experienced any double vision, new floaters, or flashes of light that are different from before? Understanding these details will help me determine how urgently you need to be seen right away for a full eye exam.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: He\u2019s asking about specific changes like shadows, flashes, or double vision. I\u2019m not totally sure what all that means, but I do remember some shadows coming and going, and I\u2019ve been feeling like my sight is just plain getting worse every day. I keep seeing dark spots and shadows, like something\u2019s lurking in my eye. I guess I\u2019ve had some floaters, but they seem worse now. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve had flashes of light\u2014that\u2019s kind of confusing. I just feel scared and overwhelmed, worried I might lose my sight forever.\nANSWER: Yeah, I\u2019ve seen shadows and dark spots in my eye, and it feels like my vision\u2019s just going away\u2014like I can\u2019t see things right anymore. Sometimes these shadows come and go, and I think I saw some flashes of light too, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s gotten a lot worse lately, and I\u2019m real worried I\u2019m gonna go blind.",
