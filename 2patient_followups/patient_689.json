    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my pain and the yellowing, which is kinda scary, but I feel overwhelmed and I don\u2019t really know how to explain it all clearly. I just want to be honest but also worried they might think I\u2019m exaggerating or not understanding myself.\nANSWER: Well, the pain\u2019s been pretty bad since it started, and it feels like it\u2019s worse than before. The yellowish skin\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more in the daytime or anything, I just see it sometimes. About the alcohol, I guess I\u2019ve been drinking more lately, especially on weekends, and I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s making it worse. I\u2019m just really scared, honestly, because I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening or if it\u2019s something serious.",
