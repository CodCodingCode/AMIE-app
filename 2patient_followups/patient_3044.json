    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy presents with a three-month history of progressive headaches, which are worse in the morning and occasionally accompanied by nausea and vomiting. His parents have also noticed episodes of unsteady gait and clumsiness over the past few weeks. On neurological examination, he exhibits mild left-sided weakness and decreased coordination. Brain MRI reveals a posterior fossa mass near the fourth ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. The lesion appears well-circumscribed with heterogeneous enhancement, suggestive of an ependymoma. CSF studies show elevated protein but no malignant cells. The patient\u2019s developmental milestones have been normal until the onset of his current symptoms. Surgical resection is planned to relieve hydrocephalus and obtain tissue diagnosis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The question is pretty straightforward, but I need to give a vague answer and not anything too detailed. I should mention my headaches and maybe some of the other strange feelings, but keep it simple and not worry too much.\n\nANSWER: My head hurts a lot, especially in the mornings, and I\u2019ve been feeling sick and throwing up sometimes. I\u2019ve also been kind of wobbly when I walk and can\u2019t seem to do things as smoothly as before."

    "output": "Well, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more\u2026 tired and kind of funny in my head, like things aren\u2019t the same as they used to be. Sometimes I feel sick and it\u2019s harder to run around like I used to. It\u2019s been a bit harder to do my normal stuff lately."

    "output": "They started a few months ago, I think, and it\u2019s like, the headaches just keep getting worse, especially when I wake up. Sometimes I feel dizzy or sick, and I don\u2019t really know what makes it better or worse, it just kind of happens all the time now."

    "output": "Umm, I haven\u2019t noticed anything really different with my weight or if my cycle is weird or anything. I don\u2019t think I take any medicines like that. My eyes feel\u2026 um, kind of funny sometimes, like when I try to look at things, they don\u2019t always stay focused or I see double. It\u2019s been like that for a little while."
