She appears concerned, and her description hints at something urgent needing attention, but she may also be scared or unsure about what\u2019s happening. I should reassure her while carefully gathering more details about her symptoms and history.\nANSWER: I\u2019ve been having kind of a dull, deep pain in my eye for a few days, but yesterday it suddenly got way worse. Now I can\u2019t see clearly\u2014everything\u2019s super blurry, and I see floaters and stuff moving around. My eye is also red and really sensitive to light. I waited a bit, thinking it might just get better, but now I\u2019m pretty scared, and I don\u2019t want to lose my sight.",
