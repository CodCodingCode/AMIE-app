    "input": "1. A 24-year-old woman presents with a slowly progressive weakness in her lower legs and frequent tripping over the past three years. She reports numbness and tingling in her feet along with difficulty lifting her toes when walking. Family history reveals that her father had a similar gait abnormality and foot deformities. On examination, she has bilateral pes cavus, muscle wasting in the anterior compartments of the lower legs, and diminished ankle reflexes. Vibration sense is decreased in her toes, and she exhibits a steppage gait. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate markedly slowed conduction velocities consistent with demyelination. Genetic testing confirms a duplication in the PMP22 gene, consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 1. Supportive orthopedic interventions and physical therapy are recommended for symptom management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that I've been having trouble with my legs and walking, and it's been getting worse over time. I should mention the numbness and tingling because that might be related. I want to keep it simple and honest since I really don't know what all of this means, just that things aren't right.\n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve been having this weird weakness in my legs and I keep tripping lately, like I can\u2019t lift my toes properly. It\u2019s been going on for a few years now, and sometimes my feet feel numb or tingly. It\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening."

    "output": "Um, well, it's been kind of slow for a while, but lately I feel like my feet are worse, and I trip more often than before. Sometimes my legs feel so numb and kind of heavy, and I can't really lift my toes when I walk, which makes me trip, like I said. It's kind of messing up my day-to-day stuff, and I\u2019m worried about doing simple things without falling."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess I\u2019ve been tripping more and walking kinda funny, like I can\u2019t lift my toes properly sometimes. It\u2019s been slow, but lately, I\u2019ve felt a bit more unsteady, especially when I try to stand up or go downstairs. Sometimes I feel a little numb or tingly in my feet, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s gotten worse or if it\u2019s always been like that."

    "output": "Well, it's kind of making it harder to walk around normally, and I trip a lot now, even over small things. I feel a bit anxious about whether it'll get worse or if I'll lose more strength. Sometimes I feel embarrassed because I can't keep up with friends or do things I used to do easily."

    "output": "Umm, I haven't really noticed my arms or hands being weak or stiff, like I don't have trouble gripping things or anything. I think my coordination is okay? My legs are the main problem, I guess. No changes I\u2019ve noticed with my vision or anything like that, and I haven't had any bladder or bowel issues."

    "output": "No, I don't think I've seen any stiffness or weird tightness in my muscles, and I haven't noticed anything different with my thinking or mood. I mostly just feel kind of tired in my legs and a bit wobbly sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I haven't really noticed anything in my arms or hands, like weakness or numbness, but sometimes I feel a bit off when I try to do things that need a lot of coordination. It's hard to tell if it's related or just because of my legs."
