I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s real or not anymore, but I know it\u2019s bad and I need help before I lose control completely. I keep feeling paranoid and confused, and I\u2019m worried about hurting myself or someone else, but I don\u2019t know how to stop it.\nANSWER: I hear voices\u2026 they\u2019re always there, telling me I\u2019m watched. I see shadows moving when there\u2019s nobody around. My thoughts are all mixed up, I can\u2019t focus. I feel like I\u2019m losing control, like I\u2019m going crazy.",
