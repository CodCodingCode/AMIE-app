    "input": "2. A 7-year-old male presents to the neurology clinic with complaints of progressive weakness in both legs and frequent urinary incontinence. His mother notes that he has walked with a waddling gait since infancy and recently has had increasing difficulty climbing stairs. On physical examination, there is a large, uncovered defect with exposed neural tissue at the lumbosacral area, surrounded by an erythematous membrane. Sensory examination reveals decreased light touch and pinprick sensation below the L3 level bilaterally. Reflexes in the lower limbs are diminished, and there is evidence of muscle atrophy in the calves. The child underwent fetal ultrasound revealing spinal abnormalities, but no surgical intervention was performed at birth due to limited resources. MRI imaging confirms a diagnosis of lumbosacral spina bifida aperta with associated Chiari II malformation and syringomyelia. Multidisciplinary care including neurosurgery, urology, and physical therapy is planned to address his neurological deficits and prevent further complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 7-year-old boy, so I should keep my answer simple and focus on what\u2019s troubling him. He might be feeling worried or confused about why he\u2019s here, so I should acknowledge his discomfort or concerns without going into too much medical detail.  \nANSWER: I guess... I\u2019ve been having trouble walking\u2026 I get tired really easily and I sometimes can\u2019t control my pee. It\u2019s been like that for a while, and I just don\u2019t feel right."

    "output": "Um, recently, it's like, I can't really do the stairs like before, and my legs feel funny, kind of weak.

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been happening for a while, but I didn\u2019t really know what to say.

How quickly have they progressed?",
    "output": "Um, it\u2019s been kind of happening gradually, I think. Like, I started noticing I couldn\u2019t feel things in my legs as much, and I keep peeing a lot lately, even when I don\u2019t want to. It feels like it\u2019s gotten a little worse over the past few weeks or so, but I\u2019m not really sure when it all started exact."
