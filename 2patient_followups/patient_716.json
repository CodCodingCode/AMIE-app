Also, how do you generally feel emotionally about these bowel changes\u2014do they cause you particular concern or anxiety that you'd like to talk about?\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed discussing my bowel issues, but I know I should at least try to explain. I'm worried they might be serious, but I also don't want to seem like I'm complaining too much. I want to be honest but I hesitate.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I have trouble with that a lot during the week. Sometimes I feel constipated, and then I have to strain quite a bit. It can be pretty uncomfortable, and yeah, it does worry me a little because it feels different than before. It kind of makes me nervous about what\u2019s going on down there.",
