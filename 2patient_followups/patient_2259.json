    "input": "2. A 21-year-old female college student reports progressive difficulty in hand coordination and frequent tripping over the past three years. She describes numbness and a burning sensation in her feet, worsening with prolonged standing. Physical examination reveals claw hand deformity, distal muscle weakness predominantly affecting the peroneal muscles, and pes cavus deformities bilaterally. Proprioceptive loss and decreased pinprick sensation are noted in a stocking-glove distribution, along with absent ankle reflexes. Electrophysiological studies show slowed motor conduction velocities and evidence of axonal loss. Her maternal uncle was diagnosed with a hereditary neuropathy that caused gait disturbances in adulthood. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the MFN2 gene, confirming Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 7. She is advised on supportive therapies including occupational therapy, pain management, and regular follow-up to monitor disease progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should express her main concern and mention her ongoing symptoms, emphasizing her confusion and worry about what\u2019s happening to her. She might also feel a bit embarrassed or unsure about how to explain her feelings clearly. She should keep it vague and emotional, just describing her symptoms and her fears.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m not really sure how to explain it, but I\u2019ve been having a really hard time with my hands and feet lately. I keep tripping and dropping things, and my feet feel kind of numb and burning, especially when I stand for a while. It\u2019s been going on for a few years now, and I just feel more and more confused about what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Um, I guess it's been hard to do stuff like walking around or even holding things properly without dropping them. Sometimes I feel really clumsy, and I trip a lot now. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing because I used to be fine, and now I get tired way faster than before, even just standing too long. I'm worried about what it means for school and just... everything really."

For example, do certain times of day make them worse, or are there specific activities you find particularly challenging?",
    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s kind of like, sometimes my feet feel really weird, and I trip more than I used to, especially when I\u2019m tired or after standing a long time. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell exactly what makes it worse, but I feel more clumsy and also kind of numb in my feet. It\u2019s pretty confusing, and I don\u2019t always know how to manage it during my day."

Also, have you noticed any changes in sensation such as loss of vibration or proprioception, or visual changes like blurred or double vision?",
    "output": "Um, I think my muscles have gotten weaker in my feet and legs, and I just feel kind of clumsy. I haven't really noticed anything about my vision, though. Sometimes I feel like I can't really tell where my feet are when I walk, but I don't know if that's normal or not."
