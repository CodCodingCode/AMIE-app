    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents with primary amenorrhea and delayed puberty. She reports no history of breast development or growth spurt during adolescence. Physical examination reveals short stature and lack of secondary sexual characteristics, including absent pubic and axillary hair. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a hypoplastic uterus and streak gonads without the presence of normal ovarian tissue. Hormonal assays reveal elevated gonadotropin levels (FSH and LH) and low estradiol. Karyotype analysis confirms a 46,XX chromosomal pattern without any structural abnormalities. There is no family history of similar endocrinological or reproductive issues. Genetic testing reveals mutations in genes implicated in ovarian development, consistent with ovarian dysgenesis type 4.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my situation simply but honestly, emphasizing my worry and the strange feelings I've been having. I should mention my age and how I haven't gone through puberty, which is why I'm here. I'll try to express that it's confusing and maybe a little scary not knowing what's wrong.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 16-year-old girl, and I guess I just feel really different from other girls. I haven\u2019t started my period or grown much, and I don\u2019t have some of the body changes I expected. It\u2019s kind of upsetting, and I don\u2019t really understand why it\u2019s happening."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel a bit weird sometimes, like I don\u2019t really fit in or I\u2019m behind everyone else my age. I worry a lot about stuff I don\u2019t really understand, and I sometimes get really anxious when I think about everything."

    "output": "Um, I dunno, I guess I just feel kind of weird about everything. Sometimes I get really anxious or sad, but I don\u2019t even know why because I don\u2019t really understand all this stuff. It\u2019s like, nothing\u2019s changing the way it\u2019s supposed to, and that makes me feel kinda scared, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I\u2019m pretty short compared to other girls my age, and I haven\u2019t really noticed much hair in places I guess I should have by now. I don\u2019t think anyone in my family has anything like this, but I honestly don\u2019t know a lot about my relatives."

Do you feel comfortable with these steps, and do you have any questions or concerns about the next part of your care?",
    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019m a bit nervous about more tests, but I don\u2019t really know what they\u2019ll show or if it\u2019s going to make things any clearer for me. I just want to understand what\u2019s going on, I guess."
