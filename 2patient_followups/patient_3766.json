    "input": "1. A 32-year-old woman presents with progressive headaches and nausea over the past three months, accompanied by intermittent episodes of confusion and blurred vision. She reports recent difficulties with balance and mild weakness on her right side. On neurological examination, mild right-sided hemiparesis and papilledema are noted. Brain MRI reveals a heterogenous, well-circumscribed mass in the midline pineal region with evidence of fat, calcifications, and cystic components, suggestive of a teratoma. No significant lumbar puncture abnormalities are found, but serum alpha-fetoprotein and beta-hCG levels are within normal limits. Given the mass effect and progressive neurological deficits, neurosurgical intervention is planned. Histopathology confirms an adult-type mature teratoma with multiple tissue elements from ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origins. Postoperative recovery is uneventful, and the patient is monitored for potential recurrence with serial imaging.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is here because of ongoing, worsening symptoms that seem to be related to something in her head. She might be feeling overwhelmed or scared given the nature of her symptoms and diagnosis. She might also be confused or unsure about what\u2019s really happening, so I will keep her answer simple and honest.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 32, and I\u2019ve just been feeling really bad lately. I\u2019ve had these awful headaches and nausea that won\u2019t go away, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of dizzy and off-balance. It\u2019s been getting worse over the past few months, and I guess I just felt like I needed to see someone about it."

    "output": "Um, well, it's kind of strange, but some days are worse than others, and I guess I feel okay sometimes for a little while, then it all just comes back again. It\u2019s hard to say if anything specific makes it better or worse \u2014 I just notice I get dizzy, and my head and eyes feel all fuzzy, especially when I\u2019m trying to focus or do things."

    "output": "Um, it's been really hard sometimes, especially with the headaches and feeling kind of blurry, like I can't focus or think straight. It gets worse sometimes in the afternoons or when I\u2019m trying to do things like work or even just walk around. I guess I feel more tired and scattered, and it\u2019s kind of scary not knowing if it will get better or if I should be worried about something."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse, honestly. Sometimes things feel a little funny in my head or my eyesight gets kinda blurry, but I can't really tell if it\u2019s because of something I did. I haven't noticed ringing in my ears or had any infections lately, at least none I can remember."

Also, do your symptoms tend to worsen or improve when you change positions or during specific activities?",
    "output": "Um, I\u2019ve just been seeing a little more fog or maybe flashes sometimes, not sure if it\u2019s spots or what, and yeah, I get this weird sensitivity to lights too. As for the weakness or anything, I still feel it sort of come and go, but I think I notice it a bit more when I\u2019m standing for a while or bending down. Sometimes, when I change positions fast, I feel kinda dizzy or off balance, and it worries me."

    "output": "Um, I can't really say if anything specific makes it worse or better. Sometimes I just wake up with a headache, and it kind of stays or gets worse during the day. I do feel really foggy sometimes, and other times I feel weak or off-balance, but I haven't had actual trouble talking or anything like that. It's all kind of confusing."

    "output": "Um, not really, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I might have bumped my head a few times like accidentally hitting something, but I don\u2019t remember anything serious or that I thought was a big deal."
