    "input": "1. A 17-year-old male presents with recurrent episodes of unsteadiness and dizziness that have been occurring since early adolescence. These episodes last from several minutes to an hour and are often triggered by sudden head movements or physical exertion. He also reports occasional brief involuntary jerking movements in his limbs and mild slurred speech during attacks. Between episodes, he is neurologically normal with no persistent motor deficits. His family history reveals that his mother experiences similar episodic symptoms. Neurological examination outside attacks is unremarkable, but video-oculography during an episode shows gaze-evoked nystagmus. Genetic testing identifies a mutation in the FGF14 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Episodic Ataxia, Type 6. Treatment with acetazolamide has reduced the frequency and severity of his episodes.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to express their ongoing worries and symptoms in a way that\u2019s honest and clear but also shows they\u2019re nervous and unsure about what\u2019s happening. They should mention their episodes, how often they occur, and how they feel during those times, even if they\u2019re not exactly sure what\u2019s wrong.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just\u2026 I\u2019ve been having these weird episodes for a long time now, like since I was younger. I get really dizzy, and sometimes I kind of stumble or feel, I don\u2019t know, off-balance, and my speech gets kinda strange for a little bit. It\u2019s been happening more often lately, and I don\u2019t really understand why."

    "output": "Umm, well, it\u2019s like suddenly I get really dizzy, and my legs feel wobbly, like I can't really control them. Sometimes I feel kinda off in my speech, like I\u2019m slurring a little. It usually lasts for a few minutes, but sometimes longer. And I notice it happens if I move my head quickly or if I\u2019ve been running around. It\u2019s kinda scary because I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s gonna happen again."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of dizzy and off-balance, like everything is moving or I\u2019m gonna fall, and then I start sometimes jerking a bit. It\u2019s worse if I move my head suddenly or try to do something quickly. I don\u2019t really know what makes it happen, but it seems to come out of nowhere sometimes. After, I just feel a little weird or tired."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel kind of dizzy and like I can't really keep my balance, and my limbs kinda jerk sometimes. During it, I get a little fuzzy in my head, and my speech gets weird, like I'm slurring a bit. After, I just feel tired and a bit off, but usually it goes away after a while."

    "output": "Um, I guess I sometimes see things a little blurry or like the lights seem brighter during those times, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really related or just in my head. I haven\u2019t noticed any specific headaches or sound sensitivity, though."

    "output": "Um, no, I don\u2019t really feel anything permanent\u2026 it\u2019s mostly just during those times, you know? Nothing sticks around that I notice much, I think."

    "output": "Um, I don't really know if I felt my heart racing or anything like that. Sometimes I feel kind of sweaty or weird, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s connected or not. My skin doesn\u2019t change color that I notice, but I do get kind of out of breath sometimes, especially if I try to move quickly."
