    "input": "1. A 14-year-old female presents with a two-month history of progressive lower back pain and intermittent numbness radiating down her left leg. She reports occasional weakness in her left foot and subtle gait disturbances but denies bowel or bladder dysfunction. Her medical history is unremarkable, and there was no recent trauma. Physical examination reveals decreased pinprick sensation over the left L5 dermatome and mild weakness in ankle dorsiflexion. Reflexes are symmetrical, and there is a subtle midline lumbar dimple noted. MRI of the lumbosacral spine demonstrates a fatty mass consistent with a spinal cord lipoma extending from the conus medullaris into the adjacent filum terminale. Nerve conduction studies are normal. Neurosurgical consultation is planned to discuss possible intervention given her progressive neurologic symptoms.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms simply. I\u2019ve been having back pain that\u2019s been getting worse for a couple of months, and sometimes I feel numbness in my left leg. Also, I think my left foot feels weird sometimes and I walk kind of differently now, but I don\u2019t really understand all of this.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019ve had this pain in my lower back for a while now, and it\u2019s been kinda getting worse. Sometimes, I feel like my left leg is numb or tingly, and I think I might be walking differently or weaker on that side. It\u2019s pretty confusing and kinda scary, honestly."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes my leg feels really heavy or numb, and I get tired more easily when I walk or stand for a long time. I haven't had any problems with going to the bathroom or anything like that, but I do feel a little worried about it all."

    "output": "Um, I guess it started a couple of months ago, and it just kind of got worse, especially in my leg, and I feel like sometimes it\u2019s more numb than others. I don\u2019t really know what makes it better or worse, it just kind of happens."

    "output": "Um, I guess I sometimes feel a little wobbly or like my leg doesn\u2019t quite work right, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts or if I notice anything else. My speech is fine, I think, and I don\u2019t see anything weird with my eyes or anything. It\u2019s just the weird feeling in my leg and my back hurting."

    "output": "Umm, I don't know? Sometimes it feels more... I don't know, more uncomfortable if I sit or stand for a while, but it's not really like I can tell exactly when it\u2019s better or worse. Honestly, I haven\u2019t really noticed a good way to tell if a certain time or position changes how I feel."
