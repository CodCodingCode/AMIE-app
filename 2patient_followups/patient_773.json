    "output": "THINKING: I feel like I need to tell the doctor everything that\u2019s wrong, but I keep rambling or forget what I was going to say. I\u2019m just so worried it\u2019s getting worse and I don\u2019t understand why. I don\u2019t want to mess around or make it worse, but I also feel kind of embarrassed about how bad my skin looks and how much it hurts. I really hope they can do something fast.\nANSWER: It all started about two weeks ago, and now my hands and feet are just so bad \u2014 the blisters are so big and the skin is cracked and sore all the time. It\u2019s super itchy too, and I keep scratching. I\u2019m really worried I might get an infection or that it\u2019s not going to get better.",
