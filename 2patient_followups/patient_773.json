    "input": "2. A 32-year-old male presents to the urology clinic with primary infertility after three years of unprotected intercourse without conception. He denies any history of urogenital infections, trauma, or pain but reports episodes of mild lower abdominal discomfort during ejaculation. Physical examination reveals normal secondary sexual characteristics and a normally sized testes, but no palpable vas deferens bilaterally. Semen analysis shows low volume azoospermia with acidic pH and absent fructose, suggestive of ejaculatory duct obstruction or absence. Hormonal studies reveal normal levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone. Scrotal ultrasound confirms the absence of vas deferens and normal testes size and echotexture. Genetic testing is negative for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations. The diagnosis of congenital bilateral aplasia of the vas deferens is made, explaining his obstructive azoospermia and infertility.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to understand why I'm here and what symptoms or concerns I have, so I should be honest but keep it simple. I feel a bit nervous talking about this and maybe a little embarrassed, but I need to explain my situation clearly.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 32-year-old guy, and I guess I came because I\u2019ve been trying to have a baby with my partner for a while, but it\u2019s not happening. I don\u2019t really have any pain or anything, but I do notice some discomfort during, um, when I ejaculate, and I\u2019m worried maybe something\u2019s wrong down there."

    "output": "Well, I guess I haven't really had any problems with getting or keeping an erection, and my interest in sex seems normal, but I do feel a bit self-conscious about everything, especially knowing about the blockage and stuff. It's just kind of confusing and makes me worried about everything."

    "output": "Um, well, during when I ejaculate, I do feel like there's some discomfort, kind of like a mild pressure or fullness, but I\u2019m not sure if that's normal. I haven't noticed any big changes before, but sometimes it feels strange or different from what I expected. I guess I just want to understand what\u2019s going on and if it\u2019s something serious or if there\u2019s anything I can do about it."

    "output": "No, I don't think so. I mean, I haven't had any surgeries or anything like that, but I sometimes feel a weird sensation down there during, uh, ejaculation. It's kind of uncomfortable but I didn't really think it was anything serious."

Additionally, has your partner noticed any changes or issues with semen discharge?",
    "output": "Um, it's hard to say exactly. I think the amount has been pretty low, and it sometimes looks a bit different\u2014maybe thinner or clearer? My partner hasn\u2019t said anything specific about it, so I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s noticed anything unusual."

Additionally, do you notice any changes in the color or volume of your semen, or any other sensations like heaviness or throbbing in your pelvic region before, during, or after ejaculation?",
    "output": "Um, the discomfort is kind of like a dull feeling that comes maybe just before or during ejaculation, and it kind of sticks around a little after. It doesn't really go away quickly, and sometimes it feels a little sharper or more noticeable than others. I don\u2019t really feel any tingling or burning, just this weird, heavy sort of sensation. No major changes in the semen, I think\u2014it looks about the same, but I haven't really paid attention to the color or volume closely. Sometimes I feel a little heavy or like a throbbing sensation around there, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always connected to the ejaculation or just random."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I guess sometimes it feels like there\u2019s less or nothing comes out, and once or twice it just seemed really different, kind of clear or watery. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not."
