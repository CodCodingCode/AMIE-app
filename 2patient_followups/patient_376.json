    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about the blue coloring and what triggers it, but honestly, I\u2019m not quite sure. I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, but I do notice it\u2019s there a lot, and it kind of worries me, even if I don\u2019t say so.\nANSWER: Well, I just kind of notice it on my lips and fingertips sometimes, and I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s always the same side or different. It kind of happens when I\u2019m a bit cold or maybe just sometimes, I don\u2019t really notice a pattern. There\u2019s no pain or numbness or tingling that I feel with it.",
