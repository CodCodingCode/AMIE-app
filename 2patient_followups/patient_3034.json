    "input": "1. A 27-year-old woman presents to the neurology clinic with recurrent episodes of unsteady gait and dizziness lasting about 15 to 30 minutes, occurring two to three times per week for the past six months. She reports these episodes are sometimes triggered by stress or sudden head movements and occasionally accompanied by mild nausea but no hearing loss or tinnitus. Between attacks, she feels completely normal without persistent neurological symptoms. Her family history is notable for a father who experienced similar balance problems in his 30s, although no definitive diagnosis was established. Neurological examination between episodes is unremarkable with normal coordination and reflexes. MRI of the brain is normal, and vestibular testing reveals no specific abnormalities. Genetic testing identifies a mutation in the KCNA1 gene, consistent with Episodic Ataxia Type 4. She is started on acetazolamide, which leads to a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of her ataxic episodes.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what my main issue is, so I should mention my symptoms and how they've been affecting me, maybe mentioning my worries or how often it happens to make it clear I need help. I want to be honest but also nervous about explaining everything properly.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi. I'm 27, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been having these weird spells where I feel kind of unsteady and dizzy, like, really off-balance, and it lasts for a little while, like 15 or 30 minutes. It happens a few times a week, and sometimes it\u2019s triggered by stress or moving my head suddenly, I think. I just feel kind of scared because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s been happening for months now."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of dizzy and wobbly, like I\u2019m gonna fall over sometimes, and it happens suddenly. It\u2019s mostly when I\u2019m under stress or move my head quickly, but I don\u2019t always know what causes it. Sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach, but I don\u2019t hear anything weird or see anything different. It just comes and then goes, and I don\u2019t really feel anything else when I\u2019m not having an episode."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really do anything special on most days, but sometimes if I get upset or if I turn my head too quickly, that\u2019s when I feel the dizziness coming on. Between these times, I usually feel fine, like normal, but I\u2019m worried it might come back when I\u2019m just trying to do normal stuff. And, I feel kind of scared sometimes because I don\u2019t know when it will happen or if it\u2019s going to get worse."

It\u2019s mostly just the dizziness and unsteadiness."
