Would you say these episodes happen almost every day, a few times a week, or only occasionally? And when they do happen, are there certain times of the day or activities\u2014like being outdoors, using screens, or exposure to certain environments\u2014that seem to make it worse or better? I appreciate your honesty, as understanding how often and under what circumstances these episodes occur can really help us figure out what\u2019s going on and the best next steps.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I really don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I guess I should answer honestly. It's probably not that often, and I haven't really noticed a pattern, but the redness and irritation do worry me a little, even if I try not to show it.\nANSWER: Um, I guess it happens maybe a few times a week, but I didn\u2019t keep track. Sometimes it feels worse when I\u2019m outside or if I\u2019ve been looking at something too long, I think.",
