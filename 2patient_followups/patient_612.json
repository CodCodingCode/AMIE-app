To help me understand better, could you tell me a bit more about the bleeding\u2014does it happen only after bowel movements, or does it occur any other times? Also, when it bleeds, how much blood are you noticing\u2014like a few spots or more? Regarding the lesion's smell or appearance, have you noticed any foul odor or pus, or any areas around it that seem swollen or red? And finally, are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, chills, or feeling unwell that you haven't mentioned yet?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess the bleeding is mostly when I go to the bathroom, and sometimes I notice a little blood on the toilet paper, but not a lot. It\u2019s kind of surprising because I didn't really think much about it until recently when it got worse. As for smell or things like swelling, I don\u2019t really notice any foul odor or pus, but it looks red and sore around the bump, which maybe makes it feel worse. No fever or chills, but I did feel a bit run-down last week because I\u2019ve been working a lot, maybe overdoing it. I just want to know if this could really be something serious like cancer or if it\u2019s just something minor I can fix quickly.\nANSWER: Well, the bleeding mostly happens after I go, and I\u2019ve seen a little blood on the toilet paper sometimes, but not a lot, really. I haven\u2019t noticed any nasty smell or pus, but yeah\u2014around the bump, it looks red and feels sore, and I guess it\u2019s swollen now. I haven\u2019t had fever or chills, kind of just tired maybe from all the extra work lately, but this thing has been bothering me quite a bit now, and honestly, I\u2019m worried it might be something serious like cancer. I know I\u2019ve smoked a long time and had HPV before, so I\u2019m pretty nervous about what it could be.",
