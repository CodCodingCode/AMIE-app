When you notice these periods of increased activity or confidence, how long do they usually last\u2014are they just a few hours, a day, or longer? Do they tend to come and go regularly, like every few weeks, or are they more sporadic? And during these times, how do you feel overall\u2014do they help you get a lot done, or do they sometimes cause you to feel restless or make it hard to sit still? Also, how do these episodes affect your daily life, your work, or your relationships? Have you noticed if these mood changes happen alongside or separate from your feelings of sadness or low energy?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to explain how these moods come and go, but I honestly don\u2019t have a clear sense of the timing or how long they last. I keep forgetting if they are more often or just random, and I get mixed up about how they fit with feeling depressed or tired. I feel kind of overwhelmed trying to organize it all.\nANSWER: Uh, I think when I get those little bursts of energy or irritability, they don\u2019t last very long, maybe a day or so, but sometimes it feels like they come back unexpectedly, like every few weeks or something? And honestly, when I feel those kind of upanddowns, I can\u2019t really focus or get much done, and it\u2019s pretty confusing because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just having a bad day or if it\u2019s something more.",
