To help me understand better\u2014when you first noticed the skin discoloration around your ankle, was that at the same time as the swelling, or did it appear a bit later? And when you look at it now, does it feel more tender or warm compared to the other leg? Also, has the color changed further since it first appeared, or does it stay roughly the same?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I\u2019m really scared, especially now that I read online about blood clots and pulmonary embolisms, and with my family history, it all seems really serious. I keep thinking about my leg, how swollen and painful it is, and that dark skin around my ankle \u2014 I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s getting worse or what I should do. I was just sitting at my desk yesterday, trying to finish a report, and I felt this weird tightness in my chest, but I brushed it off because I was stressed from work and thinking about the wedding coming up. I guess I just waited too long; now I feel like I might be in real trouble.\nANSWER: Oh, doctor, I don\u2019t really get all the medical stuff, but my leg, it\u2019s swollen and hurts more than before, and the skin around my ankle looks darker, kind of like it\u2019s dying or something. I\u2019ve read some things about blood clots, especially since my mom had one when she was pregnant and I had one last year. The thing is, yesterday I was just sitting at my desk at work, thinking about how crazy busy the ward\u2019s been\u2014lots of people coming in, I\u2019ve been really stressed out\u2014and then I suddenly felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe right, like a sharp stab in my chest, and I got really scared. Do you think I could have a blood clot or maybe something else bad?",
