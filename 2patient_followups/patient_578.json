    "output": "THINKING: I feel really worried about the numbness in my feet and if it might be something serious like nerve damage or diabetes complications. I also notice I feel colder and more irritable, which makes me think maybe my mood or health is getting worse, but I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening.\nANSWER: Well, yes, I guess I have noticed that my feet feel more numb than they used to, and it\u2019s sort of getting worse. I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve had trouble walking or anything like that, but I do feel colder all the time and crankier too. I just want to know if it\u2019s anything really bad.",
