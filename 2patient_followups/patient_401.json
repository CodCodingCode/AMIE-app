It started near my belly button\u201cYou mentioned that your pain has become very severe and localized to your lower right abdomen. Can you tell me if, when I press on that area, it feels tender or if you notice it hurts more when I release my hand\u2014that would be rebound tenderness? Have you noticed any increased warmth or redness around your abdomen, or been running a fever? Also, are you feeling more or less nauseous now compared to when your symptoms first started? Lastly, how much do you understand about what might be causing these symptoms, and is there anything about your condition that worries you the most?\u201dchronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm feeling really overwhelmed and scared, and I keep thinking about how fast this all got worse. I don't remember exactly when the pain started or how it moved, and I keep mixing things up in my head. I just want help and hope it's not something really bad.\nANSWER: It started like last night, I think, but then today it just got so much worse and pain shifted to my lower right side. When you press on it, it hurts a lot, and I think it hurts more when you let go, but I\u2019m not sure. I feel really feverish and sick, like I might throw up again, and I haven\u2019t been able to poop or pass gas. I just keep thinking, is this my appendix about to burst? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening\u2014everything\u2019s blurry in my head.",
