She has a history of recurrent otitis media and mild hearing loss diagnosed in early childhood. Physical examination reveals a low posterior hairline, a mildly broad neck, and cubitus valgus deformity of the elbows. Her height is below the 5th percentile for her age, and she demonstrates delayed secondary sexual characteristics with Tanner stage 1 breast development. The patient\u2019s blood pressure is elevated at 140/90 mmHg, and a faint systolic murmur is appreciated on cardiac examination. Chromosomal analysis identifies a structural abnormality of the X chromosome, specifically a ring X chromosome, confirming Turner syndrome. Echocardiography detects mild mitral valve prolapse without significant obstruction. Endocrine workup shows hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and she is referred for hormone replacement therapy along with cardiology and audiological follow-up.\nWhat brings you in today?",
