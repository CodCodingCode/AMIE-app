    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents to the gynecology clinic with primary amenorrhea despite normal secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development and pubic hair. She reports normal growth and no significant medical history. Physical examination reveals normal external genitalia but a shortened vaginal canal. Pelvic ultrasound shows an absence of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina, with normal ovaries. Hormonal profile, including FSH, LH, and estradiol, is within normal limits, indicating functioning ovaries. The patient denies cyclic pelvic pain and has no family history of reproductive abnormalities. Further imaging with MRI confirms M\u00fcllerian agenesis consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. She is counseled on fertility options and the potential need for vaginal dilation therapy to facilitate sexual function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling nervous or unsure about her condition. She\u2019s probably not used to talking about her symptoms openly. She could feel embarrassed or confused about her body, so I should keep my questions gentle and supportive.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just wanted to talk about, well, not getting my period and\u2026 stuff I guess? I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m here, honestly. It\u2019s kind of confusing, and I don\u2019t really feel anything wrong, but my body is just... different."

    "output": "Um, I guess I haven't really noticed anything different, really. I mean, my body kind of looks like a girl\u2019s, but I don\u2019t get my period or anything, and sometimes I feel a little weird about it, but I don't know if that\u2019s normal or not."
