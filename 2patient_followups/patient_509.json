Can you tell me if the visual changes\u2014like the blurriness, flashing lights, or partial loss of sight\u2014started suddenly all at once, or did they come on gradually over a little time? Also, when you experienced the weakness or unsteadiness, was that something that came on right after the visual symptoms, or did it happen a little later? Lastly, how long did these symptoms last\u2014were they continuous, or did they come and go? Your answers will help me understand better what might be causing these symptoms and the best next steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I know I need to tell the doctor what happened, but my head is really foggy. I keep thinking about my cousin, who had similar symptoms once and ended up in the hospital. I was just sitting in my favorite chair yesterday afternoon, reading the newspaper, and suddenly my vision went all blurry, like when I look at bright lights for too long, but it just kept getting worse. Then I felt weak on my right side, and I don\u2019t remember exactly how long everything lasted\u2014maybe a few minutes, but it felt like forever. Things kind of came and went, and I just got more scared and confused.\nANSWER: Well, it all started when I was sitting in my chair, just reading the paper, and then my eyes went all blurry, kind of like with my old cold sores, but this time it was my sight. I think it came quick, but then the weakness on my right side showed up right after, and it didn't go away fast. I kept trying to focus\u2014I mean, I\u2019ve had headaches before but not like this\u2014and then I felt kind of dizzy too, and everything just felt off, like I was losing control or something.",
