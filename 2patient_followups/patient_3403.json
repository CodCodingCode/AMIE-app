    "input": "2. A 10-year-old girl was referred to neurology for evaluation of persistent seizures and cognitive impairment. Her parents noticed delayed speech and motor development from infancy, and she began experiencing focal seizures with secondary generalization at age 3. Neurological examination revealed spasticity in the lower limbs, marked intellectual disability, and poor social interactions. Brain MRI demonstrated extensive pachygyria primarily involving the frontal lobes, along with a large arachnoid cyst in the left parietal region compressing adjacent brain tissue. EEG showed multifocal epileptiform activity consistent with her seizure semiology. There was no perinatal insult or family history of epilepsy or developmental disorders. The patient was started on a combination of antiepileptic drugs with partial seizure control, and multidisciplinary support including speech and occupational therapy was initiated. Genetic counseling was recommended due to the suspected neurodevelopmental origin of her condition.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I am here today, so I need to explain what I'm feeling or what's bothering me. I should mention my ongoing problems and how they've been bothering me lately, even if I don't understand everything. I want to be honest about feeling worried or unsure about what's going on.  \nANSWER: I'm 10, and I guess I'm here because I've been having seizures still, and sometimes I just feel really confused or tired. My legs feel strange sometimes, and I find it hard to do things I used to do, like talking or moving like other kids. I've been worried because I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s happening to me, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s getting worse or not."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know exactly how long it lasts, but I feel kind of funny, like my head is all fuzzy, and maybe I see stuff that isn\u2019t really there? Sometimes I get really shaky, and I can\u2019t control my body much. I don\u2019t always know what triggers them, but sometimes they happen when I\u2019m really tired or upset."

For example, do you have any warnings, changes in how you feel, or things that happen to your body or mind?",
    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel kinda funny or different right before it happens, like maybe my head tingles or I get a strange feeling in my tummy. During it, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, just kind of fuzzy and then everything feels all mixed up after. I don\u2019t always notice when it\u2019s coming, but sometimes I just suddenly feel weird."
