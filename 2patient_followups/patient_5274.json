    "input": "1. A 32-year-old female presents with sudden onset of irregular, jerky movements predominantly affecting her right arm and hand, which started three weeks ago after a stressful period at work. She reports that the movements are inconsistent in frequency and intensity, sometimes disappearing when distracted but worsening with attention. There is no history of neurological disease or recent infections, and neurological examination including strength and sensation is normal aside from the abnormal movements. Brain MRI and routine blood tests are unremarkable. The patient describes significant anxiety and recent life stressors, including a recent breakup and financial difficulties. Despite the alarming motor symptoms, reflexes and coordination tests remain intact. Electromyography and other neurophysiological studies fail to show typical patterns seen in organic movement disorders. After a multidisciplinary evaluation, the diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorder is made, and the patient is referred for cognitive behavioral therapy and psychiatric support.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely scared or confused about her symptoms, and probably unsure if it's something serious or just stress. She might feel embarrassed about the movements or worried about what it means, so I should reassure her and ask gently for more details.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 32, and I\u2019m a woman. Lately, I\u2019ve just been having these weird jerky movements in my right arm and hand, and they kind of come and go, but it\u2019s been happening for a few weeks now. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong, and honestly, I feel pretty anxious about it all."

    "output": "Um, I guess they come and go kind of random, sometimes more than others. I notice they get worse when I\u2019m trying to focus or when I\u2019m just thinking about them. It\u2019s kind of scary, to be honest, and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s making them happen. They don\u2019t really bother me during normal stuff, but I feel pretty stressed about them."

    "output": "Um, they just sort of happen out of nowhere, and I don't really feel in control of them. Sometimes I think about it or try to stop them, but it\u2019s like they just keep going, and I don\u2019t really understand why. It makes me nervous and kind of embarrassed, honestly."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s kind of like... I don\u2019t really feel like I can control it? Like, they just happen without me really meaning to or noticing, but sometimes I notice they get worse when I\u2019m really stressed or thinking about stuff that\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s kind of confusing because I feel like I could maybe stop it if I tried, but I also feel like I can\u2019t."

And have you ever tried to intentionally suppress or stop the movements, and if so, what happened?",
    "output": "Um, I don't really notice anything before they start, like tension or anything. Sometimes, I try to stop them or hold still, but it's like... I can't really, and then I just feel sorta frustrated or scared, I guess."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I really don\u2019t remember having anything like this before. It just kind of came out of nowhere recently."

    "output": "Well, I don't really know, honestly. Sometimes it feels like when I'm really worried or focused on it, they get worse, but then other times I try to ignore them and they still happen. It's all pretty confusing."
