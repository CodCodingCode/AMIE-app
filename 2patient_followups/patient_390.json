    "input": "1. A 32-year-old woman presents with intermittent lower abdominal discomfort and a sensation of pelvic fullness that has been gradually increasing over the past three months. She reports irregular menstrual cycles but denies significant weight loss, fever, or gastrointestinal symptoms. On physical examination, a palpable adnexal mass is noted on the right side, which is non-tender and mobile. Transvaginal ultrasound reveals a 7 cm multilocular cystic lesion with papillary projections in the right ovary. Serum CA-125 levels are mildly elevated, but there is no evidence of ascites or distant metastases on imaging. The patient has no significant past medical history and is currently nulliparous. She is counseled about the possibility of a borderline epithelial ovarian tumor and the implications for fertility preservation. Surgical staging with careful intraoperative assessment is planned to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to understand what's been bothering me, but I need to be honest about how I feel, even if I don't really get everything myself. I should describe the main problems clearly but simple. I might also be a little nervous or embarrassed to talk about it, so I should just state what I've noticed without overthinking.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of uncomfortable in my lower belly part, and there\u2019s this weird fullness thing that keeps kind of coming and going. It\u2019s been happening for a few months now, and it\u2019s kinda making me worried, but I don\u2019t really know what it is."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes it kind of just feels full or heavy down there, and I guess it makes it a little harder to do things like I used to. I haven't really noticed any changes with my bathroom stuff or anything, and the discomfort seems kind of random, not really tied to my period or anything."

Like, I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s just in my head, but I\u2019ve been noticing it more when I\u2019m sitting, and it kinda makes me feel a bit tired or, I don\u2019t know, just off somehow."

    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s been happening for a while, maybe a couple of months?
