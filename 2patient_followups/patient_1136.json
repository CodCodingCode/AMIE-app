    "input": "1. A 52-year-old female presents to the clinic with a six-month history of progressive swelling in her right lower leg. She reports a feeling of heaviness and tightness in the affected limb, which worsens throughout the day. Her past medical history is significant for breast cancer treated three years ago with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. On examination, non-pitting edema extends from the foot to mid-calf, with mild skin thickening and no signs of infection or coloration changes. She denies pain but notes occasional discomfort when wearing shoes. There is reduced range of motion at the ankle due to swelling. Ultrasound of the limb rules out deep vein thrombosis. The clinical picture supports a diagnosis of secondary lymphedema due to lymphatic obstruction post-cancer surgery.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling worried or unsure about her leg swelling and wants to understand what's going on. She seems to have been dealing with it for a while and might be looking for some reassurance or answers. I should keep her explanation simple and focus on what she's experiencing without making assumptions.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 52, and I\u2019m a woman. My leg has been getting more and more swollen on and off for about six months now. It feels heavy and tight, especially as the day goes on, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to even wear my shoes comfortably."

    "output": "Well, it kind of started maybe six months ago, I guess, and it\u2019s just been getting worse, especially toward the end of the day. The leg feels really heavy and tight, and I don\u2019t really notice much pain, but it feels uncomfortable wearing shoes sometimes. The skin seems a little thicker, I think, but I don\u2019t see any color changes or anything. It\u2019s mostly just my right leg, and it seems worse than the other one, but I\u2019m not sure why."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t really done anything different or anything new that I can think of. It just seemed to gradually get worse over time, that's all."
