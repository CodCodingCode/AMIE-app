To help us understand better, can you tell me more about what exactly you remember happening when your symptoms started\u2014like, did they come on all at once or gradually, and what things, if any, seemed to trigger them, such as certain activities, times of day, or after eating? Also, have you had episodes like this before, or is this the first time? And when your muscles cramp or you feel unsteady, does anything seem to help or make it worse?\"worried_family_involved",
    "output": "THINKING: I keep thinking about how sudden everything is and how uncomfortable I feel, but I also worry that maybe this is something serious, like a problem with my calcium or maybe I\u2019m just making too much of it. I want to be honest, but I feel so scared and a bit embarrassed about all these strange things happening to my body. I also worry about my daughter and how worried she\u2019ll be if she hears I\u2019m in the hospital or something. I want to know what\u2019s wrong, but I\u2019m also scared it\u2019s something very bad.\nANSWER: Well, it all started this morning, I think, after I didn\u2019t sleep well \u2014 I woke up kind of shaky and then these weird feelings started. The cramps and the numbness just came all at once, like out of nowhere. I don\u2019t think I did anything special, but maybe I was stressed or didn\u2019t eat properly lately. I haven\u2019t had anything like this before, just these odd feelings now and then, but not like this. And the cramps, they just come suddenly and stay hard, and I can\u2019t help but tense up. Sometimes it helps if I rub my muscles, but then they come back worse. I just want to feel better for my family, you know?",
