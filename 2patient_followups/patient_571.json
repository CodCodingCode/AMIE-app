To help me better understand what's happening, can you tell me\u2014are you seeing any changes in your vision, such as blurriness or seeing spots? Also, is there any discharge coming from your eye, like yellow or green mucus? Did you notice any bumps or injuries around your eye, or do you remember hitting it during your game? And regarding the pain, is it still feeling as severe as when you first noticed it, or has it improved or gotten worse? Lastly, are there any new symptoms, like increased swelling, redness spreading, or pain that\u2019s suddenly worse?\"anxious_amplifier",

I just want the doctor to help me feel better and not be so scared that something really terrible is happening.\nANSWER: My eyes\u2014they look funny and I see stuff all blurry, and there\u2019s yellow stuff coming out, kind of gross. I don\u2019t remember hitting it, but maybe I did by accident? The pain is still really bad, like it\u2019s worse sometimes, and I saw my face getting all red and swollen too.",

To help me be more certain about what's going on with your eye, can you tell me if you're seeing a lot of yellow or green discharge from your eye, especially in the mornings? Also, when you look at your eye, is the redness mainly around the white part, or does the eyelid seem swollen too? And regarding your injury, you mentioned you don\u2019t remember hitting your eye\u2014do you recall if anything happened during your game, even minor contact or rubbing your eye? Finally, how severe is the pain now\u2014would you say it's the same as before, or has it gotten better or worse?\"anxious_amplifier",
