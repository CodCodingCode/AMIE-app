    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really tired and weak, and I don\u2019t want to sound overly dramatic, but I feel like I can\u2019t really do much. I worry about whether it\u2019s getting worse or if I should be worried about something like pneumonia, especially since I\u2019m older. I also hope I don\u2019t need to go to the hospital, but I\u2019m not sure how bad it\u2019s supposed to get.\nANSWER: Well, I can\u2019t really get out of bed or do much right now. I feel so exhausted, and moving around makes me feel even more drained. I haven\u2019t had any dizziness or anything, but I worry I might faint if I try to stand too long.",
