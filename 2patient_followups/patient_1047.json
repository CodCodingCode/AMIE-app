Then, I was working on building some scaffolding, and I just felt this tightness that got worse, and I guess I just kept pushing through because I didn\u2019t want to call in sick or seem weak.

For example, are you seeing just a few drops, enough to stain a tissue, or more? Also, how often are these episodes happening\u2014several times a day, once a week? And are they mainly in the morning, or throughout the day? Regarding your systemic symptoms like weight loss and night sweats, can you describe how significant these have been for you\u2014have you noticed a noticeable change in your weight, or a lot of night sweats? How often do these occur, and have they been getting worse over time?\u201dtangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, the doctor wants to talk more about the blood things, so I guess I should focus on that, but honestly I'm still worried about the whole picture. I mean, I cough up blood sometimes, and it\u2019s a bit more than just spots on a tissue, maybe like a little splash, but not enough to fill a cup or anything. It happens pretty often\u2014like I\u2019d say maybe several times a day\u2014and sometimes I notice it more in the mornings, but honestly it can be anytime. As for the weight loss and night sweats, yeah, I\u2019ve lost about 10 pounds that I didn\u2019t mean to, and I wake up soaked sometimes, like I\u2019ve been running or something, but I don\u2019t really know how serious all this is.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve noticed, uh, the blood when I cough often, like enough to see in my hand or on a tissue, maybe a little more sometimes, but it\u2019s not a flood or anything. It happens quite a bit\u2014like several times a day, really\u2014and sometimes in the mornings, but it\u2019s hard to keep track exactly. And yeah, I\u2019ve lost weight and I sweat a lot at night, like I mentioned, and it\u2019s been like that for a couple of weeks, but I didn\u2019t really think it was this bad right away.",
