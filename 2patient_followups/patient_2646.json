    "input": "1. A 3-year-old female is brought to the pediatric clinic due to delayed developmental milestones and persistent hypotonia since infancy. Her parents report frequent episodes of vomiting and failure to thrive despite adequate feeding. Physical examination reveals facial dysmorphism with a broad nasal bridge and scoliosis. Laboratory tests show elevated transaminases and abnormal coagulation profiles without evidence of liver infection. Brain MRI demonstrates mild cerebral atrophy and delayed myelination patterns. A metabolic workup reveals hypoglycosylation of serum transferrin, consistent with a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant in the ALG8 gene, confirming the diagnosis of CDG type Iig. Supportive management is initiated, including nutritional support and multidisciplinary developmental therapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is really young, so I need to keep my explanation simple and focus on what the parents have mentioned. The main issue seems to be persistent problems since infancy, like vomiting and not growing well, along with some physical features and developmental concerns. I should express my concerns clearly but gently, emphasizing the symptoms rather than trying to diagnose.\n\nANSWER: My daughter is 3 years old, and ever since she was a baby, she's had trouble doing things like growing and moving right. She keeps vomiting sometimes and doesn\u2019t seem to be reaching her usual milestones. I just want to understand what\u2019s going on and see if there\u2019s anything we can do to help her."

    "output": "Well, she's not really doing what other kids her age do. Sometimes she just seems tired or not as alert as before, and she doesn't sit or stand like other kids. She used to cry a lot more, and now she seems kind of... just different, I guess. I'm worried she\u2019s not catching up or getting better."
