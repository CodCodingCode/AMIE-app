    "input": "2. A 6-year-old male is referred to the genetics clinic due to severe developmental delays and a history of seizures starting at age 2. His parents note that he rarely speaks, with only a few single words, and has marked difficulties with balance and motor coordination, often stumbling while walking. The child exhibits frequent episodes of inappropriate laughter and a generally happy disposition despite his limitations. On physical examination, he demonstrates a wide-based gait, hand flapping, and microcephaly with head circumference well below the 3rd percentile. His EEG reveals characteristic rhythmic delta activity mixed with spike-waves, and MRI is unremarkable. Family history is negative for similar conditions, and methylation studies confirm an imprinting defect at 15q11-q13, diagnostic for Angelman syndrome. Treatment focuses on seizure management with valproate, alongside ongoing physical and speech therapies to improve function. The multidisciplinary team discusses prognosis and emphasizes the importance of supportive care and early intervention to optimize quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young child, so the response should reflect parents speaking on behalf of the boy. The main concern seems to be about his development and seizures, maybe some recent changes or ongoing issues that need addressing. I should be vague but honest about the reasons for the visit.\n\nANSWER: We're here because he's still having his seizures, and we're a bit worried about how he's doing overall. Sometimes he seems more tired, and we're just not sure if there's anything else we should be doing or watching for."

    "output": "Um, well, he\u2019s been kinda more tired than usual, I think. Sometimes he seems to get really upset or excited for no reason, and he\u2019s been sleeping a lot longer... but then other times, he wakes up really early and is restless. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the seizures or something else."

    "output": "Um, the parents haven't said anything about him gaining or losing weight or feeling cold or having dry skin or going to the bathroom a lot, no. He mostly just seems the same, but I guess he does get constipated sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related."
