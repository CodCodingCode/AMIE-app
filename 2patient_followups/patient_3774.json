    "input": "1. A 52-year-old male presents with progressively worsening chest pain and shortness of breath over the past three months. He reports intermittent palpitations and episodes of lightheadedness but denies any history of trauma or prior cardiac conditions. On examination, a firm, irregular mass is palpated along the left parasternal border, accompanied by a new systolic murmur. Echocardiography reveals an infiltrative mass involving the right atrium and adjacent myocardium, causing mild obstruction of blood flow. Cardiac MRI confirms a heterogeneously enhancing lesion suggestive of a neoplastic process arising from peripheral nerve sheaths in the cardiac tissue. The patient\u2019s history is unremarkable for neurofibromatosis or other genetic tumor syndromes. Biopsy obtained via transvenous approach demonstrates spindle cell morphology with high mitotic activity, consistent with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) of the heart. Due to the aggressive nature and cardiac involvement, he is scheduled for surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms, so I need to communicate my discomfort clearly but simply. Given the complex medical details, I should focus on how I feel and the overall concern. I should be honest but keep it understandable, even if it\u2019s scary or confusing.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 52-year-old man, and I\u2019ve been having this really weird pain in my chest that\u2019s been getting worse over the last few months. I feel out of breath a lot and sometimes lightheaded, like I might faint. Honestly, I\u2019m just worried because it\u2019s all been so strange and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, it's been making things like walking around or even just doing small chores pretty hard. Sometimes I feel more tired or short of breath, and I don't really know if anything I do makes it any better or worse\u2014it's just kind of there most of the time."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been hard to do things I used to, like walking around or even just being active without feeling like I can\u2019t breathe right away.

I do wake up at night sometimes feeling like I can\u2019t get enough air, kind of panicky."
