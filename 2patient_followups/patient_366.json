Have you experienced any sudden changes in your vision, like dark spots, shadowy areas, or if something has looked like it's missing or darker in part of your sight? Also, can you tell me if these symptoms have been getting worse recently or if they've stayed about the same? This information will help us determine if any urgent eye examination is needed.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so they\u2019re asking about my vision, which I don\u2019t really think about that much, but I\u2019ve noticed sometimes I get these weird blurry spots or flashes, especially if I\u2019m tired or after eating something greasy. Honestly, I\u2019ve always had kind of floaters in my eyes, like little shadows or threads, but recently, it\u2019s been worse when I\u2019m short of breath or really exhausted\u2014I guess because I\u2019ve been more tired than usual. It\u2019s kinda scary because my dad had eye problems too, and I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s related, but I\u2019m worried about it getting worse or maybe it\u2019s all connected because my symptoms are just piling up.\nANSWER: Well, I mean, I do see these little spots or shadows that move around sometimes, mostly when my head\u2019s a bit foggy or I\u2019m really worn out, and lately, I\u2019ve noticed them more when I\u2019ve been feeling breathless. It\u2019s like, especially if I\u2019ve been working in the yard or something on the weekend, or even just trying to relax after a long day, they seem to be worse. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse recently or if it\u2019s just my imagination, but it\u2019s been kinda bothering me a lot.",
