    "output": "THINKING: I don\u2019t really wanna go into details, but I guess I\u2019ve had some weird thoughts before, like hearing stuff or seeing things when I was messed up, but it never lasted this long or got this bad. I don\u2019t want to make it seem like I got a problem all the time, though. It\u2019s probably nothing, and I just wanna get out of here with whatever helps me sleep or chill.\nANSWER: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some of that stuff before, but it\u2019s only when I\u2019m high or coming down. This time, it\u2019s been going on for days, and I feel like it\u2019s more than just the drugs.",
