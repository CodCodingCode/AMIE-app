    "input": "2. A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with a six-week history of rapidly enlarging lower abdominal mass and intermittent lower back pain. She also reports unexpected episodes of vaginal spotting and a sensation of urinary frequency without dysuria. Her medical history is unremarkable except for controlled hypertension. On examination, the uterus is palpably enlarged, firm, and irregular, extending to just above the umbilicus. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates a large, heterogeneous uterine mass measuring 10 cm with areas suggestive of necrosis. Laboratory tests reveal mild anemia, and CA-125 levels are within normal limits. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows a bulky uterine lesion with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement, raising suspicion for malignancy. A subsequent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy confirms high-grade leiomyosarcoma on histopathology.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: She might be worried or confused about her symptoms, possibly feeling scared about the new growths and the changes she's noticed. I should keep my response simple and honest, mentioning her main concerns without assuming too much.  \nANSWER: I\u2019ve just been feeling really uncomfortable down there for a few weeks now. I noticed this thing in my belly that\u2019s gotten bigger, and I\u2019ve been having some weird bleeding and feeling like I need to pee more often, but it\u2019s not always the same."

    "output": "Um, well, it's been pretty hard lately. I feel tired all the time, and sometimes I just want to stay in bed because it\u2019s all so confusing and uncomfortable. I don\u2019t really know if anything else is wrong, but I feel like I\u2019m just not myself anymore, and it scares me."
