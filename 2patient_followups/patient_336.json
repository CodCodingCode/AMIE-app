It's important she's comfortable sharing her worries so I can help her figure out what\u2019s going on.\nANSWER: Well, I've been having this deep, kind of constant ache in my right hip for a few months now. It feels worse when I try to get up after sitting or when I walk a lot, and I\u2019ve started noticing some clicking sounds when I move around, which worries me. It\u2019s making it harder for me to do my gardening or climb stairs like I used to. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit worried about it getting worse or maybe needing something serious done.",
