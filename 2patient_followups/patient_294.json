What does it mean?\u201d\n- \u201cAm I at risk because of my family history?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat should I do next?\u201d\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- Gestures towards affected areas when describing symptoms.\n- Slightly fidgeting with her hands or adjusting her clothing.\n- Maintaining eye contact, showing concern.\n- Nodding attentively when listening, expressing reassurance or worry as appropriate.\n- Slightly leaning forward when asking questions.\n---\n**INFORMATION FLOW:**\n**VOLUNTEER IMMEDIATELY:**\n- \u201cI\u2019ve had these red, scaly patches on my forearm for a few months now, and they don\u2019t seem to heal. I also noticed some new growths on my shoulder. I\u2019m worried because they\u2019ve changed how they look.\u201d\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \u201cMy family has a history of skin cancer, and I\u2019ve had quite a few sunburns over the years, especially when I was younger.\u201d\n- \u201cThe patches sometimes itch, but they\u2019re not painful. I just don\u2019t want it to get worse.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ve tried some over-the-counter creams, but nothing has helped.\u201d\"Sarah, I appreciate you sharing those details. I\u2019d like to ask a few more specific questions to make sure we\u2019re understanding how your skin patches are doing. Have you noticed any tiny spots that blood when scratched, or any parts that seem to be scratching more than before? Also, do these patches feel more itchy, rough, or scaly than when you first saw them? Even small differences can sometimes point to how active these lesions are. And before we talk about treatment, I want to check\u2014how much do you understand about psoriasis, and do you have any worries or questions about what this might mean for you?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking me detailed questions about my patches, which makes me a little nervous because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s important or what to look for. I feel overwhelmed trying to understand what they\u2019re asking and worried I might not be giving the right answers, but I want to be honest.\nANSWER: Um, well, I haven\u2019t really seen any tiny spots that bleed or anything like that, but some parts do feel itchier or rougher than at first. I\u2019m not really sure if I understand psoriasis\u2014I\u2019ve just heard the word\u2014but I\u2019m worried it could be bad or something serious.",
