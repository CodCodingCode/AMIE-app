I need to reassure her she's not alone and that her concerns are normal for her age, even if it feels confusing. I should ask about her feelings without making her more anxious.\nANSWER: Well, Emily, it\u2019s okay to feel a little weird about all these changes. Your mom said you\u2019ve been growing faster and noticing some new things, so I\u2019d like to ask you about how you\u2019re feeling and what you\u2019ve noticed, just so I can understand better.",
