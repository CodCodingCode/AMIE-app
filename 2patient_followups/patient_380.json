    "input": "1. A 19-year-old female college student presents with a two-month history of progressive lower abdominal pain and bloating, accompanied by irregular menstrual cycles. She reports a palpable mass in her lower abdomen and occasional nausea but denies fever or weight loss. On physical examination, there is a firm, fixed pelvic mass palpable on bimanual exam. Ultrasound reveals a large, heterogeneous ovarian mass with cystic and solid components. Serum tumor markers show elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and mildly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while beta-hCG is normal. MRI confirms the presence of a complex ovarian tumor without obvious metastasis. Given her age and presentation, an immature teratoma of the ovary is suspected and surgical exploration is planned. Histopathology after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy confirms a grade 2 immature teratoma, and she is scheduled for close follow-up with consideration for adjuvant chemotherapy depending on staging.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to explain her symptoms casually and honestly, expressing her worry without giving too much technical detail. She should mention her discomfort, the duration, and her feelings of confusion or fear, keeping it simple and personal.\n\nANSWER: I'm 19, and I\u2019m a girl. I\u2019ve been having this strange, uncomfortable feeling in my lower belly for a couple of months now, and it keeps getting worse. Sometimes I feel really bloated and nauseous, and I found a lump down there that I can\u2019t really ignore anymore."
