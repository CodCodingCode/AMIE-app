And when you gently feel it, would you say it's firm or soft? Also, do you notice any tenderness or discomfort there, especially when pressing on it? Regarding your systemic symptoms\u2014do you ever feel feverish, or notice those night sweats happening more frequently or intensely? Understanding these details will help me better determine what might be going on.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to get more details about the swelling and symptoms, but I feel a little shy or unsure about how much I should say. I want to be honest but also worried about saying too much or sounding crazy.\nANSWER: Um, the swelling hasn\u2019t really changed size that I\u2019ve noticed. It\u2019s sort of the same, maybe a little firm when I press on it, but no pain or anything. I don\u2019t really feel feverish, just the night sweats and all that.",
