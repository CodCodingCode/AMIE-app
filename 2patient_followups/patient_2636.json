    "input": "1. A 6-year-old boy was brought to the neurology clinic with delayed motor milestones and difficulty walking independently. His parents noticed frequent falls and progressive muscle weakness, primarily affecting his proximal limbs. On examination, he exhibited hypotonia, calf hypertrophy, and mild joint contractures. Cognitive development appeared normal, but he showed signs of mild intellectual delay. Creatine kinase levels were elevated, and electromyography suggested a myopathic pattern. Brain MRI revealed subtle structural abnormalities consistent with cortical dysplasia. Muscle biopsy demonstrated reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, confirming a diagnosis of Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy, Type a, 5. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the FKRP gene, supporting the clinical and pathological findings.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should honestly describe what\u2019s been bothering me, but I might not be very clear because it\u2019s confusing and I don\u2019t really understand all this stuff. I\u2019ll try to keep it simple but also mention what I feel the most.  \nANSWER: Well, I guess I just feel kinda tired more than usual and sometimes I get confused about my muscles, like they don\u2019t always work right. My legs feel weird and I fall a lot, even when I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything different."

    "output": "Um, I think it started a little while ago, maybe when he was really little? Things haven't really gotten better, and sometimes he falls more or it's harder for him to move around, especially lately. I guess playing or being active makes it worse, but I don't really know why. It just feels kind of worse sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I don't really know how to say it, but I get tired a lot and sometimes I fall when I try to run or jump. There are times I feel a lot weaker and, like, stuff hurts more, especially if I try to do things fast. Maybe when I rest, I feel a little better, but I still feel weird sometimes."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel kinda tired more than before, even when I haven't done much. And I get these little numb feelings in my arms and legs sometimes, like pins and needles. It's kind of confusing, and I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s connected or not."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think so. None of my family has seen the doctor for anything like this or have similar trouble walking or falling."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I get tired faster when I run a lot, and my legs feel kinda weak, like they don\u2019t want to move as much as before. I don\u2019t really know when it happens, but I just feel different sometimes."

    "output": "I don't really know if my eyes are doing... something funny. Like, I don't see things right sometimes, and I get tired looking around, I think. My eyes might not move perfectly, but I don\u2019t really feel pain or anything."

    "output": "Um, he's been the same pretty much, but sometimes he just gets really tired when trying to play, and he falls more easily now. I don\u2019t think anything's suddenly worse, but I\u2019m worried he\u2019s not getting any better either."
