Also, can you tell me about your usual substance use habits\u2014do you use inhalants or other drugs regularly, and have you experienced anything similar before these episodes started?\"  CURRENT CLINICAL PICTURE: Vignette: The patient presents with abrupt visual hallucinations of shadows and figures, accompanied by panic and feelings of losing touch with reality. Communication patterns suggest possible ongoing cognitive or neurological issues, with guarded responses and limited disclosure about substance use and prior episodes. Confirming details about recent inhalant use, prior similar experiences, and neurological symptoms is key to clarify the etiology.  Leading Diagnoses: 1. Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder: The sudden onset of visual hallucinations with panic points toward intoxication or withdrawal effects, especially if inhalant use is recent or recurrent. 2. Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia): If hallucinations persist or recur, and if there are other signs of psychosis, this diagnosis becomes more likely, particularly in the context of episodic symptoms. 3. Delirium: The rapid symptom onset and cognitive concerns warrant exploration of underlying medical causes or neurological illness. 4. Neurodegenerative Disease (e.g., Lewy Body Dementia): Less likely at this stage unless further cognitive decline or visual hallucination patterns emerge over time. 5. Postictal Psychosis: Less probable without seizure history, but remains a consideration if other clues develop.information_withholder",

Can you tell me if you\u2019ve used inhalants or other drugs recently, and if these hallucinations tend to come on more after you\u2019ve been using? Also, have you experienced similar episodes in the past before these started, or are these new for you?\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my drug use and if that might be connected. I feel nervous to say too much but also worried they won\u2019t understand how bad it is. I\u2019m scared that revealing too little might make things worse or that they won\u2019t get how serious I feel. I want to hide some things but also know I need help.\nANSWER: I\u2019ve been using glue\u2026 just to try and chill out some. The hallucinations started not long after, I think. I don\u2019t really remember if I\u2019ve had this happen before; it\u2019s not normal for me.",
