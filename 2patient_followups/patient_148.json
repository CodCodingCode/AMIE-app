For instance, are they just a few seconds or do they go on longer? And during these times, do you notice anything else happening\u2014like changes in your vision, weakness, or numbness? Also, have you noticed if they happen more often or during certain activities or times of day?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit confused about what\u2019s happening when I get dizzy. I don\u2019t really remember how long it lasts, but usually it feels like a quick spinning thing. Sometimes my vision gets blurry or I feel kind of weak, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from the dizziness or something else. I don\u2019t notice if it happens more at certain times, just whenever it wants, I guess.\nANSWER: Um, well, the dizziness usually only lasts a few seconds, I think, but sometimes it\u2019s kind of a tingly feeling in my head or I get a bit blurry vision. It happens randomly \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing something specific or time of day or anything.",
