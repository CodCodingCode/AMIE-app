    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed talking about my cough and chest discomfort because I don't really know if it's serious or not, but I do want to tell the doctor everything so they can help. I\u2019m worried about what it might mean, especially since I\u2019ve been feeling worse lately.\nANSWER: Well, the cough doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it's worse, especially when I lie down or try to sleep. The chest feeling is kind of dull and tight, and it comes and goes, but it\u2019s been happening more often now. I haven\u2019t noticed any swelling or bleeding or anything else, just the tiredness and not being able to breathe right.",
