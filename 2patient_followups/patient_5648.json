    "input": "1. A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric neurology clinic due to noticeable weakness and decreased sensation in his lower limbs. His mother reports a fluid-filled sac protruding from the upper part of his back since birth, which has gradually enlarged. The child has delayed motor milestones and exhibits difficulty walking independently. On examination, there is a soft, cystic swelling at the level of the upper thoracic spine, with overlying skin showing a tuft of hair and mild discoloration. Neurological assessment reveals absent deep tendon reflexes in the lower extremities and reduced pain and temperature sensation below the mid-thoracic level. MRI confirms a diagnosis of upper thoracic spina bifida cystica with associated spinal cord tethering and a meningocele. The patient is scheduled for neurosurgical repair to prevent further neurological deterioration. Early intervention aims to improve motor function and prevent infection or rupture of the cystic sac.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why we're here today. I should tell them about what I'm feeling, but I'm not really sure how to explain it or if it even makes sense. Maybe I just need to say that I feel funny or different somehow, and that my mom is worried. \nANSWER: My son, he's three and he's been having a hard time walking and sort of looks all floppy sometimes. He's got this bump on his back that\u2019s been there since he was little, and it\u2019s bigger now. I just want to know if he's okay or if it\u2019s something we need to fix."

    "output": "Well, he doesn't walk quite right, and he's a bit behind in moving around compared to other kids his age. Sometimes he seems to get tired or upset when trying to stand or walk, and I noticed he isn't feeling things in his legs like I think he should. It's been going on for a while, and I just want to know if it's something serious."

    "output": "Well, he's been kind of fussy sometimes, like he's uncomfortable or something, and he doesn't play like he used to. Sometimes he seems tired and not as happy, but I don't know if that's normal for him or if it's something special."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s been kind of fussy sometimes, especially when trying to move around or after sitting for a while. He doesn\u2019t seem to play as much as before, and he gets easily tired or upset if he\u2019s asked to do something. I think he\u2019s been a little different, but I\u2019m not sure how to tell exactly."

I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s getting worse, but I\u2019m worried about him."
