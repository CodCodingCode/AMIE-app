    "input": "1. A 12-year-old boy presents with a three-month history of progressively worsening headaches, nausea, and episodes of vomiting, especially in the morning. He also reports recent difficulty with balance and coordination, often stumbling while walking. His parents have noticed mild slurring of speech and occasional double vision. On neurological examination, there is evidence of left-sided facial weakness and decreased sensation in the right arm. An MRI reveals a well-circumscribed, enhancing mass located in the dorsal brainstem region. The lesion causes mild hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the fourth ventricle. Surgical biopsy confirms the diagnosis of a brain stem ependymoma. He is scheduled for a multidisciplinary treatment plan including surgical resection followed by radiation therapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is very young, and I need to remember to keep my explanation simple but truthful. I should mention the symptoms that have been bothering me for a while, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting or not understanding. I also need to express some worry and confusion about what\u2019s happening to me.\n\nANSWER: I guess I don\u2019t feel right. I\u2019ve been getting these bad headaches and I feel sick a lot, especially in the mornings. I\u2019ve also been having a hard time walking straight and my face feels funny sometimes, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s wrong."
