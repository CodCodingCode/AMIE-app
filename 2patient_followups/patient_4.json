I'm a bit worried about whether these changes happen all the time or come and go, but I don't want to overcomplicate it. I'll keep my answer simple and honest, focusing on what feels most urgent to me\u2014like the foam and the color of my urine. I also feel anxious and a little embarrassed to go into too much detail, but I want to make sure the doctor understands what I see and feel.\n\nANSWER: Well, um, my pee has been pretty dark most of the time and it sometimes looks foamy, like really frothy. I don\u2019t remember seeing blood in it or anything, but it just looks different. It kind of comes and goes, I guess. I haven't noticed if I need to go more often or less, but it\u2019s been like that for a couple of weeks now.",
