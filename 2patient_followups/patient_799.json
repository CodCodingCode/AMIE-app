During these episodes, do you notice anything happening to your body\u2014like muscle jerking, strange sensations, or maybe something you don't fully realize at the time? And afterward, do you feel tired, confused, or any different, even if you aren\u2019t sure? Also, are there any warning signs or sensations you notice before an episode starts?\"worried_family_involved",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really scared about what these seizures mean. I just want to feel normal again and not worry so much, but it\u2019s hard not to panic thinking about how serious it might be. My family\u2019s worried too, and I don\u2019t want to let them down or hurt myself.\nANSWER: Oh, um, they usually just last a few seconds, I think, but sometimes I feel like they go on longer than I realize. During them, I feel my muscles jump or jerk, and I can\u2019t really control it. After, I feel super tired and kinda confused, like I don\u2019t even remember what just happened. I don\u2019t really have warning signs, except maybe feeling really anxious or like my heart is beating weird before.",
