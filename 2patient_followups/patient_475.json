    "output": "THINKING: I want to answer honestly, but I don\u2019t want to make it seem like I\u2019m overreacting. It\u2019s been there a while, and it\u2019s gotten a bit worse, but I\u2019ve dealt with some skin stuff before. I\u2019m probably just being paranoid, but I should tell him everything so he can tell me if it\u2019s serious or not. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m making a big deal, even if I am kinda scared inside.\nANSWER: Well, yeah, it\u2019s been getting bigger and more irregular, and it bleeds pretty often now, more than before. The edges look kind of weird, and sometimes it develops little sores or scabs. It\u2019s been bothering me more lately, yeah.",
