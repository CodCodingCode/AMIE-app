Is this going\"Jessica, based on what you've shared, I\u2019d like to ask whether you've noticed times when your hallucinations and paranoia have been less intense or even absent\u2014like periods where you\u2019re feeling more balanced or normal. Have you experienced any stretches of days or weeks where your symptoms are not as overwhelming, or where you feel more in control? If so, could you tell me about what those times are like and how they compare to the more intense episodes you described? Understanding whether your symptoms come and go or are persistent can really help us understand what might be underlying these experiences.\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I worry so much about what these hallucinations and everything mean. I keep asking myself if I\u2019m going crazy or if I\u2019m dangerous. Maybe there are times I feel a tiny bit calmer, but I don't know how long those last or if they\u2019re real, and I\u2019m scared to overlook something important.\nANSWER: Honestly, sometimes I think I feel a little less out of control\u2014like maybe a day or two where I don\u2019t see shadows or hear voices so loud, but then it just comes back worse, and I feel like I\u2019m spiraling or losing my mind again. It\u2019s so unpredictable.",
