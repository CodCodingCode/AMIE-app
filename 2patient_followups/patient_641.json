    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and scared about the visual symptoms, especially since my family is worried too. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s normal or what I should expect, and I\u2019m worried about my eye possibly getting worse or losing my sight. I just want to know if this is serious and what I can do now.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, the blinking and flashes\u2014I\u2019d say they come and go, mostly when I look at the rash or try to focus on things. Sometimes I see blurry stuff even when the rash isn\u2019t so obvious, and I keep wondering if that\u2019s normal. The eye pain is kinda burning all the time, but it sometimes feels sharper, especially when I blink or move my eye. It just worries me because my family\u2019s been saying I look different too, and I don\u2019t want to lose my sight or have this get worse.",
