I feel a bit overwhelmed because I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s important or how to explain it clearly. I just want to make sure I say enough but not too much\u2014still, I\u2019m worried about what they might find.\nANSWER: Um, well, the lump has been growing pretty slowly, I think, over these past couple of months. It didn\u2019t seem like it got very big all at once, but now it feels like it\u2019s gotten a little bigger and firmer. When I press on it, it feels hard and sort of stuck there. It doesn\u2019t seem to move much when I turn my head or swallow. And, um, the pain has kind of increased, especially when I touch around it. There\u2019s also been some trouble swallowing and my voice sounds different now, kind of hoarser. No other swelling or anything else that I\u2019ve noticed.",

I\u2019d like to ask a few more specific questions to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any unintended weight loss, increased night sweats, or feeling more tired than usual over these past few months? Also, with the lump, is the growth happening slowly or more suddenly? When you feel the lump, is it still just tender, or have you noticed it becoming more painful or sensitive? Lastly, are you experiencing any other changes, like difficulty swallowing, voice changes, or swelling elsewhere in your neck or face?\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about other symptoms, which I hadn't really thought about much. I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to mention weight or tiredness, but I guess I should be honest if I want to find out what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m worried about the size of the lump and what it could mean. I don\u2019t want to scare myself more, but I also feel like I need to say something else.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2026 I haven't really lost weight or felt more tired or anything like that. It\u2019s mostly just the lump, and now it\u2019s been growing and hurting some. I do notice it\u2019s hard to swallow sometimes, and my voice sounds different, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s linked to the lump or something else.",
