    "input": "1. A 7-year-old female was referred to the craniofacial clinic due to absence of the nose and severe breathing difficulties since birth. She exhibited bilateral microphthalmia with markedly underdeveloped eyes and feeding challenges during infancy. Developmental milestones were mildly delayed, and speech articulation was compromised. Physical examination revealed complete arhinia with a small, constricted nasal cavity and no external nasal structures. MRI of the brain showed normal olfactory bulbs but hypoplastic nasal passages. There were no signs of cardiac or renal anomalies, and the child\u2019s hearing was intact. Genetic testing identified a mutation consistent with Bosma Arhinia Microphthalmia Syndrome (BAMS). The multidisciplinary team planned for staged surgical reconstruction and supportive therapies to address respiratory and speech issues.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what symptoms or issues are causing me to seek help. I should describe my breathing problems and maybe mention feeling worried about my nose not being there, but I want to keep it simple and honest.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m here because I have trouble breathing sometimes, and I don\u2019t really have a nose, so it\u2019s hard to breathe properly. It\u2019s been like this forever, and I get scared when I can\u2019t breathe good."

    "output": "Well, I guess I have trouble breathing sometimes, especially when I lie down or breathe fast. It feels kind of like I can\u2019t quite get enough air, and I guess I sometimes get scared about that. I don\u2019t really notice many other things, but people say I sound different when I talk, and I don\u2019t smell anything, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "She\u2019s been having a really hard time breathing, especially when she\u2019s lying down or playing. Sometimes she sounds like she\u2019s struggling to get air, and it makes her cranky or tired during the day. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s been getting worse or if her breathing is changing, but it\u2019s been pretty stressful for all of us."

    "output": "Well, I dunno, I think I get tired or panicky sometimes because I can't breathe good, especially when I run or cry or something. I try to stay still or take deep breaths, but it doesn't always help, and I feel kind of scared about it. I just... I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong, but it makes things harder to do."

    "output": "Um, I think her forehead looks a little bit kind of big, and her eyes are kind of far apart. She also has trouble with her speech and feeding, so it\u2019s hard to tell if other parts look different."

    "output": "Umm, I think sometimes I have a hard time breathing more than usual, especially when I lie down or run around a lot. It feels like I get really out of breath or like I can't quite breathe right, but I'm not sure if it's always like that or just sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I think... sometimes when I lie down, it feels kinda funny like I can\u2019t breathe right, and I get scared because it doesn\u2019t go away fast. During playing, I feel tired and like I can't catch my breath sometimes, and it lasts a little while before I can breathe okay again."
