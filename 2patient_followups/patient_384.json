    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents to the endocrinology clinic with primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development and pubic hair. She reports no significant medical history and is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, she is noted to be shorter than her peers with a height in the 5th percentile and has a webbed neck and widely spaced nipples. Ultrasound imaging reveals small, streak-like ovaries and a hypoplastic uterus. Laboratory investigations show elevated gonadotropins (FSH and LH) with low estradiol levels, consistent with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Karyotype analysis confirms a 46,XX genotype with mutations consistent with ovarian dysgenesis type 2. There is no family history of delayed puberty or early ovarian failure. The clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of ovarian dysgenesis type 2, and she is referred for hormone replacement therapy and genetic counseling.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to explain her symptoms without sounding too pressed or overwhelmed. She should mention her main concerns about not having started her periods or developing other signs of puberty, maybe also her physical features that seem different. The response should be simple, emotional, and a bit uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just don\u2019t really get why I haven\u2019t started my periods yet, and I haven\u2019t grown much or anything. I feel kinda different compared to other girls my age, and I\u2019ve been worried about why I look like this."

    "output": "Well, I guess I feel kind of left out sometimes because I\u2019m shorter than my friends, and I don\u2019t really have the same things happening with my body. Like, I didn\u2019t get my period or develop like they did, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if I should be worried. It makes me feel strange and a little worried about if something\u2019s wrong with me or if I\u2019ll ever be like other girls."

Are there any issues with hearing, smell, or vision? Are there any other health problems or developmental delays in the family?",
    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019m shorter than most of the other kids, and I have the neck thing and the wide nipples, but I don\u2019t really know about my face or if I have other features. I don\u2019t really notice any problems with my hearing or anything like that, and no one in my family has had any health issues that I know of."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a pelvic exam done before. The ultrasound thing\u2014I think they showed small bits that looked like ovaries, but I\u2019m not really sure what that means or if that\u2019s normal."

    "output": "Hmm, I guess I haven't really noticed anything with my hands or feet, and I don't remember anything about my heart or kidneys being different. Sometimes I feel a bit more tired or out of breath, but I don't know if that's related."

    "output": "Um, I guess my family talked about it a little, but honestly, I'm kind of worried about all the medicines and what they might do. I just want to seem normal, I guess, and not feel so different. It\u2019s kinda scary thinking about everything I might need to do."
