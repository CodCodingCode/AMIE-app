I\u2019ve been feeling just terrible, like I can\u2019t breathe properly anymore, even just sitting here. It started a couple of days after I got home from the hospital, you see, and it\u2019s been getting worse every day. My legs are swollen and heavy, and last night I woke up gasping for air. Sometimes I cough up blood, which is frightening. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me, but I\u2019m worried it might be serious, and I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s my heart or because of the anesthesia or my pregnancy.

At first, it was just feeling a little short of breath, but now I just can\u2019t breathe like I used to, even sitting here. It\u2019s worse at night, I woke up gasping and I saw blood when I coughed. My legs are heavy and swollen, and I keep feeling this tightness in my chest. It\u2019s very frightening.",
