    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my blurry spells, and honestly, I don't really remember exactly how often or how long they last. I usually just feel weird and a little disoriented, but I don't notice flashes or spots, and I haven't had trouble speaking or feeling weak, so I guess that's good, but I'm still worried about what might be happening.\nANSWER: Um, I think they happen a few times a day, maybe for a few seconds each time. I don\u2019t really see flashes or spots or have trouble talking or anything like that, but I feel kind of dizzy sometimes when they happen.",
