Can you tell me how many times a week or month you notice urine leakage, and during which activities or situations it tends to happen most often? For example, does it mostly occur when you cough, sneeze, or lift something? And when you notice the prolapse or bulge, how does that affect your daily activities\u2014like sitting for long periods or walking? Lastly, how do you feel emotionally about these symptoms\u2014do they cause you a lot of worry or embarrassment, and how are you coping with them day to day?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm really worried about the leaking, and I keep thinking it's going to get worse. I don't know if it's something serious, but it feels so embarrassing to talk about, and I just want to know what's happening to me. I keep feeling like I can't control anything down there anymore, and the thought of surgery scares me, but I wonder if it's my only choice. I just hope I\u2019m not going to lose all control completely or have something awful happen.\nANSWER: I notice I leak urine mostly when I cough or sneeze, and it seems to be worse than before. The bulge, it\u2019s just always there, and it makes it hard to sit or walk comfortably, and I keep thinking maybe I\u2019ll end up incontinent or something worse. It\u2019s embarrassing to talk about, but I feel like I can\u2019t do this anymore\u2014it's so heavy and uncomfortable, and I worry it\u2019s serious.",
