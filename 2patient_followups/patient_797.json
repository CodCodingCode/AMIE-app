I need to reassure her that she's in the right place and take her symptoms seriously, even if she's downplaying them a bit. I should ask about her pain, breathing, and swelling to get a better picture without dismissing her concerns. Also, I should be gentle and empathetic because she might be scared she's facing something very dangerous.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m 62, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been feeling just\u2014really not right for about a week now, but like, the last couple of days, it\u2019s gotten a lot worse. My right leg is swollen and feels heavy, kinda like I\u2019ve been walking all day. And I can\u2019t seem to breathe properly now. It\u2019s been like that for a little while, but yesterday and today, it\u2019s gotten worse. I feel this tightness in my chest sometimes, and I get lightheaded, so I thought I should come in before... I don\u2019t know, something really bad happens.",
