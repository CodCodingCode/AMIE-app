    "output": "THINKING: She\u2019s asking about my eyes and legs and how often I feel this way. I don\u2019t really know if it gets better or worse sometimes, or if I see double or stuff like that. I just know I feel wobbly more and more, and my eyes feel funny when I look up.\nANSWER: My eyes get blurry sometimes, like I can\u2019t see right or everything looks kind of fuzzy. And my legs feel really weak, like I\u2019m about to fall even if I\u2019m just sitting or lying down. It happens a lot, and I think it\u2019s getting worse, but I\u2019m not sure.",
