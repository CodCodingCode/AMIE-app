    "output": "THINKING: I feel nervous about all these symptoms, but I don\u2019t want to overreact or sound like I\u2019m making a big deal. Still, I know I should tell the doctor everything, even if I\u2019m worried it might be serious.\nANSWER: Well, the patch on my skin, it\u2019s been there a while, and I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s a little more sore and sometimes bleeds when I touch it. It\u2019s kinda rough and discolored still. My ear feels full most of the time, and I hear the ringing more often lately, like a constant buzz. No dizziness, but it\u2019s really annoying. And I\u2019ve been coughing up a tiny bit of blood sometimes when I clear my throat, which I don\u2019t quite understand. I guess I just want to know if this could be something serious? I\u2019m really worried.",
