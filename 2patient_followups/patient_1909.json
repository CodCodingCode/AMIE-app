    "input": "2. A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic due to recurrent painless injuries on her hands and feet, which have resulted in multiple non-healing ulcers. Her parents note she rarely complains of pain or discomfort, even after falling or sustaining burns. Physical examination reveals absent pain and temperature sensation with preserved position and vibration sense. She also experiences episodes of dry skin and poor sweating, especially during hot weather, leading to frequent fevers of unknown origin. There is a history of early unexplained injuries in her maternal cousin. Nerve conduction studies reveal small fiber neuropathy, and genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the SCN9A gene. Despite normal strength and reflexes, she has developed Charcot joints in her feet due to unnoticed trauma. Treatment involves rigorous protective measures, infection control, and family education to minimize injury risk.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that I feel kind of weird about my hands and feet, like I don't feel them properly, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting. I should mention the injuries and that I don\u2019t really feel pain when I get hurt, but I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s wrong. I also want to let the doctor know I get fevers a lot and feel really dry and hot, and I worry because I keep getting hurt and don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s bad.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m 9, and I guess I\u2019m here because I keep getting these hurts on my hands and feet that don\u2019t seem to hurt at all, even when they don\u2019t heal. Sometimes I get fevers and I feel really dry and hot, especially when it\u2019s warm. My parents say I don\u2019t really notice when I hurt myself, and I\u2019m worried because I keep getting injuries and I don\u2019t understand why."

For example, do you notice the injuries right away, or do they sometimes happen without you feeling it?",
    "output": "Sometimes I don\u2019t feel it at all, like I don\u2019t notice I\u2019ve hurt myself until I see it later. Other times, I might see the blood or the bump, but I don\u2019t really feel anything happening. It\u2019s like my body doesn\u2019t react the same way as other kids\u2019 do."

How does he usually feel during those times, and are there any activities he's unable to do because of his symptoms?",
    "output": "Um, when I\u2019m outside or it\u2019s really hot, I feel like I don\u2019t sweat much, and I get kind of all over hot and tired but not in a way I can really tell what's wrong. Sometimes I get fevers, and I have to be careful because I don\u2019t notice small hurts until they get bad. I try not to do too much or run around too much because I worry about hurting myself or that I won\u2019t feel it if I do."

    "output": "Um, I can\u2019t really remember any nosebleeds or gum bleeding, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any bleeding from other places. No one in my family talked about bleeding or anything like that, I think. I haven\u2019t had any weird joint or muscle pains, and my skin isn\u2019t stretchy or anything, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I sometimes feel a little dizzy or tired, but nothing super serious, I guess."

    "output": "Yeah, I think I do get some skin that stays sore or doesn't heal, like, even after I put stuff on it or try to make it better. It's kind of annoying because it doesn\u2019t really go away easily."

    "output": "Umm, I don't think my skin is very stretchy or anything like that. It does feel kind of dry sometimes, but I haven't noticed it being really loose or flexible."
