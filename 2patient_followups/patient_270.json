I guess, getting worse over the last few months. It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking through a fog, especially in my right eye, and sometimes I see a dark spot right in the center of my vision. My color vision doesn\u2019t seem as sharp either. I don\u2019t really have any pain or anything, just these changes. It worries me because my family has a history of optic nerve problems, and I have a mitochondrial disorder that runs in my family.
