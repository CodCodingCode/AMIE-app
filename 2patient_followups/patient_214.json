Maybe I should mention the bumps and how they appeared, plus mention my concern about them spreading or being something serious. I should also include some context about how I spend a lot of time with my kids and sometimes worry about germs or contagious stuff, but I don\u2019t want to sound paranoid.\nANSWER: Hi, doctor. Well, I\u2019ve got these small bumps on my fingers and elbows that I\u2019ve been noticing for a few months now. They\u2019re kind of rough and grainy, and they don\u2019t hurt or anything, but they look kind of weird. They first showed up maybe three months ago, and I\u2019ve seen a few more pop up here and there since then, especially after I\u2019ve been swimming with the kids or helping out at their school activities.",

Have you noticed whether these bumps ever become itchy, tender, or sore, especially after water contact or outdoor activities? Or have you seen any redness, bleeding, or signs of irritation around them at any point, even if only slightly? Sometimes, these small signs can tell us more about what's contributing to the skin changes, and knowing whether there's any ongoing irritation can help us decide the best way to help you.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess I should clarify if they\u2019ve ever been itchy or sore, but honestly, I haven't really paid that much attention because I\u2019ve just been busy with the kids and everything else. I mean, I do notice that sometimes after swimming or playing outside, they seem a little more noticeable, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts. Also, I\u2019m kind of worried because my sister had something similar a long time ago, and she said it was something contagious, but I don\u2019t want to overreact.\nANSWER: No, they\u2019ve never really itched or felt sore or anything, even after I\u2019ve been in water or outside all day. I think they just look a little worse sometimes, especially when I\u2019ve been swimming\u2014I guess because of the moisture or whatever. But I haven\u2019t seen any redness or bleeding or anything, just these little bumps that keep coming up.",
