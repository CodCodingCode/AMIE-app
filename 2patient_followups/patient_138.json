Can you tell me more specifically\u2014do you notice if this lump feels hard or soft when you touch it? Have you noticed if it moves under your skin, or if there's a spot that feels like it has more fluid or pus coming out? Also, since you've been feeling this way, have you seen any areas that seem more fluctuant or maybe even filled with pus? And just to be sure, are you also feeling any fevers, chills, or overall feeling worse?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so the doctor is asking about the lump and the redness and how it feels when I touch it. I guess I need to be clear, but honestly, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s normal or not. I\u2019ve just been really worried, and now I\u2019m thinking maybe I missed something or messed something up with the breastfeeding, cause it hurts so much and I see the redness, and I don\u2019t want it to get worse. I also feel a little chills and just tired all the time, which isn\u2019t normal for me, especially since I just want to be able to take care of the baby and keep things normal, but now I just feel really overwhelmed.\nANSWER: Well, the lump feels kinda hard and it doesn\u2019t really move when I touch it, but it\u2019s kind of all under the skin, you know? I don\u2019t really see anything like pus or any spot that looks like it\u2019s filling up, but it\u2019s sore and the redness is right there, and I do feel chills now and then, so I think I might be getting worse. The whole breast feels warm and full, and I\u2019m just worried I might need something like antibiotics or if this is serious \u2014 I don\u2019t want to stop breastfeeding, but I also don\u2019t want to ignore it if it\u2019s something bad.",
