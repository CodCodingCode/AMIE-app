    "output": "THINKING: Oh no, I don\u2019t know if it's more serious than I think, but the bleeding is there all the time and it\u2019s bothering me a lot. I\u2019m really worried it could be something worse like cancer, and I don\u2019t want it to be, but I feel so anxious and just keep thinking the worst. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m seeing everything clearly, maybe it\u2019s worse than I realize.\nANSWER: Well, um, I usually see just a little bright red on the toilet paper, but sometimes I notice it dripping into the water, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more than I think. I haven\u2019t seen any swelling or cracks or anything, but I feel a bit anxious about it sort of getting worse or being something really serious.",
