    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female schoolteacher presents with a four-year history of progressive weakness in her lower legs and intermittent cramps, making it increasingly difficult for her to climb stairs. She also notes a recent onset of mild numbness and burning sensations in her fingertips and toes. Physical examination reveals distal muscle wasting in the feet and hands, with bilateral foot drop and pes cavus deformities. Sensory testing shows decreased pinprick and vibration sensation distally, particularly in a stocking-glove distribution. Reflexes are absent at the ankles but preserved at the knees and upper limbs. Electromyography demonstrates reduced motor amplitudes with normal conduction velocities, consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Family history is notable for a maternal aunt who experienced similar symptoms in her 30s. Genetic analysis identifies a mutation in the gene associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Axonal, Type 2cc, and she begins a tailored rehabilitation program including ankle-foot orthoses and symptom management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely here because she's experiencing ongoing weakness and numbness that has been worsening over several years. She might feel anxious or unsure about what\u2019s wrong, and her response should reflect her symptoms and the feelings of unpredictability and concern she might have.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 35, and I\u2019m a woman. Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of weaker in my legs for a long time, and I keep getting these weird cramps and tingling in my hands and feet. It\u2019s been hard to walk up stairs and everything, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m just worried because it\u2019s been happening more and more."

    "output": "Well, I guess it\u2019s gotten kind of harder to do some stuff like climbing stairs, and I feel more tired than I used to, especially in my legs. Sometimes my hands feel weird, like numb and tingly, and I worry about whether I\u2019ll lose more control or feeling in them. It\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening, and I worry it might get worse or affect my work."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really notice anything with my vision or bladder stuff, and I haven\u2019t had any dizzy spells or really strange problems with walking or balancing, I think. It\u2019s just mainly the legs and hands that feel weird."

Sometimes, I guess, my legs feel more tired, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or just how it\u2019s been. I also feel a little wonky sometimes when I try to do things quickly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all the time, and I haven\u2019t noticed anything really changing suddenly."

    "output": "Hmm, I can't really remember any times where my limbs suddenly got really weak and then got better. Sometimes I feel more tired than usual, but it kind of stays that way, and I haven't noticed anything that comes and goes suddenly."

I haven\u2019t noticed anything like muscle stiffness or really sudden changes. No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any weird infections or anything, and I haven\u2019t lost weight or anything like that. As for family, my aunt had similar issues, but no one else really."

    "output": "No, I don't really remember any sudden drops or anything that comes and goes like that. My legs just kinda feel weaker over time, and I haven't had any recent infections or trips that I can think of."

    "output": "Well, I guess I feel like things are just a little more off than before. Sometimes, my feet feel sort of unsteady or like I might fall if I\u2019m not careful, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new. The numbness in my fingers and toes has been there for a while, but lately, I think it feels... different, like more noticeable."
