Have you noticed any fevers, chills, or night sweats that come and go, even if you didn\u2019t think much about them? Also, regarding your lymph nodes, can you tell me if they\u2019ve felt more tender or enlarged recently, or if they seem to be staying about the same? And about your fatigue\u2014are you feeling more tired than usual, perhaps affecting your daily routines, or has that been fairly consistent? Lastly, has your rash changed in size or appearance, or started to itch more? These details help me understand how your symptoms fit together and guide us on the next steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess I should answer what he asked, but I\u2019m kind of panicked about the whole thing. The fevers come and go, but I just feel worse some days, and I\u2019ve been super tired, like I could sleep all day. The lumps are definitely bigger than when I first started noticing them, and honestly, they look kind of weird\u2014the ones in my neck feel sore sometimes, and the rash on my arms seems to spread a bit. I mean, I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not, and I keep thinking if it\u2019s something serious, what happens next?\nANSWER: Yeah, I\u2019ve had some fevers that come and go\u2014sometimes I feel fine, and other times I just get these chills or a little hot, even when I\u2019m just sitting around. The lumps in my neck and armpits have gotten bigger, and they\u2019re kinda tender now, especially when I touch them. The rash on my chest and arms is still there, and it seems to be spreading a little, which I don\u2019t really get. I\u2019m really worried\u2014do you think it\u2019s something serious? Do I need to do a bunch of tests or something?",
