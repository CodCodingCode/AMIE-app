    "input": "2. A 7-year-old girl is referred to the endocrinology clinic due to persistent severe obesity and insatiable hunger from early childhood. Her mother reports that despite attempts at dietary restriction, the child continuously seeks food and gains weight rapidly. On examination, her BMI is markedly elevated, and she exhibits acanthosis nigricans around the neck and axillae, indicative of insulin resistance. Laboratory evaluation reveals hypoleptinemia despite substantial adipose stores, along with elevated fasting insulin levels. Developmental milestones are normal, and there are no dysmorphic features or significant family history of obesity. Further genetic analysis identifies a homozygous mutation in the leptin receptor gene, causing functional leptin resistance. The clinical team initiates a multidisciplinary approach focusing on metabolic control and considers investigational therapies targeting leptin pathways. Nutritional counseling and behavioral interventions are also implemented to address her hyperphagia.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a mother, probably worried about her child's ongoing issues with hunger and weight. She might feel overwhelmed or uncertain about what to do next, so I should keep my answer simple and honest, describing her general feelings and concerns.  \nANSWER: I guess I just feel really tired and worried all the time. My daughter keeps asking for food and she\u2019s getting bigger so fast, and I don\u2019t know how to help her or make it better."

    "output": "Well, she's always asking for something to eat, like all the time, even if she's just had a lot. She keeps saying she's hungry, and no matter how much I give her, she seems to want more. At home, she gets really upset if she can't have snacks or food whenever she wants, and she finds it hard to stop. I don't really know how she behaves at school because I can't see everything, but she seems to focus okay sometimes, though she's always thinking about food."

She moves around a lot, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enough, and sometimes she gets really upset when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s frustration or just her being upset about other things."
