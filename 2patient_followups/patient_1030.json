Sometimes, it just hits me suddenly, and I feel bad for a while, then it goes away, but it can come back. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always worse with anything specific, maybe when I move around more. I just want to get better and figure out if it\u2019s serious or not.\nANSWER: Uh, well, I don\u2019t really keep track exactly, but sometimes I feel dizzy or nausea maybe a few times a week. It usually doesn\u2019t last very long, maybe a few minutes, then it\u2019s okay again. It might happen more when I walk around or do something, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s better just resting. It sometimes comes with the chills or that headache, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s at certain times of day.",
