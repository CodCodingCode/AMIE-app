    "input": "1. A 14-year-old phenotypic male is brought to the clinic by his parents due to delayed voice deepening and lack of significant muscle development compared to peers. The patient reports some gynecomastia and feelings of social anxiety related to his body image. On examination, he has sparse facial and body hair, normal male external genitalia with a micropenis, and bilateral descended but small testes. His height and weight are within the normal range for his age. Hormonal evaluation shows elevated serum testosterone levels, slightly elevated luteinizing hormone, and normal follicle-stimulating hormone. Pelvic ultrasound reveals no M\u00fcllerian structures, and genetic testing confirms a 46,XY karyotype. Androgen receptor gene analysis identifies a mutation consistent with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. The patient is referred for multidisciplinary management including endocrinology, genetics, and psychological support to address pubertal development and gender identity concerns.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient likely feels confused and maybe a little embarrassed about his body and what he's experiencing. He might be unsure about how to explain his feelings, possibly worried about what the doctor will think or say. It's important for him to be honest yet simple about his feelings and symptoms.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I'm kind of worried because I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019ve gone through the same changes as other guys my age. My body still doesn\u2019t feel right, and I sometimes feel really self-conscious about it. My parents wanted me to come here today."
