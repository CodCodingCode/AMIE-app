My wound is more swollen and red now, and it looks bigger than before, like it\u2019s spreading. The redness is darker and the area around it is warm too. The part I\u2019m most scared of is the smell and the pain\u2014what if it\u2019s really bad? I just want to know if this could be infection or something really serious.",
