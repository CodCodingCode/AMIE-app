Can you tell me if you're noticing any changes in your vision, such as blurriness or floaters? Are you experiencing any discharge from your eyes, or any pain or sensitivity to light? Also, since you mentioned previous eye issues, can you tell me more about what those involved, and whether you've noticed any new or different problems this time?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really scared now, and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to me. All these symptoms are coming at once, and I just want it to stop. I don\u2019t know if I should keep trying to eat or just wait and see if it gets worse. I feel weak and worried I might go to the hospital if this keeps up. I hope the doctor can tell me what\u2019s wrong soon.\nANSWER: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my vision or anything like that. I don\u2019t have any eye discharge or problems with light, but I do get blurry sometimes when I\u2019m tired. My eye issues were just occasional floaters, I think, nothing serious. This time, I just feel so sick and I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t swallow right.",
