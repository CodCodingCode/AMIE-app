To help us understand your seizures better, can you tell me exactly what you notice during a seizure\u2014things like how long they last, what you feel or do during them, and if you notice anything that seems to trigger them? Also, after a seizure, do you feel different\u2014like really tired, confused, or weak? Regarding the numbness and swelling you mentioned earlier, do you recall when these sensations started and whether they've been getting worse or more frequent? Giving me these details will help us figure out the best next steps to support you.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel pretty scared about what the doctor is asking. I don\u2019t really remember exactly when the numbness started or how often the seizures happen. I just know I feel worse and worse every day, and I wanna tell her everything but it\u2019s all jumbling in my head. I keep thinking about how tired I am and my tummy hurting, but I don\u2019t know if those things are connected or not.\nANSWER: Um, I think it was last week... or maybe two weeks ago? My hands and feet started feeling all numb and tingly, and then I guess I started having those scary seizures. I don\u2019t really remember how long they last, but they make me shake and I feel all weird after. My tummy hurts in the middle sometimes too. I don\u2019t know... it\u2019s all mixed up in my head.",
