Also, have you experienced any weakness, numbness, or tingling anywhere else in your body, or any new numbness or weakness that you can think of? This will help us confirm whether this might be related solely to your eye or if there's something affecting your nervous system more broadly. And, lastly, how are you feeling about all of this now\u2014do you feel ready to talk about what treatment options might be helpful?baseline",
