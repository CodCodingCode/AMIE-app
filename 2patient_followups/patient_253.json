    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I need to answer honestly but I\u2019m really worried about what he\u2019s asking. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind, I don\u2019t know if these things are getting worse or if I\u2019m just imagining it. I\u2019m scared I might be having a stroke or something terrible, but I don\u2019t really understand all these questions about what I see or remember. I just want to get help and figure out what\u2019s happening to me.\nANSWER: Well, I, uh, I don\u2019t really know how to say it, but I think the things I see\u2014these shadows or noises\u2014they\u2019re kind of getting worse or happening more often, I guess. And I feel so confused, like my head\u2019s all foggy, even when I try to think straight. I don\u2019t remember what I was doing before it all started\u2014nothing makes sense anymore. I think I was feeling some confusion before, but it\u2019s worse now. I did start some new medicines after my surgery, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when it happened or not. I just feel like I\u2019m not myself, like I\u2019m more lost than usual, and I\u2019m really scared I might hurt myself or that something really bad is happening.",
