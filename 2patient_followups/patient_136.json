I didn\u2019t have anything like this before I got pregnant, and I\u2019m just not sure what\u2019s okay or if I should be worried about the baby.

To make sure I understand how you're feeling physically, can you tell me if you\u2019ve noticed any changes like feeling dizzy when you stand up, having a very dry mouth, or if your urination is less frequent than usual? Also, since you mentioned feeling warm earlier, do you still feel that way, and have you noticed any other signs like your skin feeling very dry or your eyes appearing sunken? These details will help us determine if you\u2019re staying hydrated enough and what steps might be best to support you and your pregnancy during this time.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I think the doctor is trying to get a clear picture, but I\u2019m honestly just kind of overwhelmed by all these symptoms and worried about my baby. I keep thinking about my mom\u2019s friend who had the same issues and ended up in the emergency room, so I guess I\u2019m scared it might be something serious. I also wonder if I should just go home and try to rest more, but I don\u2019t want to ignore something really bad.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I do feel pretty warm still, and my mouth has been feeling dry, especially after I try to drink water and get some fluids in. My skin feels kind of dry too, like I\u2019m a little sunken in around the eyes, and I haven\u2019t peed as much as I usually do, which I read might mean I\u2019m not drinking enough or could be dehydrated, but I don\u2019t want to panic.",
