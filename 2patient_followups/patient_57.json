I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting, but I do notice it\u2019s kind of red and sore, and I worry it could be worse now. I\u2019m already feeling overwhelmed, so I just want to get through this without making a big deal out of things I don\u2019t really understand.\nANSWER: Yeah, it\u2019s a little red and sore today, like I said before. It looks kinda worse, I guess, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not.",
