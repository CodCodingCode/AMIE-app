    "output": "THINKING: Oh my goodness, I mean, I don\u2019t really look that closely at the edges, but I think they\u2019re kind of irregular, not perfectly smooth. I feel like they\u2019ve been changing slowly, getting just a little darker and firmer, but it\u2019s hard to be sure. I haven\u2019t noticed any bleeding or crusting, but I do sometimes feel like they\u2019re a bit tender or strange when I press on them. I\u2019m really worried this might be something serious, like cancer or something terrible. It\u2019s been bothering me a lot.\nANSWER: Well, I think the edges are maybe a little jagged, not perfectly smooth, and they\u2019ve been gradually getting darker and firmer over the months. I haven\u2019t seen any bleeding or crusting, but sometimes they feel a bit weird or tender when I press on them.",
