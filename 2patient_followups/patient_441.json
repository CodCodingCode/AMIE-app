    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really overwhelmed and scared right now, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting. I guess I felt kinda hot and had a rash earlier, but I thought it was just an allergy or something minor. I\u2019ve always been pretty tough, so I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at first. Now I\u2019m worried it\u2019s something serious, but I don\u2019t want to make a big fuss if it\u2019s nothing.\nANSWER: I think I remember feeling a little warm and seein\u2019 some rash, but I thought it\u2019d go away. I didn\u2019t really think it was anything serious at first.",
