She\u2019s asking about how long the episodes last and what might trigger them, but honestly, I haven\u2019t been paying that close attention. I\u2019ve just been feeling worse and mostly focusing on the weirdness with my eye and head; I think maybe I ate something heavy last night, but then again, my dad had a stroke, so I can\u2019t shake that feeling it\u2019s something serious.\nANSWER: Well, they don\u2019t last very long, maybe just a few seconds, but it\u2019s like this sudden weird feeling in my face and then my eye droops, and I get dizzy if I turn my head or move quick. I can\u2019t really tell if it\u2019s triggered by anything specific, maybe when I was typing on my computer for a long time yesterday or after I had that neck adjustment last week\u2014my neck\u2019s been stiff, and I was stressed with work because of deadlines, and I just didn\u2019t feel right after.",
