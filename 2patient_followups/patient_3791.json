    "input": "2. A 55-year-old male presents with a 3-month history of unilateral nasal congestion on the right side, accompanied by recurrent episodes of mild epistaxis and a sense of fullness in the right nasal cavity. He also reports a noticeable decrease in his ability to detect odors over the past several weeks. He denies any significant facial pain but describes occasional right-sided facial numbness and mild headaches. Physical examination reveals a firm mass deep in the right nasal cavity near the cribriform plate, with no external nasal deformity or palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Nasal endoscopy identifies a grayish, vascular tumor occupying the olfactory cleft region. CT imaging shows a soft tissue lesion extending into the ethmoid sinus with mild erosion of the adjacent cribriform plate but no intracranial extension. Histopathology of the biopsy specimen reveals neurofibrillary stroma and characteristic Homer Wright rosettes confirming the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma. The patient is scheduled for endoscopic surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy due to tumor stage and location.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient feels nervous and maybe a little embarrassed to talk about his symptoms. He might be confused about what is wrong and worried about what the doctor will find. I should keep the response simple, honest, and a bit vague to reflect his feelings.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 55-year-old man, and I\u2019ve been having stuffiness on one side of my nose for a while now. It\u2019s like, there\u2019s this feeling of fullness and sometimes I notice I can\u2019t smell things properly anymore. And I\u2019ve been getting these little nosebleeds and some odd numbness in my face, so I thought I should get it checked out."

    "output": "Well, it just kind of started a few months ago, I thin \u2014 I don\u2019t really remember exactly when, but it\u2019s been getting a little worse, I think. Sometimes, I feel like the stuffiness and the weird feeling in my nose are worse at certain times, but I don't know why. And it's kind of weird because I\u2019ve been noticing I can't smell things like I used to and it makes me uneasy. Nothing I do seems to make it better or worse, really."

Certain times, I notice it worse when I\u2019m lying down or moving around. It\u2019s pretty annoying, and I think I\u2019ve been more tired, too."
