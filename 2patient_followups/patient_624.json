I just know it\u2019s been more than a little, maybe a lot at times, but I\u2019m not sure if I should say it\u2019s heavy or just a bit. I also keep thinking about the urinary stuff\u2014it\u2019s been bothering me, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse now or if it was always like that. I just want him to understand how much I\u2019ve noticed, but I\u2019m probably confusing him.\nANSWER: Well, the bleeding, um, it\u2019s not just a little, sometimes it\u2019s more, and I notice it kind of a lot\u2014I\u2019d say almost every day? Maybe it\u2019s more like every other day, or I think I saw it one day and then it stopped, but then it came back. And the discharge is more mucous, sometimes with blood, I think. The urination, I guess that started maybe two weeks ago? I feel like I go more often now, and sometimes it burns, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s all the time or just when I need to go really urgently.",
