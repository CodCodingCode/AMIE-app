And do you experience any other symptoms at the same time, like eye discomfort, headaches, or eye fatigue?\u201d  CURRENT CLINICAL PICTURE: Vignette: The patient reports intermittent inward eye deviation and double vision, mainly during near focus and fatigue. Communication indicates these episodes may be more frequent than initially described, with possible underreporting of associated symptoms like eye fatigue or headaches. Their guarded manner and concern about what it might mean suggest underlying anxiety and possible underestimation of severity. Further detailed questioning is necessary to clarify the frequency, duration, triggers, and associated symptoms to refine the diagnosis\u2014most likely convergence insufficiency or related binocular dysfunction.baseline",
