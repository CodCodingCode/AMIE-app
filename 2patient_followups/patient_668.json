I\u2019ve been sneezing and my nose is all stuffy.\u201d\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \u201cMy mom said I might have the flu because I\u2019m achy all over and I have a fever.\u201d\n- \u201cI don\u2019t really have any stomach pain, just my head and muscles hurting.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ve\"Thanks for sharing that your eye feels kind of sore and sometimes blurry. Just so I\u2019m clear, when you look at your eye now, do you see any redness around the eyelid or the white part of your eye? Also, have you noticed any sort of discharge\u2014like tears, clear or colored pus\u2014coming out of your eye at all? And since your symptoms started, has the soreness or blurriness gotten better, worse, or stayed the same? These details will help me understand exactly what\u2019s going on and whether your eye needs specific treatment.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, the doctor wants to know about my eye, but I don't really understand what all that stuff means. I just want to tell him what I see and feel, but I don't really pay attention to redness or if there's any yucky stuff coming out. I mostly want to say that my eye feels kind of sore and funny sometimes, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten better or worse.\nANSWER: My eye kind of hurts and sometimes it feels blurry, and I don't think there's any redness or anything coming out, just a little sore. It kind of feels the same, I guess.",
