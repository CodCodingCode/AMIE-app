    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so the doctor is asking about hallucinations and paralysis\u2014those sound really scary, and I want to make sure I explain clearly. I\u2019m worried because sometimes I think I see or hear things when I\u2019m not sleepy, and I feel like my body gets really stiff or heavy, like I can't move or talk. I\u2019m not sure if these happen only when I\u2019m about to fall asleep or during my episodes, or if they can happen randomly when I\u2019m just resting. Outside of these episodes, I guess I sleep okay most nights, but sometimes I find myself sleeping for a long time or waking up feeling exhausted, like I didn't really sleep. When I\u2019m feeling normal, I guess my mood is mostly okay, but I do get irritable and moody a lot, especially when the episodes come back.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
