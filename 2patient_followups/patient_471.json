I don\u2019t really remember exactly how often it\u2019s bled \u2014 maybe a couple of times, just a little? It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s enough to worry me, and I guess I\u2019ve been more itchy and tender than before. I don\u2019t know, everything\u2019s just happening so fast, and I don\u2019t want it to be anything bad.\nANSWER: Well, it\u2019s bled maybe twice, just a little, and it\u2019s been more itchy and sore, especially when I bump it or scratch it. I\u2019m not sure if that helps, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed in the last few weeks.",
