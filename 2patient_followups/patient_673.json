I keep mixing up the times, and it feels all jumbled in my head\u2014plus, I'm pretty scared right now. I think I should just say I was feeling bad a while ago, but maybe it wasn't until recently that it got really bad.\nANSWER: Um, I think it was maybe last week, or possibly two weeks ago, I started feeling kind of hot and sore throat, but then I don't remember if I had chills first or if the fever came after. It all kind of blurs together, and suddenly I felt worse, but I can't really say exactly when.",
