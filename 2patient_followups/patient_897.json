    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m not really sure what all these details matter, but I guess I should mention what I\u2019ve seen. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m making a big deal, but it\u2019s been a little itchy and kind of rough-looking on the skin over the lump, I suppose. It\u2019s not bleeding or anything, and I haven\u2019t noticed any discharge, just the lump itself feels kind of fixed, like it doesn\u2019t move much if I try to press on it. I just want to know if it could be serious.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve noticed the skin on top of it looks a bit rough, kind of like it\u2019s changed texture, but there\u2019s no redness or swelling or anything. The lump feels kind of stuck in place, not loose, I think. No discharge or bleeding or any of that.",
