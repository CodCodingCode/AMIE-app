    "input": "1. A 7-year-old girl was brought to the genetics clinic due to concerns about abnormal limb development and breast malformations. She had shortened forearms with absent thumbs on both sides and syndactyly affecting her fingers. Her mother noted that her daughter had small, underdeveloped breasts that had not begun to grow despite being close to the expected age of puberty onset. Physical examination revealed pectoral muscle hypoplasia and hypoplastic nipples as well. There was no family history of similar anomalies, though the parents were non-consanguineous. Radiographs confirmed radial ray defects, and further evaluation showed normal cardiac and renal function. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the TP63 gene, consistent with a diagnosis of Limb-Mammary Syndrome. The patient was referred for orthopedic management and endocrinology follow-up for breast development monitoring.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep my answer simple and honest, explaining my physical concerns and how I\u2019m feeling emotionally about it. I want to tell the doctor what's been bothering me without sounding too worried or confused. I\u2019ll try to mention both my body and how I feel about everything.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019m here because I\u2019m worried about my arms and my chest. I don\u2019t really understand why I don\u2019t have normal breasts yet, and I feel kind of weird about it all. It\u2019s been making me scared sometimes."

    "output": "I guess I kind of noticed my breasts being small, maybe a long time ago, but I didn't really think about it much at first. The arms and fingers are always like that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember them being different before. Sometimes I feel kind of shy or weird about how I look compared to other kids, and I don\u2019t really like talking about it much."
