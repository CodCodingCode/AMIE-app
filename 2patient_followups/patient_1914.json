    "input": "1. A 6-year-old boy presents with a history of delayed motor milestones and frequent falls over the past two years. His parents report progressive difficulty in walking and frequent tripping despite normal cognitive development. On examination, he demonstrates distal muscle weakness, areflexia in the lower limbs, and noticeable muscle atrophy. Sensory testing reveals diminished vibration and proprioception in his feet. Nerve conduction studies show markedly reduced conduction velocities consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. A sural nerve biopsy reveals hypertrophic changes with onion bulb formations characteristic of hypertrophic neuropathy. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the PMP22 gene, supporting the diagnosis of Hypertrophic Neuropathy of Dejerine-Sottas. The child is enrolled in physical therapy and monitored for complications such as foot deformities and contractures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I came here today. I should explain my issues, but I might feel confused or nervous about what to say. I want to be honest about what\u2019s bothering me without sounding like I don\u2019t understand.\n\nANSWER: I think I just don\u2019t feel right lately. I\u2019ve been falling a lot more and my legs feel weird \u2014 like, they\u2019re not so strong and kind of tired, even though I try to walk. It\u2019s been hard to do things I used to do easily."

    "output": "Um, I think it started maybe a couple of years ago? I just started falling more and having trouble walking, like I trip even when I try to stand still. Sometimes it feels worse if I run or jump, and resting doesn't seem to help much. I get kind of tired in my legs, and they feel funny sometimes."

    "output": "I feel kinda funny in my feet sometimes, like they\u2019re tingly or something, and my legs feel all tired even when I haven\u2019t done much. I don\u2019t really know about the rest, I just get really tired and my legs hurt sometimes when I walk long distances."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my legs feel weird, and I trip more now than before. I don't really know when it gets worse, but it can happen anytime, even when I try to walk or when I sit for a while. Things just feel kind of funny, and I get tired easily."
