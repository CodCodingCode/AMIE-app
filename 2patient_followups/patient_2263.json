    "input": "2. A 35-year-old man presents with a 4-year history of gradually worsening distal leg weakness and intermittent cramps, making it increasingly difficult to climb stairs and run. He notes a persistent burning sensation in his feet and occasional numbness in his fingertips. On neurological examination, he has bilateral foot drop, mild pes cavus deformity, and absent ankle reflexes, with decreased pinprick and vibration sense in a stocking distribution. Muscle bulk is reduced in the lower legs, especially the tibialis anterior and peroneal muscles. His mother developed \"foot problems\" and walking difficulties in her 40s, suggesting an inherited neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies reveal reduced amplitude of motor responses with normal or mildly reduced conduction velocities, consistent with an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy. Genetic analysis confirms a heterozygous mutation in the KIF5A gene consistent with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. He is advised on supportive care including ankle-foot orthoses and enrolled in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to optimize function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a man in his 30s with a long history of leg weakness and sensory issues, so I should focus on how it\u2019s affecting his daily life and what symptoms are bothering him most now. He seems to have been dealing with this for a while, so I want to be gentle and understanding, encouraging him to share his worries.  \nANSWER: Well, I guess it\u2019s been getting worse over the past few years, especially when I walk or try to run. Sometimes my feet feel really weird, like burning or numb, and I just can't seem to keep them steady anymore. It\u2019s kind of scary, honestly, and I don\u2019t really know why it\u2019s happening or what I should do about it."

    "output": "Uh, well, I guess I first started noticing my feet feeling weird, like a burning or tingling sensation, maybe about four years ago? At first, it wasn\u2019t really bothering me much, but lately, it\u2019s been worse, and I feel like I can\u2019t really stand or walk properly anymore. Sometimes my legs feel really weak, and I get these cramps that come and go. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s connected, but I also occasionally feel numbness or tingling in my fingertips. I don\u2019t remember having any big problems before this, and I haven\u2019t had any other health issues I can think of. It\u2019s just kind of been slowly creeping up on me."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s kind of hard to do some of the things I used to, like climbing stairs or running around with my kids. Sometimes the burning in my feet feels worse if I stand too long, and I feel pretty clumsy now. Nothing really seems to make it better, but I\u2019ve noticed it gets a little worse when I\u2019m tired or if I\u2019m on my feet a lot."

    "output": "Um, I can't say I really noticed any other specific weakness in my muscles, but sometimes I feel like my legs get really heavy or tired, especially after I walk a lot. I don't think I have any problems with my bladder or bowels, at least I haven't noticed anything weird there. And my vision hasn't changed or anything, I think. As for alcohol or other health stuff, I don't drink much or often, and I don't have diabetes or digestive problems that I know of. Sorry, I\u2019m not sure if any of that helps."
