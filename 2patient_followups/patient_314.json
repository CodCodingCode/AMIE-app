Lately, I\u2019ve been coughing up a little blood and I feel like I can\u2019t breathe very well sometimes. My ankles are swollen, and I feel pretty tired.\u201d\"Thank you for sharing that. To better understand your breathing difficulty, can you tell me if you ever notice trouble breathing when you're lying down or trying to sleep, or if you wake up feeling short of breath at night? Also, regarding your leg swelling, do you find it gets worse when you're lying down, or does it stay consistent throughout the day? How heavy or uncomfortable do your legs feel, and does this affect how you move around or sleep?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit overwhelmed and worried about all these symptoms, especially the blood and trouble breathing. I don\u2019t really understand what it all means, but I want answers and help. I\u2019m trying to answer honestly without sounding too technical or like I know what\u2019s going on.\nANSWER: Yes, sometimes I notice I wake up in the night feeling short of breath, and it\u2019s harder to breathe when I lie flat. The swelling in my legs feels heavy and uncomfortable all the time, and it doesn\u2019t seem to get better or worse at certain times \u2014 it just stays. It makes it hard to walk or sleep well.",
