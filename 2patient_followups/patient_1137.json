    "input": "2. A 45-year-old male presents with a three-month history of persistent swelling in his left arm following surgical removal of a melanoma on his upper arm. He describes a sensation of tightness and mild aching that worsens by the end of the day. His past treatment included lymph node dissection in the axillary region. Physical examination reveals non-pitting edema extending from the hand to the elbow, with noticeable peau d\u2019orange skin changes and mild fibrosis. There is no erythema or warmth, and pulses are intact. He denies fever or acute pain, and Doppler ultrasound excludes deep vein thrombosis. The patient\u2019s history and presentation are consistent with secondary lymphedema resulting from lymphatic disruption after cancer surgery. Compression therapy and physiotherapy are recommended to manage symptoms and prevent progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is here because they've been experiencing ongoing swelling and discomfort in their arm that hasn't gone away, and it's been bothering them for a while now. I should keep my reply simple and focused on what they've been feeling rather than trying to diagnose anything.  \nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been noticing my arm\u2019s been bigger and kind of tight. It\u2019s been like that for a few months now, and it\u2019s pretty uncomfortable especially as the days go on. I thought I should have someone check what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I think I first saw it a few months ago, maybe around the time I finished treatment... It just, like, started slowly, and then it kind of stayed the same but now it's, I dunno, more swollen or something. It kind of feels tight and sometimes a little achy, especially later in the day. No, I didn't notice anything weird like bruising or discoloration, and I haven't really hurt it or anything. Mostly it just feels different, and I\u2019ve been a bit worried about it."

    "output": "Well, um, it doesn\u2019t seem to get worse at certain times or with anything I can really tell. Sometimes, it feels a little tighter at the end of the day, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been moving around or just because I\u2019ve been sitting too long. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything specific like heat or anything else affecting it."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I don\u2019t really notice any stiffness or anything with my joints.
