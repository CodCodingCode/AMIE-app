    "input": "1. A 15-year-old female presents with gradually worsening balance difficulties and frequent falls over the past two years. Her parents report slow speech development and increasing clumsiness since early childhood. On examination, she has dysarthria, limb ataxia, and gaze-evoked nystagmus. Muscle tone is decreased, and deep tendon reflexes are diminished. There is no family history of similar neurological symptoms. MRI reveals cerebellar atrophy without significant spinal cord involvement. Genetic testing confirms a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Autosomal Recessive 25 due to biallelic mutations in the gene associated with this condition. Supportive therapy with physical rehabilitation is initiated to improve coordination and prevent falls.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should explain what\u2019s been bothering me, but I might not be very clear or specific about it. I need to mention my symptoms and how they've been making me feel, maybe sounding a bit worried or uncertain since I don\u2019t fully understand everything myself. I should keep it simple and honest, just sharing what I notice day to day.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m here because I\u2019ve been falling a lot and I feel sort of unsteady, like I can\u2019t keep my balance. It\u2019s been getting worse over the last couple of years, and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s wrong or why it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s kind of scary sometimes, and I just want to see if there\u2019s anything that can help."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been worse over time...like, I fall more often now, even just walking around the house. Sometimes I feel kind of wobbly, like I can\u2019t really balance, especially if I\u2019m trying to do more than one thing at once. It\u2019s better when I sit still, but even then, I feel like I might tip over sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I guess I just feel kind of wobbly most of the time, and sometimes I fall more than I used to. Like, if I\u2019m trying to focus on something or if I\u2019m tired, it gets worse, I think. It\u2019s really confusing because I don\u2019t always know when I\u2019ll be okay or when I\u2019ll stumble."

    "output": "Umm, I think it just kind of happens when I\u2019m walking or sometimes even when I\u2019m standing still. It\u2019s like I suddenly lose my balance, and I fall or almost fall. I don\u2019t really notice anything special happening before it, and it\u2019s not always the same, really. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or like my eyes go funny, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s always there."

It makes it hard to read stuff or look at things above me, and it feels worse sometimes if I try to look up quickly. It's kind of annoying, and I think it gets worse when I\u2019m tired or anxious."
