    "input": "5. A 9-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of multiple congenital anomalies including a cleft palate and hearing impairment. He exhibited prominent supraorbital ridges, low-set ears, and broad, short fingers with hypoplastic nails. His parents noted delayed speech development and frequent middle ear infections since infancy. Audiological assessment revealed a moderate mixed hearing loss bilaterally. Radiographic studies demonstrated skeletal dysplasia characterized by bowed long bones, hypoplastic clavicles, and vertebral segmentation anomalies. There was no known family history of similar conditions, and the pregnancy was notable only for mild polyhydramnios. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant in the FLNA gene, confirming an otopalatodigital spectrum disorder. The child was enrolled in a multidisciplinary program including surgical planning for palate repair, audiologic rehabilitation, and physical therapy for mobility support.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young boy, so he might not be able to clearly explain what he's feeling. His mother or father is probably responsible for answers, but I'm supposed to respond as if I am the boy, possibly sounding uncertain or worried. I need to be vague and show some signs of discomfort or confusion without giving too much medical detail.\n\nANSWER: Um, I don't feel quite right today. My ears feel all clogged up and I can't hear very well, and my nose is stuffy or maybe it\u2019s my throat, I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want to go to school because everything feels kinda weird inside, and I don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t do things like before."

    "output": "I guess it kind of started when I was really little, and I kept getting ear infections and had trouble talking. Things feel a little different now, like my ears and my bones, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s worse or better. I don\u2019t have a fever or anything, and I don\u2019t really understand all this stuff about symptoms changing."

    "output": "I guess it makes it hard to hear stuff sometimes, especially when there's lots of noise. I get pretty frustrated when I can't understand my teachers or friends properly. Sometimes my head feels a little funny, like they're weird feelings, but I don\u2019t really know what they are."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes my ears feel stuffy or like they\u2019re not really working right, and I hear things funny, especially when I\u2019m sick or if I\u2019ve been swimming. And my bones, um, I think they feel kind of funny sometimes, like they\u2019re a little bent or not normal, and I get tired faster when I run around. It\u2019s been happening for a while, but it\u2019s hard to say just when it started or if it changes a lot."

    "output": "I guess I don\u2019t really look at my face much, but I do feel like my head or my bones sometimes feel kind of strange, like they\u2019re not quite right or they move in ways they shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s worse when I\u2019m tired or after I\u2019ve been moving around a lot."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes when I move my head or bend over, it feels kinda weird, but other times it doesn\u2019t seem to change. And when I wake up in the morning, I feel kind of stiff and different, like my bones are weird or something. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not."
