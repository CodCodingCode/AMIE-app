It all started this morning\u2014my right eye just went dark, like I was looking through fog, and I can\u2019t see out of it anymore. It happened so fast, I didn\u2019t really expect it. I\u2019ve been kind of anxious about it all day because I\u2019m worried it could be something serious\u2014maybe a stroke or something with my blood pressure or diabetes?
