She\u2019s polite and cooperative but visibly distressed, so I need to reassure her while gathering details.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m 55 and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve had these patches on my skin for a while, but I think they started about six months ago, or maybe a little longer? They just kept growing and now they seem much bigger and darker... and there are more of them. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening but they feel firm and kinda raised, like bumps under the skin. Some of them itch or feel uncomfortable now, and I\u2019m really worried they might be something serious, like a tumor or cancer.

Sometimes, subtle early signs can be hard to remember, but these details can really help in understanding what might be going on and whether it matches patterns typical of conditions like mycosis fungoides. Would you be comfortable describing what these patches looked like originally and how they\u2019ve changed as they\u2019ve grown?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a bit unsure about when exactly I noticed all this. I think it was maybe last year, but then I noticed more of them and they got bigger lately, like in the last couple of months? It\u2019s all a bit jumbled in my head, and I don\u2019t really remember clearly what they looked like at first or if they changed suddenly or gradually. I just know they\u2019re bigger now and some feel weird.\nANSWER: Umm, I think I first saw them maybe last year? Or was it a little after that? They were small and kinda flat, and they looked like skin-colored patches, maybe a little darker in some places, but I\u2019m not exactly sure. They didn\u2019t feel as firm before, just like maybe regular patches, but now they\u2019re really raised and firm and some itch and feel uncomfortable, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve changed in color or texture or something. It\u2019s all sort of mixed up in my head.",
