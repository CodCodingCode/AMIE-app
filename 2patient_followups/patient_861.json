    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I need to tell him everything, but honestly I\u2019m kind of freaked out right now. My head\u2019s all foggy and I keep shaking, but I also keep thinking about how I was just playing soccer earlier today, and I felt some blurry vision then, kind of like stuff wasn\u2019t clear. I mean, I don\u2019t know if that matters, but after tonight\u2019s stuff, my heart\u2019s been racing like crazy, and I've been sweating nonstop\u2014like I was in a sauna. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s been super intense and I just want to stop feeling like this.\nANSWER: Yeah, so when I was playing soccer earlier, I noticed my vision getting kind of blurry, like everything wasn\u2019t quite in focus, but it went away after a bit. And then tonight, I used those bath salts\u2014don\u2019t ask me why, I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2014and my heart just started pounding really hard, and I felt super sweaty and anxious. It\u2019s been like that since then, and it\u2019s not really stopping; I feel like I might actually lose it.",
