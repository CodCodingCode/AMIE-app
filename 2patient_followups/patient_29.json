    "input": "2. A 14-year-old boy arrives at the clinic complaining of sudden, excruciating pain in his right testicle that started about 2 hours ago while he was sleeping. He also notes swelling and redness of the scrotum, accompanied by feeling nauseous but no fever or urinary symptoms. He denies any recent trauma or heavy physical activity. On physical exam, the right testicle is tender, firm, and noticeably higher than the left, with an absent cremasteric reflex on that side. His left testicle is of normal size and non-tender. Urinalysis is normal, showing no signs of infection. A prompt scrotal color Doppler ultrasound reveals absent blood flow to the right testicle, consistent with acute testicular torsion. Given the time-sensitive nature, he is immediately prepped for surgical detorsion to salvage testicular function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that I suddenly started feeling really bad and that my testicle hurts a lot, so I should tell the doctor that right away. I also want to mention the swelling and how it all just came on suddenly, to make it clear I didn\u2019t do anything to cause it. I should sound worried but maybe not totally clear about everything since I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening. \n\nANSWER: I\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it just started hurting really bad in my right testicle, like out of nowhere. It\u2019s all swollen and red and I feel kinda sick, like I wanna throw up. I\u2019ve never felt anything like this before, and I was just sleeping when it started."
