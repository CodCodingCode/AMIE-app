    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female presents with a 7-year history of progressive difficulty in dorsiflexion of both feet and frequent ankle sprains. She describes a burning sensation and numbness that began in her toes and gradually extended up to her calves. On examination, there is marked muscle wasting in the anterior compartment of the lower legs and mild clawing of her toes, along with reduced pinprick and proprioceptive sensation distally. Deep tendon reflexes at the ankles are absent, while knee and upper limb reflexes are preserved. Her family history reveals that her father had a similar gait disturbance and hand weakness in his 40s. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes with normal conduction velocities, consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic mutation in the REEP1 gene, confirming Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Axonal, Type 2v. She has been advised on ankle-foot orthoses and is engaged in a tailored rehabilitation program to maintain strength and prevent falls.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly but honestly, without making it sound more serious than it feels. I should mention how long I've had this and what kind of problems I'm really struggling with.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 35-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve been having this weird stuff with my feet and ankles for about seven years now. They feel kind of burning and numb, and sometimes I trip or sprain my ankles a lot, even when I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything unusual. It\u2019s been getting worse, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been, like, getting worse? Sometimes my feet feel really weird, like they\u2019re burning or numb, and I can\u2019t control them right. It\u2019s harder to do things I used to do, especially walking or standing for a long time. I\u2019m kind of worried about falling or not being able to do stuff on my own."

    "output": "Well, I guess I feel kind of off sometimes, like my legs don't really want to move the way I want them to, and I get tired pretty easily. It's hard to tell if it's just from walking or if there's more going on, and I worry about falling. I haven't noticed anything with my vision or dizziness exactly, but I do sometimes feel a bit strange when I try to do things quickly or if I stand for a long time. It\u2019s all kind of confusing."

    "output": "Um, I mean, I do sometimes feel a bit wobbly if I stand too long or if I try to walk down stairs, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal, and I haven't really noticed my vision changing or anything like that. It\u2019s mostly just those weird tingling and burning feelings in my feet and legs."
