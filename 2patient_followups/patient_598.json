I should just say what I can remember, even if it sounds all jumbled.\nANSWER: Well, I think it was around six weeks ago when I first felt that tingling in my left hand, and I thought it was just from sleeping weird or maybe tired. But then, I guess, the numbness started spreading into my arm and leg, though I\u2019m not sure exactly when. The lump near my thigh, I just recently noticed it feels bigger and firmer, but I\u2019m not sure if it was always there or if it\u2019s changed. Sometimes, the numbness and numbness come and go, but lately, it\u2019s been pretty steady and worse. The pain \u2014 sometimes sharp, sometimes dull \u2014 I think it\u2019s come at different times but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s all related or what exactly caused what.",
