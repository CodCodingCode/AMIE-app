    "input": "2. A 10-year-old boy is brought to the neurology clinic due to worsening seizures that began around age 5, accompanied by worsening intellectual disability and behavioral challenges. His parents note progressive joint stiffness, especially in the wrists and ankles, which has led to difficulties with walking and hand use. On physical exam, he exhibits facial features including hypertelorism, a prominent nasal tip, and a thin upper lip. Neurological evaluation reveals axial hypotonia with spasticity in the limbs and impaired fine motor skills. Cognitive assessment demonstrates moderate intellectual disability with significant language delay and limited social engagement. EEG shows frequent epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal regions, while brain MRI remains normal. The family history reveals an affected maternal cousin with similar symptoms presenting with developmental delay and seizures. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the responsible X-linked gene, leading to initiation of tailored antiepileptic therapy and multidisciplinary care including orthopedic consultation for joint contracture management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 10-year-old boy, so his responses might be limited or vague. He's likely to feel confused or overwhelmed by the visit, possibly anxious or embarrassed about his symptoms. He might not fully understand what's happening, so I should keep his responses simple and focus on what he feels.\n\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t feel right\u2026 my head feels all strange and I\u2019m having these tingly feelings in my arms and legs. It\u2019s been happening more and more, and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel different inside, like my head or my body is kind of all over the place. I don\u2019t really know what makes it worse or better, but it\u2019s hard to do some things like walking or using my hands like I used to."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been hard to tell exactly, but I think I\u2019ve been having more trouble moving my hands and feet, and I get tired really easily. Sometimes I see stuff in my eyes or feel kind of funny, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new or just how it\u2019s always been."

    "output": "Well, it all kinda started when he was around five, I think. The seizures got worse, and he started having a harder time walking and using his hands. He's been more stiff lately, and he doesn\u2019t seem to talk much or play like other kids. Sometimes he gets really upset or frustrated, and I notice he's having more trouble with things he used to do easily. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not, but it feels like it\u2019s been getting worse over the years."
