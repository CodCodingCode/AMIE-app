    "input": "2. A 34-year-old female presents with a 6-year history of progressive gait instability and stiffness in her legs. She describes intermittent muscle spasms and noticeable slurring of speech that have gradually worsened over time. On examination, she exhibits pronounced lower limb spasticity with increased deep tendon reflexes, along with dysmetria and intention tremor suggestive of cerebellar involvement. Her gait is wide-based and unsteady, and she requires assistance for longer distances. Cognitive functions remain intact, but she reports occasional urinary urgency and mild pain in her calves after prolonged walking. Brain MRI reveals significant cerebellar atrophy, especially in the superior vermis, without other abnormalities. Family history reveals her father had similar symptoms beginning in his thirties, implying an autosomal dominant inheritance. Genetic analysis confirms a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene, establishing the diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia 2.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to express her ongoing issues clearly but in a way that reflects her confusion and emotional state. She might feel anxious or embarrassed about her symptoms but also worried about what the doctor might find. I should keep her response vague and focused on her feelings and what she's experiencing day-to-day.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really off for a long time. My legs feel weird, like they\u2019re all stiff and wobbly, and I have trouble walking straight lately. It\u2019s been getting worse over the years, and I just don\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s happening to me."

    "output": "Well, it's been really tough to do things I used to do easily, like walking for a bit or even standing for a while. Sometimes I feel clumsy, and I worry about falling or messing up, so I avoid crowded places or long walks. It sort of makes me anxious and frustrated because I never know when it'll get worse."

    "output": "Well, I think it started a few years ago, maybe around six? At first, it was just kind of feeling like my legs were a bit stiff and unsteady sometimes, but now it feels worse and I get these spasms and I stumble more often. I haven't really noticed anything with my memory or vision that I can tell, but I do have to pee more urgently sometimes and my calves get a bit sore after walking for a while."

    "output": "Um, I guess everything's just been getting more out of control, like my legs especially, and I feel like I can\u2019t really walk straight most of the time. Sometimes I feel kind of foggy or like my thoughts are slower, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really new. As for my vision or sensation, I don\u2019t really notice anything different, but sometimes my calves hurt after walking a long time. It\u2019s all kind of confusing."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my legs feel a little weird, like tingly or numb, but it doesn\u2019t seem to last very long or get worse with moving around. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything strange in my arms or anywhere else, though."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I think my legs sometimes feel numb or tingly, and it\u2019s been happening for a while. I also have trouble doing little things with my hands. As for my face, I don\u2019t really notice double vision or weakness, but sometimes I feel like my face doesn\u2019t move quite right or I have a hard time smiling properly."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think it was sudden, more like it\u2019s been slowly happening? Like, sometimes I notice it more, and then it kind of eases up, but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s coming back or if it\u2019s still there. Both sides kind of feel the same, I guess, but sometimes maybe one side is a little more noticeable. It\u2019s been there quite a bit lately, though."

    "output": "Well, I guess I do feel off sometimes when I try to walk or keep my balance, and my legs feel shaky. I haven't really noticed double vision, but sometimes I get those strange urges to go to the bathroom more than usual, especially if I\u2019ve been walking a lot. It\u2019s all kind of jumbled in my head, honestly."
