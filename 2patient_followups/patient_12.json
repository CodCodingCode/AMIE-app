I want to answer honestly, but I don\u2019t want to sound overly worried or scare myself.\n\nANSWER: Well, the blood\u2019s been there pretty much every time I go. It\u2019s like a bright red, and sometimes it seems a little more than other times, but mostly about the same. The pain, it\u2019s like a dull ache, kind of deep on my right side, right below my ribs. Most of the time it stays about the same, but I think sometimes it feels a little worse. I don\u2019t really notice if I\u2019m extra tired or short of breath or anything like that. It\u2019s mostly the blood and the ache that\u2019s got me nervous.",
