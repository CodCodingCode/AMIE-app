You first thought it was just a pimple or irritation, but it hasn\u2019t gone away and keeps bleeding easily. You\u2019re also pregnant and taking prenatal vitamins, which you read can sometimes influence skin changes.

There\u2019s this little bump on my upper lip that\u2019s gotten pretty big over the past few weeks, and it\u2019s bright red and kind of sore. It also bleeds really easily if I accidentally bump it or touch it, and it sometimes scabs over. I honestly don\u2019t really know what it is, but it\u2019s been growing fast, and I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s different from things I\u2019ve had before, and I feel a bit uncomfortable, especially when it gets bumped.",
