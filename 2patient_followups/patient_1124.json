Can you tell me if your tiredness, feeling hot, or pain has been getting worse since you first noticed them, or if they\u2019ve stayed the same? Specifically, do you feel more tired now than a few days ago? And when you feel hot or uncomfortable, does anything help or make it worse? Also, are you feeling more short of breath or dizzy than before, or has the bone pain become more painful? It\u2019s okay to tell me honestly\u2014your answers will help us figure out what\u2019s going on and what we need to do next.\"information_withholder",
