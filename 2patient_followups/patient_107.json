Also, you mentioned feeling tired and having trouble focusing\u2014can you tell me more about those feelings? Are they happening alongside your eye issues or at different times?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little overwhelmed by all the questions and worried that maybe I\u2019m seeing things or feeling symptoms that are serious. I don\u2019t really understand what all these eye terms mean, and I just want to know why I\u2019m so tired all the time and if what I feel could be dangerous.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t really see tiny spots or shadows all the time, but sometimes I notice like blurry stuff or lines crossing my vision, and it kind of happens suddenly or if I get really tired. It\u2019s mostly happening when I\u2019m doing stuff, like reading or looking at my phone, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s making my head hurt more or if it\u2019s something bad.",
