I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse, but I do notice if I sit still, it might ease up, or if I get up and walk around, it sometimes gets worse.

It\u2019s like I get this foggy feeling in my head, and I can't really focus on reading or even watching TV without feeling drained, and that\u2019s been going on for a few weeks now, especially after lunch. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not, but I just feel so worn out, like I could just fall asleep sitting up sometimes.\nANSWER: I\u2019d say I\u2019d give it around an 8, mainly because I feel so tired most of the time, especially after I do little tasks or sit down for a bit. It\u2019s kind of making everything harder\u2014like even talking or remembering things seems tougher than usual, and it\u2019s messing with my usual routine.",
