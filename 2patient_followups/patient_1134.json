    "input": "1. A 12-year-old girl presents to the pediatric endocrinology clinic with a six-month history of rapid weight gain, increased facial hair, and irregular menstrual cycles. Her mother reports that she has also developed a noticeable roundness to her face and a deepening voice over the past few months. Physical examination reveals central obesity, hypertension, and abdominal striae. Laboratory tests show elevated cortisol and androgen levels, along with suppressed ACTH. Imaging via abdominal CT scan identifies a large mass in the left adrenal gland. Genetic testing reveals a TP53 mutation consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, implicating a hereditary predisposition to adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient's family history includes multiple relatives with early-onset cancers. She is referred for surgical oncology evaluation and multidisciplinary management, including genetic counseling for her family.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why she's here today. I should explain my symptoms without overloading the info, just enough to give a sense of what's been bothering me. I might be nervous or embarrassed about all the changes I've been experiencing. I should keep it simple but honest, even if I don't completely understand everything myself.\n\nANSWER: I, um, I'm not feeling right. I\u2019ve been gaining a lot of weight really fast, and I\u2019ve been getting dark spots and this round face that I never had before. My voice sounds funny and deep now, and I don\u2019t have regular periods anymore. It all just feels really confusing and scary."
