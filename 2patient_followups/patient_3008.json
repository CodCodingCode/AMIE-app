    "input": "1. A 4-year-old boy is brought to the developmental pediatrician by his parents due to delayed speech and difficulty with social interactions. He exhibits distinctive facial features including deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, and a pronounced Cupid\u2019s bow on his upper lip. His developmental milestones are significantly delayed; he is nonverbal and exhibits episodes of hyperventilation followed by apnea. The child also has hypotonia and demonstrates an unusual happy demeanor with frequent smiling. His parents report he has had recurrent constipation and some seizures beginning in early infancy. On examination, there is noted global developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. Genetic testing reveals a pathogenic mutation in the TCF4 gene, confirming the diagnosis. The family is counseled regarding supportive therapies including speech, occupational therapy, and seizure management for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that I\u2019m feeling something different today but not sure what it is. I might be worried or confused about my symptoms, and I should keep it simple and honest. I should mention my age and gender first, then talk about what\u2019s happening now.\n\nANSWER: I am 4, and I am a boy. I don\u2019t know, I just feel weird today, like I\u2019m not really myself. My breathing was kind of strange and it frightened me, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of fuzzy and happy, but then I got tired really fast."

For instance, how long did it last, and did anything seem to trigger it?",
    "output": "It was really scary, honestly. He started breathing really fast and then just stopped for a little while, like he wasn\u2019t breathing at all. It maybe lasted a few seconds, but it felt so much longer, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t notice anything that seemed to cause it, but he was upset and fussing before it happened."

For example, was he sleeping, playing, eating, or around any new substances or allergens?",
    "output": "Um, he was just sitting there, kinda playing with his toys, and then he suddenly started breathing differently, like he was trying to breathe too fast or something. It happened pretty quick, and he looked uncomfortable, I guess. Nothing new that I noticed right before it, and I don\u2019t think he was around anything different than usual."

    "output": "Umm, I think sometimes he stops breathing and then he wakes up and looks a little scared or upset. It doesn\u2019t seem to happen exactly after things like eating, but he does it more when he's really excited or maybe tired. I\u2019m not sure if it happens more lying down or sitting. It just kind of happens randomly I think."

Sometimes I just see him breathe funny and then stop, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse in any particular position."
