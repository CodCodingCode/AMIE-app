    "input": "1. An 8-year-old girl is evaluated in a neurology clinic for severe intellectual disability and absent speech development. Her parents describe episodes of rapid breathing followed by breath-holding and occasional cyanosis, which began in early childhood. Physical examination reveals a broad nasal bridge, a wide mouth with a pronounced Cupid\u2019s bow, and deep-set eyes with strabismus. She has significant hypotonia and poor motor coordination, unable to walk independently. There is also a history of chronic constipation and frequent respiratory infections. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring shows intermittent seizure activity consistent with her reported seizures. Neurodevelopmental assessment confirms global developmental delays with profound impairment in communication skills. Genetic testing identifies a de novo mutation in the TCF4 gene, establishing the diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and prompting initiation of multidisciplinary supportive care.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should mention my main concerns but keep it simple. I feel a bit overwhelmed, so I might not explain everything clearly. I want to be honest about my feelings and symptoms without pretending I understand medical terms.\n\nANSWER: Hi, I\u2019m 8 years old, and I have a really hard time talking and moving right. I\u2019ve been having these quick breathing spells and sometimes I stop breathing for a little while and turn blue, and it\u2019s been happening since I was little. I get really tired and it\u2019s just not been easy for me to do things."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes she seems to have more trouble breathing, like it happens more often or she struggles longer before she calms down. She also feels more tired, I guess, and her limbs seem a bit weaker, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s different than before."

    "output": "Um, she kind of\u2026 she makes like, mostly heavy sounds sometimes when she breathes, and she kind of holds her breath sometimes, especially when she's upset or sleeping. She hasn\u2019t really been moving much more or less than usual, but I think she\u2019s been a little more sleepy or tired. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s anything, but she seems different maybe."

    "output": "Um, she kind of makes these loud sounds, and her face turns really red or blue sometimes. She holds her breath for a little while, and then she seems to breathe again, but I don't know how long it lasts\u2014sometimes it feels longer than it looks. No, I haven't noticed anything that really triggers it or makes it better; it just happens, and we hope it stops."

    "output": "She\u2019s been having some trouble with swallowing lately\u2014she coughs a lot when she eats or drinks, and sometimes she seems to choke. Her walking has also gotten a little worse, and she seems more unsteady than before.

    "output": "Um, I don't know about my liver or anything like that, but sometimes my eyes seem kinda weird or they move funny, I think. And I don\u2019t really understand what the doctor means about the other stuff, so I just feel tired and sometimes my body feels all funny too."
