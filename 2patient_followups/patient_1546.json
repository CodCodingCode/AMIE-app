    "input": "1. A 28-year-old female presents with a slowly enlarging, painless mass on the left side of her neck that she first noticed six months ago. She reports occasional mild discomfort when swallowing but denies any fever, weight loss, or recent infections. Physical examination reveals a well-circumscribed, firm, non-tender, mobile subcutaneous swelling in the anterior cervical region near the midline. There are no signs of overlying skin changes or regional lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound imaging shows a heterogenous cystic lesion with areas of echogenic debris consistent with a dermoid cyst. Fine needle aspiration yields keratinaceous material without malignant cells. The patient has no relevant past medical history or recent trauma to the area. Based on clinical and radiological findings, a diagnosis of cervical dermoid cyst is made, and surgical excision is planned to prevent potential infection or enlargement.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that I noticed something weird on my neck that's been slowly getting bigger. I might sound a little uncertain or embarrassed because I don\u2019t really understand what it is or if it's serious. I should mention I don\u2019t have other big problems, just this thing bothering me now.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 28, and I\u2019m a woman. I guess I just, um, noticed this lump on my neck a few months ago. It\u2019s not really painful, but it\u2019s kind of firm and I can feel it just there, and I thought I should get it checked out because it doesn\u2019t seem to be going away or anything."

    "output": "Well, honestly, I guess I don't feel much different most of the time, but sometimes it feels a little strange when I swallow, like it's kind of tight or weird. I haven't noticed it changing much, but I keep thinking about it, and it kind of worries me a little."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess it\u2019s been kinda the same most of the time. I only noticed it more when I swallow, but I don\u2019t really feel any different overall? No idea about weight or feeling really tired, and my voice is still okay, I think. It\u2019s just there and kinda, I don\u2019t know, there sometimes more than others."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess it's kind of there all the time, and it\u2019s weird because sometimes it feels a little weird or uncomfortable when I swallow, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal? It\u2019s kinda been kind of distracting, and I just worry I guess, but I haven\u2019t noticed anything super serious or anything else changing."
