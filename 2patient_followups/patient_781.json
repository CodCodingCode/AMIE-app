    "input": "2. A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a four-month history of intermittent lower pelvic pain and increasing abdominal girth. She also reports experiencing early satiety and occasional nausea but denies any significant weight loss. Her menstrual cycles remain regular, though she has noticed heavier bleeding over the past two months. On examination, there is mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a firm, mobile pelvic mass is palpated. Transvaginal ultrasound reveals a 6 cm complex adnexal mass with solid and cystic components. Her past medical history is notable for surgically confirmed endometriosis during her late 30s. Laboratory studies show mildly elevated CA-125 at 95 U/mL. Given these findings, suspicion for endometrioid ovarian carcinoma is high, and she is scheduled for laparoscopic biopsy and staging.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I'm here today, so I should explain my symptoms without sounding too worried or medical. I need to be honest about what I\u2019ve been feeling, even if I don\u2019t fully understand it all myself. I should mention how long it's been going on and what bothers me most.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having this kind of nagging pain down there, and it\u2019s been coming and going for a few months. My belly\u2019s looking a bit bigger, and I feel full all the time, even if I haven\u2019t eaten much. It\u2019s kind of uncomfortable and weird, and I just wanted to check what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, it's been pretty confusing, honestly. Some days I feel okay, but then other times, like, I just get this weird pain in my belly that comes and goes, and I don\u2019t really know what makes it better or worse. It kind of feels like it\u2019s messing with my usual day, but I don\u2019t really understand why or when."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know if this is related, but sometimes I feel a little off when I go to the bathroom. Like, I don\u2019t notice anything specific, but I just feel kind of uncomfortable or bloated more than before. And I guess I haven\u2019t really lost or gained weight, but I feel like my stomach keeps getting bigger sometimes, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal."

    "output": "Um, well, my periods have been a bit heavier lately, and I\u2019ve felt a little\u2026 different with my bathroom stuff, like I\u2019m going often but not really going all out. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just normal or related. Nothing really about my weight, I don\u2019t think. It\u2019s just all kind of confusing and a little scary."
