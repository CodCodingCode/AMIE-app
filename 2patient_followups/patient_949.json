As for redness, I haven't really noticed much, but I\u2019ve been busy feeling terrible overall. I don\u2019t remember any change in my vision or light sensitivity, but honestly, I\u2019m kind of distracted trying to breathe and deal with all this chest pain.\nANSWER: I think it\u2019s been kind of off and on during the day, but I\u2019m not sure. I haven\u2019t really noticed any redness or change in my vision, and I don\u2019t think so about the light sensitivity, but I\u2019ve been pretty worried about everything else, so I might not be paying close attention.",
