    "input": "1. A 7-year-old girl is brought to neurology for evaluation of progressive muscle weakness and developmental delay. Her parents note that she had difficulty sitting independently until 12 months and has never been able to run or climb stairs like other children her age. On examination, she shows marked proximal limb weakness, hypotonia, and mild facial weakness, with difficulty swallowing and nasal speech. Serum creatine kinase is significantly elevated, and electromyography indicates a myopathic pattern. Brain MRI demonstrates ventriculomegaly and polymicrogyria, consistent with cerebral involvement. Cardiac evaluation reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy without functional impairment. Genetic analysis identifies a mutation in the POMGNT1 gene, confirming muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type a, 1. A multidisciplinary team initiates supportive therapies including physical rehabilitation, nutritional support, and cardiopulmonary monitoring.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my problems without going into too much detail or sounding like I understand what\u2019s happening. I should mention my symptoms and how I\u2019ve been feeling, maybe sound a little worried or confused.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 7-year-old girl, and I guess I\u2019m here because I\u2019ve been feeling really tired and weak lately. My muscles don\u2019t seem to work right, and I can\u2019t do things like climb stairs or run like other kids. I also feel kind of funny and sometimes have trouble swallowing."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more tired sometimes, even when I haven't done much. I try to walk or climb, but it\u2019s really hard and I get tired faster than before. And my face feels funny, like it\u2019s hard to smile or talk clearly."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my face feels kind of floppy or tired, and my voice sounds funny maybe? But then other times, I don\u2019t really notice something. I try to rest a lot, and it sort of helps, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the only thing."

    "output": "Um, she sometimes makes this funny gagging sound when she\u2019s eating, and I think she\u2019s having a little trouble with certain foods\u2014like she coughs or sputters a bit. She\u2019s also been a bit more tired when holding her head up or lifting things, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or if it\u2019s always been like that."
