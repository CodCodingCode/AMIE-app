    "input": "1. A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic by her parents due to a persistent swelling and intermittent discharge located just below her left ear that has been present for over a year. The swelling occasionally becomes erythematous and tender, especially after minor upper respiratory infections. Her parents also report a small skin opening near the inferior portion of her external auditory canal, from which a clear, odorless fluid sometimes leaks. There is no associated fever, hearing impairment, or facial weakness. On physical exam, a palpable, soft, and fluctuant mass is found near the angle of the mandible, with a tiny sinus tract opening on the skin surface anterior to the ear. Otoscopic examination reveals mild external auditory canal narrowing without middle ear involvement. Ultrasound imaging shows a cystic structure extending medially toward the parotid gland, and MRI further delineates a tract running from the skin near the external auditory canal to the deep facial planes. These clinical and radiologic findings suggest a first branchial cleft anomaly, consistent with a type I lesion arising from ectodermal remnants.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, probably anxious or confused about why she\u2019s here. She might struggle to explain clearly, so I should keep her comfortable and listen closely to her words. I need to keep the tone gentle and reassuring while encouraging her to share what\u2019s bothering her.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just... I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve had this bump near my ear for a long time, and sometimes it hurts and gets a little red. There\u2019s also some clear fluid that comes out from a tiny hole in my skin, and I don\u2019t really understand why. My parents said I should come see someone about it."

    "output": "Um, I think I\u2019ve had it for a really long time, maybe over a year... sometimes it feels sore, and I see a little stuff come out, but it doesn\u2019t really hurt all the time. It\u2019s kind of always there, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s been there a long time, and sometimes it gets a little sore or red, especially when I get sick. But I don't really know if it\u2019s bigger or smaller or anything else changing much."

    "output": "Um, I\u2019ve sort of noticed it looks bigger sometimes, especially when I have a cold or if I play outside a lot. But other times, it\u2019s kind of the same, like it\u2019s just there and not really bothering me much. I haven\u2019t really seen it go away, though."

    "output": "Um, the stuff doesn\u2019t always come out, only sometimes, like when it\u2019s bothering me. It\u2019s mostly clear, I think, and not really thick or stinky, just wet. I haven\u2019t had a fever or really hurt my ear or anything, but sometimes it feels kind of funny when it leaks."

    "output": "Well, I do notice like a puffiness and sometimes it hurts a little, even when I don\u2019t have a cold or anything. I also have this tiny opening on my skin that leaks sometimes. I don\u2019t really know if I had anything like a bump before I got older, just that part near my ear."
