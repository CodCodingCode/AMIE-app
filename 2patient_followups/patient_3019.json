    "input": "2. A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic due to a two-year history of worsening seizures and progressive loss of motor skills. Her parents note that she has developed frequent myoclonic jerks and has difficulty coordinating her movements, often stumbling and falling. She also complains of vision difficulties, including night blindness and decreased peripheral vision. Neurological examination reveals cognitive decline, spasticity, and mild ataxia. Brain MRI demonstrates diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, and an EEG shows generalized epileptiform activity. Ophthalmologic evaluation reveals optic nerve pallor and retinal degeneration. There is no known family history of similar symptoms, but genetic testing identifies mutations in the MFSD8 gene, confirming neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 11. The patient is started on anticonvulsant therapy and referred for physical and occupational therapy to manage her symptoms and maintain quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking in simple terms why I'm here today. I need to explain my feelings and symptoms without getting too detailed or technical. I should mention what's bothering me the most and how it has changed recently.\n\nANSWER: I'm a 9-year-old girl, and I don't really understand everything, but I feel really tired and sometimes I get these weird jerks that I can't control. My eyes feel funny, and I keep bumping into things or stumbling a lot more than before. It just doesn't feel right, and I guess I\u2019m worried because things are getting worse."

    "output": "Um... it's kind of hard to say exactly. Sometimes it just happens randomly, and I don\u2019t know why. They can last a few seconds or a bit longer, I think. Nothing I do really makes it better or worse, I guess. It just happens whenever, mostly."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening, but I feel kind of funny and shaky, like I can\u2019t control it. Sometimes it gets worse if I\u2019m tired or excited, and after, I feel really tired and kind of out of it, like I don\u2019t remember much."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t sleep very well... I sometimes wake up a lot, and I feel really tired during the day, but I don\u2019t know why. I also stumble more now and forget what I was supposed to do, and sometimes I get upset without knowing why. Things at home are kinda the same, but I guess I feel a little more tired than before."

Are they typically symmetric or asymmetric?",
    "output": "Um, sometimes I just start shaking all of a sudden, like my whole body jerks and I don't really expect it. I don\u2019t notice anything before it happens, and it feels kinda weird, not like I can control it. They seem to happen all over me at once, not just one side."

Also, do you experience any warning signs or sensations before an episode begins?",
    "output": "Um, I think they happen kind of a lot, but I\u2019m not really sure how many times, maybe every day but sometimes more or less? And it\u2019s mostly when I\u2019m trying to do stuff or at night, I guess. I don\u2019t really notice anything before they start, just suddenly I feel all strange, but I don\u2019t know what it is."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes she just kind of stares or looks like she\u2019s gone for a moment, but I don\u2019t know if she really fully loses consciousness. The jerks, um, they sometimes happen all over or just in one part\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure. No one\u2019s really explained if they watched her brain during those times, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s been any test like that."

    "output": "Um, sometimes in the morning when she wakes up, she has those jerks. She doesn\u2019t really talk about flashing lights or anything, but she seems to get tired or really sleepy, so maybe that\u2019s when it happens? I\u2019m not sure if anything else makes it worse."

And my eyelids sometimes twitch a little, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related. I just notice I have trouble focusing sometimes before I fall or do my jerks."
