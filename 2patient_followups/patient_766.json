She uses a wheelchair for longer distances.\n- She lives with her parents and has an older brother. Her family has a history of mitochondrial disorders; her maternal grandfather had unexplained neurological issues.\n- Emma is generally friendly but sometimes becomes easily frustrated when she can't do things she used to do.\n- She has had a history of episodes of seizures and muscle weakness, with some episodes requiring emergency care.\n**CURRENT MEDICAL SITUATION:**\n- Emma says, \"My legs feel really weak, and I can't run or jump like I used to.\"\n- Symptoms began around age 3 with developmental delay, but over the past year, her motor skills have worsened, and she has had more frequent seizures.\n- She reports muscle weakness and ataxia (difficulty walking steadily). Her seizures are occasional but sometimes severe.\n- She reports feeling tired and achy, especially after activity.\n- She was brought in today because her parents are worried about her increasing difficulty moving and recent seizure episodes.\n**ROLEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS:**\nYou are Emma Johnson.

I should mention my weakness and my seizures too, since they seem really serious and make me nervous. I also want to ask if it\u2019s because of my brain or my muscles, so I\u2019ll try to sound a little worried but cooperative.\nANSWER: Hi, um\u2026 I don\u2019t feel very good today.
