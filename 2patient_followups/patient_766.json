    "input": "1. A 12-year-old male presents with progressive vision loss and night blindness, which his parents first noticed around age 8. He has a history of early-onset obesity and difficulty with balance and coordination. On examination, he demonstrates polydactyly on both hands and mild intellectual disability. Fundoscopic evaluation reveals retinal dystrophy consistent with rod-cone degeneration. His growth charts show truncal obesity, and laboratory tests indicate mild renal insufficiency. Family history is notable for consanguinity but no known genetic disorders. MRI of the brain shows mild cerebellar hypoplasia. Genetic testing confirms a pathogenic variant in the ARL6 gene, consistent with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 19.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and might be feeling confused or worried about why they\u2019re at the doctor\u2019s office today. I should keep my response simple, honest, and convey some of the ongoing issues they've been experiencing. Mentioning multiple symptoms could help the doctor understand what might be bothering them most.  \nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t know really. My eyes feel weird, and I keep seeing things kinda blurry, especially at night. Sometimes I feel really sleepy or tired, and I don\u2019t wanna walk straight sometimes."

    "output": "Um, well, the seeing stuff gets kind of blurry, especially at night, and it\u2019s worse when I\u2019m tired or in dim places, I guess. Sometimes, I feel kind of off-balance or clumsy more than before, and I don\u2019t really know why. Nothing I do seems to really help or make it better, and it just kinda keeps happening."

    "output": "Well, my vision has gotten really blurry, especially when it gets dark. I sometimes see like spots or shadows and I feel kind of off sometimes, like I\u2019m not steady on my feet. It\u2019s kind of like everything is kind of dull or weird-looking, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s connected, but I also feel like my eyes get tired easily."

    "output": "Um, I think it kind of happens slowly, like over days or weeks, but sometimes I see weird flashes or shadows that kind of come and go quickly. I'm not really sure how long they last, just that they kind of pop up and then go away."
