    "input": "1. A 14-year-old male presents with a two-year history of progressive weakness and wasting of the distal muscles in his hands and feet, accompanied by frequent falls while walking. He reports difficulty in dorsiflexion of his ankles, leading to a high-stepping gait, and complains of occasional numbness and tingling in his toes. On examination, there is marked muscle atrophy in the intrinsic hand muscles and anterior lower legs, pes cavus deformity, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Sensory testing reveals decreased vibration and proprioception distally. His father has a similar but milder neuropathy with foot deformities, suggesting a family history. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate markedly reduced conduction velocities, consistent with a demyelinating neuropathy. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the MFN2 gene, consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 7. The patient is referred for physical therapy and orthotic support to manage symptoms and improve mobility.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain my problems clearly but honestly, even if I feel a little embarrassed or confused about what\u2019s wrong. I want the doctor to understand I\u2019ve been having these weird feelings and trouble walking for a long time.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m 14 and I\u2019m a guy. Well, I\u2019ve been kind of falling a lot when I walk and my hands and feet feel all weird and weak, like they\u2019re wasting away, I guess. It\u2019s been happening for a couple of years now, and I just feel kinda shaky and off-balance all the time."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess it\u2019s been pretty hard lately. I get tired really fast, especially when I try to walk or stand for a long time. Sometimes my feet feel numb, like pins and needles, I think. And I keep falling, even if I don\u2019t feel like I was about to. It\u2019s not really clear if it gets worse at certain times \u2014 it\u2019s just kind of there all the time, I guess."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been kind of weird. Like, my hands and feet get really weak, and I drop stuff now sometimes, even stuff I\u2019m holding tight. It\u2019s worse when I do a lot of walking or stand for a long time, and I fall a lot now. Sometimes my toes feel numb or tingly, and I don\u2019t know, I guess it\u2019s kind of the same most days, but it\u2019s been getting a little worse over time, I think. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything that helps or makes it worse, really."

    "output": "Well, I think I started noticing my feet feeling kind of weird maybe about two years ago, like they\u2019d tingle and sometimes go numb. At first, it was just sometimes, but lately it\u2019s been worse\u2014like I fall more often and my legs feel really tired. I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better; sometimes rest helps, but not always. It just seems to keep getting worse, I think."

Also, were there any recent illnesses, infections, or immunizations preceding the onset of your symptoms?",
    "output": "Uh, yeah, my dad has something similar\u2026 he has foot problems and a little weakness too, but it was milder. As for recent illnesses or vaccines, I don\u2019t really remember anything like that happening before I started feeling this way. Nothing I can think of anyway."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s mostly been pretty slow and steady, but sometimes I feel worse than other days, and then it\u2019s kind of the same again. I haven\u2019t really had any sudden bad days or anything that just went away fast."

    "output": "No, I haven't really noticed anything like speaking or swallowing problems, or any changes in my thinking or mood. I just feel the weakness and some tingling in my toes, and it's been happening for a while."

    "output": "Um, yeah, sometimes I feel like I might fall if I\u2019m on uneven ground or if I try to go faster. And, I think walking uphill or not on flat surfaces makes it worse, like I get more tired or my feet feel weird."

    "output": "Um, I don't think it\u2019s gotten really faster or anything, but sometimes I feel like my feet or hands get a little more numb or weak than before, kind of gradually. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s worse suddenly or just slowly, you know?"
