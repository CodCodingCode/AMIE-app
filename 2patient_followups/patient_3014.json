    "input": "1. A 32-year-old male presents with a slowly progressive stiffness and weakness in both lower limbs that began in his mid-20s. He reports difficulty walking long distances and frequent tripping over his own feet. His family history reveals that his father had similar mobility issues starting in his 30s, suggesting an inherited disorder. On neurological examination, he exhibits spasticity in the lower extremities with hyperreflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Sensory examination is intact, and there are no signs of cerebellar involvement. MRI of the brain and spine is unremarkable, ruling out compressive causes of spasticity. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the SPAST gene, consistent with Spastic Paraplegia 17, Autosomal Dominant. Symptomatic management with physical therapy and antispasticity medications has been initiated to improve his gait and quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to express what\u2019s bothering him in a way that\u2019s honest but not overly technical. He might be feeling unsure or worried about his condition worsening, so he\u2019ll probably mention something about his walking or his feelings of fatigue or frustration. I should keep it simple and focus on the main issue.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 32, a guy. It\u2019s just that, lately, I\u2019ve been walking even slower and tripping more often, like I keep losing my balance. Sometimes it feels like my legs just don\u2019t want to cooperate, and I\u2019m kind of worried it\u2019s getting worse or I\u2019ll fall or something."

    "output": "Well, I guess I\u2019ve been walking more slowly, and I trip more often now \u2014 like my feet don\u2019t quite lift right, you know? I haven't really noticed anything weird upstairs or anything about feeling numb or going to the bathroom or anything. It just sort of feels like I\u2019m, I don\u2019t know, more stiff, I guess."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been making stuff harder, like walking longer or standing for a while. Sometimes I trip more than I used to, and I feel pretty tired after just a little walk. I haven't really noticed anything else weird, but I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more down too."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, walking has gotten kinda harder, and I trip more than before, even just around the house. Sometimes I feel tired, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s related or just me being lazy or something. I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a little down or just sorta stressed about all of this."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess I sort of feel like certain muscles stay tense or stiff, especially in my legs, and sometimes I feel like I get wobbly or kind of off balance, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the same thing. And, yeah, my dad had similar issues too, so I suppose there's some family thing going on."

    "output": "Uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I guess I just feel like my legs are really stiff and sometimes they don\u2019t move right, even when I try to walk. It\u2019s like they\u2019re heavier or something, and I trip sometimes, but I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s causing that. I just want it to stop or get better if I can."
