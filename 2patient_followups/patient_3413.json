    "input": "1. A 10-year-old male is referred to a genetics clinic after repeated evaluations for intellectual disability that was first noted around age 3. His parents describe significant language delays, limited social interactions, and difficulty with problem-solving tasks typical for his age. The child exhibits mild behavioral disturbances, including impulsivity and occasional aggression, which have led to challenges in school. On examination, he has a long face and mild macrocephaly without other major physical anomalies. Neurological assessment reveals low muscle tone and poor fine motor coordination. His mother reports a family history of learning difficulties affecting male relatives on her side. Neuropsychological testing demonstrates moderate cognitive impairment across verbal and nonverbal domains. Molecular genetic analysis confirms a pathogenic variant consistent with Mental Retardation, X-Linked 105, establishing the diagnosis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should tell them what\u2019s been bothering me or what's changed lately. I might feel a little nervous or unsure about how much to say. I should keep it simple but honest, sharing what\u2019s been making me feel uncomfortable or worried.\n\nANSWER: Well, um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of different lately. Like, I get upset pretty easily and it\u2019s hard for me to focus sometimes, even more than before. And I don\u2019t really understand why, but I just don\u2019t feel right."

    "output": "Um, I think I started noticing stuff kinda early, like when I was really little, but I don\u2019t remember exactly. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling kinda off, like everything\u2019s louder or more confusion than before, and I don\u2019t know if something changed or if it\u2019s just me."

    "output": "Well, sometimes I feel... like everything's just really hard or mixed up, especially when there's a lot going on. I don't always know why, but I guess I feel worse when I'm trying to do stuff I don't get or when there's a lot of noise or people talking at once. Other times, it's kind of okay, but I can't really say when exactly."
