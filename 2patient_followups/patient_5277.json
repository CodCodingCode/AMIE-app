    "input": "2. A 68-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of worsening intermittent headaches predominantly in the occipital region, accompanied by episodes of mild dizziness and occasional tinnitus. He denied any focal weakness or sensory changes but mentioned subtle difficulties with balance when walking on uneven surfaces. Neurological examination revealed slightly decreased proprioception in the lower limbs and mild gait ataxia. Brain MRI demonstrated a well-demarcated, dural-based mass along the left parietal convexity, exhibiting low signal intensity on T2-weighted images and intense homogeneous enhancement post-contrast. The mass showed characteristic dense fibrous stroma on imaging, consistent with a fibrous meningioma, and mild surrounding vasogenic edema was present. Given the lesion\u2019s size and progressive symptoms, surgical excision was planned to prevent further neurologic decline. Histopathological analysis confirmed fibrous meningioma, characterized by spindle cells embedded in abundant collagenous matrix and absence of atypical features. The patient experienced gradual symptomatic improvement after surgery and was scheduled for routine follow-up imaging.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling a bit embarrassed or unsure about how much to share, so I should encourage them to speak freely and reassure them that it's okay if they're not sure what exactly is wrong. The symptoms are somewhat vague, so I should listen carefully to every detail.\n\nANSWER: Well, Doc, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really off lately. I\u2019ve had these headaches that come and go, mostly at the back of my head, and I get a little dizzy sometimes. It\u2019s been going on for quite a few weeks, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s serious or just part of getting older."

    "output": "Well, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of tired all the time, even when I think I get enough sleep, and I don\u2019t really have much of an appetite lately. Sometimes I feel a little down or restless, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just old age or everything else happening. My days feel a bit harder to get through, you know?"

    "output": "Well, honestly, it\u2019s kinda hard to do things like I used to. Sometimes the headaches get worse when I\u2019m trying to do anything active, but I can\u2019t really tell what makes it better. The dizziness just kind of comes and goes, and I\u2019m worried I might fall or something, especially on uneven ground. I don\u2019t really know what to do about it, or if anything I do makes it better or worse."

    "output": "Well, I guess things haven't changed so much, but I do feel a bit more tired lately and I haven't been able to do things like I used to. Sometimes I get these headaches that make everything feel a little fuzzy, and it's kind of hard to focus on my usual daily stuff."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any recent head injuries or neck stiffness. My vision has been pretty much the same, I guess. As for hearing, I sometimes feel a little off or like I hear things differently, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new. I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, just the dizziness and the head trouble."

    "output": "No, I don't think so. I guess my eyes sometimes feel a little funny, but I can't really tell if it's blurry or double or anything like that. Nothing really hurts, I just feel a bit off sometimes."

    "output": "Honestly, I haven't really noticed anything particular that sets it off. Sometimes it just happens out of nowhere, and I can't think of anything specific that makes it worse or better."
