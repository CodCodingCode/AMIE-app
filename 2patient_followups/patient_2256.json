    "input": "1. A 32-year-old female presents with gradually progressive weakness and muscle wasting predominantly in her distal lower limbs, causing frequent tripping and difficulty climbing stairs over the past four years. She reports numbness and tingling sensations in her feet and hands, along with mild foot deformities such as pes cavus. Family history reveals similar symptoms in her father and paternal grandfather, suggesting an inherited neuropathy. Neurological examination shows distal muscle atrophy, reduced ankle reflexes, and decreased vibration sense in the feet. Electromyography demonstrates evidence of axonal neuropathy, with reduced compound muscle action potentials but relatively preserved conduction velocities. Genetic testing identifies a mutation in the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) gene, consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2g. The patient is advised on supportive care including physiotherapy and orthotic devices to improve mobility. She is also referred for genetic counseling given the hereditary nature of her condition.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly enough without sounding like I know too much. I should mention the main issues that made me decide to see the doctor now, focusing on how it\u2019s affecting me day to day.  \n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more and more shaky and weak in my legs, especially when I try to climb stairs or walk for a while. It\u2019s been like that for a few years, but it\u2019s gotten worse recently, and I keep tripping or feeling unsteady. My feet also feel numb sometimes, like tingling, and it\u2019s kind of embarrassing because I\u2019m afraid I might fall."

    "output": "Yeah, um, I guess it's been pretty hard to walk normally sometimes, and I keep tripping a lot more than I used to. Climbing stairs is really tough now, and I feel kind of numb sometimes, especially in my feet and hands. I haven\u2019t noticed anything about my memory or bladder control really, but I do get a weird tingling feeling and a little pain here and there. It\u2019s all kind of confusing and scary sometimes."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s like\u2026 at first, it was just a little numb sometimes, but now, I trip more often and I can\u2019t really do stairs like I used to. My feet feel weird all the time, and I guess I worry if it\u2019s going to get worse or if there\u2019s something else going on inside. Sometimes I feel a bit anxious about what it means for the future."

    "output": "Well, I think it started maybe... I don\u2019t know, a few years ago? Like, at first I just felt a little numbness and some tingling in my feet, but then it kind of spread or got worse, especially in the evenings. Now I trip more often, and climbing stairs is really hard sometimes. It\u2019s been happening slowly, so I didn\u2019t really notice it all at once."

Also, have you noticed any episodes of vision loss, double vision, or eye pain?",
    "output": "No, I haven't really noticed anything like that. I don\u2019t think I have any problems with going to the toilet or with my vision. Nothing's really changed there."

    "output": "Yes, actually, my father and grandfather had something like this too. They had similar issues with their feet and legs, and they tripped a lot. I'm not really sure what they called it, but it runs in the family."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I think my hands sometimes feel a bit funny, like they're weaker or tingly, especially when I try to do little things like buttoning my shirt or writing. It's been happening for a while, but I'm not sure if it's getting worse or if it's just in my head."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve felt a little more off-balance sometimes, like I wobble a bit more than usual, especially when I\u2019m tired. And my vision\u2026 I haven\u2019t really noticed anything sharp or different, but sometimes everything looks a little fuzzy or strange, especially at night. It\u2019s been kind of confusing for me."
