    "output": "THINKING: I'm kind of confused about this eye thing. I don't really understand what's normal or not, and I keep forgetting when it started. I just know it feels weird sometimes, and I'm worried it might be something serious. I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I also can't stop thinking about it.\nANSWER: Um, I think it started maybe last week... or maybe two weeks ago?

I haven't really seen any spots or blurriness that I remember, just that weird feeling when I look at bright lights.",
