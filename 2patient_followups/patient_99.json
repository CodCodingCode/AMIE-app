He\u2019s describing it as growing fast and bleeding, which sounds urgent to him. I need to listen carefully and reassure him while gathering information about how it looks and feels, but also be sensitive about his fear that it might be something deadly. I should also ask about how quickly it\u2019s changing and what worries him the most to understand his level of concern.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I just want to get this checked out because it\u2019s getting worse quickly. I found this bump on my arm about three weeks ago, and it\u2019s been growing fast. It started as just a little bump, but now it\u2019s about the size of a dime. It looks shiny and pink, kind of like a pearl, but sometimes it got a reddish-purple tint. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it\u2019s been breaking open and bleeding a bit now. I\u2019ve been out in the sun a lot over the years, you know, gardening and fishing, and I never thought something like this could happen. Could this be something serious? Do I need to worry?",

I want to ask, have you noticed if the area has become tender, itchy, or painful at all, or does it feel the same as when it first appeared? Also, since it started bleeding and crusting, have you seen any other symptoms like increased size, color changes, or anything else around it that might help us understand what's happening?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m nervous about answering that, because honestly, it\u2019s been kind of the same\u2014no pain or itching that I notice, but I did see it change a little with the color and how it looks, more red and shiny. I keep thinking about Uncle Joe, he had something weird on his neck too, but he didn\u2019t do anything and well, it turned out bad. I\u2019ve just been busy with my garden and, you know, trying to stay busy after my wife passed, but now this\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I should be worried about it spreading everywhere or what might happen next.\nANSWER: Well, it doesn\u2019t really hurt or bother me \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t feel pain or anything\u2014 but I did notice it got a little more red and shiny, and it\u2019s gotten bigger pretty quick. It\u2019s kind of like that stuff I saw on Uncle Joe after he passed away\u2014I keep wondering if this is something serious, you know? I just want to know what\u2019s going on with it and if I should be worried about it spreading or if it\u2019s something bad.",
