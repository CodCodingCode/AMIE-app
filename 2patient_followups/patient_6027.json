    "input": "2. A 9-year-old girl is brought to the clinic due to difficulty walking and persistent leg stiffness that has gradually worsened over the past year. Her mother notes that she sometimes drags her toes and complains of leg cramps after prolonged walking. There is a history of delayed speech development and mild intellectual disability. On examination, there is spasticity predominantly affecting the lower limbs, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski reflex bilaterally. Sensory examination is largely preserved, though proprioception is mildly impaired. MRI of the brain reveals mild hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and no significant cerebellar abnormalities. Family history is positive for affected males with early-onset spastic gait and cognitive challenges on the maternal side. Genetic analysis confirms a mutation in the L1CAM gene, consistent with X-linked complicated spastic paraplegia type 1, and multidisciplinary care is recommended.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The girl might be having more trouble walking or feels uncomfortable. Her mother probably brought her because her walking is worse or she seems more stiff. I should mention how she's been feeling and any new or ongoing issues.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019m here because I\u2019ve been having a really hard time walking lately. My legs feel all stiff and sometimes I drag my toes when I try to walk. It\u2019s been happening for quite a while, and I don\u2019t really know why."

    "output": "Um, I guess I just, like, can't walk as nicely as I used to. Sometimes my legs feel really stiff and heavy, and I worry about tripping or falling. I also get tired more easily, and my toes sometimes drag when I try to walk."

    "output": "Um, I think I walk a little funny now, like I drag my toes sometimes. It feels worse after I walk a long way, and I don\u2019t really know why it gets better or worse. Sometimes it\u2019s just hard to walk properly."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes I feel like I can't really keep my balance good, even just standing, and I sometimes feel like my legs don't move the same or get tired real quick. I might stumble more now and then, but I don\u2019t know if that's new or not."
