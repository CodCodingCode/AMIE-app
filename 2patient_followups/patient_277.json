You started feeling very drowsy and struggled to stay awake, and when you looked in the mirror, you noticed your lips and nails had a noticeable blue tint. Later that evening, you became confused about where you were and what time it was, and your heartbeat felt irregular and fast. You have a history of COPD and were recently exposed to some chemical fumes while working in your garage. You\u2019re worried because you\u2019ve never felt this way before and think you might need urgent help.",

They might also be embarrassed or unsure about how serious their conditio\nANSWER: Well, I'm a 68-year-old man, and honestly, I don't feel right. I\u2019ve been feeling kinda tired and out of breath lately, but yesterday it just got worse all of a sudden. My lips and fingertips turned kinda bluish, and I got real confused, like I didn't know where I was or what time it was. My heart also felt funny, like it was beating irregularly and fast. I\u2019ve got COPD, and I was exposed to some fumes in my garage not long ago. I thought maybe it\u2019d go away, but now I think I probably should have come sooner.",
