Just to make sure I understand completely, when you notice bleeding at night, how much blood do you usually see\u2014would you say it's just a little on the toilet paper or more than that? Have you noticed if you're waking up in the middle of the night because of bleeding or discomfort? Also, have you experienced any weight loss or fevers, chills, or feeling unusually tired that you've noticed? Understanding how severe these symptoms are helps us plan the best next steps for you.\"baseline",
