    "input": "2. A 14-year-old male assigned at birth presents with delayed onset of puberty and persistent micropenis despite normal childhood growth. He reports a lack of facial and body hair development and has mild gynecomastia on physical exam. Notably, the patient\u2019s testes are palpable in the scrotum but are small for his age. Hormonal studies demonstrate low serum testosterone, elevated androstenedione, and increased LH and FSH, suggestive of impaired testosterone biosynthesis. A history taken from his parents reveals ambiguous genitalia at birth with no early corrective surgery. Pelvic MRI confirms the presence of testes without M\u00fcllerian structures. Genetic testing reveals a homozygous mutation in the HSD17B3 gene, confirming 17-Beta Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase III deficiency. The patient is started on testosterone replacement therapy and referred to endocrinology and urology for ongoing management and pubertal induction.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain how I feel and what's been bothering me. I might be nervous or embarrassed about talking about my body and what\u2019s going on, so I need to be honest but also clear that I don\u2019t really understand everything myself. I want to make sure I tell the doctor I\u2019ve been feeling different and worried about how I look and maybe about how I\u2019m growing.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just feel kinda different from other kids, and I\u2019ve been really worried because I don\u2019t see some of the stuff I expected to see by now. Like, I don\u2019t have as much hair and stuff, and I feel kinda weird about how I look, and I just want to understand what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019m supposed to compare. I don\u2019t look like most of the other boys I see, and I sometimes feel kinda out of place, but I also don\u2019t really get what\u2019s normal or not. It\u2019s just kind of confusing."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of weird sometimes when I see other guys at school... like I don\u2019t really look or act like them, and it makes me feel out of place or different. I sometimes wonder why I\u2019m not like everyone else, and it makes me a little sad or lonely."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve really grown or not. Sometimes I think my voice might be a little deeper, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just in my head or if it\u2019s actually happening. I haven\u2019t noticed much change in muscle or anything like that."

If so, what did they find?",
    "output": "Yeah, I think they looked at my private area and said my testes were pretty small for my age, but I don\u2019t really remember exactly what else they checked. I don\u2019t have a lot of hair like in pictures I\u2019ve seen, so I guess they noticed that too."
