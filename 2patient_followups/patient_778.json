    "input": "1. A 3-year-old male child was brought to the pediatric urology clinic by his parents due to abnormal genital anatomy and difficulty with urinary stream. On examination, the penis was noted to have a ventrally displaced urethral meatus located near the perineoscrotal junction, with an associated bifid scrotum and a redundant fold of skin resembling a vaginal introitus. The child\u2019s parents reported a weak and downward deflected urine stream and occasional spraying during micturition. There was no history of urinary tract infections, but the toddler had difficulty aiming while voiding. Ultrasound evaluation of the kidneys and bladder was normal, and there were no signs of upper urinary tract dilation. The clinical presentation and physical findings were consistent with pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, a severe variant of hypospadias characterized by penoscrotal transposition and bifid scrotum. Surgical reconstruction was planned to correct the urethral meatus position and achieve normal functional and cosmetic outcomes. The multidisciplinary team discussed the timing and potential complications with the family, emphasizing follow-up for urinary function and genital cosmesis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to express that my son has been having issues with his pee and maybe how he looks, but I might not be able to explain it very well. I should mention his pee stream and that he's been having a bit of trouble aiming. I also want to show I'm worried about his health and how he\u2019s doing overall.\n\nANSWER: Hi, um, I brought my little boy today because he\u2019s been having trouble with his urination. His pee stream doesn\u2019t seem right, and sometimes it sprays or points down instead of straight. We\u2019re just really worried because he was born like this, and we want to know what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, um, sometimes he kind of sprays or tricks us when he goes, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s not aiming right, you know? And he seems to have a weak flow\u2014like it\u2019s not as strong as before, and he dribbles a bit. But he\u2019s still going, so I didn\u2019t think it was something urgent, but I just worry because it\u2019s different than what I expected."

    "output": "Umm, he\u2019s been okay, I guess? Sometimes he seems a bit fussy after going to the bathroom, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of that or something else. No fevers really, but he\u2019s had a few times where he was more tired or didn\u2019t want to eat much, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related."

    "output": "Um, he seems to be a little fussy sometimes when he\u2019s trying to pee, and he\u2019s not really good at aiming, so he ends up splashing or sometimes going outside the potty. He also seems shy or uncomfortable when he has to sit to pee, and he doesn\u2019t always finish completely. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if it\u2019s related, but I just wanted to mention it."

    "output": "Um, no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s had any special images or anything like that done, at least not that I remember. We\u2019ve just seen how it looks and how he pees, but no, no tests or anything like that. And he hasn\u2019t been diagnosed with anything else like that about his back or nerves, if that\u2019s what you mean."

    "output": "No, I don't think he's having any trouble walking or anything like that. I haven't seen any bumps or weird skin or anything on his back, but I guess I didn't check really closely."

His pee doesn\u2019t smell funny that I\u2019ve noticed, I think."
