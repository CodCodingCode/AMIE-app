I usually try to handle pain and stuff myself, so I might not give all the details the best way. Still, I need to tell the doctor what\u2019s really going on, even if it\u2019s confusing or embarrassing.\nANSWER: I\u2019ve been feeling sick for about two weeks now. It started with some stomach pain and just feeling super tired, but now I get dizzy and short of breath like all the time, especially if I stand up or walk around. I don\u2019t really keep track of how many times, but it happens a lot daily, and each time it can last a few minutes. When I feel really bad, I\u2019m usually just trying to sit or lie down, but sometimes I feel like I might pass out or throw up. My legs and belly hurt, and I keep coughing, especially at night.",
