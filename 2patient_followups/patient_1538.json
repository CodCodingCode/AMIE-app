    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy presents with a recurrent, tender swelling located just in front of his left ear, which has occasionally drained clear fluid over the past several months. His parents report intermittent episodes of mild pain and redness in that area, especially after upper respiratory infections. There is no hearing loss or fever noted. On examination, a small pit with surrounding erythema is observed near the angle of the mandible anterior to the ear. Palpation reveals a fluctuant mass deep to the skin, and gentle pressure can express serous fluid from the sinus opening. Audiologic evaluation is normal, and there are no signs of systemic infection. Imaging studies including ultrasound and MRI suggest a cystic tract extending from the skin near the external auditory canal down toward the parotid gland. These findings are consistent with a first branchial cleft anomaly, likely a type II cyst.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The child is young and probably feels worried or upset about what\u2019s been going on, but I need to keep the explanation simple and focused. I should mention the recurring swelling and discomfort, and that the parents are concerned, but avoid medical jargon.\n\nANSWER: My son, he\u2019s 7 years old, and he\u2019s been getting this bump in front of his ear a lot. It sometimes hurts and leaks a little sometimes, especially after he catches a cold or stuff. That\u2019s why we thought we should come see someone."

    "output": "Um, it's kind of there sometimes and then it goes away, but then it comes back again. It gets a little red and sore, especially when he\u2019s sick or stuffy. No fevers or making his ears feel funny that I\u2019ve noticed, but he does complain sometimes that it hurts a little. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s gotten bigger or smaller, just that it\u2019s there more often lately."

    "output": "Um, he sometimes says his ear hurts a little or feels funny, and there's been some stuff come out near his ear, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not. He\u2019s also been a bit annoyed or fussy during those times."

    "output": "Um, sometimes it's kind of puffy and feels soft, like a little bump that comes and goes. When it's bad, it gets more swollen and tender, and he seems bothered by it, like it hurts or it\u2019s uncomfortable. Sometimes he says it\u2019s sore and makes his ear feel funny, but he doesn\u2019t really know what it is."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve tried putting anything in it or probing. It kind of feels like there\u2019s a little opening, but I\u2019m not really sure, and I don\u2019t want to hurt myself or make it worse."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I think he's had some stuff like that before, but I'm not really sure if it's the same every time. Sometimes he just gets a little sniffly or coughs, but I don't know if it really makes the bump worse or anything."

    "output": "Um, yes, he did have a little cold not too long ago, and after that, the bump seemed a bit more sore or maybe bigger, but then it kind of settled down again. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really related or just a coincidence."
