    "input": "1. A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents due to a noticeable bulge on his upper back, present since birth. The swelling, located at the T2-T4 vertebral levels, occasionally leaks clear fluid and appears covered by a thin, transparent membrane. The child exhibits weakness and decreased sensation in both lower limbs, resulting in difficulty walking and frequent falls. He also has impaired bladder control with episodes of urinary incontinence. Neurological examination reveals spasticity and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, along with a positive Babinski sign. An MRI of the spine confirms a defect in the posterior elements of the upper thoracic vertebrae with herniation of meninges and spinal cord tissue consistent with spina bifida aperta. The boy was born prematurely and his mother admits she did not take folic acid supplements during pregnancy. Early neurosurgical intervention and multidisciplinary rehabilitation are planned to improve neurological outcomes and prevent infection.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The question is simple, but I want to be honest and tell the doctor what really worries us. I should mention the swelling and how he's been having trouble walking and controlling his bladder, but I might stumble over my words or get emotional because it's hard to see him like this. I want to make sure the doctor understands everything is not normal and we're scared.\n\nANSWER: Um, we brought him because of this bump on his back that\u2019s been there since he was born, and he\u2019s been having trouble walking and also keeps leaking urine sometimes. It\u2019s been worrying us because he falls a lot and seems upset about it, and we don\u2019t really know what to do now."

    "output": "Um, I think I started noticing that I was falling more and couldn't hold my pee sometimes, maybe a while ago? It just feels like everything is a bit different now, and I get tired easier. Sometimes I get scared when I can't control it or when I fall, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Well, I don\u2019t walk very well sometimes, and I fall a lot. It\u2019s hard to run or even stand for a while, and I get tired easily. My pee\u2014uh, I leak sometimes and I have to go a lot, even when I don\u2019t feel like it. It makes me feel really strange and sometimes I get worried about it all."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s been falling a lot and can\u2019t walk as good as before, I think. Sometimes he leaks pee and seems upset or frustrated when he tries to go potty. It\u2019s hard for him to do stuff by himself now, like get around or play like other kids."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I see like a little bump or a spot on my back where the rash is, and I feel sometimes kinda tingly or funny in my legs, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "It\u2019s been there since he was little, like when he was born, I think. It looks about the same size \u2014 maybe a little bigger but I\u2019m not really sure. Sometimes it leaks a bit of clear stuff, and it feels kind of soft or squishy, but I don\u2019t really touch it much. It doesn\u2019t really hurt him or anything, but he sometimes seems to get upset if it bothers him. We haven\u2019t looked at it much closely."
