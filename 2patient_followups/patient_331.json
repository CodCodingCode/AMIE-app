I should mention the change over time\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m a 62-year-old man, and I have this spot on my cheek that\u2019s been changing for a while. It started out as just a small brown mark, but over the past few months, it\u2019s gotten bigger and the shape looks different now. Sometimes, it feels a little rough or raised in the middle, and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019ve been worried because it keeps changing.",
