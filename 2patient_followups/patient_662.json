I don\u2019t remember exactly when I started feeling weird or if my eyes were involved earlier. I think I\u2019ve been having problems with my knee for a while, but I don\u2019t recall if my eyes were bad then or if it was around the same time. I also notice that sometimes my knee hurts more in the mornings and other times after I\u2019ve been walking, but I can\u2019t tell if it just gets worse all at once or gradually improves sometimes.\nANSWER: Um, I think I might have had some eye discomfort, maybe dryness, but I\u2019m not really sure if it was before or around the same time my knee started acting up. And, uh, when I have the pain, it kind of gets worse, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s sudden or if it gets better slowly\u2014mostly it just tends to stay the same or worse after I do stuff, I guess.",
