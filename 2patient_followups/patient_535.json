Is it cancer?\"\n- \"Am I going to survive this?\"\n---\n**ROLEPLAY FOCUS:**\n- Show distress and urgency.\"You've described this bleeding as very sudden and severe, but I wanted to ask\u2014have you ever noticed before, even if it was less serious, any bleeding from your rectum, or had problems like hemorrhoids or fissures that you were aware of? Sometimes these issues can come and go, and knowing about them can help us figure out what\u2019s causing this current episode.\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: He\u2019s asking about previous bleeding or issues like hemorrhoids, but honestly, I don\u2019t really remember exactly. Maybe I had some bleeding before, but it was always minor, or I just thought it was nothing. I feel like I should say yes, but I\u2019m not sure if I actually paid attention. Anyway, I\u2019m really scared that this might be something bad like cancer or a serious hole I can\u2019t see, and I keep worrying it\u2019s going to kill me if I don\u2019t get help fast enough.\nANSWER: Well, I think I might\u2019ve had some bleeding before, but maybe not this bad. I just thought it was nothing, and I didn\u2019t really pay much attention, but now I think maybe I did notice something before. I don\u2019t know if it was hemorrhoids or fissures, but it\u2019s all so scary because I\u2019ve never seen so much blood like this\u2014it\u2019s terrifying.",
