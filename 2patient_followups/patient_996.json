Also, have you noticed any sensations like tingling, burning, or itching in the area before the blisters appeared\u2014that's something some people experience as a warning sign? And have you had similar episodes before, or is this your first time happening like this?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I really don't know if the blisters are close together or spread out, and I feel like I should know, but I don\u2019t. The tingling and burning before the blisters showed up scared me, like maybe it\u2019s something serious. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, so I\u2019m worried it\u2019s herpes or something worse. I just want it to go away and feel normal again, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be permanent or really bad.\nANSWER: Um, they\u2019re kinda in clusters, I guess? Like, they\u2019re grouped together, but I also saw some that are more spread out. And yeah, I did feel a kinda weird tingling and burning sensation before, like, I knew something was coming, but I didn\u2019t know what. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, so I\u2019m just really worried it\u2019s herpes or something really awful.",
