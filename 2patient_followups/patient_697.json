To help me understand better, can you tell me how often your eye hurts\u2014does it happen all the time or just at certain times? When it does hurt, how strong is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst? Also, is the pain dull, sharp, or burning? And regarding your vision changes, do your eyes become blurry suddenly or gradually? How long does that usually last, and does anything you've tried\u2014like resting or changing your activity\u2014make it better or worse? Lastly, do you notice any other symptoms like sensitivity to light, floaters, or redness around your eyes?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Honestly, I don\u2019t really know how often my eye hurts because sometimes I get so exhausted I forget about it until it starts bugging me again, mostly at night or when I\u2019m resting. The pain is more like a dull ache, maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, but sometimes it feels kind of like a burning, like when my eyes are dry or maybe don\u2019t have enough sleep. It\u2019s weird because it doesn't happen all the time \u2014 just sorta comes and goes \u2014 and I noticed if I rest or stop working for a bit, it sometimes feels a little better, but then it just comes back. And about the vision stuff, yeah, my eyes get blurry suddenly, like out of nowhere, and it lasts maybe a minute or two, and then it\u2019s fine for a while. I think I saw some floaters too, like little black spots, but that\u2019s probably just my eyes getting tired or something, I don\u2019t know.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
