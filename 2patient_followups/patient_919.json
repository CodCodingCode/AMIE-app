I hope they can just tell me it's okay or what I should do next.\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019ve soaked through probably like two pads already today, maybe a little more, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m bleeding constantly, just a lot at once now. I feel kind of dizzy sometimes, like I might pass out, and the pain\u2019s gotten worse\u2014it's sharp suddenly, and it kind of takes my breath away. I can\u2019t sit or stand without feeling weak and shaky. I think I might still be pregnant because I took a test a couple weeks ago, but I don\u2019t really know if anything\u2019s different now.",
