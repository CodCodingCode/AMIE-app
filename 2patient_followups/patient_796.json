    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my eye flashes, but honestly, I don\u2019t really understand what she wants to know, and I feel a bit overwhelmed. I just want to answer honestly without sounding like I don\u2019t know anything but also without making it more complicated.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t really notice them happening all the time. They seem to come and go, like maybe a few seconds or so. I don\u2019t think I see spots or anything, just the flashing lights. I haven\u2019t really paid attention if they get more or less often, and I don\u2019t really know if anything makes them worse.",
