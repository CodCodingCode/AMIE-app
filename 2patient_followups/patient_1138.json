    "output": "THINKING: He\u2019s asking about my pain and how I feel now, but honestly, it\u2019s all so confusing and painful that I don\u2019t know if I can explain it well. I just feel worse today, more swollen and weak, and I keep thinking maybe something really bad is going on because I can\u2019t get my stomach to settle down. My daughter keeps telling me I shouldn\u2019t wait, and I\u2019m scared I might get sicker or need surgery, but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong or how long it will last.\nANSWER: The pain is like a sharp, really tight cramp in the middle of my belly, and it\u2019s worse than yesterday. I feel so dehydrated and weak, and I still haven\u2019t passed any gas or stool, and I just keep vomiting everything. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any new fever or dizziness, but I feel awful and worried about what\u2019s happening.",
