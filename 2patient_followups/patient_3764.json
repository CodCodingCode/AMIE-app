    "input": "1. A 15-year-old male was brought to the clinic by his parents due to concerns about delayed speech development and difficulty with learning at school. On physical examination, he exhibited pronounced folds and ridges on the scalp resembling cerebral gyri, a characteristic feature of cutis verticis gyrata. Additionally, he showed signs of mild intellectual disability and exhibited social withdrawal and impaired communication skills. His medical history revealed frequent seizures beginning at age 10 and generalized hypotonia during infancy. Neurological examination confirmed global developmental delays but no focal deficits. Genetic testing identified a mutation associated with neurocutaneous syndromes linked to cutis verticis gyrata and intellectual impairment. Brain MRI showed mild cortical atrophy but no structural malformations. The patient was referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation and supportive therapies, including speech and occupational therapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and might not fully understand the question, so I need to keep my response simple and focused on what they might be experiencing or feeling. Since they have trouble speaking and communicate poorly, I should mention any discomfort or worries in a gentle way. I also want to acknowledge their history subtly to help the doctor understand the context.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really know\u2026 I just feel kind of confused sometimes, and I get really tired easily. My parents said I should come, so I guess I just want to feel better or understand what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really remember exactly when it started, but I guess I notice it more in the afternoons or when I\u2019m trying to focus on stuff, like at school or at home.

    "output": "Um...
