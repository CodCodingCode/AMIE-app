    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking detailed questions, but I\u2019m just trying to tell exactly what I feel and what happened without overthinking. I'm nervous and confused, just want to get this over with, and I hope they understand how bad I feel. I don\u2019t really remember every little detail but trying to explain what I can.\nANSWER: Well, it\u2019s like a tearing, ripping pain, right here in my chest, and it\u2019s spreading back into my shoulders. It started suddenly and it\u2019s just been worse since. I\u2019ve been feeling weak and dizzy, and I\u2019m sweating a lot. The dizziness kinda hit me when the pain got worse, and I think my left leg feels kinda numb and weak now, like I can\u2019t move it right. I\u2019ve never felt anything like this before, not like this bad anyway.",
