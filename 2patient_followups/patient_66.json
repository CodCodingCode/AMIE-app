I should mention the dizziness, headaches, and that I think they've been getting worse, maybe over the past few months, trying to emphasize how disruptive it is. I also want to connect it to my family history just in case, and ask about serious conditions so the doctor understands my concern.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I am 45, and I am a biological female. Lately, I keep feeling really off\u2014like, my head feels under pressure all the time, and I get these dizzy spells. I think it started about three months ago, maybe, with these headaches and kind of blurred vision or spots before I feel dizzy. It\u2019s been worse lately, and sometimes I stumble or lose my balance. I\u2019m worried it might be something serious, maybe a tumor or something, especially since my mom had neurofibromatosis. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and I\u2019d like to find out if there\u2019s something I should be worried about.",
