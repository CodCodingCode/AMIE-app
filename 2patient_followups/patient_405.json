I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, and maybe I overthought it, but now it\u2019s gotten worse. I don\u2019t want to seem too worried or like I\u2019m overreacting.\nANSWER: I think, at first, there wasn\u2019t really any pain or anything, just this little bump that I barely noticed. I didn\u2019t feel sick or anything, and I didn\u2019t have any fever or chills, so I thought it would go away. It\u2019s only been a few weeks, but it\u2019s really swollen and painful now.",
