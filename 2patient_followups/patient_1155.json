Can we go over exactly how much blood you've noticed when coughing\u2014do you see just tiny streaks, or is it more than that? How often have you been coughing up blood lately?

    "output": "THINKING: I want to be honest about everything, but I also don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s serious or not. I feel scared but also a little overwhelmed trying to explain it without sounding too worried or stupid. I just want the doctor to know I\u2019m really worried and that I feel like I can\u2019t breathe properly.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve seen a little blood when I cough, just tiny streaks, but enough to scare me. It\u2019s not every time, maybe like twice in the past week. I keep coughing a lot, and I wheeze a lot too. The shortness of breath has gotten worse quickly\u2014I feel like I can\u2019t get enough air, especially when I lie down or walk around a little. I don\u2019t have a fever or anything, but I\u2019m really worn out and worried something\u2019s wrong with my lungs.",
