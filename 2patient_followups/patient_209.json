Also, have you experienced any fevers, chills, or feeling really tired or sweaty that you might not have mentioned before? I want to be sure I understand what\u2019s been happening so we can figure out the best next steps together.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about whether my swelling and pain come and go, or if they're constant, and if I have fevers or chills or feel super tired. I\u2019m not really sure, I think it\u2019s been changing but maybe not. I feel all mixed up about when I felt hot or tired, and I don\u2019t really remember if it was all at once or spread out.\nANSWER: Um, I think the swelling is kind of always there now, but maybe it was bigger at some times and smaller at others? I do feel hot sometimes, like I get really warm and sweaty but then it\u2019s gone again. I\u2019m so tired, I just want it to stop.",
