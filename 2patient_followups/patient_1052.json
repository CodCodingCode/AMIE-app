I mean, I\u2019ve always loved working in my yard and fixing things around the house, but lately, my eyes get red and teary, and sometimes I see double or things look fuzzy, especially after I\u2019ve been outside or if I\u2019ve been reading for a while. It\u2019s really annoying, and I get these terrible headaches that just won\u2019t go away.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse at certain times, but it feels like it\u2019s worse when I\u2019ve been working in the yard or if I\u2019ve been trying to read something long, like those crossword puzzles I picked up again.

Honestly, I don\u2019t really remember anything specific happening, but maybe I bumped my head or something\u2014it's all a blur 'cause I was so tired that day. I\u2019ve been so worried about my nose and face, I barely paid attention to the game at the time, but now I keep thinking maybe that could be part of it or not.\nANSWER: Well, I honestly don\u2019t remember exactly, but I might\u2019ve bumped my head a little or maybe got hit somehow\u2014I was busy fixing a leak under my sink earlier that week and it was pretty awkward to squeeze into tight spaces. Since then, I\u2019ve just noticed more pressure and pain, especially behind my eyes, and my vision\u2019s been a little fuzzy sometimes\u2014like, blurry when I look at things far away. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related, but it\u2019s been worrying me a lot.",
