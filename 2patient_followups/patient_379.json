Can you tell me more about exactly how your vision looks when it\u2019s at its worst\u2014are you able to see anything clearly at all, or is it like everything is hazy or blackout? Also, regarding your weakness, has it felt the same everywhere, or is it stronger or worse on one side? And have you noticed any new or different sensations, such as numbness or tingling, especially around your face or limbs?
