To help me understand better, can you tell me more specifically about how much blood you see during or after these episodes? For example, do you notice if it\u2019s just a few drops or more than that?

    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so she\u2019s asking about the amount of bleeding and other symptoms that might show something more serious. I guess I should try to remember exactly how much bleeding I see, but honestly, it varies\u2014sometimes it\u2019s just a little when I wipe, like a few drops, and other times I notice more, especially after I bend or move around a lot during the day. I haven\u2019t really lost weight or had fever or chills that I can think of, but I did feel unusually tired last week, like I just wanted to nap all the time, even when I hadn\u2019t done anything strenuous.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019d say the bleeding, it\u2019s not really heavy, just a few drops here and there, like when I wipe after going to the bathroom. But sometimes it\u2019s more, especially if I\u2019ve been moving around a lot or like after sex\u2014it\u2019s more than just a little. And I haven\u2019t noticed anything like fever or losing weight, but I do feel more tired lately, even when I didn\u2019t do much that day, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of achy in my lower belly sometimes.",
