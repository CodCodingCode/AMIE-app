    "input": "2. A 17-year-old girl visits the gynecology clinic complaining of absent menstrual periods and recurrent lower abdominal discomfort. She mentions having noticed minimal breast development and no pubic hair growth by age 16. Her medical history is unremarkable, with no chronic illness or medication use. On examination, Tanner stage 2 breast and pubic hair development are noted, along with a small vaginal introitus. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals a markedly small uterine size with thin endometrial lining. Blood tests show normal ovarian hormone levels, including estradiol, FSH, and LH. MRI pelvis confirms a hypoplastic uterus with no structural abnormalities of the ovaries or vagina. Based on clinical, hormonal, and imaging findings, a diagnosis of uterine hypoplasia is made, and counseling about fertility implications is initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know the reason for my visit, so I should explain my symptoms honestly but without too much detail. I might feel a little embarrassed or unsure about how to say it, especially since it\u2019s personal. I need to mention my periods aren\u2019t happening and that I\u2019ve been experiencing some abdominal discomfort, but I might not fully understand what it all means.  \nANSWER: Um, I guess I just don\u2019t get my period, and I\u2019ve been having this weird kind of pain in my lower belly a lot. I\u2019m kind of worried, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong."
