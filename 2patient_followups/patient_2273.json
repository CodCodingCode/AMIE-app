    "input": "2. A 12-year-old girl is brought to the neuromuscular clinic due to progressive difficulty in running and frequent falls over the last two years. Her developmental history was unremarkable until early childhood, but parents recently noticed delayed speech and mild intellectual disability. Physical examination reveals proximal muscle weakness, mild facial weakness, and elongated lower limbs with calf pseudohypertrophy. She has spinal rigidity and limited ankle dorsiflexion causing a high-stepping gait. Laboratory tests show elevated serum creatine kinase around 5 times the upper limit of normal. Brain MRI demonstrates mild cortical dysplasia and cerebellar involvement, while muscle biopsy reveals reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Genetic analysis confirms compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the FKRP gene. Multidisciplinary management focusing on physical rehabilitation, speech therapy, and surveillance for cardiopulmonary complications is underway.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should explain my main concerns honestly but simply. I might feel nervous or unsure about what to say, but I need to tell them what\u2019s been bothering me the most. I should mention my difficulty with moving and falling, since that\u2019s what I notice most and what probably worries my parents.\n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve been having a hard time running and I fall a lot more than before. It\u2019s been getting worse over the past couple of years, and I just don\u2019t feel as strong as I used to. Sometimes my legs feel really tired and weird, and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Umm, I guess I just get tired more easily, especially when I try to run or play with my friends. Sometimes my legs feel kinda stiff, and I worry about falling, so I don't do as much. It seems worse when I haven't moved around much or if I try to do a lot at once."

    "output": "Um, I think I\u2019ve been falling more often lately and I have trouble keeping my balance sometimes. My legs feel weird, like they get tired or tingly, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same as before or something new."

    "output": "Um, I guess I just feel really tired sometimes, and I have a hard time running or playing like I used to. There are times when my legs feel weird, and I get more tired if I try to do too much at once. Some days I can do stuff okay, but other days everything feels heavier or harder to move."

    "output": "Um, my eyes sometimes feel kind of weird, like sensitive to bright lights or maybe a little sore. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost my sight suddenly, but when I move my eyes or look around, it kinda hurts a little."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my eyes feel kind of funny? Like, if I look really far to the side or up, it feels a little weird, but I don't know if that's normal or not. And maybe my eyelids get a bit heavy or heavy-looking sometimes, but it's hard to say."

    "output": "Um, sometimes my eyelids feel like they\u2019re kinda heavy or tired, especially when I\u2019ve been trying to read or look at stuff for a while. And yeah, I guess when I rest for a bit, it feels a little better."
