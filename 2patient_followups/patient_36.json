    "input": "1. A 16-year-old phenotypically female patient presented to the adolescent endocrinology clinic with primary amenorrhea and lack of breast development. She was assigned female at birth but reported minimal growth spurt during puberty and absence of menstruation. Physical examination revealed Tanner stage I breast development, sparse pubic hair, and normal external female genitalia without virilization. Pelvic ultrasound showed absence of uterus and ovaries, and the gonads appeared undescended and dysplastic in the inguinal region. Hormonal studies revealed elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels with low estradiol, consistent with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Karyotyping confirmed a 46,XY chromosomal pattern despite female phenotype. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic mutation in the gene associated with 46,XY sex reversal 8. Multidisciplinary management included gonadectomy to prevent malignancy, hormone replacement therapy, and psychological support for gender identity concerns.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain I\u2019m feeling confused and a little worried about my body and what\u2019s been happening. I want to honestly share how I feel without getting into too many details I don\u2019t fully understand myself.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 16, and I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really strange lately. Like, my body isn\u2019t doing what I expected, and I haven\u2019t started my periods or grown much, and it\u2019s been kinda confusing and upsetting."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling pretty weird, like... I don\u2019t know, kind of out of place with my body? Sometimes I feel maybe a little strange or different from other girls, and I get kind of worried about how I look or if something's wrong with me. It\u2019s hard to explain exactly."

    "output": "Um, my pubic hair is like, almost nothing, really sparse. My breasts are still flat, like they never really started to develop, and I haven't had any other signs of puberty, like growing taller or anything. I kind of feel like I missed that part completely."

    "output": "Um, I think they did some blood tests, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones. I know they told me my chromosomes are usually different or something, but I don\u2019t remember the exact details."

    "output": "Um, I think they did some of those tests, but I don\u2019t remember all the numbers or what exactly they showed. I know they said my hormones were kinda off, but I don\u2019t really understand what that means. About the chromosomes, I think a doctor told me it was a certain kind of test, and I guess my results were different from usual? But honestly, I didn\u2019t really follow all of that."

I\u2019m just worried and sometimes scared to talk about it all, but I guess I want to figure it out with someone who can help me sort through what\u2019s best for me."
