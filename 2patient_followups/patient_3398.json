    "input": "1. A 12-year-old male presents with progressive difficulty in walking and frequent tripping over the past two years. He has noticeable muscle weakness and atrophy in his lower legs, with a high-stepping gait and foot drop on examination. His parents report he has been hoarse and occasionally chokes while swallowing since early childhood. Neurological assessment reveals diminished deep tendon reflexes and reduced pinprick and vibration sensation in the distal limbs. Electromyography demonstrates predominantly axonal neuropathy. Family history is negative for neuropathy, and genetic testing confirms autosomal recessive mutations associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal type, with vocal cord paresis. Laryngoscopy shows bilateral vocal cord paresis contributing to dysphonia. Supportive care with physical therapy and speech therapy is initiated to address functional impairments.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and might feel a bit scared or confused about what's happening. They might mention difficulty walking or feeling different in their legs, maybe worried or unsure about what it means. Keep the response simple and based on what they've experienced directly.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been having a really hard time walking lately. I trip all the time and feel like my legs are really weak, even though I didn\u2019t want them to be. Also, I\u2019ve had like, a hoarse voice and sometimes I choke when I try to swallow, and I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been like this for maybe two years? It\u2019s kinda gotten a little worse, I guess. Sometimes I trip more than before, and I feel weaker in my feet, but I don\u2019t really remember when it first started exactly."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes I trip more in the mornings, I think? And I guess I get tired faster, and I feel kind of off when I try to run or do stuff I used to do easily. It\u2019s just\u2026 weird, and I don\u2019t always get why it changes so much."
