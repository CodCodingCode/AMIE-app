    "input": "1. A 28-year-old male presents with a gradual onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy predominantly affecting his lower legs, leading to frequent tripping and difficulty running over the past five years. He reports numbness and a burning sensation in his feet that have progressively worsened, impairing his balance and proprioception. Neurological examination reveals decreased vibration and pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution, along with diminished deep tendon reflexes at the ankles. Muscle strength testing shows moderate weakness in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, accompanied by pes cavus deformities bilaterally. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with similar gait difficulties, suggesting a possible inherited neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate reduced amplitude of motor and sensory responses without significant slowing, consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the DNAJB2 gene, consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, axonal type 2u. The patient is initiated on a multidisciplinary management plan including physiotherapy, orthotic support, and symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling worried or unsure about their symptoms and what the doctor will say. They might be unsure how to explain it or feel embarrassed about the way it\u2019s affecting their body. They should be honest and describe what\u2019s been happening, even if it sounds confusing or strange.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi... I\u2019m 28, and I\u2019ve been having these weird feelings in my feet and legs for a while now. It\u2019s like, numb and kinda burning, and I trip more than I used to. It\u2019s been getting worse, so I thought I should come and see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, um, things have kinda gotten worse slowly. I trip more often now and my feet feel really weird, like burning and numb, especially at night. Sometimes I feel clumsy or off balance, and I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with going to the bathroom or anything like that, but I guess I\u2019m worried about what all this means for the future."

    "output": "Um, I guess it kind of changes? Sometimes, when I\u2019ve been walking or standing a lot, it feels worse, like my feet are burning more and I trip more easily. But then other times, if I rest for a while, it feels a little better. It\u2019s confusing because it doesn\u2019t seem to follow anything specific, and I don\u2019t really notice a pattern."

    "output": "Umm, it\u2019s kind of hard to say exactly, but mostly, I notice it\u2019s been getting worse over the years. Like, I trip more often now, especially when I\u2019m running or walking for a while. Sometimes, in the mornings, my feet feel worse, and then it kind of eases up a little as I move around. Nothing really makes it better or worse on purpose, but I guess if I stay still too long, they\u2019re sort of numb or tingly, and when I try to walk, it feels weird or unsteady."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I think my legs feel pretty weak sometimes, and I kind of stumble more than I used to. I don\u2019t really know about my reflexes, I haven\u2019t checked \u2018em myself, but I guess maybe they\u2019re not as good as before? I haven\u2019t had any fevers or gotten sick lately, and I haven\u2019t traveled anywhere or seen any ticks or anything strange."
