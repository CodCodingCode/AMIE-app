I didn\u2019t think it was this bad till I couldn't sleep and I felt like I was drowning in my own chest.

I was doing my chores, braving the weather like I always do\u2014worked all day in the water and soil\u2014and then I just started coughing more and more. The fever hit me sometime at night, and I got these terrible chills, couldn\u2019t stop shivering.

How serious is this?\"\n- \"Should I have come sooner?\"\"Given what you've described about how the symptoms have changed over the past few days, can you tell me more about how you were feeling during the first couple of days \u2014 for example, did you notice any mild cough, slight sore throat, or feeling a bit more tired than usual? Sometimes these early signs can seem small, but I want to understand all the details to help us get the full picture.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know about the early days, but honestly, I hardly remember that part because I was so busy trying to work and fix things around the farm. I think I just felt a little tired or worn out at first, maybe from all the heat lately. It\u2019s hard to say if I noticed anything really specific because I was distracted with a bunch of stuff, like fixing the tractor and dealing with some family issues I wasn\u2019t even sure about at the time.\nANSWER: Well, to be honest, I don\u2019t really remember exactly. I think I just felt kinda tired and maybe like I had a little bit of a sore throat or something, but it wasn\u2019t really bad at first. I was more worried about the crops and my wife\u2019s garden, so I didn\u2019t pay much attention until I started coughing more and the fever got worse.",
