    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and scared by the pain and the worsening vision. I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening, but I want to explain how bad it feels and see if the doctor knows what it might be. I might be a little nervous and worried about what this means for my eyes and my life.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t know if moving my eye makes it worse, but it\u2019s really hard to look around because the pain is sharp and intense all the time. I do notice some dark spots, like little floaters, and sometimes I see flashes of light. It\u2019s like I\u2019m losing parts of my vision on that side. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, and honestly, I\u2019m really scared it could be serious or that I might go blind.",
