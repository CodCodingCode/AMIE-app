Can you tell me if you notice any particular size or shape of the bulge\u2014like, does it seem to go back inside when you lie down or when you gently push on it? Also, when you see or feel the protrusion during standing or activity, what does it feel like\u2014tight, soft, or something else? Regarding your leakage, how much urine do you typically lose\u2014would you say just a few drops, or more than that? Do you feel any sensation, like sudden urgency, right before you leak, or is it more of a stress leak? And finally, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or any discomfort during sexual activity that might be related?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I guess I need to explain better, but I get all mixed up sometimes because I\u2019ve been so worried. I feel kind of ashamed talking about this stuff, but I really can't ignore it anymore. I wonder if it\u2019s serious or if I just have to live with it, I don\u2019t know.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019ve just felt worse over the last few months. It started with a little heaviness, but now I feel like everything is coming out down there, like I can see or feel something when I go to the bathroom or sometimes when I stand up, and it\u2019s not comfortable, you know? And I keep losing control of my urine\u2014sometimes I just can\u2019t hold it, even when I don\u2019t think I have to go, and usually I wear pads because of all the leaks. It\u2019s gotten worse recently\u2014I feel like I need to push or strain to urinate, and it doesn\u2019t all come out. During intimacy, it\u2019s very painful now, and I\u2019m just worried about what\u2019s happening to me.",
