    "input": "2. A 29-year-old female emergency nurse presents with a two-year history of recurrent brief episodes of imbalance and vertigo lasting 10 to 20 minutes. These attacks often occur during stressful shifts or after sudden movements of the head, accompanied by nausea and mild double vision. She describes episodes of difficulty coordinating her hand movements, making routine tasks like writing challenging during attacks. There is no history of seizures or loss of consciousness, and neurological examination between episodes shows no abnormalities. Her paternal uncle reportedly had similar spells of dizziness and coordination problems in his youth. Brain MRI is unremarkable, but video-electronystagmography performed during an episode reveals downbeat nystagmus and impaired smooth pursuit. Genetic analysis uncovers a pathogenic variant in the FGF14 gene, confirming Episodic Ataxia, Type 6. Initiation of acetazolamide therapy results in a significant decrease in attack frequency and improved quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should express that I've been having these weird episodes and they're really bothering me, especially at work. I want to explain how often it happens and how it feels without sounding too technical or like I\u2019m overreacting. I also need to mention that I\u2019ve noticed some relief with the medication, but I\u2019m still concerned about what\u2019s going on.  \nANSWER: Uh, well, I guess I\u2019ve been having these episodes for about two years now. I keep feeling this weird dizziness and sometimes I get all off balance, and it\u2019s really hard to focus or do things like write. It happens mostly when I\u2019m stressed or move my head suddenly, and it kind of scares me because I don\u2019t know why it keeps happening."

    "output": "Um, they usually last like, 10 or 15 minutes maybe? Sometimes I feel like a weird sensation or kind of dizzy before it actually happens, but not always. Things like resting or sitting down seem to help, but sometimes stress or quick head turns seem to make it worse."

For example, have they become more frequent, severe, or are you noticing any new symptoms like hearing changes, headaches, weakness, or visual difficulties?",
    "output": "Um, I think they\u2019ve kind of stayed about the same most of the time, but sometimes they do feel a little stronger? Like, I can\u2019t really write or do stuff properly during an attack more often than before, I guess. And I don\u2019t really remember anything new like hearing or headaches or anything, just the dizzy spells and that funny feeling in my head."

    "output": "Well, um, I guess my work has been pretty hectic lately\u2014lots of long shifts, and I think I\u2019ve been more stressed out. My sleep\u2019s been kind of patchy, sometimes I can\u2019t fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night. I haven\u2019t taken any new medicines or anything, but I\u2019ve noticed that when I\u2019m really tired or stressed, the spells seem worse or happen more often."

Do you notice any weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or visual changes (such as blurred vision or visual field deficits) during or after these episodes?  \n2. Have you experienced any episodes of double vision, ringing in the ears, or hearing disturbances?  \n3. Do you have any risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, or a history of cardiovascular disease?  \n4. Are there any other unassociated seizure-like events, such as involuntary movements, loss of awareness, or confusional states?  \n5. Have you ever undergone imaging studies of your brain or vascular imaging? If so, what were the results?",
    "output": "Uh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed weakness or numbness or trouble talking or seeing anything weird like blurred vision, but sometimes I do feel a bit out of sorts during the episodes, like I can\u2019t quite focus or coordinate properly. I haven't really had ringing or hearing issues, and I don\u2019t have any of those stroke risk factors that I know of \u2014 I don\u2019t smoke, and I try to eat healthy, but I do work a lot and stress a lot sometimes. I haven\u2019t had any seizures or anything that felt like a losing consciousness or confusion beyond the imbalance stuff. As for scans, I think I had a brain MRI done before, but I\u2019m not really sure what it showed, just that it was okay."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s usually when I move my head quickly or tilt it in certain ways, like looking up or to the side suddenly. Sometimes during those times, I get really dizzy and everything feels a bit off, and then the episodes last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but sometimes it\u2019s even shorter. I don\u2019t always know exactly what I was doing before it started, though."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes I notice it more if I move my head a certain way, like looking up or to the side. It kind of happens right when I change position usually, but not always. I haven't really tried any special maneuvers or treatments myself, just... hoping it would just stop or be okay."
