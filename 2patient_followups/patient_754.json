    "input": "1. A 12-year-old male presents with progressive vision loss over the last three years and difficulty maintaining balance. His mother reports that he has struggled with night blindness since early childhood and recently noticed weight gain despite a restricted diet. On examination, he has central obesity, postaxial polydactyly on both hands, and mild developmental delay. Fundoscopic exam reveals pigmentary retinopathy consistent with retinitis pigmentosa. Renal ultrasound shows structural abnormalities with mild cystic changes. Hearing is normal, but he demonstrates decreased proprioception. Laboratory tests reveal elevated fasting glucose and dyslipidemia. Family history is significant for consanguinity but no known genetic disorders, and genetic testing confirms a mutation in the BBS3 gene.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know why I came today. I need to explain my main issues, but I feel nervous about how to say it right. I should mention my vision and maybe some other problems I've been having without sounding too worried or confusing.  \nANSWER: Um, well... I guess I\u2019ve been having a hard time seeing stuff clearly, especially in the dark. And I\u2019ve felt kind of unsteady or off-balance sometimes, like I might fall. Also, I\u2019ve noticed myself gaining weight even though I don\u2019t really eat more than usual, and I feel kind of tired or just different overall."

    "output": "Um, my vision, it\u2019s been worse over a few years, and I have a hard time seeing things at night now. It\u2019s kind of made me feel more dizzy sometimes and I don\u2019t really like it, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the only thing."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, it's been pretty hard sometimes. I get really tired a lot, and I don\u2019t see as well as I used to, especially at night. Sometimes I feel kinda down or like I don\u2019t have much energy, and I don\u2019t really know why."

Also, have you experienced any problems with balance, coordination, or other neurological symptoms like weakness or numbness?",
    "output": "Yeah, I do feel really thirsty all the time, and I pee more than I used to, but I haven't really noticed if my vision gets blurry or anything like that. As for balance, I do feel kind of unsteady sometimes, like I can\u2019t keep my balance like I should, and my feet feel weird sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my legs feel a little funny, like they're not really firm or something, and I\u2019ve fallen a few times when I wasn\u2019t really expecting it. Dizziness happens sometimes, especially if I stand up quickly, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s a big deal. My hearing feels the same, I think, but I don\u2019t know if something\u2019s new with my balance; it\u2019s just been kind of hard to tell."
