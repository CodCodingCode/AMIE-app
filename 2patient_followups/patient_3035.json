    "input": "2. A 34-year-old man presents with a 9-month history of sudden-onset episodes of imbalance and vertigo lasting 10 to 20 minutes, occurring several times weekly. He describes difficulty coordinating his movements during these attacks, often accompanied by transient double vision and mild slurred speech. The episodes frequently arise during or immediately after physical exertion and sometimes after caffeine intake. Between episodes, he remains asymptomatic with no persistent neurological deficits. His mother had episodes of dizziness and clumsiness in her youth, but no formal diagnosis was made. Neurological examination between attacks is normal, showing intact coordination and gait. Brain MRI and routine lab work are unremarkable, and video nystagmography shows no vestibular pathology. Genetic analysis reveals a pathogenic mutation in the FGF14 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Episodic Ataxia, Type 4.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain that I\u2019ve been having these episodes for quite a while, and they\u2019re really bothering me. I feel a little embarrassed and worried, but I want to tell the doctor what\u2019s been happening so maybe they can help me understand.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 34-year-old man, and I\u2019ve been having these sudden spells where I feel off balance and like everything\u2019s spinning, and it\u2019s been going on for about nine months. During these times, I can\u2019t really coordinate well, and I sometimes see double or slur my words a bit. It mostly happens when I do something active or even after I have caffeine, and it\u2019s pretty unsettling."

    "output": "Well, um, they do make daily things harder sometimes\u2014I get really dizzy and out of balance, and it\u2019s hard to focus. I guess I worry a lot about when it\u2019s going to happen next, especially if I\u2019m doing something active or if I\u2019ve had coffee. It kind of interrupts my day, and I get scared maybe it\u2019s going to get worse."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes I just suddenly feel like everything's wobbly or I can't keep my balance, and my vision gets kinda blurry for a little bit. It usually lasts maybe 10 or 15 minutes, I think. I\u2019ve noticed it happens more when I\u2019m moving around a lot or after I have coffee or do something active, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s the only thing that makes it happen. It\u2019s confusing because I don\u2019t always feel the same, and I don\u2019t know what sets it off exactly."

    "output": "Honestly, I just try to sit down and wait when it happens, but it\u2019s really scary not knowing what\u2019s causing it. I keep wondering if it\u2019s something serious or if I\u2019ll be able to do normal stuff without these episodes bothering me."

Also, do your episodes happen specifically with certain head movements, or do they occur regardless of position? Lastly, do you have any personal or family history of heart problems, hypertension, or stroke?",
    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been told I have migraines, but sometimes I get this weird kind of throbbing or pressure thing and bright lights or loud sounds kinda bother me. My episodes happen pretty much anytime, not really related to how I move my head or anything, just out of the blue mostly. And yes, my mom had some dizziness and clumsiness when she was younger, but nobody really said what it was. I don\u2019t know about heart or stroke problems in my family, though."

Genetic analysis reveals a pathogenic mutation in the FGF14 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Episodic Ataxia, Type 4.1. Vestibular Migraine (Migraine-Associated Vestibulopathy) \u2013 Because of episodic vertigo coupled with migraine features such as throbbing sensation, sensitivity to light and sound, and family history, this remains a strong candidate.  \n2. Paroxysmal Vestibular Neuritis or Vestibular Paroxysmia \u2013 Due to the brief, recurrent episodes potentially linked to nerve or vascular compression, especially with triggers such as activity.  \n3. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) \u2013 Possible if episodes are triggered by head position, although not explicitly stated; the short duration aligns with BPPV episodes.  \n4. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) involving posterior circulation \u2013 Because of the transient nature of symptoms affecting balance, vision, and speech, raising concern for ischemic etiology, though less likely given the absence of risk factors.  \n5. Focal Seizures involving vestibular and visual centers \u2013 Considering the combination of sensory, visual, and speech symptoms, seizures remain a differential especially if episodes have a stereotyped pattern and no clear associated movement or postictal features.",
    "output": "Wow, there\u2019s so many different ideas... I don\u2019t really understand them all, but I do get these dizzy spells that come and go so suddenly, and sometimes my head feels all weird or fuzzy during those times. It\u2019s kind of scary because I never know when it will happen or how long it will last."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes if I move my head a certain way, like turning quickly or tilting it, it feels a bit worse or I get more dizzy, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always that way or if I notice it every time."
