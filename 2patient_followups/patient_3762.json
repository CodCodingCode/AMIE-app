    "input": "1. A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of intermittent headaches that she describes as severe, feeling \"pressure-like,\" and predominantly frontal. She notes occasional episodes of nausea and mild blurred vision but denies any history of trauma or recent illness. Over the past 3 days, she reports transient episodes of confusion and difficulty maintaining balance. On neurological examination, she is alert but displays mild papilledema and subtle ataxia. Her past medical history is unremarkable, and she has no known chronic conditions or medication use. A brain MRI reveals a well-circumscribed, hyperdense lesion within the anterior third ventricle causing obstruction of the foramen of Monro with resulting ventriculomegaly. The findings are consistent with a colloid cyst of the third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Neurosurgical consultation is sought urgently to evaluate for cyst resection and CSF diversion as needed.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: Since the patient seems anxious and unsure, I should be gentle and allow her to express her concerns without rushing her. She might be scared about her symptoms and not fully understanding them, so I should encourage her to share what she's feeling.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 35, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been having these really bad headaches for about two weeks now, and they come and go. Sometimes I feel a bit sick and a little bit blurry in my eyes, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling off and unsteady, like I\u2019m not quite myself. It's been kind of scary, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, well, the headaches just sort of come and go, sometimes suddenly, sometimes they build up slowly. It's like a really tight pressure in my forehead, and it doesn\u2019t really get better with anything I try. I only notice it with the other things I feel\u2014like feeling kind of sick and seeing blurry sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s connected."

    "output": "Uh, well, the headaches come and go, kind of random, I guess. Sometimes they feel worse in the mornings, but other times, it\u2019s just a dull pressure all day. I don\u2019t really know what makes them better or worse, honestly. I just want it to stop."

    "output": "Um, I guess yeah, I do see flashing and shapes sometimes before my head really starts hurting. But I don\u2019t always notice if they get worse or happen more often. It\u2019s kind of random to me."
