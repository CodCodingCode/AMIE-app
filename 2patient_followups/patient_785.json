    "input": "2. A 17-year-old female-identifying individual assigned male at birth presents with primary amenorrhea and progressive distal limb weakness over the past year. They report persistent burning sensations in their feet and difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as buttoning shirts. Physical examination reveals tall stature with a eunuchoid body habitus, small, firm testes palpated in the inguinal canals, and scant, sparse pubic hair. Neurological evaluation notes decreased proprioception and mild distal muscle wasting in the lower extremities. Laboratory tests show elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels with low serum testosterone. Chromosomal analysis confirms a 46,XY karyotype, consistent with partial gonadal dysgenesis. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, and sural nerve biopsy reveals characteristic minifascicular neuropathic changes. Family history is negative for hereditary neuropathies or disorders of sexual development.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain what\u2019s been bothering me without sounding too technical or like I know what might be wrong. I\u2019m feeling pretty worried but also a bit embarrassed about talking about these things. I need to be honest about the symptoms I\u2019ve been noticing.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really tired and kind of weird, like my legs and arms have been getting weaker, especially in my feet. I\u2019ve also noticed I don\u2019t get my period at all, and I\u2019ve been having this burning feelings in my feet that won\u2019t go away."

    "output": "Um, it's kind of confusing. Sometimes, my feet burn like they're really hot or numb, and I feel weak, especially in my hands and legs, so I have a hard time doing things like tying my shoes or writing. Nothing really helps much, but if I rest or sit still, it feels a little better, I guess. It's been making my days pretty frustrating."

    "output": "Um, it was kind of gradual, I guess? Like, the tingling and stuff in my feet got worse over the past year, and I noticed I was having a harder time buttoning shirts and doing small things. Sometimes it feels worse when I try to do more active things, I think."

    "output": "Um, I don't really get hot flashes or anything like that... I think I used to have like, irregular things happen before I stopped getting my periods, but I don't really remember exactly, and I haven't noticed anything weird with my thyroid or anything."
