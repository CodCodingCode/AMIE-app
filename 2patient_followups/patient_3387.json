    "input": "2. A 12-year-old male is brought to the neurology clinic due to worsening gait instability and frequent stumbling over the past year. His parents note that he has had delayed motor milestones and problems with fine motor tasks such as buttoning clothes since early childhood. Neurological examination reveals truncal and limb ataxia, dysmetria, and a broad-based gait. He exhibits dysarthria and mild horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze. Muscle strength is preserved, but deep tendon reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Brain MRI demonstrates marked cerebellar atrophy, predominantly in the vermis, with no significant spinal cord abnormalities. There is no consanguinity in the family, and no other relatives have similar symptoms. Genetic analysis identifies biallelic pathogenic variants consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Autosomal Recessive 25, guiding a multidisciplinary approach including occupational therapy and regular neurological follow-up.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 12-year-old boy, so I should remember to keep my answer simple but honest, expressing some concern about his worsening symptoms and past difficulties. I want to mention that I\u2019ve been feeling unsteady and that it\u2019s been a while since these problems started, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting or trying to pretend I know what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s important I keep it real and share what I\u2019ve been experiencing without trying to explain too much.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019ve been feeling kind of unsteady on my feet and I keep stumbling a lot, especially when I walk. It\u2019s been happening for over a year, and I guess I\u2019ve always had some trouble with small movements and stuff since I was little. I just wanted to see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I don't think I've had any problems remembering stuff or thinking different. My pee or how I move my eyes hasn't really changed that I can tell."

    "output": "Umm, I guess I stumble a lot more now and it\u2019s hard to walk straight, especially if I\u2019m in a hurry or on uneven ground. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m clumsy or messing things up more than before, and I get worried I might fall or hurt myself. It\u2019s kind of frustrating because I can\u2019t do things like I used to."

I don\u2019t know if anything else is different, but I just feel more tired when I stand for a while."

Also, have you observed any facial masking, decreased arm swing, or other subtle movements that might not have been obvious initially?",
    "output": "Um, well, I guess I kinda stumble a lot when I walk, like I don\u2019t lift my feet enough sometimes, and I don\u2019t feel like I shuffle or anything, but maybe I do get a little stiff in my legs? About my face, I think I might look a bit blank or serious sometimes, like I don\u2019t really move my face much... but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really notice much change when I move or rest. Sometimes I feel worse when I\u2019ve been walking a lot, but then other times I just feel kind of stiff and unsteady all the time, especially lately."
