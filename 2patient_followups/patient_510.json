I also saw a scaly patch of skin over it, and I found a small sore on my neck that doesn\u2019t heal.\"\n- **SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n\"I used to spend a lot of time outside\"Based on what you've told me so far, I\u2019d like to understand better how the lesion has changed over time\u2014can you tell me, in your own words, when you first noticed this lump and how it has behaved since then? For example, has it slowly been getting bigger over months, or did it seem to suddenly grow or change in size or appearance more recently? Also, have you noticed any new symptoms like increased pain, weakness, or any other changes besides the sore and the skin over it?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm a bit unsure about the timeline myself, and I don't quite remember exactly when I first saw it or how it changed over time. I think I noticed it a few weeks ago, but maybe I saw it longer ago and just didn't pay much attention. Now it\u2019s bigger, and I keep thinking maybe it suddenly got worse, but I can't be sure if it was all at once or gradual. I also forgot to mention if anything else is happening besides the sore and the bump. I probably should tell him everything, but I feel a little overwhelmed.\nANSWER: Well, I think I first saw it maybe around six weeks ago, but maybe longer, and it kinda slowly got bigger, or I just noticed it more recently. It\u2019s hard to say exactly. Nothing really changed suddenly, I don\u2019t think, but it keeps getting a little more noticeable, I guess, and I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more tired too, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related.",
