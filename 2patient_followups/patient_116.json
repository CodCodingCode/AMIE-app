She probably feels a bit scared but is trying to be honest about her concerns and her physical feelings.

It\u2019s just this constant ache, but sometimes it really aches more, like sharper. Recently, I noticed this lump near my shoulder \u2014 it\u2019s tender and feels kind of firm when I touch it. And, um, I woke up one morning and couldn\u2019t really move my arm properly, so I think I might have broken something.

That lump only showed up, oh, I\u2019d say about a month ago, and it\u2019s right near my shoulder, kind of under the skin, but it\u2019s firm and tender when I press on it. I first noticed it when I was sitting in my garden, weeding, and suddenly it was there, and I kind of brushed against it or something. Last week, I woke up one morning and the arm just wouldn\u2019t move right, like it was stuck or something, and I was worried I had broken a bone because I felt this terrible ache and the swelling was worse by then. Now I just feel so tired all the time, even after a good night\u2019s sleep, and I keep thinking if it\u2019s something serious, like cancer or whatever, I want to know what to do.",

I might mention how I\u2019ve been feeling more tired than usual and how my family noticed I\u2019m more nervous lately.\nANSWER: Well, lately, I haven't really felt like myself. I mean, I\u2019ve been more tired than usual, even after sleeping a lot, and my daughter keeps telling me I look paler, which makes me worry. Sometimes I start talking about my garden or my volunteer work or how my knee has been bothering me since last winter\u2014it's just, everything seems a bit off.

Can you tell me exactly how bad the pain is when you move or open your eye\u2014would you describe it as mild, moderate, or severe? Also, have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurred or double vision? And besides the redness and swelling, have you experienced any fever, a feeling of warmth around the eye, or any other systemic symptoms? This will help me get a clearer picture of what's going on.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I need to tell him what's been going on, but I keep thinking about how this pain is really persistent and how I haven't had anything like this before. I'm also worried because my mom had cancer, and I keep wondering if it's something serious, but I don\u2019t really understand all the medical stuff. Maybe if I tell him everything, he can help me figure out if I should be worried, or if it\u2019s just something I can fix easily.\nANSWER: Well, like I said, the pain in my arm just kind of hangs around \u2014 it's there pretty much all the time, and sometimes it feels sharper, like a needle poke. There\u2019s this lump near my shoulder too, and it\u2019s tender when I touch it, which is kind of odd because I don\u2019t remember hitting anything. The other morning I woke up and I just couldn\u2019t move my arm properly, almost felt like it was broken or something. It\u2019s been really tiring, even after I sleep\u2014or I try to sleep, but my mind keeps worrying that it could be something serious, like cancer or\u2026 I don\u2019t know, spreading or something. Do you think I need to get scans or do tests, and what are my chances it\u2019s something really bad?",
