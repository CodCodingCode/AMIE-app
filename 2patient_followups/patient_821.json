These details will help me understand how extensive the lesion might be.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little overwhelmed trying to describe how big the sore is, and I worry about whether I'm saying the right things. I'm honestly scared it has gotten worse and maybe spread or gone deeper, but I don't really understand all the medical details they want. I just want the doctor to understand how serious it feels to me.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m not exactly sure how big it is, but it feels pretty large now, maybe a few centimeters, like I\u2019d say about the size of a little coin, I guess. It\u2019s definitely gotten deeper because I can feel kind of a thick, firm part underneath, and it sort of feels like it\u2019s spreading out a little more, not just in one spot. It\u2019s been changing so fast, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s spreading or if that\u2019s just how it feels, but it\u2019s definitely not just a tiny sore anymore.",
