I\u2019d like to understand more about your nights\u2014do you ever notice if you have accidents while sleeping? Also, when you go to the bathroom during the day, do you feel like you're fully emptying your bladder afterward? Sometimes people notice sensations or tell-tale signs before an accident\u2014have you ever experienced any feeling or urge just before an episode, either daytime or at night? And regarding your bowel movements, do you feel like your bowel is emptying completely, or do you ever notice any issues with that?\"  CURRENT CLINICAL PICTURE: Vignette: The patient is a male with a three-month history of recurrent daytime urinary incontinence without warning. He reports accidents that he minimizes as \"sometimes\" and describes emotional distress. He is uncertain about nocturnal incontinence and incomplete bladder emptying, with hesitance to discuss bowel control, indicating potential underreporting. Additional details about night symptoms and sensations are necessary to delimit the possible diagnoses, including neurogenic bladder, detrusor underactivity, or functional causes.anxious_amplifier",

I\u2019m worried that maybe it\u2019s something more serious or I\u2019m sick or something, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it too much but I guess I should say what I feel.\nANSWER: Um, sometimes I wake up and I have accidents in my bed, and I don\u2019t really notice or feel anything before it happens. And I do feel wet sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if I woke up like that or if I\u2019ve been wet for a while. I don\u2019t really feel like I totally empty my bowels, like I still feel like I gotta go even after I do go.",
