Can you tell me if these episodes tend to happen at specific times of day\u2014like more in the evening or during certain activities\u2014or if they happen less often? Also, during these times, do you notice any other eye symptoms, like soreness, light sensitivity, or seeing flashes? And when these episodes happen, is there anything you do or try, like blinking or resting your eyes, that helps? The more specific you can be, the better I can understand what\u2019s happening.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Hmm, he's asking about the blurring stuff and if it happens at certain times or with certain activities, but honestly, I don't know if there's a pattern. It happens randomly sometimes, like when I\u2019m really tired or after I\u2019ve been on the computer for a long time. And I guess it might be worse in the evening because I feel more tired then, but I also get spots in my eyes sometimes when I stand up too fast, so I don\u2019t get how it all fits together.\nANSWER: Um, I think the blurring things happen mostly when I\u2019m really tired or after staring at screens too long, kinda like when I play video games or watch stuff late at night. Sometimes I get flashes or spots in my eyes too, especially if I stand up quick, and I do try blinking or resting my eyes, but it doesn\u2019t really help much. I don\u2019t notice that it\u2019s worse at any specific time, just kind of random, I guess.",
