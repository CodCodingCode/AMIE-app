When you look at the rash on your arms and chest, can you tell me if the tiny red dots stay red all the time or do they turn white when you press on them? Also, are all the spots the same size, or are some bigger or smaller? Regarding your fever, have you taken your temperature with a thermometer? If so, what was your temperature? Lastly, during these symptoms, have you felt more confused, had trouble focusing, or noticed any stiffness in your neck or sensitivity to light? These details will help me understand how serious this may be and what the next steps should be.\"baseline",

I feel overwhelmed and a little panicked, but I\u2019ll try to answer honestly without really knowing what all the medical stuff means.\nANSWER: Um, the spots, I think they stay red when I press on them, and they\u2019re all about the same size, I guess? I didn\u2019t use a thermometer, but I feel really hot and sweaty, and I haven\u2019t really noticed if I feel more confused or anything, but my neck is super stiff, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not.",
