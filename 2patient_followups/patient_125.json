Since he's been feeling worse for a while, I need to reassure him but also gather enough details. He seems to focus on his walking, balance, and pain, so those are important points. I should keep the conversation gentle and supportive, encouraging him to tell me more about what he's experiencing without making him feel judged.\nANSWER: I\u2019ve been having a lot of trouble with my legs, doctor. They feel all heavy and weak, and I keep falling even when I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. My hair\u2019s been falling out for a long time, but I thought it was just stress or something. Also, my back has been hurting a lot\u2014like, dull pain that\u2019s been getting worse over the past few months. I guess I just want to know what\u2019s going on with me.",
