    "input": "1. A 3-year-old female toddler is brought to the pediatric clinic by her parents due to concerns about delayed speech and poor response to auditory stimuli. She was born full-term with no complications and has met all developmental milestones besides communication. Hearing tests reveal bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, and there is no history of infections or ototoxic medication exposure. Family history is notable for consanguineous parents and a paternal uncle with similar hearing impairment since early childhood. Physical examination shows no dysmorphic features or other neurological deficits, suggesting nonsyndromic involvement. Genetic testing confirms a homozygous pathogenic variant in a gene associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness. Early intervention with hearing aids and consideration for cochlear implantation is discussed with the family. Audiological rehabilitation and speech therapy are initiated to improve language development.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain that we are here because of concerns about my child's hearing and speech. I should mention her age and the main issues without going into too much technical detail. It\u2019s important to share that we\u2019re worried about her not responding or talking like other kids her age. I want to sound honest and a little worried but not overwhelmed.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m here because my little girl, she\u2019s 3, and she doesn\u2019t seem to hear well or respond much when people talk to her. She doesn\u2019t really speak like other kids her age, and we\u2019re worried about it."

    "output": "She doesn\u2019t really talk or try to say much, and sometimes she just looks at us or responds when we call her name, but it\u2019s like she can\u2019t really hear us well. She plays mostly alone and doesn\u2019t seem to understand what we say most of the time. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s trying to tell us something sometimes, but it\u2019s hard to tell what she wants."

    "output": "Um, she doesn\u2019t really look at people much, and she sometimes just plays by herself. When others talk to her, she doesn\u2019t really respond like I would expect, and she doesn\u2019t seem to get what\u2019s going on most of the time. It\u2019s like she\u2019s in her own world."

    "output": "She's kind of like, um, I don't know, sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem to notice when things make noise, and other times she might look or turn around, but I can't really tell if it's because she hears something or if she's just doing it on her own. It's all kind of confusing for us."

    "output": "Um, she doesn\u2019t really seem to respond much to any sounds, honestly. Sometimes she looks a little more alert when there's louder noises, but it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s because of the volume or what kind of sound it is. In quiet places, she just seems kind of indifferent most of the time."

    "output": "Um, she has had some tests before, I think? I\u2019m not really sure what they were called, but they said her hearing was pretty bad in both ears. As for pictures and stuff, she looks at things, but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really following them or not. Sometimes she seems more interested in looking at things than listening to us, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."
