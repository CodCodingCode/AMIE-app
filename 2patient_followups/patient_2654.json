    "input": "1. An 8-year-old boy was brought to the pediatric neurology clinic by his parents due to delayed speech and difficulties with learning at school. He has struggled with fine motor skills and coordination since early childhood and exhibits occasional seizures. His medical history reveals hypotonia during infancy and frequent infections, but no major structural brain abnormalities were detected on MRI. The boy shows mild behavioral problems, including impulsivity and social withdrawal. Family history disclosed that the maternal uncle also had intellectual disability with unknown cause. Physical examination revealed subtle dysmorphic features such as a prominent forehead and open mouth posture. Cognitive testing confirmed moderate intellectual disability. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic mutation consistent with Mental Retardation, X-Linked 97.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an 8-year-old boy, so I need to express his age and gender first. I should mention some general feelings about his condition without sounding too detailed or technical. Since he's here because of ongoing issues, I\u2019ll keep it simple and honest, maybe hinting that he's worried about how he's feeling or doing.\n\nANSWER: I'm 8 years old, and I'm a boy. I've been feeling kind of confused and tired sometimes, and I don't really get what people are saying to me all the time. It\u2019s been hard to keep up with school and play right, and I get worried about messing up or not being like other kids."
