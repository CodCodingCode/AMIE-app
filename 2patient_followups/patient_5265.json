    "input": "2. A 5-year-old girl is referred to the developmental pediatrician due to concerns about speech delay and difficulty engaging with other children. Her parents note she has had a significantly larger head circumference since infancy, currently above the 97th percentile. She demonstrates limited eye contact, repetitive rocking movements, and intense interest in specific objects. Physical examination reveals mild facial dysmorphism and hypotonia, but no seizures or motor deficits are observed. Neuropsychological assessment confirms a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder with moderate language impairment. Brain imaging reveals increased brain volume without overt structural anomalies. Genetic testing uncovers a pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene, consistent with macrocephaly/autism syndrome. Multidisciplinary intervention including speech therapy, occupational therapy, and genetic counseling is initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 5-year-old girl with autism spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and some physical features. She might feel confused, maybe a little scared or overwhelmed, especially with new people. She may have difficulty expressing exactly what\u2019s bothering her, so I should keep my response simple and gentle.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just feel funny lately. My head hurts a little sometimes, and I don\u2019t really want to play with the other kids like before. It\u2019s all a bit confusing for me."

    "output": "Well, she\u2019s kind of the same in some ways, but I feel like she\u2019s gotten a little more upset or overwhelmed sometimes. She doesn\u2019t really want to play with other kids or do things that most kids her age do. It\u2019s like she\u2019s just kind of stuck in her own world, and it makes it hard for her to do even simple daily things, like getting ready or paying attention. I don\u2019t really understand if that's better or worse than before, honestly."

    "output": "I don\u2019t know... I just always feel kinda different. Sometimes I get really upset if things change or if I see something new. Nothing really happened recently, but I guess I get worried or upset a lot."

    "output": "Um, at home, she's been kind of the same, I guess? Sometimes she gets really focused on certain toys or objects and doesn\u2019t really want to do what we ask. She\u2019s a bit more upset or upset easier if things don\u2019t go her way, I think. And at school, I\u2019m not sure... she doesn\u2019t always say what\u2019s happening, but she doesn\u2019t seem to pay attention sometimes and just kinda spins or rocks a lot. We\u2019re not sure what makes it worse, but if there\u2019s loud noises or if she\u2019s tired, she gets more upset or quiet."

    "output": "Yeah, she\u2019s always been a bit different with talking and stuff. She doesn\u2019t talk much, and she seems kind of to do her own thing, more than other kids her age. Sometimes she moves in ways that seem repetitive, and we\u2019ve noticed she doesn\u2019t make much eye contact either."
