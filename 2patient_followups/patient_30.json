And then, the voices I hear, they say I\u2019m worthless or stuff I don\u2019t really want to listen to, and I get all tangled up trying to figure out if I\u2019m just losing my mind or if it\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know, real?

Sometimes, I get caught up in remembering stuff from years ago \u2014 like, the other day I was at the store and I heard someone calling my name, but nobody was there. The voices last for a while, and it kind of messes with my focus, especially when I\u2019m trying to do something simple like counting items or just walking home. I wonder if it\u2019s always gonna be like this, or if there's a way to make it stop so I can feel normal again.\nANSWER: When the voices start, it\u2019s like they just break into my head out of nowhere, and I can\u2019t really tell if they\u2019re real or not, so I kind of freeze sometimes. They usually go on for a bit, I don\u2019t really know how long, and then I feel tired out and a little dizzy, like I\u2019ve been running or something. It\u2019s kind of distracting, especially because I can't concentrate on anything else once they start, and I keep thinking about if I\u2019ll lose my job or if my family talks about me behind my back\u2014stuff like that.",

Also, do they tend to occur at specific times, like during the night or when you're feeling particularly stressed or upset? And when you experience these, do you notice whether your thoughts or feelings change\u2014like feeling more anxious or upset\u2014during or afterwards?tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I understand the doctor wants to know if these things happen all the time or just sometimes, and if certain times make it worse, but honestly, I don\u2019t really track that stuff well. Plus, I\u2019m kinda distracted by the voices now talking to me while I\u2019m trying to think about what I should say, so it\u2019s hard to focus. I also feel like when I see shadows or hear things, I get more jittery or worried, like I\u2019m losing a bit of control, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s linked to what I\u2019m doing or just random.\nANSWER: Uh, well, the voices, sometimes they talk to me pretty often, like, almost every day, but some days are worse than others, especially when I\u2019m tired or stressed out from work or just thinking about stuff with my family. And when they start in, I get anxious, and my mind feels kinda scrambled, like I\u2019m trapped in my head, and it\u2019s hard to think straight after that.",
