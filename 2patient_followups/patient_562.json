She reports mild episodic visual disturbances such as fuzziness and flickering, along with light sensitivity. She denies current eye discharge but fears serious issues. Her prior allergies occasionally affected her eyes, but no prior significant eye problems. This pattern suggests an inflammatory process, possibly trauma-induced injury like corneal abrasion, with consideration of allergic conjunctivitis or mild uveitis. Further examination is needed to evaluate discharge, visual changes, and other signs to refine diagnosis and plan management.anxious_amplifier",

The flickering and fuzziness have gotten a little worse, and the light sensitivity is also worse than when it first started, I think.
