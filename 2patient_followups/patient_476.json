Also, when you press on the lumps, do they feel like they move easily or do they seem fixed in place? And have you noticed any swelling in your neck, armpits, or groin that might be related? Lastly, do you feel any numbness, tingling, or unusual sensation around the lumps or in nearby areas?anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about these lumps. They\u2019re tender, and they\u2019re getting bigger, which I think must be bad. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dangerous or if I\u2019m getting some kind of worse illness. I feel terrible and scared, like maybe it\u2019s something serious I can\u2019t fix myself. I just want to understand what\u2019s happening and make it stop.\nANSWER: Yes, doctor, these red bumps are sore and getting bigger all the time. When I press on them, they feel like they\u2019re stuck and don\u2019t move around. I haven\u2019t noticed any ulcers or rashes on top of them, but they look pretty red and inflamed. I haven\u2019t seen any swelling in my neck or armpits or anywhere else that I can tell. And no, I don\u2019t feel any numbness or tingling, just pain and my skin feels hot around the lumps.",
