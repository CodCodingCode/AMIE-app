I have a history of chronic kidney disease and recently started taking a new medication for hypertension. I also have been eating more bananas and orange juice than usual, which I now realize might have increased my potassium intake. I haven't noticed any muscle weakness or irregular heartbeat, but I\u2019m feeling quite weak and uncomfortable.",

I'm feeling pretty weak and uncomfortable, so I should describe that as well. \nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m 65 and I\u2019m a male. I\u2019ve been having some stomach pain and I\u2019ve been feeling really nauseous, and I\u2019ve actually been vomiting and having diarrhea too.

I have kidney issues, and I just started on a new blood pressure medicine\u2026 I feel pretty weak and uncomfortable overall.",
