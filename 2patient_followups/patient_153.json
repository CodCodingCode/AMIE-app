I can't stop eating.\"\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- FidgetingBased on what you've shared so far, I\u2019d like to ask a few more detailed questions about what you experience during these episodes, especially about any physical sensations or sensations in your body\u2014do you notice anything involuntary happening like muscle jerks, twitching, or changes in your heartbeat or temperature? And when these episodes occur, do you see or feel anything in your environment or inside your head that stands out? Can you tell me more about whether you feel hot, cold, or see any lights or shadows? Also, do you notice any specific triggers or things that seem to start or worsen these episodes? This will help me understand better what\u2019s going on and how to help you.baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and a bit paranoid about what\u2019s happening to me. I don\u2019t really understand it all, and I just want some clarity, but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s really serious. I want to tell the doctor everything without sounding crazy, but I\u2019m worried it might sound that way anyway.\nANSWER: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really notice anything weird like shaking or my heartbeat changing, but I do feel super hot or cold sometimes during these times. I see shadows or lights flickering, and it\u2019s really creepy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed anything that triggers it\u2014I just suddenly feel off. It\u2019s all so confusing.",
