I\u2019ve noticed some changes in my right breast, and I\u2019m a little worried about what they might mean. I feel like there's a hard spot inside my breast, like a thickened area I can feel when I press on it. There\u2019s also a little dimpling on the skin, like a tiny dent, and my nipple seems to be pulled in or inverted now. I\u2019ve recently seen that my breast looks a bit different, maybe a little larger or fuller, and these changes have been happening gradually over the past few weeks.",
