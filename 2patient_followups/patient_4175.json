    "input": "2. A 32-year-old female accountant presents with a 6-week history of gradually worsening bilateral vision loss, initially noticing blurriness and difficulty reading fine print. She describes a recent increase in cigarette smoking and has been taking high doses of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis for the past two months. On examination, her visual acuity is 20/80 in both eyes, with decreased color discrimination and central scotomas on automated perimetry. Pupillary responses are sluggish, but no relative afferent pupillary defect is observed. Fundoscopy reveals mild optic disc pallor temporally in both eyes without signs of inflammation. Blood tests show normal vitamin B12 but elevated isoniazid levels and mild peripheral neuropathy on nerve conduction studies. She denies headache, eye pain, or other neurological symptoms, and MRI of the brain and orbits is unremarkable. The presentation is consistent with toxic optic neuropathy likely induced by isoniazid therapy compounded by smoking.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly, but I feel a bit nervous and confused. I should mention the main problem and how it's been getting worse, without overloading with details.  \nANSWER: Well, I've been having trouble seeing clearly for about six weeks now, and it's been getting worse gradually. I mostly notice that my reading and seeing small print is harder, and everything looks a bit blurry. It's kind of scary, and I just want to find out what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "It\u2019s been really tough, honestly. I can\u2019t read things properly anymore, especially small print, and it makes work really hard. Sometimes I feel kind of lost or like I\u2019m not seeing clearly enough, and I get scared because it\u2019s just been getting worse, you know? I haven\u2019t noticed any other crazy symptoms besides the vision, but I keep thinking about what all this means."

    "output": "Um, well, it's mostly been like blurry and kind of dull in the middle part of my vision. I haven't really seen any flashes or floaters that I remember, but everything just feels more washed out, especially when I try to look at small print or detail stuff."
