    "input": "1. A 34-year-old male presents with progressive weakness and muscle wasting in his distal lower limbs, first noticeable in his early twenties. He reports frequent tripping and difficulty running, alongside numbness and tingling sensations in both feet. On examination, there is marked atrophy of the anterior tibial muscles and mild pes cavus deformity. Deep tendon reflexes are reduced in the lower extremities, and sensory testing reveals decreased vibration and pinprick sensation distally. His family history is significant for similar symptoms in his father and paternal grandfather, suggesting a hereditary pattern. Electromyography shows signs of axonal neuropathy, while nerve conduction studies reveal reduced amplitudes consistent with axonal loss rather than demyelination. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the GARS1 gene, confirming autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2g. Supportive treatment including physical therapy and orthotic devices is initiated to maintain mobility and delay progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is asked why they are here today, probably feeling a bit unsure and worried about their symptoms, maybe even embarrassed. They might struggle to fully explain what's been happening or how they're feeling now. I should keep it simple, honest, and focus on their main concerns without overloading details.\n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019m 34, and I\u2019m a guy. Lately, I\u2019ve just been feeling more weak in my legs and feet, and I trip a lot more than I used to. It\u2019s been pretty confusing because I also feel tingling and numbness down in my feet, and I don\u2019t really know why all of this is happening now."

    "output": "Well, I guess it\u2019s been pretty hard sometimes. I trip a lot more than I used to, even just walking around, and I feel like my feet are kind of weird, like numb or tingly. Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling more tired and unsteady, especially when I stand for a long time. It\u2019s also messing with stuff I used to do easily, like running or even just being on my feet all day. I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s different, but I keep worrying about if it\u2019s gonna get worse or if I should be doing something different."

    "output": "Well, I guess it started when I was in my early twenties, kind of slowly. At first, I just noticed I was tripping more and having trouble running, but it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. Over the years, it\u2019s gotten worse, especially in my feet\u2014they sometimes feel numb or tingly, and my legs get weaker. I don\u2019t really know what makes it worse or better, it just kind of happens. Sometimes walking a lot makes it worse, but I can\u2019t really tell what\u2019s triggering it."

    "output": "Yeah, I guess it\u2019s been gradually worse \u2014 like, I trip more often now and have trouble keeping my balance, especially on uneven ground. My feet feel kind of numb or tingly all the time, and I sometimes get these weird shocks or pins and needles. It\u2019s made things harder for me to do, like walking or even standing for a while. I haven\u2019t noticed any new health problems, but I just feel tired or a bit off more than before. Sometimes I worry about what it all means."
