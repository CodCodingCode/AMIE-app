    "input": "1. A 12-year-old female presents with progressive difficulty swallowing and slurred speech over the past three months, accompanied by intermittent episodes of double vision. She also reports increasing stiffness and weakness in her legs, causing frequent falls and trouble walking. Neurological examination reveals spasticity, hyperreflexia, and ataxia, with nystagmus on ocular testing. Brain MRI demonstrates diffuse white matter abnormalities involving the brainstem and spinal cord with lactate peak on spectroscopy. CSF analysis is unremarkable, and metabolic workup shows elevated lactate levels in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle who experienced early-onset motor decline of unknown etiology. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the DARS2 gene, consistent with Leukoencephalopathy with Brainstem and Spinal Cord Involvement and Lactate Elevation (LBSL). The patient is started on supportive therapies including physical therapy and monitored for progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl who\u2019s been having worsening symptoms, so I need to express that I feel worried and confused about why I\u2019m here. I want to mention my symptoms but in a way that sounds natural and honest, not medical jargon.  \nANSWER: Um, I guess I just feel like I can\u2019t really swallow or speak properly anymore, and sometimes my eyes like jump or jolt around. I\u2019ve been falling a lot and feeling kind of weird in my legs, even when I try to walk."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes my speech and swallowing feel really hard, and my eyes sort of flicker. It's kind of worse when I try to do stuff, but then I feel a bit better if I sit down or rest for a little while."

    "output": "Um, I think it's been slowly getting worse. Like, I used to be able to do things normal, but now I get tired really easy and I fall more often. Sometimes I feel like I can't really swallow or talk right, and I've been having more of those double vision things. I don't know if there's anything new, but everything just feels a bit off more and more."

    "output": "Um, well, everything feels harder than before. I drop things a lot now, and walking feels really off sometimes, like I can\u2019t control my legs very well. My speech is a bit worse, and I get really tired, even just doing little stuff. Sometimes my eyes feel weird too, like they\u2019re not really working right. It\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna get worse."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know if I have those things. I mean, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed anything weird with my mouth or eyes, but sometimes I do feel like I gotta go to the bathroom a lot or it\u2019s hard to control, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts."
