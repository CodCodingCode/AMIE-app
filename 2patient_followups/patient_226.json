I also don\u2019t really understand if it\u2019s gotten worse or if I\u2019ve been feeling more tired all the time, but I do feel more drained than usual. I guess I should just tell him what I remember, even if I\u2019m not sure about everything.\nANSWER: Well, I think I\u2019ve seen some blood in the toilet, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a few drops or more, and I think it happens during or after I go, but honestly, I\u2019m not always sure. As for the tiredness, I do feel more exhausted than I used to, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse or how to say what\u2019s changed exactly.",
