    "input": "1. A 27-year-old female presents with a two-year history of gradually worsening foot drop and difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning her shirt. She notes intermittent numbness and burning pain in her hands and feet, more pronounced distally. On physical examination, there is noticeable weakness in ankle dorsiflexion and finger extension, accompanied by pes cavus and mild hammer toe deformities. Sensory assessment reveals reduced proprioception and pinprick sensation in the distal limbs, and reflexes are diminished at the ankles. Family history is remarkable for a paternal uncle with a similar gait abnormality and hand weakness beginning in his late twenties. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate axonal neuropathy with reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes, consistent with an axonal process. Subsequent genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic mutation in the GARS gene, supporting a diagnosis of Autosomal Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2g. A multidisciplinary approach including occupational therapy and symptomatic pain management is recommended to optimize function and quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should describe my symptoms without getting too technical or detailed, just enough to explain what\u2019s been bothering me. I want to be honest but also not overwhelming or confusing.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 27-year-old woman, and lately I\u2019ve been having trouble with my feet and hands. It\u2019s like, my feet just don\u2019t want to lift properly, and my fingers feel all tingly and burning sometimes. It\u2019s been going on for a couple of years, and it\u2019s just getting worse."

    "output": "Well, at first, it was just a little tingly feeling in my feet, you know? But now, it kinda... I dunno, like, I can't lift my toes properly sometimes or keep my hands steady when I try to do stuff like button or tie my shoelaces. It's been getting worse over these past couple of years, and honestly, it makes me nervous because I never know when I might stumble or drop things."

    "output": "Um, I guess it started a couple of years ago, maybe? At first, I just thought it was nothing, but then my feet started feeling more numb and kind of tingling all the time. Over time, I\u2019ve noticed I can\u2019t really do certain things easily anymore, like tying my shoes or buttoning my shirt, and my legs feel weaker or strange sometimes. It\u2019s like this stuff just keeps getting worse, and I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s going to happen next, especially with stuff I need to do every day."

I haven't really noticed any problems with my vision or anything with my bladder or bowel, but I guess I sometimes feel kind of off-balance more than usual."
