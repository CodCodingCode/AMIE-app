I do remember feeling a little dizzy earlier, but I thought it was from yawning so much. I guess I just feel pretty off, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related or not. It\u2019s all kind of foggy in my head.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t really remember hitting my head or feeling anything right after. I think I might have felt a little dizzy earlier, but maybe I was just tired or something. I don\u2019t know, everything kind of feels weird and mixed up, so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s what.",
