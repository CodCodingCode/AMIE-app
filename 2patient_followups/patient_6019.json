    "input": "2. A 45-year-old female is brought to the clinic by her family due to new-onset slowness in movements and difficulty walking, which developed gradually over three months. She reports having been found unconscious following accidental exposure to a malfunctioning gas heater in her home, with confirmed carbon monoxide poisoning treated in the hospital two months prior. Since then, she has noticed stiffness in her limbs, reduced facial expressiveness, and a soft, monotone voice. Her family also notes occasional episodes of confusion and memory problems. On examination, she exhibits bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity predominantly in the upper limbs, and a mild resting tremor in the left hand. Cognitive testing reveals mild executive dysfunction, and MRI brain imaging shows bilateral lesions in the globus pallidus. A DaTscan demonstrates decreased dopaminergic activity consistent with parkinsonism. She is diagnosed with carbon monoxide-induced parkinsonism and started on levodopa therapy with plans for neurorehabilitation focusing on motor and cognitive symptoms.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be feeling anxious or unsure why she was brought in but should focus on her symptoms and recent changes. She may also feel a bit embarrassed or confused about her condition and why she's here. It's important to be gentle and encouraging to get her to share her experience.  \nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling really slow lately, and my movements aren\u2019t as smooth as they used to be. I\u2019ve also been having trouble walking and sometimes I forget things or get confused more than before. My family was worried, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of slow every day, like I can\u2019t really move as easily as I used to, especially in the mornings. Sometimes I forget things or get confused, and it\u2019s harder to do things I used to do all the time, like, I don\u2019t know, get dressed or make coffee. It feels worse when I\u2019m tired or if I\u2019m trying to do too many things at once."

Specifically, are there any other symptoms you've observed, such as difficulty with balance, changes in bladder or bowel habits, or visual or sensory changes?",
    "output": "Um, I think I started noticing things a couple of months ago? Like, I\u2019d feel sorta slower, and my movements weren\u2019t as quick as before. It\u2019s kinda gotten worse, especially my walking. I\u2019ve also felt a bit off sometimes, like I get confused or forget stuff more. I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with my bladder or seeing things, but I do feel a little unsteady sometimes when I try to stand or turn around."
