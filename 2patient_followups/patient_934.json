I should mention her weak voice and feeding issues, but keep it simple and honest since she's only three months old and can't communicate clearly myself.

Her voice is very soft, like a whisper, and she sometimes sounds like she's struggling to breathe. She\u2019s been having a hard time feeding because she chokes and sounds noisy or strained when she breathes. I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s been like this since she was born.",
