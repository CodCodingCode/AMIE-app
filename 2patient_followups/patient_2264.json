    "input": "1. A 32-year-old male presents with a gradually progressive weakness and numbness in his lower limbs that began in his early twenties, now accompanied by difficulty with balance and frequent tripping. He reports a family history of similar symptoms in his father and paternal grandfather, who both developed foot deformities and walking difficulties in their thirties. On examination, distal muscle atrophy is noted in the anterior lower legs, with pes cavus deformity and diminished vibration and pinprick sensation in a stocking distribution. Reflexes are reduced at the ankles but brisk at the knees. Electromyography reveals axonal neuropathy without conduction block, consistent with an axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation in the TFG gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal dominant CMT type 2. The patient is currently undergoing physical therapy to maintain mobility and uses orthotic devices for foot support. Pain management and genetic counseling are also integral parts of his ongoing care.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep it simple and focus on what\u2019s been bothering me lately. I\u2019ve been feeling some new stuff that worries me, but I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m overreacting. I\u2019ll just mention what\u2019s happening now, even if I don\u2019t fully understand it myself.  \nANSWER: I guess I just felt like I needed to come in because I\u2019ve been having more trouble with my legs, like they get pretty weak and I trip sometimes more than before. It\u2019s been kind of creeping up on me, and I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore."

    "output": "Um, I guess it's gotten a bit worse over time. I trip more than I used to, and sometimes I feel pretty unsteady, especially when walking on uneven ground. It\u2019s kind of frustrating because I can\u2019t always tell how my legs will hold up, and I worry about falling. I haven\u2019t noticed anything else really, just that it\u2019s harder to keep my balance sometimes."

    "output": "Um, well, most days I just try to get through it, but sometimes when I\u2019m on my feet for a while or if I\u2019m tired, it gets harder to stay balanced or stand without feeling wobbly. There are moments when I feel like my legs just won't cooperate, especially when I\u2019m trying to walk upstairs or on uneven ground."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes it feels worse when I\u2019ve been standing or walking a lot, like my feet get really heavy or numb. I haven't noticed anything new, like swallowing problems or more tingling, but sometimes the numbness feels different or more intense, especially in the evenings."

    "output": "No, I haven't really noticed anything with my arms or face, and my vision seems okay, I think. But sometimes I do get these weird feelings, like a bit of tingling in my hands, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts."

    "output": "Umm, well... I haven't really noticed anything with my bladder or bowels. I mean, I don't think so? My coordination\u2019s been kinda the same, I guess\u2014still tripping and having trouble balancing sometimes, but I haven't really tried that heel-to-shin thing to check or felt any weird stiffness like I\u2019ve read about. It\u2019s mostly still the same, I think."

And if they do come and go, how long do these episodes last?",
    "output": "Um, I think it's been gradually getting worse for a while, but sometimes I feel a little more off-balance than usual, like maybe once in a while. The bad days seem to last for a bit, maybe a day or two, and then I think I feel a little better, but it\u2019s also kind of hard to tell. It\u2019s all kind of slowly changing, I guess."
