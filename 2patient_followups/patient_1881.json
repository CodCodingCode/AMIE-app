    "input": "1. A 12-year-old girl presents with progressive muscle weakness, particularly in her proximal limbs, and worsening exercise intolerance over the past year. Her parents note episodes of muscle stiffness and occasional cramping after physical activity, along with difficulty climbing stairs and rising from a seated position. She also reports fatigue and muscle pain following mild exertion. On examination, mild hepatomegaly is detected, and there is decreased muscle strength in the shoulder and hip girdle muscles. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum creatine kinase levels and persistent fasting hypoglycemia with normal serum lactate. A muscle biopsy demonstrates excessive glycogen accumulation within lysosomes, and enzymatic assays show deficient acid alpha-glucosidase activity. Genetic analysis confirms mutations in the GAA gene, consistent with Glycogen Storage Disease Type II (Pompe disease), but given the patient's presentation prefers a subtype diagnosis of Glycogen Storage Disease VI, further evaluation reveals partial deficiency of hepatic phosphorylase. The patient is advised on frequent meals to prevent hypoglycemia and initiated on tailored supportive therapy to manage symptoms and prevent disease progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient feels a bit overwhelmed but needs to explain her main concerns without sounding too worried. She has trouble describing her symptoms clearly but wants to tell the doctor what she's experiencing in her own words.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I've just been feeling really weak, especially in my arms and legs, and I get tired super fast when I try to do anything active. Sometimes my muscles feel kinda weird, like they're stiff or sore after I play or walk around a lot. It's been worse over the last year, and I\u2019m not sure why."

    "output": "Well, I guess it's harder to do stuff like climb stairs or get up from sitting, and I get tired more easily than I used to. Sometimes my muscles feel kind of stiff or sore after I play. I haven't really noticed any numbness or vision problems, but I do feel a bit off sometimes, like I just feel weaker or more tired than usual, even if I haven't done much."

    "output": "Um, I think it started about a year ago, like I was getting more tired when I was playing or trying to do stuff that used my muscles, and I noticed I was a little stiff sometimes. Lately, I've been feeling kind of funny, like, I don't know, maybe a little numb or weird in my arms or legs, but I'm not really sure if it's the same or different. I haven't really noticed anything like trouble swallowing or feeling different in my other senses, but sometimes I feel kind of shaky after exercising."

    "output": "Um, I think the weakness feels, like, more in my shoulders and hips, like I have trouble lifting things or getting up sometimes. I haven't really noticed much about my reflexes or anything like that."

    "output": "Yeah, I guess so. I\u2019ve been noticing that I get more tired and weak when I try to do things like climbing stairs or trying to stand up from sitting. It feels like it\u2019s getting harder than it was before."
