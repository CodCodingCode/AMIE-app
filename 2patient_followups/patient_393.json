I also noticed I\u2019ve been running a low-grade fever, and I feel unusually weak, almost like I can\u2019t get enough rest. I\u2019ve been drinking more alcohol than usual lately, and I\u2019ve been taking some over-the-counter vitamins and painkillers for back pain. I\u2019m worried because I\u2019ve read that liver issues can be caused by medications or alcohol, and I\u2019m concerned about what might be wrong.When a healthcare provider examines your eyes and skin, do they notice more of the yellowing or a dull yellow color that might be harder to see yourself, and does this appearance seem to have changed compared to a few days ago?tangential_storyteller",

I\u2019ve had other health i\nANSWER: Well, I think I do see more of that dull yellowish kind of color now \u2014 a little more, I guess? Though sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell because I\u2019ve been so tired, and, honestly, I haven\u2019t been paying much attention to my eyes, just everything else going on. It sort of seemed the same as a couple of days ago, but I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe it\u2019s gotten a little worse, or maybe I think that because I\u2019m worried.",
