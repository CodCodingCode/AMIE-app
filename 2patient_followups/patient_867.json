I mean, I was just working on a new design project last night, and suddenly the pain hit, and it was like this stabbing feeling in my side, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my mom having kidney problems, and her having her own health scare last year.

Last\"Emily, I want to make sure I understand exactly how much blood you've noticed. When you wipe, do you see just a tiny smear, or has it been enough to make the tissue look quite red or even your urine darker? Also, about the pain \u2014 you mentioned it came on suddenly and is very severe now \u2014 can you tell me if it feels like sharp, cramping, or persistent ache? Have you had similar episodes before, or is this an entirely new experience? Lastly, what are your main concerns or worries about what\u2019s been happening? Sometimes, talking through these can help us both understand what\u2019s going on and decide on the best next steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I need to tell her everything, but I keep thinking about how weird and frightening this is. My mind jumps to my family\u2014my mom had kidney problems, so maybe it runs in the family? I also just got back from a big client presentation yesterday, and I was super stressed and tired, so maybe that\u2019s making things worse? I saw a little blood when I wiped earlier today, but I didn\u2019t think much of it then. I just want to make sure I\u2019m not dying or something\u2014surgery sounds terrible, but I really can\u2019t handle this pain anymore.\nANSWER: Well, I did notice some blood when I wiped, and it\u2019s like a bit of a darkish color, not just a little, but enough that it kind of freaked me out. The pain started off dull but now, it\u2019s just sharp and stabbing all over my side and back, like a really bad cramp but also constant. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before\u2014it's my first time feeling something this bad\u2014and I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s my kidney? I\u2019m really worried, and honestly, I feel so tired I don\u2019t even want to move. Do you think it\u2019s something serious? Do I need surgery or what?",
