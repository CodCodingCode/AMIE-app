It\u2019s been happening on and off for a few months. Also, I get these weird thoughts that don\u2019t make sense, like my mind is jumbling everything up. And I feel a bit detached, like I\u2019m watching myself from outside. It\u2019s not constant, but it\u2019s enough to bother me. I don\u2019t have any pain or physical discomfort, just these strange experiences.\"\n- *Timeline of symptom development:*\n\"The voices started a few months ago, gradually becoming more noticeable.
