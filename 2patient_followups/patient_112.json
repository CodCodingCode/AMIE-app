Maybe I\u2019m just so focused on the weakness that I haven\u2019t paid attention to other things. I guess I don\u2019t feel any big balance issues or anything, but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s going to get worse or it\u2019s something really bad like a nerve problem or something. I feel like I should have noticed more, but I haven\u2019t.\nANSWER: Uh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt any numbness or tingling, at least not really. Sometimes I feel a little shaky or weird in my legs when I walk, but I thought that was just tiredness? I haven\u2019t noticed much change in my balance or coordination, but I\u2019m just really worried if it\u2019s going to get worse or mean something serious.",

    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little embarrassed to say it, but I\u2019ve definitely felt kind of numb sometimes, especially in my legs and sometimes my face, like they\u2019re heavy or tingly. It started a while ago, but now it\u2019s worse, and I\u2019m really worried it\u2019s something serious like nerve damage or even a brain problem, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just overthinking, but these things concern me a lot, especially since I\u2019m feeling unsteady sometimes and I don\u2019t want it to get worse or make me fall.\nANSWER: Yeah, I\u2019ve noticed some numbness and tingling in my legs and face, especially when I try to do something like lift things or climb stairs. It feels different than just tiredness, like it\u2019s harder to move or even feel stuff properly, and I\u2019m worried it might affect my balance or make me fall.",
