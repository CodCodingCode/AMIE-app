I\u2019ve been noticing more tearing and irritation in my eyes, especially when I wake up. Sometimes I feel like there\u2019s something gritty or like a film or something stuck in there, and bright lights bother me a lot more than they used to.

What if this is something worse\u2014I don\u2019t want to lose my sight or have some nerve problem. I\u2019m worried I might be getting worse or it\u2019s something really bad. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, and it just won\u2019t stop bothering me, so I want to make sure I understand what\u2019s going on.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t seen double or felt my muscles weak or anything like that. It\u2019s just my eyelids\u2014they feel really heavy and like they don\u2019t want to open all the way, especially when I first get up or after I\u2019ve been focusing on stuff.",
