    "input": "1. A 14-year-old male presents with delayed puberty and poor linear growth compared to his peers. He reports numbness and tingling in his hands and feet, accompanied by occasional muscle weakness. Physical examination shows underdeveloped genitalia and scant pubic hair consistent with partial gonadal dysgenesis. Neurological assessment reveals decreased sensation to light touch and vibration in a stocking-glove distribution with mild distal muscle atrophy. Hormonal studies demonstrate elevated gonadotropins with low testosterone levels, while karyotyping confirms a 46,XY chromosome pattern. Electromyography indicates features consistent with a peripheral neuropathy, and nerve biopsy reveals minifascicular patterns. The patient has no significant family history of endocrine or neurological disorders. Genetic testing is underway to identify mutations related to gonadal development and neuropathic changes.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor asks why I came in today, so I need to explain my problems without sounding like I know what they mean. I should mention my feelings and symptoms in a simple way, maybe emphasizing how I feel worried or different from other kids.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 14 and I\u2019m a boy. I\u2019ve just been feeling really weird\u2014my hands and feet keep tingling, and sometimes my muscles feel kinda weak, like I can\u2019t move them right. I guess I just wanted someone to see if there's something wrong with me."

Or have you experienced any changes in vision, problems with coordination, or other symptoms?",
    "output": "Um, I don't think I've had any infections or anything like that. Sometimes I feel kind of dizzy or like my balance is weird, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not. No changes in my eyesight or coordination that I know of, I guess."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess I notice the numbness and tingling sometimes just shows up out of nowhere, and it makes it kinda hard to do stuff like writing or even holding things. And sometimes, my legs feel weak, but then it's okay for a little while. It's kind of annoying not knowing when it\u2019ll happen or if it\u2019ll get worse."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really know if anything happens more at certain times. Sometimes it\u2019s just there, and I don\u2019t think I did anything special or anything made it worse or better."

Additionally, have you had any recent infections (like respiratory or stomach illnesses), flu-like symptoms, or fevers before these episodes started?",
    "output": "Um, I haven't really noticed anything like that with my eyes. No double vision, I guess. I haven't been sick or anything lately, at least I don't think so. Everything just feels weird sometimes."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost control or anything like that, but sometimes I feel numb or tingly in my hands and feet, and it kind of spreads maybe a little up my legs but not sure if it goes beyond that. It\u2019s like my body feels weird but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s everything or just parts of me."
