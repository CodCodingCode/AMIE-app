For instance, is it a dull ache, a sharp pain, or something else? And when exactly did it begin\u2014was it sudden or has it come on gradually? Also, have you noticed if anything you've done, like moving your eye, being in bright light, or using any eye drops or medications, makes the pain better or worse?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel really scared about what\u2019s happening\u2014my eye pain sounds terrible, and I keep thinking it might be something really bad, maybe I\u2019m going blind or it could be something serious like cancer. I\u2019m worried I didn\u2019t do enough or maybe I caused this myself, especially with those steroid drops I used. I just want to know if there\u2019s any way to fix it or stop it from getting worse, but I\u2019m also petrified it\u2019s permanent.\nANSWER: The pain is like a really bad, dull, heavy ache \u2014 it just won\u2019t go away. It started yesterday but I\u2019ve felt some pressure in my eye for a while, and now it\u2019s just the worst. I don\u2019t know what I did, maybe I caused this somehow, and I keep thinking, is this seriously going to make me lose my eyesight forever?",
