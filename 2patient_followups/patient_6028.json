    "input": "1. A 16-year-old male presents with a six-month history of progressive neck pain and intermittent numbness radiating into both hands. He reports frequent episodes of clumsiness and stumbling while walking, particularly after playing sports. On examination, there is mild weakness in the upper extremities and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs, with a positive Hoffmann\u2019s sign bilaterally. Past medical history is unremarkable, and there is no history of trauma. MRI of the cervical spine reveals a congenitally narrow spinal canal with evidence of cord compression at C4-C6. Electromyography shows signs of cervical myelopathy. Neurological symptoms worsen with activities involving neck extension. The patient is referred to neurosurgery for evaluation of possible decompressive laminectomy due to congenital cervical spinal stenosis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and might be nervous or unsure about how to describe what\u2019s going on, so I should keep it simple and honest. They might be worried about what\u2019s happening to their body and want to understand it better. I should also make sure to mention the main symptoms clearly and honestly without overcomplicating things.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve been having this weird neck pain for like, six months, and sometimes I feel like my hands go numb or tingle and I trip or stumble when I\u2019m playing sports or walking. It\u2019s been getting worse lately, and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening, but I just feel kind of off."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been pretty hard sometimes. My neck hurts a lot, and I actually get these weird tingling feelings in my hands, so I\u2019m usually a bit cautious and try not to do too much. I\u2019ve been missing out on some sports and stuff I used to enjoy, and I guess I feel kind of nervous about all of it, like I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s coming next."
