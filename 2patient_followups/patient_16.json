    "input": "1. A 16-year-old phenotypic female presents to the clinic with primary amenorrhea and concerns about minimal breast development despite normal growth during puberty. She reports normal axillary and pubic hair growth, but her menstrual cycles have never started. Her past medical history is unremarkable, and she has no significant family history of reproductive disorders. Physical examination reveals normal external female genitalia, sparse pubic hair, and well-developed breasts. Pelvic ultrasound shows absent uterus and ovaries, with undescended gonads located in the inguinal region. Hormonal evaluation shows elevated testosterone levels within the male range, elevated luteinizing hormone, and normal follicle-stimulating hormone. Karyotyping reveals a 46,XY genotype. The clinical picture is consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS).\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young, likely confused and a little anxious about her body not developing as she expected. She might feel embarrassed or unsure how to explain her feelings or concerns clearly. I should encourage her to express whatever's bothering her without making her uncomfortable.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi, I'm 16, and I guess I\u2019ve just never really started my period, and my boobs are kind of small. I don\u2019t know, I just feel different sometimes, and I\u2019ve been wondering why my body isn\u2019t like other girls\u2019. It\u2019s kind of confusing and I\u2019m a little scared to say it out loud."

I just\u2026 I wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me, but I\u2019m not sure what to ask or say about it."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I have a webbed neck or anything like that, and I guess I\u2019m not really sure about my family history. I haven\u2019t had any genetic tests or pelvic ultrasounds before, so I don\u2019t really know if I have extra features or not. I just know I never got my period and I\u2019ve always been a bit confused about all of this."

    "output": "Um, I think they showed some stuff was kind of high, especially the male hormones, but I didn't really get what all of it meant. I just know they did some tests and said things were different than normal."

    "output": "Um, I guess so... I don't really understand all those tests, but if it helps find out why I feel the way I do or what's going on, I guess I can try."
