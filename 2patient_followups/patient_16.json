My chest hurts a little when I breathe and my cough is so annoying, I just want to know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m worried that if it\u2019s serious, I might not be able to handle it or it could be something deadly. I don\u2019t quite understand what the doctor might ask next, but I just want answers quickly.\n\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve been having this cough that\u2019s just not going away, sometimes a dry one, sometimes a little more phlegm. I feel really tired all the time, and I\u2019ve had a low fever on and off for about a week now. Sometimes I feel like I can\u2019t get enough air, especially when I climb stairs or do much outside. I keep thinking maybe it\u2019s pneumonia or something really serious like cancer, and I\u2019m just worried what it might be. Do you think it\u2019s something bad? Do I need a bunch of tests?",
