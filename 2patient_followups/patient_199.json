    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and really frightened by everything I\u2019m going through. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to me, so I try to tell the doctor how scared I am and what I see and hear, even if it\u2019s confusing or I don\u2019t have all the words.\nANSWER: I keep seeing shadows moving all the time, even when there\u2019s nothing there, and sometimes I hear voices I know aren\u2019t real. It happens suddenly, and the shadows change shapes. It feels like it\u2019s happening out of nowhere, and it lasts just a few seconds, but it\u2019s so frightening.",
