    "output": "THINKING: I don\u2019t really understand what the doctor is asking about my vision or eye, but I feel a little self-conscious and don\u2019t want to make a fuss. Maybe they\u2019re worried I have something serious, but I think I just see fine most of the time\u2014I guess I should say something, but I also don\u2019t want to draw too much attention to it.\nANSWER: Uh, I mean, I don\u2019t really notice anything major, like blurry or anything. My eye\u2019s kinda sore sometimes, but it\u2019s not really shooting or anything, just a bit of ache. Overall, I feel fine, I guess, but I\u2019m not sure what I should be worried about.",
