If you have, can you tell me when that happened and how often you might see them now? Also, when your vision feels fuzzy or blurry, does that sometimes come on suddenly as well, or does it develop gradually? These details can help me better understand what might be causing your symptoms.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I don\u2019t want to sound overly worried or like I\u2019m exaggerating, but I do notice these things, so I should tell the doctor. I\u2019ve seen floaters a couple of times, but it\u2019s not really that often and it came and went pretty quick. As for the blurry thing, it kind of sneaks up on me slowly, not all at once. I don\u2019t really want to make a big fuss about it, but I guess I should mention it.\nANSWER: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve seen a few floaters, maybe twice in the last few weeks, but they didn\u2019t stick around long. The blurry vision, that\u2019s kind of gradual, not like it just all of a sudden got fuzzy, it kind of creeps up.",
