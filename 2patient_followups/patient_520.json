I\u2019ve been feeling really weak and haven\u2019t wanted to eat much.\"\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \"I do drink a little alcohol, maybe a glass or two a night, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything different recently.\"\n- \"I\u2019ve been taking vitamins for a while, and I sometimes use over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches.\"\n- \"I don\u2019t have any history of liver problems, but I do have a bit of obesity.\"\n- \"\"Earlier, you mentioned that your yellowing of the skin has been mild and hasn't worsened, but I want to make sure we've caught everything. Have you noticed if your urine has become darker or your stools lighter in color recently? Also, have you taken any medications lately or been around anything that might have affected your liver\u2014like alcohol, herbal supplements, or toxins? And how do you feel overall about your symptoms\u2014do you think there's anything else about how you're feeling that you haven't shared?\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess she's just trying to figure out if it's serious, but I don\u2019t really want to make a big deal out of it. I don\u2019t think my urine sounds darker, but I\u2019m not really sure. I don\u2019t take much else, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been around anything harmful, but I haven\u2019t talked to anyone about it. I just feel kind of off and weak, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting.\nANSWER: Um, yeah, I think my pee might be darker, and I haven\u2019t changed anything really. I\u2019ve only been drinking a little alcohol here and there, and I don\u2019t really remember taking anything new. I just feel kind of tired and blah, honestly.",
