    "input": "1. A 28-year-old male presents to the urology clinic after 18 months of unsuccessful attempts to conceive with his partner. He reports no history of testicular trauma or infections but has noticed a decrease in libido over the past few months. Physical exam reveals bilateral small testes with no varicoceles or palpable masses. Semen analysis consistently shows severe oligozoospermia with sperm concentrations well below normal thresholds. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates markedly increased serum FSH levels, with normal LH and testosterone levels. Scrotal ultrasound confirms the absence of structural abnormalities. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant associated with Spermatogenic Failure 6, explaining his impaired spermatogenesis. The patient is counseled about his diagnosis and possible fertility preservation methods including testicular sperm extraction and assisted reproduction.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know what\u2019s bothering me or why I decided to come in today. I should explain my main concern, maybe mention the difficulty with having children and how I've been feeling about that. I want to be honest but also a little nervous or confused about explaining everything clearly.\n\nANSWER: Um, hi, I\u2019m 28, and I just, I guess, I\u2019ve been trying to have a baby with my partner for a while now, but it just isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019ve also noticed I feel kind of different lately, like my, uh, libido is lower and I just don\u2019t really feel like myself. I thought I should come see someone about it all."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been a bit more tired than usual, and I don\u2019t know, just kind of down sometimes, like I\u2019m not really motivated or interested in things I used to enjoy. My mood feels all over the place, and I\u2019ve been avoiding thinking about all this stuff too much."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been kind of stressed and a little worried, honestly. It\u2019s hard not to think about everything and wonder what it all means for, you know, my chances or if there\u2019s something I missed. Sometimes I feel pretty down about it, but I also don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m supposed to do next."
