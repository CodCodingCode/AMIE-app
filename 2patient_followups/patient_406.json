    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents to the clinic with primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain that has been worsening over the past six months. She reports normal secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development and pubic hair growth. On physical examination, the external genitalia appear normal, but there is an absence of a palpable vaginal canal upon pelvic exam. An ultrasound reveals a normal uterus and ovaries but no visible vaginal canal. The patient denies any history of sexual activity or trauma. MRI confirms complete vaginal atresia with a functional uterine corpus. Hormonal profile is within normal limits for her age. Surgical intervention is planned for neovagina creation to relieve obstructive symptoms and enable future sexual function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might feel nervous or unsure about explaining her symptoms, but she probably wants to get help for her issues. She might be worried about what\u2019s wrong or embarrassed to talk about her anatomy or discomfort. Her response should reflect her confusion and concern without sounding too confident or specific.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been having a lot of pain down there, like, in my pelvis, especially during certain times. It\u2019s been getting worse over the last few months, and I just don\u2019t really understand why it\u2019s happening or what\u2019s wrong with me."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes it just hurts a lot, especially if I move or sit for too long. It\u2019s worse during certain times, I think, but I don\u2019t really know why. It kind of comes and goes, and I try to ignore it, but it\u2019s been happening more often lately."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s kind of like a dull ache, I think. It\u2019s mostly in my lower belly\u2014like, inside? And sometimes it feels worse, especially when I move around a lot, but I don\u2019t really know why. I haven\u2019t noticed any changes with going to the bathroom or anything like that, but the pain kind of comes and goes, and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s causing it."

    "output": "Um, I\u2019ve just been having this really weird, kind of aching pain?
