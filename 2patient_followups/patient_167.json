I\u2019ve been handling this stuff on my own, just trying to tough it out, and now it feels worse, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting. Still, I can\u2019t ignore how bad it\u2019s gotten.\nANSWER: Well, yeah, I guess I am a bit more short of breath than before, even just walking to the corner. It\u2019s been hard to breathe sometimes, and I don\u2019t know, I just thought I\u2019d get used to it or it\u2019d go away. It\u2019s definitely worse than a couple of weeks ago.",
