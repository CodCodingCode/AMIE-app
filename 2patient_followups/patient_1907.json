    "input": "2. A 45-year-old man presents with a three-month history of worsening dizziness and intermittent blurred vision. He also reports difficulty with balance and frequent falls, which have begun to affect his daily activities. Over the past few weeks, he has experienced episodes of nausea and early morning headaches that improve after vomiting. His wife mentions subtle changes in his speech, including occasional slurring, and recent memory lapses. On examination, there is left-sided limb ataxia and dysarthria, with mild weakness noted in the left hand. Brain MRI reveals a well-demarcated mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere, exhibiting heterogeneous enhancement and moderate surrounding edema. There is no history of trauma, radiation exposure, or prior malignancy. The clinical presentation and imaging findings raise suspicion for a medulloblastoma or metastatic brain tumor, necessitating further diagnostic workup including biopsy and systemic evaluation.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here, so I should explain my symptoms without sounding too technical. I need to mention the dizziness and balance problems but keep it simple and honest. Maybe I should also mention the headaches and memory issues since they seem important but I'm unsure if they matter.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 45, and I\u2019ve been feeling pretty dizzy and off-balance for a few months now. Sometimes I see a little blurry or get headaches in the morning that get better after I throw up. My wife says I\u2019ve been slurring my words and forgetting things more than usual."

    "output": "Um, I think it's been gradually worse, you know? Like, I get dizzy more often and my vision sort of blurs sometimes, especially when I try to focus on stuff. It\u2019s hard to keep my balance now, and I\u2019ve fallen a few times which makes me nervous. It\u2019s kinda messing up my day-to-day stuff, and I feel more tired and off than before."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been getting worse over the past few months, I think. The dizziness and trouble with my balance are just not stopping, and sometimes I feel like my vision blurs out for a bit. The headaches in the mornings are new, and I\u2019ve been feeling sick and a bit foggy, like I forget things or slur words sometimes. I guess I\u2019m pretty worried because everything\u2019s affecting what I can do every day, and I keep falling more."

    "output": "Well, it started maybe three months ago, I think. I just felt kind of dizzy most of the time, and sometimes things looked blurry\u2014like I couldn't see clearly. I\u2019ve been falling more and having trouble keeping my balance, which makes me a bit scared to do things I used to do easily. It\u2019s also like I forget stuff or speak a little funny sometimes, and I just don\u2019t really feel right anymore."

    "output": "Uh, my walking has been really unsteady, kind of like I can't quite keep my balance, but I don't know if it's shuffling or wide or anything specific\u2026 I haven't noticed anything about my bladder, like, going crazy or anything, but the headaches and nausea have been pretty bad, especially in the mornings. I don\u2019t think anyone's said anything about my eyes or pressure stuff, but I feel like my head is always kind of heavy."

    "output": "Um, yeah, sometimes I feel like my feet just won't move right, like they stick or I have to really concentrate to get going. And my walk seems all over the place, kind of wide and shaky. I haven't noticed any sudden urges or accidents, but I do feel like I need to go more often than usual, even if I don\u2019t always make it."
