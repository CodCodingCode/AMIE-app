I\u2019d like to ask a few specific questions to better understand your eye symptoms\u2014when you notice the itching or dryness, do you also see any kind of discharge, like watery or sticky secretion? And has your eye become more red or swollen at all, or do you notice any pain or sensitivity to light? Sometimes these details help us get a clearer picture of what's going on.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed to describe the eye stuff too much, but I want to be honest in case it helps. I\u2019ve noticed my eyes are more itchy sometimes, and a little red when I wake up, but I don\u2019t really see much discharge. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re swollen, though, and I haven\u2019t noticed any pain or sensitivity to light. It\u2019s all pretty mild compared to the stomach issues.\nANSWER: Um, yeah, I guess my eyes feel more itchy and they look a little red in the morning, but I don\u2019t see any gooey stuff or anything. They don\u2019t really hurt or anything, just kinda uncomfortable sometimes.",
