    "input": "1. A 6-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents due to concerns about delayed speech and learning difficulties. He has a history of mild intellectual disability and exhibits hyperactivity, anxiety, and poor eye contact. Physical examination reveals a long face with a prominent jaw, large ears, and macroorchidism. His developmental milestones were notably delayed, particularly in language acquisition and social interaction. Family history is significant for a maternal uncle with similar cognitive challenges. The child also displays repetitive hand-flapping behaviors and sensory hypersensitivity. Genetic testing confirms an expanded CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene consistent with Fragile X syndrome. The family is counseled on supportive therapies, including speech and behavioral interventions.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The parent might be worried about how he's doing with school or behaviors, or maybe he's started acting differently. I should explain that we're concerned about his development and any new or worsening problems. I need to keep it simple and honest, showing that we're here to seek help.\n\nANSWER: Well, he's been a bit more fidgety than usual and sometimes seems really upset or overwhelmed when there's a lot going on. He's also not talking as much as other kids his age, and we're worried because he's been having a rough time learning things and focusing."

    "output": "He gets really upset sometimes, especially when there\u2019s a lot of noise or stuff changing quickly. At home, he likes to flap his hands a lot and can get pretty anxious if things are not how he expects. At school, he seems overwhelmed easily and doesn\u2019t really talk much or make eye contact. Sometimes he gets really frustrated if he can\u2019t do something right away or if he\u2019s asked to sit still for too long."

    "output": "Um, he usually likes to line up his toys and watch the same videos over and over. Sometimes he gets really upset if things change or if he's around loud noises. When he's upset, he starts flapping his hands or crying, and he doesn\u2019t like being touched or moved a lot. He's kind of picky about what he wants to do and can get really anxious."

He doesn\u2019t talk much about how he feels, but he gets kinda anxious or overwhelmed sometimes."

    "output": "He started talking kinda slowly, I think around two or three years old, but honestly, sometimes I feel like he has trouble keeping up or remembering things he used to do, and I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s just him or something else."

But other times, it\u2019s like he gets really upset out of nowhere, and I don\u2019t know what sets him off. Yeah, he gets really fidgety and there's just stuff that seems to bother him more than usual, but I\u2019m not sure what exactly."

But other times, when we try to change his routines or ask him to do something new, he gets really upset or more distracted. Honestly, I can't always tell what helps and what makes him worse."
