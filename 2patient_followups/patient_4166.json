    "input": "1. A 34-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute confusion, auditory hallucinations, and agitation that began two days ago. He has a history of bipolar disorder and recently started a new prescription of high-dose corticosteroids for a severe asthma exacerbation. The patient's family reports he has been increasingly disoriented and paranoid, believing people are conspiring against him. Physical examination reveals tachycardia and mild hypertension, but no fever or focal neurological deficits. Routine labs and a head CT scan are unremarkable. His symptoms are consistent with a drug-induced psychotic disorder secondary to corticosteroid therapy. The treating team decides to taper the steroids cautiously while managing his symptoms with low-dose antipsychotics. Over the following week, the patient's mental status gradually improves, and his hallucinations resolve.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is confused and agitated, so I need to gather what he perceives as his reason for being here without overwhelming him or making him feel judged. I should use simple language and focus on how he's feeling rather than trying to get details about his past or specifics of his condition.\n\nANSWER: I'm not really sure, honestly. I\u2019ve been feeling kind of weird\u2014like I can't think straight or remember things right. And I keep hearing things that don't make sense."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know\u2026 It\u2019s like I hear stuff that no one else hears, and it\u2019s sort of loud or\u2026 weird, like people talking when I\u2019m alone. I feel all jittery and worried, and I just want it to stop, but it\u2019s been making everything feel wrong or really stressful."

    "output": "Um, it all started about two days ago, I think. I just felt really confused and kinda out of it, and then I started hearing things that weren\u2019t there. Nothing seems to make it better or worse, really, I just feel like this has been going on and I don\u2019t know why."

If so, when was the last use? Also, have you noticed any changes in your mood state, like periods of depression or mania, around the time these symptoms began?",
    "output": "Um, I haven't really used anything like that recently, at least I don't think so. I don't really know if what I'm feeling is related to anything like that, but I\u2019ve been feeling kind of up and down, like very weird mood swings or something. It's hard to tell if it\u2019s the same as before or new."
