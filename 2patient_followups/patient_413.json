    "input": "2. A 19-year-old male-to-female transgender patient presents with primary amenorrhea and lack of breast development despite hormonal therapy. The patient reports no spontaneous pubertal changes and notes ongoing fatigue and dry skin. Physical examination shows underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics, including minimal breast tissue and sparse pubic hair. Pelvic ultrasound identifies a small, hypoplastic uterus with bilateral streak ovaries. Laboratory tests reveal markedly elevated serum FSH and LH levels alongside extremely low estradiol. The patient\u2019s karyotype is 46,XX with no chromosomal abnormalities detected. Family history is unremarkable for reproductive disorders or delayed puberty. Genetic analysis confirms a mutation associated with ovarian dysgenesis type 4, explaining the gonadal failure despite hormonal therapy efforts.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young, likely feeling frustrated or worried about not developing normally despite treatment. They might be confused about their body and what\u2019s happening, possibly feeling embarrassed or anxious. I should reassure them lightly while gathering more details about their symptoms.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just feel like, nothing\u2019s really changed, and I don\u2019t know, I still don\u2019t have what I was expecting, like, no breasts or anything, and I\u2019ve been really tired and my skin feels kind of dry, so I thought maybe I should ask about it."

    "output": "Um, I guess I just feel kind of tired all the time, even when I get sleep, and my skin feels really just dry and weird. Sometimes I notice I still don\u2019t see much of any changes like other girls might, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not."
