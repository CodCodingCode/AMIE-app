And how about the sore itself\u2014has it changed in size, appearance, or how it feels when you touch it?\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I think I should tell the doctor everything, but I don't want to sound like I'm overreacting. I just want to get this checked out because it\u2019s been bothering me, but I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll think I\u2019m making a big deal or that it\u2019s something terrible. I also wonder if the swelling has gotten worse or if I should be more scared.\nANSWER: Uh, no, I haven't really noticed any other symptoms like fever or chills. The lymph nodes in my groin do seem a bit more swollen now, and they feel kind of firm, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really tender. The sore itself looks about the same\u2014it's just there, not bigger or anything, and it\u2019s still open, like a little ulcer.",
