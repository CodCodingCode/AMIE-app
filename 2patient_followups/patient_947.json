To help me understand better, could you tell me if when you press on the lump, it goes back in easily, or does it stay out? Also, have you noticed any changes in the skin, like redness, discoloration, or warmth around the area? And just to be sure, have you experienced any sudden worsening of pain, nausea, or fever that might indicate something more serious happening? Your answers will really help me confirm what\u2019s going on and discuss the best next steps.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess the doctor is asking about whether I can push the lump back in or if it stays out, and if there's any redness or warmth or if I feel worse somehow. I\u2019m a little worried they\u2019re looking for signs it\u2019s more serious, like if it\u2019s strangulated or infected, but I\u2019m also just confused\u2014this has been hurting a lot, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s normal anymore.\nANSWER: Well, when I press on it, the lump, it doesn\u2019t seem to go back in, it stays out, and it feels kind of hard and swollen. I did notice some redness around the area yesterday, and it\u2019s warm when I touch it. I haven\u2019t had nausea or fever or anything, but the pain just keeps getting worse, and I\u2019m worried it might get worse after I left work yesterday and did a lot of lifting.",
