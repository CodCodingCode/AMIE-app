Can you tell me if the redness and swelling have stayed the same, gotten worse, or improved at any point? Also, with your systemic symptoms like swelling and fatigue, I want to make sure I understand how recent or persistent these have been, and if there\u2019s been any specific pattern or triggers you've noticed. Lastly, how comfortable are you discussing these symptoms and what you\u2019re worried about? I want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page so I can help you best.\"baseline",

The swelling in my legs and arms is terrible, and I just can\u2019t catch my breath sometimes.",
