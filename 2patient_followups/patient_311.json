I also saw blood in my urine a few times when I went to the bathroom. My mother mentioned that my grandfather had similar issues, so I think it might run in the family. I\u2019ve been feeling a bit worried because the bleeding seems worse than usual and is happening more often.Have you ever had episodes of your joints swelling or hurting, like in your knees or ankles, or experienced blood in your stool or vomit\u2014anything that suggests bleeding into your internal organs\u2014that maybe you haven't talked about before?stoic_minimizer",
