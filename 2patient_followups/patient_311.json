Her fears are evident, so I should prioritize comforting her and explaining what I plan to do next.\nANSWER: I understand you're feeling very frightened and washed out, Mrs. Carter. You've lost a lot of blood and are feeling cold and dizzy\u2014that's very serious. We'll do everything we can to help you, but I need to check on you now and see how we can stop the bleeding and get you back to feeling better.",
