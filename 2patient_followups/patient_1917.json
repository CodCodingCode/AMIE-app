    "input": "2. A 28-year-old man is referred for evaluation of longstanding gastrointestinal symptoms including frequent episodes of severe constipation and early satiety that have progressively worsened over the last two years. He also reports intermittent abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss of 8 kg during this period. Neurological evaluation reveals bilateral ptosis, slowed saccadic eye movements, and mild spasticity in the lower limbs. He mentions difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning his shirt, suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. Blood tests demonstrate persistent lactic acidosis and elevated serum thymidine levels. Brain MRI shows areas of leukoencephalopathy with involvement of the cerebral white matter and cerebellar atrophy. Gastrointestinal manometry reveals impaired colonic and small bowel motility consistent with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Genetic analysis identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in the TYMP gene, establishing the diagnosis of Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalopathy Disease.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should be honest about my symptoms without overloading with details. I want to explain how I've been feeling and what\u2019s been bothering me lately, even if I don't fully understand what it all means. I might feel a bit nervous or embarrassed talking about my issues, so I should keep it simple and straightforward.\n\nANSWER: Um, I'm 28 and a guy. I\u2019ve been having a lot of stomach problems, like I get really full really fast and I keep getting constipated. I also feel like my muscles are weird, and I\u2019ve lost some weight without trying. It\u2019s been going on for a couple of years, and I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Um, honestly, it's been pretty tough. Sometimes I just feel really exhausted and sort of lost, like I can't do the things I used to without a lot of effort. I get frustrated because I never know when the pain or the weird stomach stuff will happen, and it's hard not to feel kind of scared about what\u2019s going to come next."

    "output": "Um, I think the stomach problems kind of come and go, but they seem worse after eating, I guess? Sometimes I feel more tired or just out of it, and I\u2019ve noticed I get a bit more shaky or weird sometimes, especially when the pain or the bloating gets really bad. Nothing really seems to make it better, just... I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like it\u2019s always there."

    "output": "Um, I think I started feeling weird a couple of years ago, and it\u2019s just kinda gotten worse, I guess. Sometimes my stomach really hurts, and I get really tired, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal. I haven\u2019t noticed anything about blood stuff or skin or anything else weird, but maybe I\u2019ve just been too focused on everything else."

    "output": "Um, I don't know if it's really about any specific foods, but sometimes, I just feel worse after I eat maybe a big meal or certain things that feel heavy or greasy, I guess. It's all kind of jumbled in my head."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess my\u2026 my bowels have been pretty weird lately.

I haven't really noticed any nausea or throwing up or that burning stuff in my throat, but I dunno, it's all kind of fuzzy in my head."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I guess so. I\u2019ve been feeling pretty weird and tired, so if there\u2019s something that can help, I\u2019m willing to try it. Just\u2026 I don\u2019t really know what to expect or what I should do."
