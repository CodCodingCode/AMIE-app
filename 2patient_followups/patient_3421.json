    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female reports a 5-year history of increasing difficulty walking due to balance problems and leg stiffness. She describes episodes of muscle spasms and notes clumsiness with tasks like typing and using utensils. Her mother was diagnosed with a hereditary ataxia in her late 40s. On exam, there is marked lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia, and ankle clonus, along with dysdiadochokinesia and a wide-based gait. Sensory testing is normal, but cerebellar signs such as nystagmus and impaired heel-to-shin coordination are present. Brain MRI reveals moderate cerebellar atrophy predominantly affecting the vermis. Electromyography is normal, ruling out peripheral neuropathy. Genetic analysis identifies a SACS gene mutation confirming Spastic Ataxia 4, and she is started on a multidisciplinary rehabilitation plan including physical and occupational therapy.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has a complex neurological history with symptoms that have been gradually worsening, but she might be feeling worried or unsure about what\u2019s happening now. She might also be feeling embarrassed or confused about these ongoing issues. She probably wants reassurance or guidance but can be vague or hesitant in explaining her symptoms.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been having a really hard time walking and I feel kind of unsteady all the time. Sometimes my legs feel really stiff or like I get these strange spasms, and I don\u2019t know, I guess I just want to see if there\u2019s anything that can help or if I should be worried about all this."

    "output": "Um, I think it's been pretty much the same, but sometimes I feel more clumsy than before, and my legs feel stiffer. I haven't really noticed any tremors or anything with my memory or how I think. As for my mood, I guess I\u2019ve been a little more anxious, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or related. No problems with my bladder that I\u2019ve noticed or anything like that."

    "output": "Well, um, everything's kinda gotten harder, I guess. Walking is pretty unsteady sometimes, and I worry about falling, especially if I\u2019m outside or in a crowded place. Dressing can be tricky too, especially putting on socks or shoes \u2014 I feel like my legs don\u2019t cooperate. I\u2019m often tired, and I keep wondering if this will keep getting worse or if there\u2019s something I should be doing differently. Sometimes I feel kind of scared about what this means for my future."

    "output": "Um, yeah, it\u2019s kinda hard sometimes. Like, I get tired really fast when I try to do stuff, even just walking or standing too long. And I feel like I\u2019m more clumsy than before, dropping things or losing my balance more often. I\u2019ve also been feeling a bit more off somehow, like my muscles are more tense or spasming at weird times. It\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t really understand if it\u2019s getting worse or if I should be worried about anything new."

    "output": "Umm, sometimes I feel like my eyes twitch or jump around when I try to look at things. It's kinda hard to keep my gaze steady, especially when I look up or down. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t do what I want them to do sometimes."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I guess my eyes don\u2019t seem as steady as they used to be.
