When you see flashes or zig-zag lines, can you describe exactly what they look like\u2014are they sharp, bright, colorful, or shape-specific? How long do they usually last\u2014just a few seconds or longer? Do they come on suddenly, or do they develop gradually? Also, do these episodes happen during certain times of the day, or when you're under stress or doing something specific? And beyond the visual things, you've mentioned feeling forgetful or worried about your mind\u2014can you tell me if these cognitive issues come along with or separate from your visual symptoms? This will help me understand what might be causing these sensations and how we can best help you.\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about what these flashes and lights mean. They come suddenly, and they\u2019re bright and scary-looking\u2014like sharp shapes or blinding sparks. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my eyes or my mind playing tricks, but they seem to last a few seconds and then disappear. Sometimes I notice them more when I\u2019m tired or stressed, but they happen any time really. And yes, I keep forgetting things all the time, even recent stuff, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s part of the same problem or something worse, like my brain breaking down or something. I just want to understand, but I\u2019m so scared it\u2019s serious.\nANSWER: Well, they come suddenly, like sharp shapes or flashes\u2014bright, maybe colorful, I think\u2014and they last just a few seconds, I guess. Sometimes I see them when I\u2019m tired or stressed, but they happen randomly. And I keep forgetting stuff, like recent things I just did or talked about. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all connected or if I\u2019m losing my mind or what.",
