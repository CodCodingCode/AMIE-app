Well, I\u2019ve just noticed that the iris in my right eye looks a little different \u2014 kind of like there\u2019s a dark spot or maybe a little gap. I don\u2019t remember hitting or injuring it or anything like that. It\u2019s been there for a while, I think... maybe last week, or maybe a little longer, I\u2019m not exactly sure. And I\u2019ve been seeing double or blurry sometimes, especially when I look at bright lights or try to focus on small stuff. It\u2019s kind of been bothering me when I work or drive.

And did you notice right away if it stayed the same or if it seemed to change or get more noticeable over time? Also, when you look at your eye, does that dark area look like a part of your eye\u2019s natural shape, or does it seem different from the other eye? I want to make sure I understand what you're seeing.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed talking about my eye, but I want to be honest. I'm not really sure when I first saw the dark spot \u2014 maybe last week, or was it two weeks ago? \u2014 and I think it\u2019s been changing, or maybe I just noticed it more now. I look at my eye and it kind of looks different from the other one, but I\u2019m not sure if it always looked like that or if I\u2019m just noticing it because of the spot. I\u2019m a bit confused about when everything started and what it all means.\nANSWER: Umm, I think I saw the dark spot maybe last week, but it could have been earlier... or maybe I only just started noticing it more recently. And I don\u2019t know, it kind of looks different from my other eye now, but I\u2019m not sure if it was always like that or if I just never looked closely before.",
