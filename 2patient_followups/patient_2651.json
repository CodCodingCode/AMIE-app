    "input": "2. A 12-year-old girl is referred to the neuromuscular clinic due to progressive proximal muscle weakness that began around age 9, leading to difficulty rising from the floor and climbing stairs. Her family notes mild speech delay and occasional cognitive difficulties at school. On physical exam, she has ptosis, a waddling gait, and scapular winging, along with decreased muscle bulk in her shoulder girdle. Cardiac evaluation reveals mild conduction abnormalities, though echocardiogram remains normal. Serum creatine kinase is elevated at 2,000 U/L. Brain MRI shows subtle white matter changes and mild cerebellar atrophy consistent with a dystroglycanopathy. Muscle biopsy indicates dystrophic muscle changes with reduced alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Genetic sequencing identifies compound heterozygous mutations in the gene associated with Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy, Type a, 8, prompting initiation of a tailored rehabilitation plan and regular cardiac and cognitive monitoring.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, so her answer should sound like she's explaining her feelings and difficulties in a simple, honest way. She might be confused or overwhelmed by the visit, so her response should reflect her emotional state and physical issues without going into medical details.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I feel really tired lately and it\u2019s hard for me to do things like climbing stairs or even getting up from the floor. My arm muscles feel kinda weak, and I\u2019t\u2019s been making school hard too. I was just worried because I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong with me."

    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s been kinda slow, like I started noticing things a few years ago, but it\u2019s gotten worse lately. I don\u2019t really remember any pain or numbness, and I haven\u2019t had any big injuries or anything recently. It\u2019s just been sort of confusing, you know?"

    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s been kinda hard to do stuff like get up off the floor or climb stairs, and I feel tired a lot more than before. Sometimes I notice my face kinda drooping or my hands feeling weak, but I don\u2019t really understand why or when it happens. It\u2019s kinda scary not knowing if it\u2019s gonna get worse or what."

    "output": "Um, well, it's just kind of hard sometimes to do normal stuff like get up from sitting or climb stairs. I get tired really easily, and my muscles feel all weak, like they\u2019re not working right. I don\u2019t really understand why, but it\u2019s making everything feel a little different and kinda scary, I guess. I don\u2019t want things to get worse or for people to make fun of me."

Also, do you experience any difficulty swallowing, speaking, or nasal speech?",
    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes I feel more tired after I do stuff, like climbing stairs or running around, and then I kinda feel better after resting a bit? And, uh, I do notice my voice sounding funny or kinda different sometimes, like I can't speak clearly, but I'm not exactly sure when or why."

Also, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or other sensory changes, or had any facial or neck pain that might suggest a different neurological or muscular issue?",
    "output": "Um, yeah, my eyelids do kind of droop sometimes, like they get heavy and I have to pull them up more. I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling really, but I do feel tired a lot, especially when I run or do stuff like that. I haven't had any pain in my face or neck, though."
