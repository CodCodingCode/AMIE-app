Can you tell me if you've had any specific thoughts about harming yourself\u2014like imagining how you might do it or when you might do something\u2014especially in the past few days? And if so, have you taken any steps toward that, like collecting things or making plans?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: Oh no, I\u2019ve been feeling worse, and I keep thinking about how heavy I feel and if I should just sleep forever. I\u2019m really scared that I might do something terrible if I get too overwhelmed, but I don\u2019t want to admit it out loud because I feel embarrassed and also worried what that means. I don\u2019t really want to admit I\u2019ve thought about hurting myself, but I can\u2019t get those thoughts out of my head sometimes, especially when I\u2019m feeling really hopeless. I just want the doctor to take me seriously because I feel like I might be losing control.\nANSWER: Yes, I\u2019ve had some thoughts like that, like about hurting myself or... or not being here anymore, especially when I feel really awful. I haven\u2019t exactly done anything, but I\u2019ve kind of thought about it and, I guess, I\u2019ve been worried I might do something if it doesn\u2019t get better.",
