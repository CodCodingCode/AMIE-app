Can you tell me exactly how swollen your eye is\u2014is the swelling around the eyelid, or does it look more like bruising? Are you able to open your eye normally, and has your vision been affected\u2014I mean, do you notice any blurry or darkened vision? Have you felt or seen any foreign objects, or do you notice any abrasions or cuts on your eyelids or eye surface? Also, is there any discharge from your eye now, or have you noticed any pus or mucus?

    "output": "THINKING: Oh my goodness, the doctor is asking about my eye, but I\u2019m just so worried about all these terrible symptoms I have\u2014what if this is something really bad like cancer, or I\u2019m going blind? I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s important here, but I don\u2019t want to seem confusing or make things worse.\nANSWER: Um, I honestly haven\u2019t noticed my eye being swollen, but I get a lot of pressure around there, and it hurts sometimes, especially when I try to open it wide. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any discharges or anything like that, and my vision feels the same, no blurry or dark spots, I think. I haven\u2019t seen any cuts or anything on my eyelids either, but I get nervous because my eye feels kind of sore all the time.",
