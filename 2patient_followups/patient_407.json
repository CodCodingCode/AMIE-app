    "input": "2. A 14-year-old girl is referred to the pediatric gynecology clinic for evaluation of lack of menstruation. She has normal breast development and pubic hair consistent with Tanner stage IV but reports monthly lower abdominal cramping. Her parents mention she has never had a vaginal discharge or bleeding. On examination, the external genitalia appear well-developed, but there is no palpable vaginal canal on inspection and digital exam. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a normal-sized uterus with no signs of hematometra, and bilateral ovaries are normal. Laboratory workup reveals normal levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol. An MRI confirms the absence of the vaginal canal with a functional endometrial stripe. The team discusses surgical creation of a neovagina to address her symptoms and future reproductive needs.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain simply what has been bothering me without going into too much detail or sounding worried. I want to make sure the doctor understands I\u2019ve had these problems for a while and I\u2019m a little scared and confused. I shouldn\u2019t try to guess what\u2019s wrong\u2014I just need to describe how I feel.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m here because I haven\u2019t started my period yet, and I\u2019ve been getting cramps in my lower tummy sometimes. My parents say I\u2019ve never noticed any discharge or anything, and I guess I just want to figure out why. It kind of makes me nervous."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of weird sometimes, like, a little off or different from other people. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s anything, but I also get worried about stuff I don\u2019t understand, like what all this means for later."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of weird sometimes, like I don\u2019t really fit in or I\u2019m different from other girls. Sometimes I get sad because I don\u2019t have a period or certain parts, and I worry a lot about what\u2019s wrong with me or if I\u2019ll ever be like everyone else. It\u2019s confusing and kind of embarrassing to talk about."

    "output": "Yeah, I have some breast development, like, they look a bit bigger than before, and I\u2019ve got some pubic hair too, kind of like what I read about in books.
