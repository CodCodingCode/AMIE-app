    "input": "1. A 34-year-old woman presents with progressive difficulty in coordination and balance over the past three years. She reports clumsiness while walking, frequent falls, and slurred speech that has gradually worsened. Her family history reveals her father also experienced similar symptoms starting in his early thirties. Neurological examination shows ataxic gait, dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, and mild intention tremor. She also exhibits mild cognitive slowing and occasional episodes of double vision. MRI of the brain reveals marked cerebellar atrophy predominantly affecting the cerebellar hemispheres. Genetic testing confirms a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the CACNA1G gene, consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 9. Supportive care and physical therapy are initiated to manage her symptoms and improve quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has a neurological condition that has been getting worse, and she seems worried but also unsure what to say. She might struggle to explain her symptoms clearly, so I should encourage her to share her experiences without making her feel judged. I need to be gentle and understanding.\n\nANSWER: Well, um, I guess I've just been feeling more unsteady lately. It's like, I trip over things and can't really control my body like I used to. It's been going on for a few years, and I just feel worried about it."

    "output": "Well, I guess I feel unsteady mostly when I\u2019m walking or standing for a while. Sometimes I stumble or nearly fall, and I get really scared. It\u2019s worse when I\u2019m tired or trying to do more than one thing at once. I haven't really found anything that makes it better\u2014sometimes rest helps, but it doesn\u2019t always. It just kind of happens and then I have to catch myself."
