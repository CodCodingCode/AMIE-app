    "input": "1. A 29-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of progressive headaches and intermittent nausea. He reports recent visual disturbances, including blurred vision and double vision. On examination, there is bilateral papilledema and a mild limitation of upward gaze. He also notes some memory lapses and difficulty concentrating at work. MRI of the brain reveals a well-demarcated, homogenously enhancing mass in the pineal region with obstructive hydrocephalus. Serum and CSF tumor markers, including AFP and beta-HCG, are within normal limits. Endoscopic biopsy confirms the diagnosis of a central nervous system germinoma. The patient is started on radiotherapy and chemotherapy with close neuro-oncological follow-up.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know what made me come in now, so I should explain my symptoms simply and honestly, maybe emphasizing how different or worse they\u2019ve been, since I might feel worried or confused about what\u2019s going on.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m 29, and I\u2019m a guy. I guess I\u2019ve been having these headaches for a couple of months, and they\u2019re getting worse. Sometimes I feel sick and kind of blurry in my eyes, and I\u2019ve noticed I can\u2019t focus or remember things like I used to, which is really weird for me."

    "output": "Um, the headaches are kind of there most of the time but sometimes they get worse, like a really sharp pain, and other times just dull. I\u2019ve also been feeling kind of weird, like sometimes my vision blurs or I see double, and I\u2019ve been forgetful, like I forget things I just did. It\u2019s all kind of jumbled in my head."

    "output": "Um, I think they've been getting worse pretty slowly, like over a few months. Sometimes they feel worse in the mornings or when I bend down, and I wonder if anything helps, but really, nothing seems to make it better, and I just get more worried when they're bad."
