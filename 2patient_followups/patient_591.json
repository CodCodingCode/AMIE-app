To help me understand better, could you tell me exactly how often these episodes of feeling faint or like you're going to pass out happen? For example, are they daily, weekly, or less often? And when they do happen, how long do they usually last\u2014just a few seconds, a minute, or longer? Also, do you notice anything specific that tends to bring them on, like standing up quickly, after eating, or feeling stressed? Knowing these details can really help us figure out the best way to move forward together.\"baseline",

My vision\u2019s all blurry, my hands sometimes tingle, and I\u2019ve lost some weight without trying. I just feel so weak and shaky all the time, and I\u2019m really scared it\u2019s something serious.",
