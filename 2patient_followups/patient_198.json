I\u2019m trying to remember all the details without seeming too out of control, but it\u2019s hard to keep track of everything. I just want to explain it clearly enough for the doctor to help me, even if I don\u2019t fully get it myself.\nANSWER: The hallucinations and seizures happen pretty often now, maybe every day or every other day, and they last a few minutes each time. Sometimes I notice I start feeling really tense or restless just before, and after they\u2019re over, I feel exhausted and scared. I don\u2019t really know what makes them happen more, but they seem worse at night, and I keep seeing shadows or hearing voices even when I know no one\u2019s there.",
