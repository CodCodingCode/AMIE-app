    "input": "1. A 12-year-old male is brought to the clinic due to concerns about learning difficulties and poor school performance since early childhood. He exhibits moderate intellectual disability with limited expressive language and struggles with fine motor coordination. His mother reports a history of brief absence seizures starting around age 5, which have decreased in frequency with medication. On examination, he has mild microcephaly and subtle facial anomalies, including hypertelorism and a flat nasal bridge. There is also evidence of impaired gait and mild hypotonia on neurological assessment. MRI brain imaging shows no significant structural abnormalities. Family history reveals several maternal uncles with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the ARX gene consistent with X-linked mental retardation with or without seizures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young boy, so I need to keep my explanation simple and focus on how he's feeling or what's bothering him. Since he's very young and has developmental issues, he might not understand complicated questions, so I should be gentle and clear. It's also important to mention any specific symptoms he's experiencing now, rather than just past history.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really know how to explain it, but I\u2019ve been feeling kind of different lately. Like, I get upset or tired more than I used to, and sometimes I just feel really weird in my head. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m acting normally, and I don\u2019t know why."

    "output": "Um, mostly, I feel kind of tired, and it\u2019s hard to pay attention sometimes. I get a little frizzy or upset when things don\u2019t work right or when I try to do stuff and it\u2019s too hard. It\u2019s worse when I\u2019m at school or when I have to do something I don\u2019t understand very well. I guess I feel better when I get to rest or do things I like, but I don\u2019t always know why."
