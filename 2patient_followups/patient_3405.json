    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female schoolteacher presents with a three-year history of progressive difficulty maintaining balance and frequent episodes of dizziness. She reports worsening handwriting and occasional swallowing difficulties but denies headaches or sensory disturbances. Her past medical history is unremarkable, and there is no known family history of neurological diseases. On neurological examination, she displays broad-based gait, limb ataxia with impaired coordination on heel-to-shin testing, and mild scanning dysarthria. Eye movement assessment reveals subtle saccadic pursuit abnormalities without nystagmus. Brain MRI shows marked cerebellar cortical atrophy, primarily affecting the posterior lobes. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 16. She is counseled regarding the progressive nature of the disease, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation is arranged to address her mobility and speech challenges.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to describe her symptoms in a way that shows her ongoing issues without sounding overly detailed or clinical. She might feel nervous or uncertain about what to focus on, and it\u2019s important she conveys her concerns clearly but simply.\n\nANSWER: Hi, I\u2019m a bit worried because I\u2019ve been having trouble staying balanced and my dizziness has been worse over the past few years. Sometimes I notice my handwriting getting really messy and I feel like I have a hard time swallowing now."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess everything\u2019s been getting a little worse? I feel more unsteady than before, and I keep dropping things or missing spots when I write. Sometimes I feel really dizzy, like the room spins, and I\u2019ve had a few times where I almost fainted but I don\u2019t know why. I haven\u2019t seen any change in my eyesight, though."

    "output": "It\u2019s been pretty hard to do simple things like writing or even just walking normally, and sometimes I feel really off-balance or dizzy, like I might fall. It\u2019s making me anxious about normal stuff, like go to work or even just moving around at home. And I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more tired and... kind of shaky sometimes, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling a bit more tired than usual, like after teaching all day, but I thought maybe I was just... exhausted. Sometimes I feel a little numb or tingly in my hands too, but I\u2019m probably overthinking it."

Also, have there been any recent brain MRI or blood tests done, and if so, what were the findings?",
    "output": "Um, I haven't really noticed any specific side or anything\u2014I just find some things harder, like buttoning shirts or using utensils, but I can't tell if it's one side or not. About the tests, I think they did some brain scans, and I guess there was some shrinking or whatever in that area at the back? That's all I really remember."
