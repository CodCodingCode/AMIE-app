Is it serious?\"\n- \"I\u2019m really scared I might get worse or something bad happen.\"\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- Shivering and trembling visibly when describing chills\n- Wrapping arms around himself or rubbing his forehead when mentioning headache or fever\n- Fidgeting or shifting uncomfortably in the chair, showing discomfort\n- Occasionally grimacing or showing signs of fatigue, like slumping or closing eyes briefly\n- Slightly clenched fists or restless movements indicating distress\n---\n**INFORMATION FLOW:**\n**VOLUNTEER IMMEDIATELY:**\n- \"I started feeling sick four days ago with fever and chills. It\u2019s just gotten worse since then.\"\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \"I work in the forest, near monkey habitats, so I guess I might have been bitten by a mosquito carrying the parasite.\"\n- \"I\u2019ve never had malaria\"Based on what you've shared, I want to make sure I understand the timing and severity of your symptoms: can you tell me more specifically when you first noticed the fever and chills\u2014was it about four days ago, or could it have been earlier? Also, how quickly did your eye symptoms\u2014like redness, swelling, or soreness\u2014develop in relation to the systemic symptoms? Have you experienced any new symptoms, like severe headache, neck stiffness, or changes in how you see or feel? And throughout this time, have you noticed anything else unusual, like dizziness, weakness, or confusion that might suggest your condition is affecting your nervous system?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to answer honestly, but I keep getting muddled about when stuff happened, and it\u2019s all just overwhelming. I think I started feeling sick about four days ago, but maybe it was sooner? The chills, then the fever, and now the headache\u2014it's all kind of jumbling in my mind. I don\u2019t remember exactly how fast things got worse, and I\u2019m really worried about the eye part and if I\u2019m seeing or feeling anything weird now. I just want help because I feel so terrible.\nANSWER: Uh, I think it was about four days ago when I started feeling sick with the fever and chills, but maybe it was earlier? The head pains and everything have been getting worse, and I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019ve also felt a bit dizzy now and then, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s part of it or not.",
