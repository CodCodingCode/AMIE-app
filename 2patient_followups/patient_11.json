There\u2019s been this thick, yellowish stuff coming out, and it\u2019s kind of bleeding a little after I go to the bathroom. It\u2019s been getting worse over the last few days, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. Do you think it could be something serious or an infection?",

    "output": "THINKING: I'm feeling pretty uncomfortable sitting here, and my stomach feels a bit tense.

I noticed some itching around my butt and this thick yellowish stuff coming out, kinda sticky. Sometimes I see a little bit of blood after I go to the bathroom, and now there\u2019s some swelling and pain when I sit or walk. It\u2019s definitely worse today than at first. I dunno, I feel a little feverish or something, and honestly, I\u2019m worried it\u2019s something serious, like an infection or an STI. Do you think I need antibiotics? Will this go away by itself?

I want to get help but also feel embarrassed talking about my bottom area, so I\u2019ll try to be honest but a little shy.\n\nANSWER: Yeah, um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling this itchy, burning kind of feeling down there, and there\u2019s this thick, yellowish stuff coming out. Sometimes it kind of feels like it\u2019s bleeding a little after I go to the bathroom. It\u2019s been a few days, and it\u2019s gotten worse \u2014 now there\u2019s some swelling and it hurts to sit or even walk properly.
