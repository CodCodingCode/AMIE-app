    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain clearly but also try not to sound overly worried, even though inside I\u2019m pretty scared. I want to tell him everything, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting. I\u2019ve had this bump for a couple of weeks now, and it\u2019s really growing fast, so I should mention that. I also want to say I\u2019ve been putting this off because I thought it might go away on its own or wasn\u2019t a big deal, but now it\u2019s just worse. Maybe he\u2019ll think I\u2019m overthinking it, but I really am worried it\u2019s something serious or could turn bad. I need to be honest and straightforward, even if I sound nervous.\nANSWER: Hi, um, I\u2019m really worried about this thing on my lip. It just kinda appeared out of nowhere, and it\u2019s been growing a lot in the last couple of weeks. It started small, like a pea, but now it\u2019s pretty big, and it\u2019s really tender. Sometimes it bleeds just from brushing my teeth or touching it. I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s gotten worse, and I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at first, but it\u2019s gotten so big and painful, and I\u2019m honestly scared it might be something serious.",
