Also, have you noticed any pain, sensitivity to light, or any discharge, like mucus or pus, coming from your eye? And depending on how it started, did anything else happen around that time, like being around others with similar symptoms or exposure to dust or chemicals?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he's asking about my eye now, and I think I remember or maybe I don\u2019t something about it but not quite sure. Did it get worse or better? I feel a little lost trying to keep track of that, especially since everything's been happening so fast. I don\u2019t want to forget anything important or seem silly, but honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.\nANSWER: Uh, I think it was maybe yesterday or the day before that my eye started to get a little red and a bit teary, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse or not. It\u2019s still kind of the same, I guess. I don\u2019t really notice any pain or sensitivity, and I haven\u2019t seen any mucus or pus, just the teariness and redness. I don\u2019t remember being around anyone with similar eye issues or anything like chemicals or dust lately.",
