    "input": "1. A 3-year-old male is brought to the pediatric neurology clinic due to delayed developmental milestones and difficulty with coordination. His parents report that he has not started walking independently and has poor eye contact. On examination, hypotonia and mild intellectual disability are noted, along with micropenis and hypospadias. Brain MRI reveals complete agenesis of the corpus callosum with colpocephaly. The child also exhibits partial seizures controlled with medication. Family history is unremarkable for neurodevelopmental disorders. Endocrine evaluation shows normal cortisol but borderline low testosterone levels for age. Multidisciplinary management including physical therapy, endocrinology, and neurodevelopmental specialists is initiated.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I'm here today, so I should try to explain what\u2019s been bothering me or what\u2019s not right. I might feel nervous or unsure about how much to say, but I need to share what I\u2019m experiencing, even if I don\u2019t fully understand it myself. I should keep it simple and honest, focusing on what\u2019s been different or hard lately.\n\nANSWER: I guess I just feel kind of... different, and I can't really do things like other kids. I get tired easily and don\u2019t seem to pay much attention sometimes. My parents said I\u2019m not walking or talking like I should, so they brought me here."

    "output": "Um, he doesn't really look at us much or play like other kids do. He seems to get upset or overwhelmed sometimes, especially with new things or people. He likes sitting quietly and watching things, but I\u2019m not sure what he enjoys exactly, or if he finds anything fun."

    "output": "Um, well, he\u2019s usually kind of slow with stuff and doesn\u2019t really do things like other kids, but sometimes he gets really fixated on certain toys or sounds, and that seems to make him kind of happy or calm. But then, if something changes suddenly or if he's tired, he gets upset pretty easily, and I don\u2019t always know why. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell what he\u2019s thinking or feeling most of the time."

    "output": "He mostly just kind of flips between different things, but sometimes he gets really upset when there's too much noise or too many people around. He seems pretty confused a lot of the time, and I notice he doesn't really like trying to do stuff on his own."

    "output": "Um, he doesn\u2019t really point or wave much, and sometimes he looks at us but doesn\u2019t seem to follow simple things like, \"Come here\" so well. When he's upset or hungry, he makes noises or moves around but can\u2019t really tell us what he wants, and it feels a little confusing to figure out what he\u2019s trying to say."

    "output": "Yeah, I think that might help a little, but I just worry about making things worse or upsetting him more. I don\u2019t really know how to do it right."
