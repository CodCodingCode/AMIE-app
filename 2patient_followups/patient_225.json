Can we go over a few specific details? Are these hallucinations loud voices or quiet? Do they usually happen at certain times, like when you're feeling stressed or alone? And when you see shadows or figures, can you describe what they look like or how real they seem to you? Also, do you notice if these experiences happen all the time or just now and then? Understanding these aspects will really help me get a clearer picture of what you're going through.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to follow the doctor\u2019s questions, but my mind is racing and I get confused easily. I want to answer honestly but I also feel overwhelmed and unsure about what parts are important. I keep thinking about how scared I am and that I just want it to stop.\nANSWER: Um, the voices\u2026 they\u2019re loud sometimes, I guess. They tell me I\u2019m dangerous or that I should hurt myself. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re always there, but I hear them mostly when I\u2019m alone or maybe when I\u2019m really stressed. And the shadows, they move quick, like people watching me or, I don\u2019t know, hiding. It feels real, like I could reach out and touch them, but I know I shouldn\u2019t trust what I see. It\u2019s like, sometimes they just come out of nowhere and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m imagining it all or if it\u2019s really happening.",
