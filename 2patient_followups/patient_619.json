    "output": "THINKING: He's asking about how it looks now, but honestly, I don't really know how to describe it well. I just know it\u2019s bigger and uglier than when it started, and I feel so worried about what he\u2019ll see. I\u2019m also nervous because I felt a little something hard around it when I was changing my clothes earlier, but I wasn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s normal or not.\nANSWER: Well, it\u2019s like this sore got bigger and more ulcerated, I guess, and it\u2019s still open and bleeding. I can\u2019t really see everything clearly down there, but I feel a hard spot or lump around it, and it\u2019s kind of sore when I sit or walk, especially if I move the wrong way. And I think the skin around it is a little swollen, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or what.",
