    "input": "2. A 7-year-old girl comes to the neurology clinic with a visible, soft swelling on her upper back at around the T3 level, noticed soon after birth but recently increasing in size and redness. Her parents report difficulty with walking, frequent tripping, and reduced sensation in her legs, alongside occasional muscle spasms. She also has chronic constipation and urinary urgency, indicating possible neurogenic bladder dysfunction. On examination, there is a cystic sac covered by thin, friable skin, with decreased lower limb strength and reduced proprioception bilaterally below the lesion. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk in the legs with clonus, and she has a positive Babinski reflex. MRI reveals a defect in the posterior elements of the upper thoracic spine with herniation of spinal cord and meninges through the vertebral defect consistent with upper thoracic spina bifida aperta. The child was born at term, and prenatal ultrasounds did not identify the lesion. Surgical closure of the defect is scheduled urgently to reduce infection risk, alongside initiation of physiotherapy and urological management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly but simply, feeling a bit worried and overwhelmed, especially since this is all new and kind of confusing for me. I want to be honest but also not scare the doctor too much, so I will mention what I notice and how I feel physically and emotionally.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m here because I have this bump on my back that\u2019s gotten a little bigger and red lately. I also feel like I can\u2019t walk properly anymore, and my legs sometimes feel funny or weak, and I trip a lot. Sometimes I feel something in my tummy and wanna go to the bathroom suddenly."

    "output": "Um, well, she\u2019s had the swelling on her back since she was little, but it\u2019s been getting bigger and more red lately. She\u2019s been tripping more and having trouble walking, and she sometimes feels numb in her legs. I\u2019m really worried because she also has trouble with going to the bathroom and constipation. It\u2019s been like this for a while, but it feels like it\u2019s worse now. Sometimes she has muscle spasms, and I just feel scared about what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, I feel kinda funny in my legs sometimes, like they get really heavy or tingly, and it's hard to walk straight or tripping a lot. When I try to run or play for a long time, I get more tired and my legs feel worse. Sometimes, I just can't feel things in my feet properly, and that makes me nervous."

    "output": "Um, I think I trip a lot when I walk, and sometimes I feel like I can't keep my legs steady, like they\u2019re not really following me. My bladder feels like it's urgent a lot, and I have to go more often, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like I can control it. I\u2019ve noticed that when I sit for a long time or try to run, it gets worse. Nothing really makes it better, but I guess lying down for a bit sometimes helps, I don\u2019t know."
