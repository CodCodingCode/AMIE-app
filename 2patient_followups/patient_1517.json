    "input": "1. A 6-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department with increasing respiratory distress and a persistent high-pitched breathing noise noted since birth. His parents report that his stridor worsens particularly during feeding and when he has upper respiratory infections. He has exhibited poor weight gain, likely due to difficulty coordinating breathing and swallowing. Physical examination reveals biphasic stridor, intercostal and suprasternal retractions, and mild cyanosis during episodes of coughing. There is no history of prematurity, intubation, or trauma, suggesting a congenital airway anomaly. Flexible bronchoscopy confirms a circumferential narrowing of the subglottic airway consistent with congenital subglottic stenosis. Chest X-ray is unremarkable aside from a narrowed subglottic space, with normal lung fields. The patient is admitted for airway stabilization and evaluation by pediatric otolaryngology for possible endoscopic dilation or open reconstructive surgery.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain what\u2019s been going on without sounding too worried or confusing. I should mention the breathing and feeding issues, but keep it simple and honest. I want to tell the doctor my little one is having trouble and it\u2019s been bothering us.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m here because my baby, he\u2019s been having trouble breathing and making that strange noise since he was born. It gets worse when he eats or has a cold, and he\u2019s not gaining weight like he should. We\u2019re really worried because it seems like he\u2019s struggling more than before."

    "output": "Well, I think he\u2019s been like this since he was born, but I didn\u2019t really know what to think at first. It just kind of sounded different, and lately, it seems worse when he\u2019s eating or if he\u2019s got a cold or something. Sometimes it\u2019s okay, but other times he really struggles to breathe, and I just get really scared trying to figure out what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, his breathing seems worse sometimes, especially when he's crying or drinking milk. I think it gets harder to breathe when he's coughing or trying to swallow, and I feel scared because it sounds really loud and his face turns different colors sometimes."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s hard for him to swallow sometimes. He actually coughs a lot when he eats, and I\u2019ve noticed he chokes or gags pretty often. He also drools more than other babies, I think. It\u2019s been making feeding pretty stressful."

    "output": "Well, I guess he seems a little fussy sometimes or tired more than usual, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not. Sometimes he makes strange noises or doesn\u2019t seem to wake up easily. It\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s normal for him."

    "output": "Yes, sometimes his face looks a little more blue or sometimes he seems pale, especially when he\u2019s struggling to breathe or coughing a lot. I get worried because he doesn\u2019t look right, and I wonder if it\u2019s bad or if it will get worse."

    "output": "It\u2019s like a really loud, high squealing kind of noise whenever he tries to breathe, especially when he\u2019s crying or eating. It\u2019s kind of sharp and doesn\u2019t go away, and it sounds worse sometimes than others."

    "output": "Um, yeah, sometimes his lips look like they\u2019re a little bluer than normal, especially when he\u2019s coughing or crying hard. It kind of freaks me out, honestly."

    "output": "Yeah, um, it seems like when he's lying flat or crying really hard, he sounds worse, and I think he struggles more then. Sometimes, holding him upright seems to help a little, but I\u2019m not totally sure if it makes it better or just different."
