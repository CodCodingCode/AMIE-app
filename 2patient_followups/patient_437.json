To help me better understand these periods when you feel more energetic or impulsive, can you describe in more detail what you're experiencing during those times? For example, do you notice specific thoughts, feelings, or behaviors\u2014like taking risks, acting differently, or feeling confident\u2014that stand out? And during these episodes, do you sometimes find it hard to control what you do, or do your symptoms overlap with periods when you're feeling more down or tired? Knowing these details will help us get a clearer picture of what your mood and energy swings look like over time.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I don\u2019t want to overstate things, but this feels really intense now. I\u2019ve been putting it off, but maybe I should talk about how I feel when I get those crazy energy moments\u2014they\u2019re kind of scary, and I don\u2019t really understand why I act different. I just want to make sure it\u2019s not anything worse.\nANSWER: Well, like, sometimes I feel super confident and restless, like I can\u2019t sit still, and I end up doing stuff without thinking\u2014buying stuff, or saying things I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t really control myself, but then later I feel really down and hopeless, and it all kinda blurs together.",
