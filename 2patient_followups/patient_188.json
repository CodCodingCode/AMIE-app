Details about whether the patient has experienced episodes of dizziness, fainting, or near-fainting spells, and how his fatigue and shortness of breath are affecting his ability to perform daily activities. - Which of my leading diagnoses would this question help distinguish? It would help distinguish between heart failure (which may cause significant functional impairment and syncope) and conditions like PE or panic attack (often associated with acute distress but less impact on daily functioning), as well as revealing signs of hemodynamic compromise. - How should I adapt my communication for this patient's style? Use a soft, non-judgmental tone, emphasizing curiosity and support, and frame the question to feel safe, such as, \"Sometimes when people feel very short of breath or tired, they might also feel dizzy or like they might pass out. Have you noticed anything like that happening to you?\"stoic_minimizer",
