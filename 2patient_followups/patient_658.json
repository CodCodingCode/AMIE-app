I want to mention my eye problem because it feels important and maybe related, but I also worry about sounding overly anxious or confusing. I need to be honest about my symptoms but keep it simple so the doctor understands I\u2019m concerned about both the bumps and my vision.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m a 52-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve got these strange bumps on my arm that just won\u2019t go away. They started as small, dark spots but now they\u2019re swollen and tender, and they sometimes itch and feel warm, especially at night. I also recently noticed that my vision in one eye seems blurry, which is worrying me. I guess I came in because I\u2019m scared it might be something serious or contagious, and I really don\u2019t know what's wrong.",
