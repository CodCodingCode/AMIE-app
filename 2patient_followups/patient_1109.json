Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your vision, like blurriness or flashes, or if there\u2019s any pain when you blink or move your eye? Also, have you seen any kind of discharge, like pus or mucus, coming from your eye? Thinking back to when your symptoms began, was there anything specific that happened during the soccer game\u2014like a direct hit or bump\u2014that you think might have caused this? Finally, have you experienced any new or worsening symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or additional dizziness since the injury?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, the doctor is asking about my eye now? That's strange because I barely even thought about my eye with all this pain I\u2019ve got in the chest and belly. I guess I should say something, but honestly, my eyes have been kind of bothering me too lately, like I see some floaters and maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was just my glasses or if that\u2019s relevant. I also remember, just a few hours before the pain started, I was sitting in my chair and my grandson was over, watching that football game, and he accidentally bumped my arm really hard\u2014like a rough tackle\u2014and I felt a jolt then, but I thought it was just a bruise or something. But it\u2019s all kind of jumbling in my head now because everything hurts and I feel like I\u2019m losing control of it all.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
