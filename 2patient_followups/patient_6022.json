    "input": "1. A 32-year-old female presented to the neurology clinic with episodes of brief loss of awareness and involuntary jerking movements that consistently occurred while she was eating. She described the episodes as sudden and lasting about 10 to 20 seconds, predominantly affecting her right arm and face. Her medical history was unremarkable except for mild anxiety. Neurological examination between episodes was normal, and there were no signs of focal deficits. She reported that these events started approximately three months ago and seemed to be triggered almost exclusively by chewing or swallowing. An EEG performed during a meal revealed epileptiform discharges localized to the left temporal lobe. MRI brain imaging was unremarkable, ruling out structural lesions. Based on her clinical presentation and EEG findings, a diagnosis of eating reflex epilepsy was made, and she was started on carbamazepine with marked reduction in seizure frequency.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain what\u2019s been happening without overdoing it. I want to be honest about how I feel but also not get into too many details. I might also mention my worry or if I\u2019m scared about what it could be.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 32-year-old woman, and I guess I just feel really strange when I eat. I\u2019ve been having these quick episodes where I sort of lose awareness and my arm and face jerk a little, especially when I\u2019m chewing or swallowing. It\u2019s been going on for a few months now, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on with me."

    "output": "Well, before it happens, I don\u2019t really notice anything special, but maybe I feel kind of tense or almost like a little flutter in my head. During the episode, everything behind my eyes feels strange\u2014like I\u2019m sort of disconnected, and I can\u2019t really control my arm or face. It\u2019s sudden and really brief, but I feel kind of stuck, and I keep trying to stop it but I can\u2019t, and then it\u2019s over. Afterward, I feel really shaky and kind of tired, and I worry if I did something wrong. Sometimes I get a little scared, and I wonder if it\u2019s happening again or if I\u2019ll feel okay."

    "output": "Well, um, I think I notice a weird feeling coming over me, like maybe my face and arm kind of twitch or tense up, and I get really focused on chewing or swallowing. During the episode, everything then feels like it just kind of goes blackout or I forget where I am for a moment, and I can't really control it. After, I usually feel sort of shaky or out of it, and sometimes a little embarrassed, like I lost track of time or what I was doing. It makes me nervous to eat in front of people or even just go about my day, because I never know when it will happen again."

    "output": "Um, I guess I feel kind of scared when it happens because I don't really understand what\u2019s going on, and afterward I feel tired and a little bit upset, like I\u2019m confused. I also notice that it mostly happens when I try to eat or swallow, but I don\u2019t really know what makes it worse or better."

    "output": "Honestly, I don\u2019t really notice anything specific right before it happens. Sometimes I just feel kind of tense or nervous, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just me overthinking, or if it\u2019s actually related. Like, I don\u2019t get any strange feelings in my head or anything obvious."

    "output": "Um, I think I did have some kind of test, a brain thing I think they did while I was eating, but I don\u2019t really remember all the details. It was maybe to check my brain?"

Also, do your episodes happen in any particular setting or situation, such as when you're stressed or relaxed?",
    "output": "Um, I mostly notice these things when I\u2019m eating or swallowing, like it\u2019s only happening then, really. Sometimes I wonder if they could happen in other times, but I don\u2019t really remember ever having them when I\u2019m just relaxed or not doing anything. It\u2019s mostly during those times, but I don\u2019t know if stress or anything makes it worse or not."

    "output": "Yeah, they do feel pretty similar each time, like the same kind of sudden thing that just happens out of nowhere, and I guess I\u2019m a little scared because I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening, but if these pills can help, I hope that\u2019s true."
