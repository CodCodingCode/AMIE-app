I feel like the pain is worse when I move or try to concentrate, and I\u2019ve had to lie down in a dark, quiet room. I\u2019ve experienced similar episodes a few times in the past, often around my menstrual cycle, but this one feels particularly severe.",

I should mention how bad it is and how it\u2019s different or worse than before, especially since it\nANSWER: I\u2019m 28, and I\u2019m a woman. Yesterday afternoon, I suddenly started seeing flashing lights and zigzags, like I was seeing weird shapes. Then, I got this really bad, throbbing pain on the right side of my head, and it\u2019s been making me feel really sick \u2014 like I want to throw up. It\u2019s been hard to be in bright or noisy places, and the pain gets worse if I try to move or think too much. It\u2019s been pretty intense, way worse than my usual headaches.",
