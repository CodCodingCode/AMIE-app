I don\u2019t really understand all the medical stuff, but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m getting worse and I don\u2019t want to be really sick or dehydrated. I hope the doctor can figure out what\u2019s wrong quickly.\nANSWER: Well, I haven\u2019t been able to pee much today, maybe just a little when I go, and I do feel really dizzy when I stand up. My mouth feels super dry, and I just feel so tired, kind of like I might pass out if I don\u2019t sit down.",
