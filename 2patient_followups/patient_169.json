    "output": "THINKING: I'm confused and worried about all these symptoms, especially the vomiting of blood and weight loss. I feel overwhelmed and scared that it's something very serious and I don't really understand what\u2019s happening or what to do next.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve vomited blood twice now, and it\u2019s been a small amount each time, but I\u2019m not sure how often it\u2019s happened exactly\u2014I guess a few times over the last week. I\u2019ve been drinking pretty heavily\u2014mostly beer and whiskey\u2014just about every day. All this stuff makes me feel more anxious and kind of helpless, like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next or if I\u2019ll get worse.",
