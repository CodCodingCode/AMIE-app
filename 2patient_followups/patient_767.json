Can you tell me more about what happens during your seizures\u2014like what you notice just before they start, what you feel or see during the episode, and how you feel afterwards? Also, have you noticed if these episodes are becoming more frequent or longer over time, or if they happen differently after you've been active or tired? Sometimes, people don\u2019t remember all the details, so I want to hear everything you can tell me, even if it feels small or hard to describe.\"baseline",

I just want her to fix me or make it stop.\nANSWER: I don\u2019t really remember what happens before, but I feel funny and my eyes go weird during the seizures. After, I feel tired and sometimes I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore.",
