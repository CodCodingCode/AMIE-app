I spend a lot of time outdoors gardening and have had several sunburns over the years, especially on my arms. I don\u2019t remember any trauma to the area, but I\u2019ve been feeling a little more tired lately. I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s changing quickly and looks quite different from my other skin spots.",

Well, I noticed this shiny, pinkish bump on my forearm about two weeks ago, and it\u2019s really grown since then. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but it feels firm and odd, sort of irregular on both sides. I\u2019ve been outdoor a lot, gardening and stuff, and I\u2019ve had some sunburns over the years. I just feel a bit more tired than usual, and I\u2019m worried because this thing looks different from my other skin spots, and it\u2019s changing pretty quickly.",
