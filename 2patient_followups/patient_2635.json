    "input": "1. A 6-month-old male infant is brought in due to persistent failure to thrive and frequent episodes of hypoglycemia despite regular feeding. His parents also note poor head control and limited social smiling compared to his older siblings. On examination, the infant demonstrates marked axial hypotonia and bilateral inverted nipples, along with prominent fat pads over the suprapubic area. Laboratory tests reveal mild transaminase elevation and prolonged coagulation times. An electroretinogram detects early retinal dysfunction without overt vision loss. Brain MRI shows mild cerebellar atrophy and delayed myelination patterns. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant in the SRD5A3 gene confirming Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Type Ir. The patient is enrolled in a multidisciplinary care program focusing on metabolic stabilization and developmental support.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The question is simple, but I might be feeling a bit scared or overwhelmed about explaining all the weird things happening with my baby. I need to tell the doctor what's been concerning us without sounding like we're overreacting or missing something important.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess we're here because he just hasn't been gaining weight like he should, and he gets really tired or giddy sometimes. He's also not doing the things other babies his age usually do, like smiling or holding his head up well."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s been feeding okay sometimes, but other times he just doesn't seem interested. He doesn\u2019t really play or smile much like the other babies did at this age, and I think he\u2019s sometimes really sleepy or fussy without any clear reason."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been, um, kind of fussy sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t seem to sleep very well. He also doesn\u2019t eat as much as before, and I feel like he\u2019s very floppy most of the time, like he\u2019s not holding his head up right. Sometimes, he just doesn\u2019t react or seem interested in stuff, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal."

    "output": "Um, he used to look at us and react when we made noises or showed him toys, but lately, he kind of just stares blankly sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t seem to turn towards sounds or smiles like before. I\u2019m worried he\u2019s not responding the same way anymore."

    "output": "Uh, no, I don't think so. Nothing unusual that I remember during the delivery. No problems with oxygen or anything like that."

    "output": "No, I don't think so. I don\u2019t really remember anything like that before he was born, and I don\u2019t think there were any issues during pregnancy, but I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to that stuff."

    "output": "Well, he sometimes makes these strange eye movements like he's staring or maybe looking around weird, but I don't really know if that's supposed to be normal or not. He hasn't had any sudden jolts or anything like that, but sometimes he seems to jerk a little or his eyes move funny when he's tired or upset."

    "output": "Um, well, he sometimes looks a bit weird when he moves his eyes, like they don\u2019t always seem to follow right, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new. His muscle tone still feels pretty weak, and he doesn\u2019t really respond much to us sometimes, even if we call his name or try to get his attention. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s changed or if it\u2019s always been like that."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes he seems a bit stare-y, like he's looking at things but not really following them properly, I think? And his muscles, they seem really floppy\u2014like, I don't know, weaker than I expected? He's not really responding much when we call his name or try to get his attention, so I guess that worries me a little."
