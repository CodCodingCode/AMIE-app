I think I was a little stressed because work\u2019s been hectic, and then I remembered I\u2019ve had similar wheezing before, but never like this. Maybe the cigarette smoke from the neighbors I mentioned, I guess? I don\u2019t know, it just kind of all hit me suddenly, and now I\u2019m worried I might need that emergency shot or something.\nANSWER: Well, it started kinda out of nowhere, like a couple hours ago, when I was just sitting at my desk at work, and I felt this really tight feeling in my chest and wheezing, like all of a sudden, everything was closing in. I was just thinking about how busy the day has been\u2014my boss always has me running around\u2014and then I got this tickle in my throat, but then it just got worse. I\u2019ve had coughs before when I had colds, but this feels much more intense, and I keep thinking about my mom\u2019s asthma when she was sick, but she never had an attack like this either. It\u2019s just so sudden, and I\u2019m really scared I won\u2019t be able to breathe at all.",

To make sure I understand the situation fully, can you tell me whether your eye symptoms\u2014like redness, tearing, or itching\u2014have been worsening or if they\u2019re quite uncomfortable now?

    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he\u2019s asking about my eyes and if they\u2019re bad or bothering me, but honestly, I haven\u2019t noticed much with my eyes except maybe they\u2019re watering a bit because I\u2019ve been so worried. I guess it's all feeling *really* intense, especially with this wheezing and tightness, and now I\u2019m worried maybe my face or lips might turn blue, though I haven\u2019t looked really close. I did try to breathe in deep just now, but it didn\u2019t help much, and I\u2019ve been holding my inhaler in my bag but I haven't used it yet \u2014 I think I feel worse than any cold I\u2019ve ever had.\nANSWER: No, my eyes aren\u2019t bothering me or anything like that. I think my mouth might feel a little numb, but I don\u2019t really know; I\u2019ve been so focused on trying to breathe and not passing out, honestly. I haven\u2019t really looked for blue around my lips, but I feel like I\u2019m running out of air fast, and I\u2019ve not taken that inhaler because I\u2019m scared it won\u2019t help and I just need to breathe.",
