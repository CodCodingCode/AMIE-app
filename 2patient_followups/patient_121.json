Also, have you noticed if there\u2019s any sticky or goopy stuff in your eye, especially in the mornings or during the day? And about how bad your eye feels\u2014does it hurt a little, or does it feel really sore or painful? Has this changed at all since you first felt sick? Lastly, have your other symptoms, like feeling warm or tired, gotten worse or stayed the same?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he\u2019s asking about my eye, but I don\u2019t really know what \u201ckinda funny\u201d means. My eye\u2019s been bothering me on and off, like it\u2019s all itchy and kinda sticky sometimes, especially when I wake up. I think it\u2019s more red now\u2014like a bright red, and it feels weird, like it\u2019s all puffy around the edges, but it might be because I\u2019ve been rubbing it a lot and crying a little. My eye feels sore, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worse than before or if it\u2019s just the same. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s gotten better or worse because my head and my mouth still hurt, and I\u2019ve been super tired all day.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
