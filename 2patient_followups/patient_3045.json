    "input": "2. A 45-year-old woman presents with a six-week history of worsening headaches localized to the occipital region, accompanied by intermittent blurred vision and episodes of vomiting. She reports recent difficulty with balance and mild dizziness when walking, which her family has also noticed. On neurological examination, there is a mild ataxic gait and nystagmus on lateral gaze. MRI of the brain reveals a well-demarcated intraventricular mass adjacent to the fourth ventricle with heterogeneous contrast enhancement and evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus. No signs of metastasis are apparent on imaging. Routine blood work is unremarkable, and lumbar puncture is deferred due to increased intracranial pressure concerns. The patient has no prior history of neurological disorders and is otherwise healthy. Neurosurgical evaluation is initiated for tumor resection and stabilization of cerebrospinal fluid flow.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should explain that I\u2019ve been having these headaches for quite some time and they\u2019re getting worse, especially at the back of my head. I also feel blurry sometimes and I\u2019ve been getting threw up a lot and feeling kind of dizzy, like I might fall. I want to tell the doctor what\u2019s been happening without sounding too alarmed or confusing.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 45-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve been having these bad headaches for about six weeks now, and they seem to be getting worse. Sometimes I see blurry things and I\u2019ve been throwing up a few times, and I feel really off-balance when I walk or stand. It\u2019s been making me pretty scared, to be honest."

    "output": "Well, at first, I thought it was just a typical headache, you know? But then, over these weeks, it\u2019s gotten worse, more intense sometimes, especially in the back of my head. Sometimes the pain sort of comes in waves, and I\u2019ve noticed that when I bend over or strain a little, it feels worse. It doesn\u2019t really seem to get better with rest or anything, and I\u2019ve been feeling a bit dizzy and kind of off-balance, which is new for me."

    "output": "Well, at first, it just felt like a little nagging headache, kind of behind my eyes, but then it just kept coming back and got worse. Sometimes, I feel queasy and start to vomit, and it\u2019s worse when I move my head or if I stand up too fast. I\u2019ve noticed I get a little dizzy, especially when I try to walk or turn my head, and it\u2019s harder to keep my balance now. Nothing specific seems to trigger it, and resting doesn\u2019t really seem to help much."

    "output": "Well, I dunno, sometimes I feel like my head is really heavy, and my vision gets even more weird, kinda like flickering or spots. I haven't noticed anything about talking or numbness really, but I guess I've been more tired and a little more off-balance than before."
