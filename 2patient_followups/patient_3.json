Also, have you had any recent infections, like sore throats, colds, or skin issues, especially around the time your symptoms worsened? And regarding your eye redness and swelling, did they start after a particular activity or event, or have you experienced similar eye problems in the past?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I guess I should answer honestly, but I\u2019m a bit confused about what\u2019s important. I had some slight swelling before, but not like this, and I\u2019ve never really paid much attention to urinary changes. It does make me wonder if it\u2019s linked to some cold or sore throat I had a while ago, though I don\u2019t remember any big infections recently, just the usual stuff with the kids. My eye swelling came on really suddenly and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related or if I just messed up my contact lenses or something.\nANSWER: Well, I think I have had some minor swelling before, like maybe in my ankles sometimes, but it never looked like it does now, and I don\u2019t really remember having blood in my urine before\u2014just a little sometimes, but now it looks really dark. I actually don\u2019t remember any specific infection or sore throat lately, but the eye swelling started out of nowhere yesterday, and I just thought maybe I was tired or I rubbed it too much or something, because it\u2019s kind of red and puffy.",
