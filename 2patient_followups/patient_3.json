    "input": "1. A 7-year-old female is evaluated for persistent learning difficulties and episodes of urinary incontinence. Her mother reports delayed speech development and poor social interactions compared to peers. Physical examination reveals ambiguous genitalia with mild clitoromegaly and fused labia. Neurological assessment notes impaired fine motor skills and mild hypotonia. Brain MRI demonstrates partial agenesis of the corpus callosum with Probst bundles and a widened interhemispheric fissure. Endocrinology workup indicates elevated luteinizing hormone and a discrepancy in androgen levels inconsistent with typical female puberty. There is no relevant family history of congenital brain malformations or genital abnormalities. The patient is referred for cognitive therapy, endocrinological monitoring, and genetic counseling to investigate possible underlying syndromic causes.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is very young and probably can't explain her symptoms clearly. I should keep her explanation simple and focus on her feelings and the things her mother mentioned. I need to understand what has been bothering her and how she's been doing lately.\n\nANSWER: I guess... I\u2019ve been having a hard time with stuff like learning and talking like other kids do. Sometimes I also can\u2019t hold or go to the bathroom when I should, and I don\u2019t really know why. I feel kind of confused and a little upset about it."

    "output": "Well, she\u2019s kind of all over the place, I guess. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem to want to play with the other kids or talk much, and she gets really upset if she can\u2019t do things her way. I worry she\u2019s falling behind or not understanding things like she should, but I honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Um, she\u2026 she likes playing with her toys and sometimes watches her favorite cartoons. She doesn\u2019t always want to talk much, and sometimes she gets upset when things change suddenly. She\u2019s been a little more fussy than before, but I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s just how she is."

    "output": "Um, she\u2019s been having these strange moments more often, I guess? They last a little longer sometimes, and she seems more tired afterward. I don\u2019t know if anything specific makes them happen, but she gets really upset or tired when she\u2019s been playing a lot. I haven\u2019t really noticed her losing skills or anything, but she looks a bit funny with her eyes sometimes when it happens."
