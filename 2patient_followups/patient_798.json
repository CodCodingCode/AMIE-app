When you have one, do you ever notice yourself biting your tongue or lip? Have you ever lost control of your bladder or bowels during one? Sometimes, these details can tell us important things about what kind of episodes you\u2019re having. Also, do you sometimes realize after an episode that you\u2019re more tired or confused than usual? Your answers will help us understand these episodes better and decide the best next steps for you.\"information_withholder",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little embarrassed talking about the biting or losing control parts, but I guess the doctor needs to know. I haven\u2019t really thought about that much before. I do feel really tired after the episodes, and sometimes I forget stuff right after. Maybe that\u2019s important? I just want to make sure I\u2019m okay.\nANSWER: Uh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve bitten my tongue or lost control of my bladder or anything, at least I don\u2019t remember doing that. But I do feel more tired and kinda dazed after, like I don\u2019t remember everything right away.",
