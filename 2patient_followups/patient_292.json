I\u2019ve been waking up a few times a week because I feel like I can't breathe right, and it\u2019s kind of scary when it happens. And yeah, my feet and ankles really swell up by the evening, but sometimes it\u2019s worse than other times, especially after I\u2019ve been working around the yard or lifting stuff\u2014my wife says I should rest more, but I got things to fix, you know? I guess I just want to understand if this is normal or if I should worry more about it.\nANSWER: Well, like I said, I\u2019ve just been feeling more tired than I used to, and at night, I wake up a few times when I feel like I can\u2019t get enough air, especially when I lie down. My legs and feet get pretty swollen by the end of the day, but sometimes it seems worse after I\u2019ve been working outside or carrying things, and then I notice I cough a little more too. It kinda comes and goes, but it\u2019s making me pretty anxious.",
