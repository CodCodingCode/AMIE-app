    "input": "2. A 2-week-old female newborn is referred to pediatric neurosurgery after delivery complicated by a noted back mass spanning the lower thoracic to sacral spine. The parents noticed a prominent, dome-shaped swelling covered with a thin, tense membrane and intermittent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. On examination, the infant has poor spontaneous movement in both lower extremities and diminished pain and temperature sensation below the mid-thoracic level. There is also a distended bladder with urinary retention, indicating neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The mother reports no prenatal folic acid supplementation and inconsistent antenatal care. MRI confirms a large thoracolumbosacral meningocele containing neural elements and associated tethering of the spinal cord. Head ultrasound shows mild ventriculomegaly with concern for early hydrocephalus development. Given the risk of infection and progressive neurological deterioration, prompt surgical intervention is planned to close the defect and decompress the cord.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a newborn girl with a complex spinal issue, so her response should reflect her parent's perspective, and she is probably very worried and confused about the situation.\nANSWER: I... I don't really understand everything, but she's been having trouble moving her legs and seems sad sometimes. The doctors said something about her back being special, and I'm scared she'll get worse if we don't do something soon."

    "output": "Um, I think we first noticed something maybe a few days after she was born? Like, she wasn\u2019t moving her legs much, and she seemed kinda stiff. It\u2019s been getting worse, I guess, because she\u2019s not really able to do much now, and she cries a lot, especially when we try to handle her lower body."

    "output": "She doesn't really move her legs much, and sometimes she seems more still than before, like she\u2019s not doing much at all. I\u2019ve noticed she doesn\u2019t wiggle or kick like other babies do, and she sometimes looks uncomfortable, especially when her head or back seems stiff. I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s a pattern, but when she gets upset or sounds fussy, I guess she seems more stiff? It\u2019s hard to tell if it gets worse at certain times, but I just feel worried she\u2019s not getting better or behaving normally."

    "output": "Um, she\u2019s been kinda fussy when I try to feed her, and sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem to finish fully. Sleepwise, she\u2019s been a little more unsettled, like she doesn\u2019t stay sleeping for long, and I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s not as awake as before. I don\u2019t really know if she\u2019s having weird movements or anything\u2014she just seems different and I feel kinda worried, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know what counts as reflexes or eye movements, but sometimes she makes weird flailing movements with her arms or fusses a lot and doesn\u2019t seem to look around much. I haven\u2019t seen her have seizures, but she can be really sleepy or sometimes kind of limp."

    "output": "No, I haven\u2019t really noticed anything like that. Her eyes seem okay, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have any jerky movements or seizures that I can tell, but she\u2019s kind of still and not moving much sometimes. It\u2019s all a little confusing to me."

She\u2019s also been having some trouble feeding, and I noticed she doesn\u2019t seem to react much when we touch her lower body."
