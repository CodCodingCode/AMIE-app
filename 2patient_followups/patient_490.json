    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about how I feel about being this way, especially when I\u2019m with my friends or at school. I guess I sometimes feel sad or left out, but I don\u2019t really talk about it much. It\u2019s been like that for a while, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of my size or something else. I worry a little about how I see myself, but I don\u2019t want to sound too upset or make a big deal out of it.\nANSWER: I guess I feel that way pretty often, especially when I\u2019m with my friends and they\u2019re all taller or going through stuff. It\u2019s been like this for a long time, and sometimes I feel worse after school or when I think about how I look next to everyone. It makes me a little sad about myself, and I guess it kind of makes me not want to be around people sometimes.",
