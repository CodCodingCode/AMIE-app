    "input": "2. A 16-year-old male athlete presents with progressive difficulty running and frequent ankle sprains over the past two years. He notes a decreased ability to feel the ground beneath his feet and occasional foot cramps after exercise. His mother mentions he has had \u201cfunny feet\u201d since childhood but was never formally diagnosed. On physical examination, there is noticeable pes cavus deformity bilaterally, wasting of the intrinsic foot muscles, and absent ankle reflexes. Sensory testing reveals reduced vibration and proprioception in the distal lower limbs. Nerve conduction studies show reduced motor conduction velocity suggestive of demyelinating neuropathy. Genetic analysis identifies a PMP22 gene duplication confirming Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 1. The patient is advised to begin tailored physical therapy and orthotic support to improve mobility and prevent further deformity.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young and might be confused or embarrassed about their condition. I should keep my answer simple and focus on what they're experiencing rather than the medical details.  \nANSWER: I guess... I\u2019ve been having a hard time running and feeling my feet right, especially after sports. Sometimes my ankles just feel weak or weird, and I keep spraining them a lot more than I used to."

    "output": "Well, um, sometimes when I try to run or walk long distances, my feet feel really weird, and I can't tell exactly where they are, so I trip or stumble more. It kind of gets worse if I stand for too long or if I\u2019m on uneven ground. Resting seems to help a little, but it doesn\u2019t go away completely."

    "output": "Uh, yeah, I guess I\u2019ve been finding it harder to keep up or feel confident when I\u2019m running around. Sometimes I feel kinda off balance or like my feet aren\u2019t really doing what I want them to do, especially if I\u2019m on uneven ground or tired. It\u2019s kinda scary not knowing exactly why I\u2019m feeling like that."

    "output": "Um, well, usually I feel kinda off on my feet, like they\u2019re not really holding me up right, especially after I\u2019ve been standing a while. Sometimes my legs get really tired or shaky, and I notice I might cramp more after running or playing sports. It feels worse when I try to walk a lot, but I guess it gets a little better if I sit down for a bit. It\u2019s kind of confusing because I don\u2019t always know why it happens."

I don\u2019t really notice any vision changes or if I get dizzy, but I do feel a little shaky or weak in other parts sometimes, I guess."
