I\u2019ve been seeing shadows more at night, I think it got worse after I did more meth, but I\u2019m not sure when it started exactly. It definitely feels like it comes and goes, sometimes worse, sometimes a little better, but I can\u2019t tell for sure. I\u2019m just so paranoid all the time now.\nANSWER: Um, I think it was last week or maybe two weeks ago? I started seeing shadows moving around, especially at night, and I kept hearing whispers I couldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s like they come and go, but sometimes it feels constant, and I get really freaked out.",
