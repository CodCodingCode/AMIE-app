She also reports persistent headaches and occasional blurry vision. On further questioning, she mentions decreased libido and fatigue. Physical examination reveals bitemporal hemianopsia on visual field testing. Laboratory results show markedly elevated serum prolactin levels. MRI of the brain reveals a 1.5 cm pituitary macroadenoma compressing the optic chiasm. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently on any medications that might elevate prolactin. She is referred to endocrinology for management with dopamine agonist therapy and further evaluation of pituitary function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is experiencing multiple symptoms that seem related to a hormonal issue, especially given the visual changes and headaches. She might feel confused or worried about what all these symptoms mean, so I'll want to keep my questions gentle and open-ended to understand her perspective. \n\nANSWER: I've just been feeling really tired all the time, and my periods have been messing up\u2014like, they\u2019re not regular anymore. And sometimes I see weird spots or blurry stuff, especially around my head. It\u2019s been going on for a while, and I\u2019m kind of worried about all of it."

    "output": "Well, it's been kind of hard to keep up with everything, you know? I feel really tired most of the time, and I\u2019ve noticed my mood is all over the place. Sometimes I forget stuff, and I just feel kind of off, like I\u2019m not myself. The headaches and blurry vision\u2026 they really interfere with my day."

    "output": "Um, I think I started noticing the headaches maybe six months ago? At first, they were not so bad, but now they are pretty constant and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or fuzzy, especially when I look around. It's kinda messing up my mornings and I don\u2019t feel as energetic as I used to."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess part of it has been getting worse slowly. The headaches are there most days now, and I\u2019ve noticed my vision isn\u2019t as clear sometimes, especially looking at things far away. I\u2019ve been more tired than usual and kinda lost interest in things I used to enjoy. It\u2019s all just been kinda confusing and a little scary."

My headaches have been there for a while, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been worse or if they come and go randomly. I just feel kind of tired and out of sorts most of the time."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes things look more blurry or I see spots, especially when I\u2019m tired or after looking at screens for a while. Rest kind of helps a little, but it doesn\u2019t go away completely. I haven\u2019t really tried eye exercises or anything like that."
