For example, how long do they last, how often they happen, and whether you've noticed any neurological changes during these times\u2014like weakness, difficulty speaking, or problems with coordination? Also, are there specific things that seem to bring these episodes on or make them worse?\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m worried but I don\u2019t want to overreact or make a big deal out of it. It\u2019s probably nothing serious, but the seizure and all these symptoms are scary. Maybe I should tell the doctor everything, even if I feel silly or embarrassed about how bad it looks.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long each of these episodes last, but they come and go. The seizure was pretty quick\u2014I fell and was shaking, but I don\u2019t think I was aware of much else. Nothing specific seems to trigger it, and I didn\u2019t notice anything different with my speech or movement. Just the headache, dizziness, and feeling confused.",
