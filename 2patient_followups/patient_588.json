Also, do you notice if it feels cooler or warmer than normal? And have you seen any swelling or unusual firmness when you touch or look at the area? Even small changes can tell us a lot about how it's doing, and I really appreciate your help with this.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he\u2019s asking about how it looks and feels now, but honestly, I\u2019m a little lost about what I should be noticing, and I\u2019m feeling pretty shaky about the whole thing. I mean, the color, temperature, and swelling, right? But I didn\u2019t really look closely because I was kinda too focused on how uncomfortable it is, and I keep thinking back to my cousin who had something similar, but he didn\u2019t say what happened afterward. I just want to be honest and not mess this up when I describe it since I\u2019m really worried it could be serious.\nANSWER: Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t look really pale or anything, but it kind of feels cooler at the tip when I touch it, and the shaft is pretty hard, but the tip feels soft and squishy\u2014like, not firm like the rest. I didn\u2019t notice any swelling or anything and I haven\u2019t seen any color changes, but I\u2019ve been kind of blanking out about that because I get nervous and can\u2019t look at it too long.",
