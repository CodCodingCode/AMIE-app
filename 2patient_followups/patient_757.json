    "input": "1. A 14-year-old girl presents to the adolescent clinic for evaluation of persistent anxiety and difficulty in social situations at school. She has a history of mildly delayed motor milestones and mild learning disabilities, managed with special education services since early childhood. Her parents report that she is significantly taller than her classmates and has long legs and arms compared to her peers. Physical examination reveals no major dysmorphic features, but height is above the 95th percentile for her age. Cognitive assessment shows borderline intellectual functioning with challenges in executive functioning and attention. Her menstrual cycles began at age 12 and have been regular without abnormalities. Given the tall stature, learning difficulties, and subtle psychosocial challenges, a karyotype is performed revealing 47,XXX consistent with Triple X Syndrome. The care team recommends ongoing academic support, psychological counseling, and monitoring for any emerging developmental or behavioral issues.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain why I'm here without sounding like I'm asking for special treatment or making a big deal out of it. I'll try to mention the feelings and struggles I have without going into too many details or sounding like I understand everything. Keep it simple and honest about the anxiety and social stuff.\n\nANSWER: I guess I just feel kinda nervous all the time and really awkward when I try to talk to people. School's really hard for me, and I don\u2019t always know what to say or do, so I just wanted to see if maybe someone can help with that."

It\u2019s like everything is just a little too much."
