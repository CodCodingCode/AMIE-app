Also, when you experience these dizziness episodes, do you notice any other symptoms like feeling very pale, sweaty, your heartbeat racing or pounding, or tingling in your hands? How often do these episodes happen, and do they tend to occur in specific situations, like when you stand up quickly or feel anxious? Lastly, have you noticed whether these episodes are becoming more frequent or severe recently, or if they're affecting your daily activities more than before?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: Oh no, he\u2019s asking about fainting and symptoms like sweating or racing heart. I definitely get dizzy and feel weak, but I\u2019m scared I might faint one day or something worse. I don\u2019t really notice my hands tingling much, but the feeling of my heart pounding makes me even more worried. I think it\u2019s happening more often now, especially when I get up too fast or if I\u2019m tired. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s affecting my life a lot, but I just feel like I can\u2019t keep up anymore and this dizziness keeps coming back. I\u2019m really worried something serious is going on.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t exactly faint, but I do feel really dizzy and weak, and sometimes my heart races so fast I think it\u2019s going to burst. It happens more often now, especially when I stand up quickly or I\u2019m tired, and it\u2019s kind of scaring me because I don\u2019t want it to get worse or something bad happen.",
