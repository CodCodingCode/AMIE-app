Just to make sure I understand clearly\u2014can you tell me if your feelings of wobbliness or unsteadiness happen all the time, or do they come and go? For example, are they more noticeable when you're walking, standing up from sitting, or perhaps during certain times of the day? And when these symptoms happen, do you feel like you might fall, or do you just feel a bit unsteady? Also, have you experienced any actual falls or nearly falling recently? If so, could you describe what happened around those times?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to answer the doctor\u2019s question, but I keep thinking about how I\u2019m always worried about falling and my balance, especially since I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m more wobbly now and I\u2019ve had a few near-misses. Sometimes I feel unsteady when I\u2019m just standing up or walking, and I keep reminding myself to hold onto something or watch where I step because I don\u2019t want to fall. It\u2019s like, I do feel unsteady most of the time now, especially when I\u2019m tired, and I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been extra cautious, but I haven\u2019t actually taken a tumble yet \u2014 just this feeling that I might slip or stumble, you know?\nANSWER: Well, the wobbliness, it\u2019s kind of there all the time now, especially when I\u2019m walking or trying to get up from a chair. I keep feeling like I might fall because I feel so off-balance before I even realize it, and I\u2019ve come close a couple of times\u2014like I was going to trip on the doormat or stumble stepping into the kitchen, but I caught myself. My daughter keeps telling me I should be more careful since she saw me almost fall last week when I was trying to pick some flowers in the yard, and I guess I\u2019ve just been more cautious since then.",
