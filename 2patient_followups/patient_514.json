What about any discharge\u2014maybe a sticky or watery substance\u2014that you\u2019ve needed to wipe away? Have you experienced any increased sensitivity to light, or any changes in your vision\u2014like blurriness or seeing spots? Even if these feel minor, I\u2019d like to know if any of these symptoms have appeared or changed recently, since they can help us better understand what might be going on.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my eye, but honestly, I barely noticed any change there. I\u2019m just really worried about how sick I feel overall, and I don\u2019t even know if my eye matters right now or if it\u2019s part of this whole thing. I don\u2019t see any discharge or anything, and my eye looks normal to me, but maybe it could be related? I just want to get better and figure out what\u2019s going on.\nANSWER: No, I don\u2019t think my eye looks red or anything, and I don\u2019t see any sticky stuff or tears really. It just feels a little sore, but I haven\u2019t noticed anything else with it.",
