    "input": "1. A 27-year-old male presents with gradually worsening difficulty in coordinating his movements and stiffness in his lower limbs that began in his late teens. He reports frequent falls due to poor balance and a sensation of tightness in his legs, which has made walking increasingly effortful. Neurological examination reveals spasticity predominantly in the lower extremities, hyperreflexia, and a broad-based, unsteady gait with limb ataxia. He has mild dysarthria but no significant cognitive impairment. There is a family history of similar symptoms affecting his paternal uncle, suggesting a hereditary pattern. MRI of the brain shows mild cerebellar atrophy, particularly in the vermis region. Electromyography is unremarkable, and genetic testing confirms a pathogenic mutation in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical picture is consistent with Spastic Ataxia 2, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia combined with spasticity.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient needs to explain their symptoms in a way that reflects ongoing, worsening issues, possibly with some confusion or uncertainty about what exactly is happening. They should mention multiple symptoms over time and their impact on daily life, without trying to give medical details.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m a 27-year-old guy, and honestly, I\u2019ve been having a really hard time walking lately. My legs feel stiff and kind of weird, and I keep falling when I try to stand or move around. It\u2019s been getting worse over the years, and I just feel kind of off and worried about it."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been like, things aren\u2019t as easy as they used to be. I trip more often now, even just walking around at home, and I feel really stiff in my legs, like they\u2019re heavy. Sometimes I get tired really quickly just trying to do everyday stuff, and it worries me because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get worse or if I\u2019ll lose more of my independence."

    "output": "Um, I think it started when I was a teenager, but it\u2019s been getting worse over the years. Sometimes I fall more often, and walking is kind of hard now, like my legs just feel really tight or heavy. It\u2019s really frustrating, especially when I try to do things like go out or even just stand for a while."

Sometimes I worry about what\u2019s gonna happen next because it feels like it\u2019s not stopping or getting better. I don\u2019t really understand all of it, so I\u2019m just scared I\u2019ll keep losing more control or that it\u2019ll get worse somehow."

Have you noticed any problems with bladder or bowel control?",
    "output": "I haven't really noticed any numbness or tingling, but sometimes my legs feel a bit weird, like they're out of place or tight, even when I haven't done much. Bowel or bladder stuff? Umm, not really sure, I guess I haven't paid close attention to that."

    "output": "Yeah, sometimes my arms feel like they\u2019re not really working right, and I\u2019ve had moments where I get kind of dizzy, especially if I move too fast or stand up too quick. I guess I just feel off sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure exactly what that means."

Sometimes it feels like my legs are even tighter or harder to move, but it doesn\u2019t really come and go in waves or anything. I guess sometimes I feel more tired or like I\u2019m stumbling more, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new or just part of all this."

    "output": "No, I don't think so. It just seems to be slowly getting worse overall, but I haven't really had any times where everything suddenly felt different or better for a little while."
