    "input": "1. A 28-year-old woman presents with a progressively worsening difficulty in walking over the past 3 years, describing frequent tripping and frequent falls. She reports numbness and tingling in her hands and feet, as well as muscle weakness predominantly in her distal limbs. On examination, there is noticeable atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and anterior lower leg muscles, with reduced ankle reflexes and decreased vibration sense distally. Her family history is significant for similar gait difficulties in her father and paternal grandfather. Electromyography reveals reduced amplitude of motor potentials with mildly slowed conduction velocities, consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Genetic testing identifies a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the KIF5A gene, confirming a diagnosis of autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2. Nerve biopsy shows loss of large myelinated fibers without demyelination. The patient is counseled on symptom management and referred for physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and prevent contractures.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is experiencing ongoing issues with walking, weakness, and numbness, so I should be gentle, clear about how bad it\u2019s gotten, and emphasize her concerns. She might feel worried or confused about her symptoms, so I need to be supportive and straightforward. I should avoid medical jargon and focus on her experience.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess it\u2019s been getting harder for me to walk normally. I trip a lot now and fall more than I used to. My hands and feet feel numb and tingly, and I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s all getting worse."

    "output": "Um, I think it started a few years ago, maybe like three? At first, it was just kind of feeling a little numb in my hands and feet, but then over time, I started tripping more, and my legs felt weaker. Lately, I feel like my hands are not as steady, and sometimes I get these weird feelings in my arms and legs, like tingling or if they\u2019re asleep even when I\u2019m not doing anything. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if it\u2019s gotten worse, but it\u2019s starting to interfere with some of my daily things."

    "output": "Um, well, it's been hard to walk like I used to. I trip a lot and fall more often, even just stepping off a curb or something. I guess my hands feel weird sometimes, like numb or tingly, and I drop things more than before. I haven't really thought about my eyesight or coordination much, but I do feel a bit more unsteady overall and sometimes my muscles feel weak, especially in my feet and hands. It's pretty scary not knowing if it's gonna get worse."

    "output": "Umm, well... I don\u2019t really notice anything with my eyes or dizzy spells, but sometimes I feel kind of weird in my tummy, like it\u2019s a little upset. And I haven\u2019t had any trouble with going to the bathroom or anything like that. It\u2019s mostly just my hands and feet feeling funny and weak."

    "output": "Um, I think I've fallen a few times recently, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I tripped or if I was really unsteady. Sometimes I feel like my hands or legs just get weak all of a sudden, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or worse than before."

    "output": "Um, I guess I might have fallen a few times but I don't really remember hitting anything or hurting myself seriously. It just kinda happens, like I lose my balance more easily, I guess."
