    "output": "THINKING: The patient is clearly very worried about a rapidly worsening infection that started after a minor injury. They describe severe pain, spreading redness, blisters, and even skin turning grey, which suggests a serious, urgent condition. I need to reassure them while assessing the severity and symptoms they describe, especially concerns about possible limb loss or needing surgery. They seem anxious but cooperative, so I should focus on calming their fears but also emphasize the urgency.\nANSWER: Well, Mr. Harris, I can see you're really worried, and with the way this has been progressing so quickly, it sounds very serious. You said your leg\u2019s swollen, red, and painful\u2014way worse than you expected\u2014and now there are blisters and some greyish skin? That\u2019s concerning. We need to figure out exactly what's going on, but from what you\u2019re describing, it could be something that requires urgent treatment, maybe even surgery. We need to act fast to prevent it from getting worse\u2014or possibly losing the leg, like you\u2019re worried about.",
