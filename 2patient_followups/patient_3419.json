    "input": "2. A 35-year-old female was referred to neurology for evaluation of slowly progressive balance difficulties and stiffness in her lower limbs over the past four years. She described clumsiness while walking and occasional slurring of speech, which had gradually worsened, impacting her ability to perform daily activities. Neurological examination revealed increased muscle tone with spasticity in both legs, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and a wide-based gait with marked truncal ataxia. Dysmetria and intention tremor were noted on finger-to-nose testing, alongside mild dysarthria. Her mother had a history of similar symptoms manifesting in her late thirties, raising suspicion of a hereditary condition. Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar atrophy, predominantly involving the vermis, without significant corticospinal tract lesions. Genetic analysis identified expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene, confirming Spastic Ataxia 1. The patient was started on a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program focusing on gait training, speech therapy, and management of spasticity with baclofen.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a woman in her mid-30s who has been experiencing gradual worsening of balance and stiffness, along with speech and walking problems. She might feel worried or unsure about what's happening, and her response will likely reflect her ongoing struggles and emotional state.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling more off than usual, like I\u2019m having a hard time walking straight and my legs feel really tight. It\u2019s been getting worse over the years, and I\u2019m kind of scared about what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, it kinda started a few years ago, maybe four? I think I noticed I was walking more awkward, and my legs felt pretty stiff sometimes. It got worse, I guess. My speech has been a little odd\u2014I slur or stumble more than I used to. Sometimes I feel kinda foggy or maybe a little down, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s related. I don\u2019t see well out of one eye sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s part of it."

    "output": "Well, um, it's like, I think it\u2019s been slowly getting worse, especially with walking and maybe talking sometimes. I feel more unsteady than before, and I guess I'm kind of worried because it feels like I can't do stuff I used to do easily. I haven't really noticed headaches or dizziness exactly, but I do worry about losing control or messing up more, you know?"

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s kind of all mixed up now. Some days, I feel like I\u2019m okay for a while, but then out of nowhere, I get really clumsy or shaky and struggle more. Walking becomes harder, especially when I try to do things like carry stuff or stand for a bit. I guess in the mornings, I think I feel a little better, but then as the day goes on, it gets worse, and I start to feel more stiff and unsteady. It\u2019s pretty confusing and kind of frustrating."

    "output": "Um, I think sometimes my vision gets a little blurry or like everything is kind of fuzzy? It's hard to tell, really. I haven't noticed flashes or floaters much, but sometimes my eyes feel kind of weird, like they don't move quite right. I guess I sometimes see double or have trouble looking up or down smoothly."

Additionally, have you noticed whether your visual disturbances worsen with activity and improve with rest, which could point toward a neuromuscular junction disorder like myasthenia gravis?",
    "output": "Um, I haven't really seen any rashes or swelling or trouble breathing, honestly. And my eyes, sometimes they feel a bit weird, but I can't really tell if it gets worse with activity or better with rest. It's all a bit confusing to me."

Rest doesn\u2019t always seem to help much, and I haven\u2019t really noticed cooling down making a difference. It just kind of comes and goes, and I feel pretty confused about it all."
