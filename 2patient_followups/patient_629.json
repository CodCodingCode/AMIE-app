The eye thing started around the same time or maybe a little after, but I can\u2019t be sure. It\u2019s hard to tell what happened first. I just know I don\u2019t feel right, and everything's gotten worse lately.\nANSWER: Um, I think I felt really exhausted, like I couldn't get enough sleep, maybe about a week ago? But then I started getting fevers, and those come and go, so I\u2019m not sure if they were before or after the eye stuff. Honestly, everything\u2019s been kind of muddled in my head. The eye symptoms might\u2019ve come around the same time or maybe a little later, I don\u2019t really remember exactly.",
