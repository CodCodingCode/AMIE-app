    "input": "1. A 45-year-old man presents with a three-week history of persistent headaches, intermittent low-grade fever, and progressive confusion. He reports recent episodes of blurry vision and transient weakness in his right arm. On examination, he is lethargic with subtle left-sided hemiparesis and mild nuchal rigidity. Laboratory studies reveal elevated inflammatory markers, while cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein. MRI of the brain demonstrates multifocal enhancing lesions in the cerebral cortex and leptomeninges. Cerebral angiography reveals segmental narrowing and beading of intracranial vessels. Brain biopsy confirms granulomatous inflammation involving small- and medium-sized cerebral arteries consistent with granulomatous angiitis. The patient is started on high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide with gradual clinical improvement.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms simply without sounding too technical or alarmed. I should mention the main issues and how long they\u2019ve been bothering me, and also express some concern but in a straightforward way.  \nANSWER: Uh, I\u2019m a 45-year-old man. I\u2019ve had these weird headaches for almost three weeks, and sometimes I feel kind of foggy, like I can\u2019t think straight. I also noticed my vision blurring and some weakness on one side, and I\u2019ve just been feeling really tired and a bit strange."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling pretty off\u2014I\u2019m more tired than usual and sometimes I get these weird spells where I feel kind of foggy, like I\u2019m not really myself. And I\u2019ve noticed my vision acting up, like it\u2019s a little blurry, and I keep feeling... I don\u2019t know, kind of weak randomly, especially on my right side."

    "output": "Well, it kinda started a few weeks ago, and then the headaches just kept coming, getting a little worse maybe. Sometimes I feel really fuzzy or foggy, and I can\u2019t think straight. It\u2019s made it hard to concentrate or do my normal things, like work or even just walking around. It\u2019s pretty upsetting."

    "output": "Um, it's been really hard to do the things I used to do every day. I get tired really fast, and sometimes I feel kind of lost or foggy, even after resting. I try to rest when I can, and I guess moving around or too much makes my head worse, but I don't know for sure. Sometimes when I lie down or just sit still, I feel a little better, but it's not always the same."

I haven\u2019t had any seizures, I don\u2019t think. I guess I\u2019ve been a bit more out of it recently, like not quite myself, but I don\u2019t know if that counts."

Do you experience any pain behind your eyes during these episodes?",
    "output": "Um, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. Sometimes the blurriness comes and goes, and other times it sticks around for a bit. I don\u2019t really notice if it\u2019s worse or better at certain times, and I can\u2019t remember if it hurts behind my eyes, really. It just kind of feels weird, like I can\u2019t see clearly, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s pain exactly."
