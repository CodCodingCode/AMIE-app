Even if you don\u2019t recall waking up gasping or choking, sometimes these episodes can happen without us realizing it. Can you tell me if during the night you\u2019ve noticed any moments where you suddenly wake up feeling short of breath, or maybe felt you were holding your breath for a little while? Also, when you wake up in the morning, do you feel more rested, or do you sometimes feel tired or like you didn\u2019t sleep well, even if you sleep all night?\"baseline",

I do sometimes feel tired even after sleeping all night, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related or not. I feel kind of anxious just talking about it.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t really remember waking up gasping or anything like that. Sometimes I wake up tired, but I think I just didn\u2019t sleep well, or maybe I was tossing around.",

For example, sometimes people feel as if their breathing paused or they need to shift positions to breathe better. Do you ever wake up feeling really tired or like your sleep hasn't been restful, even if you sleep through the night? These details can help us get a clearer picture of what's happening during your sleep.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit embarrassed talking about sleep stuff, but I guess I do wake up tired and sometimes feeling like I can't breathe properly, even if I don\u2019t really remember waking up. It\u2019s kind of scaring me a little.\nANSWER: Yeah, I think I do wake up feeling pretty tired, and sometimes I feel like I can't get enough air, but I don\u2019t remember actually waking up. It\u2019s just how I feel when I get up.",
