You\u2019ve noticed the pain has become more constant and bothersome, especially after a day of manual labor at your job.

I\u2019ve had this really sharp pain in my lower back that\u2019s been steady for a few weeks now, and it\u2019s kind of radiating down into my legs.

I\u2019m worried it\u2019s more than just tired muscles because it\u2019s been bothering me more each day, especially after work.",
