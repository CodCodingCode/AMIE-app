    "input": "2. A 12-year-old female presents with episodes of muscle stiffness and fatigue during and after moderate exercise, such as playing soccer or running. Her parents report that she often complains of muscle pain and weakness that resolves slowly with rest, but occasionally she experiences dark urine days after physical activity. On examination, mild proximal muscle weakness and tenderness are noted, especially in the thighs and calves. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum creatine kinase and myoglobin levels, suggestive of muscle injury. A non-ischemic forearm exercise test shows a blunted lactate response with a normal ammonia increase, indicating a metabolic block in glycolysis. Muscle biopsy demonstrates subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation and markedly reduced phosphofructokinase enzyme activity. Genetic analysis identifies a homozygous pathogenic variant in the PFKM gene, confirming Glycogen Storage Disease VII. The patient is counseled on avoiding high-intensity anaerobic exercise and strategies to manage symptoms, including frequent carbohydrate-rich meals before activity.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to understand what's been going on, but I don't have clear words for it. I feel a little nervous and embarrassed trying to explain something I just sort of notice happening. I should keep it simple, mention the main problems, and maybe express how it\u2019s been making me feel worried or tired.  \n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m 12, and I\u2019m a girl. It\u2019s just that, when I play soccer or run around, I get really stiff and tired, and sometimes my muscles hurt for a long time after. And, um, a few days after I exercise, I notice I have dark stuff in my pee, which makes me a little scared."

    "output": "Um, I guess my muscles just feel really tight and heavy, like I can't move right sometimes, and it takes forever to feel better. After I stop playing, I just feel really exhausted and my muscles hurt more if I try to do things later."

    "output": "Um, sometimes it kind of hurts or feels really heavy in my legs when I play, and afterward, I\u2019m really tired and my muscles kind of ache for a while. I\u2019ve also seen my urine look dark a few days after playing, and that scares me a little."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I do feel some pain and weakness, especially after playing a lot or running around, and resting seems to help a little, but it doesn\u2019t go away completely. I guess I just sort of feel like that most of the time."

    "output": "Yeah, sometimes after I play really hard, I notice my pee looks kind of dark, like cola, but I don\u2019t always see it right away. It maybe happens a couple of days after I exercise the hardest."
