    "input": "1. A 7-year-old male is referred to the audiology clinic after his teacher notices he frequently asks for repetition during class and seems withdrawn in group conversations. He passed his newborn hearing screening but gradually showed signs of hearing difficulty over the past two years, with no history of ear infections or head trauma. His parents report no exposure to loud noises or ototoxic drugs, and there is no known family history of hearing loss. Physical examination is unremarkable, with no craniofacial anomalies or vestibular dysfunction observed. Audiometric evaluation demonstrates moderate-to-severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, predominantly affecting high frequencies. Imaging studies, including MRI of the inner ear, reveal normal cochlear and auditory nerve anatomy. Genetic analysis identifies a homozygous pathogenic variant linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic neurosensory deafness. Management includes fitting with hearing amplification devices and enrollment in auditory-verbal therapy to support language acquisition and academic performance.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is young, and probably confused about why they're here. They might be feeling a bit anxious, maybe worried about what the doctor will say. They probably can't give a very clear explanation but will share what they\u2019re experiencing in simple, vague terms.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m not feeling like myself, I guess. I keep asking people to say it again, and I don\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re saying sometimes. It\u2019s been happening for a while, and I don\u2019t know why, but I just don\u2019t hear things right."

Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing along with this, like weakness, numbness, or headaches?",
    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been kind of slow\u2026 like, I didn\u2019t notice it all at once, but now it\u2019s harder to understand sometimes, especially with lots of noise. I don\u2019t really get headaches or anything, but sometimes I feel sort of tired or weird in my head, like it\u2019s hard to focus."

    "output": "Um, I guess it's harder for me when there's a lot of noise around, like in the cafeteria or when there are lots of kids talking at once. Sometimes I can't catch what people are saying, even when they repeat. It makes me feel kind of shy and I don\u2019t always answer right away because I\u2019m not sure I got it."

    "output": "I guess I sometimes miss what people say, especially if there's lots of noise or if they\u2019re far away. It feels worse when everyone talks at once or when I go to loud places like the cafeteria. Sometimes, I think I hear okay, but then later I realize I didn\u2019t catch what was said."
