Well, my wife\u2019s been telling me I need to come see someone because I\u2019ve been having a lot of pain in my shoulder and it\u2019s been hard to move my arm. It\u2019s been about three weeks now, and I started doing more painting lately, maybe that made it worse? I can\u2019t really reach behind my back or lift my arm up high without it hurting a lot, and lately it feels weaker too, like I can\u2019t do stuff as easily. I just want to know if I can fix it because I need to take care of my family.",
