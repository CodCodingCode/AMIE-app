Have you noticed if the edges of your mole look irregular or uneven? Do the colors within the lesion seem varied or darker in some areas? Is the size over 6 millimeters, roughly the size of a pencil eraser, or has it changed recently? Also, do you experience any bleeding, itching, or pain associated with it? These details will help me understand what we're dealing with and whether we should consider further testing or advice.\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little overwhelmed and worried about what all these changes might mean. I want to be honest, but I\u2019m also a bit embarrassed about showing my back and talking about it. I just want to make sure I\u2019m not doing anything wrong or making it worse.\nANSWER: It\u2019s hard to say exactly, but I noticed it looks different now\u2014more uneven, with jagged edges, and it has different colors in it, like some dark spots and lighter areas. It\u2019s definitely bigger than before, like the size of a pencil eraser or more now, I think. It doesn\u2019t hurt or itch, but I\u2019m really worried it could be something serious.",
