    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little nervous that the doctor might think it's really serious or that there\u2019s something really wrong with me. I don\u2019t want to sound weird or like I\u2019m making up excuses, but I just want help.

It\u2019s like sudden and out of nowhere most of the time.",
