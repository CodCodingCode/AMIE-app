I need to understand how serious this might be, but I also want to be gentle and get him to share more details without scaring him. His concern about the pain, swelling, and fever could mean something more serious, but I shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions. I should ask open-ended questions to clarify his symptoms and how they\u2019re affecting him.\nANSWER: I started feeling this dull pain in my thigh about a month ago, and it\u2019s been kind of coming and going. The pain gets pretty bad at night, and I noticed a lump under my skin near my thigh that feels warm. I\u2019ve also had a low fever for a couple of weeks now that just won\u2019t go away. So, um, I guess I just wanted to come see what\u2019s going on because it\u2019s been really bothering me lately.",
