    "output": "THINKING: I need to give a bit of background, but I also feel kinda overwhelmed and frustrated with how this has gotten worse.

I hope the doctor understands I\u2019m just trying to explain what\u2019s happening without confusing things more.\nANSWER: Well, it started maybe two months ago, and at first, it was just an annoying feeling like something was kind of in my eye, but I figured it was just dryness or tiredness. Lately, though, it\u2019s gotten a lot worse\u2014like, the eyelid keeps flipping open when I wake up, and I can't keep it closed during sleep, which wakes me up. During the day, it\u2019s really irritating, and I keep tearing up and feeling like there\u2019s always something in there, which makes me blink a lot and squint because bright lights bother me now. I mean, I\u2019ve always had some eye discomfort, but this feels more serious, and honestly, I\u2019ve been pretty stressed out with work lately\u2014long hours and trying to handle everything at home, too.

To help me better understand, can you tell me more precisely how much your eyelids tend to stay open\u2014like, do you notice if they\u2019re more open during sleep or waking, and does this happen all the time or only at certain times? For example, when you wake up in the morning, do your eyelids feel stuck open, or is it more noticeable later in the day? Also, when your eyelids are swollen or irritated, do they seem to make it harder to close them fully, or is that difficult more part of how they feel overall? Lastly, do you find that these eyelid behaviors are affecting your vision or comfort during daily activities?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, he\u2019s asking about how my eyelids act\u2014like, when they stay open or if I notice it more in the morning or later, and whether that makes my sight worse or just how it feels. I mean, I do remember waking up and my eyelid kinda stuck open, which was weird, but mostly it just feels like my eyelid is tired or something, and bright lights definitely seem worse now. I guess it\u2019s messing with my day because I keep rubbing my eyes, and that\u2019s probably not helping, but honestly, I feel pretty frustrated because I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s wrong or if this is serious or what I should do first.\nANSWER: Well, um, I notice that when I wake up, my eyelid is kind of like, hanging kinda open, like it feels floppy or something, and yeah, it seems more noticeable in the mornings. During the day, it gets worse when I look at my computer screen for a long time, and I keep rubbing my eyes because they feel itchy or like something\u2019s in there. It\u2019s definitely bothering my vision and comfort, especially with bright lights and all, so I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s wrong and if I can fix it without some big surgery.",
