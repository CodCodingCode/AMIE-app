    "output": "THINKING: I want to tell the doctor everything that's bothering me, but I feel a bit embarrassed about some things, especially the bruising and red spots. I just want to get it all out, even if I'm nervous about sounding silly or mistaken. I hope they can help me understand what's wrong because I feel so scared and overwhelmed right now.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve been feeling terrible for, um, a while now. It\u2019s like I get these flashes of feeling really sick, then better, but then it comes back. The lymph nodes in my neck and under my arms\u2014they\u2019re just... bigger and more noticeable than before, and it\u2019s been bothering me. I don\u2019t really know what it all means, but I just feel so tired all the time, and I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m bruising so easily or why I keep getting tiny red spots on my legs. I'm really worried this might be something serious, like cancer or something, and I don\u2019t know what I should do.",
