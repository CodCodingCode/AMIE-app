It\u2019s kinda like that all the time now, just worse. I used to hang out with friends on weekends, but I haven't seen anyone in weeks \u2014 not even my sister or the guy I was seeing before everything fell apart.

I used to love drawing, but now all I do is, I don\u2019t know, sit and feel guilty for not working and then I get even more exhausted, so I just sleep more.

    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and honestly a bit embarrassed to talk about the darker thoughts, but I guess I have thought about, you know, just ending this all. It\u2019s not like I want to, but sometimes when I\u2019m so exhausted or stuck in my head, I get this weird feeling like maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. I don\u2019t really have a plan or anything, just these fleeting thoughts that pop up at night when I can\u2019t sleep or when I\u2019m crying and feeling hopeless. I feel pretty safe now, but then I worry that one day I might get overwhelmed again or lose control, especially since I\u2019ve been feeling worse the past couple of weeks. It\u2019s like I keep telling myself I should reach out, but I don\u2019t even know where to start or if anyone would even understand. I just feel so stuck and so guilty for feeling this way when everyone else seems to have their lives together.\nANSWER: Honestly, I\u2019ve been thinking sometimes that maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just stop fighting these feelings because they feel so heavy all the time. Like, I was just sitting in my apartment earlier, staring at my laptop, and suddenly I got this thought that maybe it would be easier if I just wasn\u2019t here anymore. But then I feel really guilty for even thinking that, especially because my mom had depression too, and I always worried about her, so I guess I thought I\u2019d be okay or that I just have to try harder to get out of this. And honestly, I don\u2019t really know how safe I am sometimes\u2014it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to do anything to hurt myself, but these thoughts scare me because they come when I\u2019m feeling really low, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.",
