    "input": "2. A 12-year-old girl presents to the genetics clinic for evaluation of growth delay and learning difficulties. She has a history of short stature and mild intellectual disability, with delayed speech and motor milestones noted since infancy. Her parents report frequent episodes of muscle weakness and fatigue, along with occasional seizures controlled with medication. Physical examination reveals distinctive facial dysmorphism including a prominent forehead, upslanting palpebral fissures, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears. Additional findings include clinodactyly of the fifth fingers, scoliosis, and mild hypotonia. Cardiac evaluation identifies a small ventricular septal defect, and laboratory tests show intermittent hypoglycemia during periods of fasting. Brain MRI reveals mild ventriculomegaly without overt structural abnormalities. Genetic analysis confirms a pathogenic variant associated with Miles-Carpenter syndrome, and a multidisciplinary care plan is implemented focusing on developmental support and cardiac management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what the main reason for the visit is. As a young girl, I might feel nervous or unsure about how to explain my problems, so I should mention my main symptoms without getting too technical. I want to convey that I don't feel well but keep it simple and honest.\n\nANSWER: Um, my body feels weird sometimes. I get really tired and shaky, and I sometimes have trouble moving or doing things that I used to do easily. I don\u2019t know, I just feel off and I\u2019m worried about it."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t know exactly... it\u2019s like, maybe my muscles get all weak and shaky, and sometimes I feel dizzy or like I\u2019m sort of out of it? It doesn\u2019t last very long, just a little while, and it happens sometimes when I haven\u2019t eaten or if I\u2019m really tired. I guess it happens more when I\u2019m, like, doing a lot or when I get scared about something."

Are there certain activities, times of day, or emotional states that seem to make them worse or better?",
    "output": "Um, well, sometimes I feel really tired, and my muscles kinda feel weak all of a sudden. It\u2019s like, I want to sit down or lie down because I feel shaky. It happens kind of randomly, but I think it sometimes gets worse if I haven\u2019t eaten for a while or if I get really upset about something. After a bit, I start to feel a bit better, but I\u2019m not sure exactly how long it lasts or why it happens."

Do you have any history of diabetes or blood sugar checking? If not, have you noticed signs like increased thirst, urination, or weight changes?  \n2. Are you experiencing any chest pain or discomfort during these episodes?  \n3. Have you ever had episodes of fainting or near-fainting outside of these symptoms?  \n4. Do you notice any pattern regarding your sleep, stress levels, or recent changes in diet or medication?  \n5. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, nausea, or gastrointestinal symptoms that might suggest metabolic or nutritional issues?",
    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever checked my blood or anything. I did notice I get super thirsty and I have to go to the bathroom a lot sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal. I\u2019ve fainted a couple of times when I was just really tired or if I was feeling weird, but it\u2019s not all the time. I guess my sleep has been kind of off, and I\u2019ve been stressed with school and stuff, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s connected. I haven\u2019t had much nausea or anything really, just sometimes I feel really weak and just...off."
