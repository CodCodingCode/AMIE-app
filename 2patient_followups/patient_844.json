Maybe it\u2019s worse when I move around, but I haven\u2019t really noticed anything serious when I\u2019m just sitting, so I\u2019ll just say what I think is important.\nANSWER: Well, I haven't really had that heavy feeling or dizziness just sitting around, only when I\u2019m moving or climbing stairs.
