    "input": "2. A 15-year-old female high school student presents with complaints of difficulty following conversations in crowded classrooms and misunderstanding rapid speech. She has a history of mild jaundice as a neonate but no other significant medical issues. Her parents note that she responds inconsistently to sounds at home and often appears inattentive during auditory tasks. Otoscopic examination is unremarkable, and tympanometry shows normal middle ear pressure. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing demonstrates preserved cochlear outer hair cell function. However, auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing reveals absent or severely delayed waveforms, suggesting disrupted auditory nerve conduction. Pure-tone audiometry shows mild to moderate hearing loss with fluctuating thresholds over multiple visits. These clinical features and diagnostic results lead to a diagnosis of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder, accounting for her speech perception difficulties despite relatively normal cochlear function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should describe my main worries honestly, even if I feel unsure or embarrassed, focusing on how I notice things are different for me lately.\nANSWER: Um, I guess I just... I keep having trouble understanding what people are saying, especially when it's noisy or fast, and sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not really hearing everything right. It\u2019s been bothering me \u2018cause I don\u2019t always get it, even when I try really hard."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes when there are a lot of people or background noise, I just... I don\u2019t really get what people are saying properly. Like, I hear them, but it\u2019s kind of pieces, and I don\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s kind of frustrating, and I feel kinda lost or maybe disconnected."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes I don\u2019t really catch what people say, especially in loud places like school. It makes me feel kind of lost or behind, and I get kind of tired trying to pay attention. I don\u2019t really notice anything else, but it\u2019s kind of messing with my head, you know?"

    "output": "I think I\u2019ve kinda always had trouble understanding people, even when I was little, but I didn\u2019t really know it was a problem. I\u2019ve never really had a full check-up for anything like that, and I don\u2019t remember anyone saying I had language or attention issues."

    "output": "Umm, I think I was okay, kind of. Sometimes I didn't really get what people said right away, but I guess I just thought that was normal. My parents didn't say I had any big problems, but I guess I always kind of heard things differently or missed parts of conversations."

Sometimes, I feel like I don\u2019t hear things right, especially when it\u2019s noisy, and it\u2019s been like that for a while, I think. It\u2019s kind of all over the place, so I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s gotten worse or better."

    "output": "Umm, I guess I do kind of understand better when it's quiet or if I'm with someone I know well, but sometimes it still feels weird, like I can't catch everything even then. And yeah, noisy places are so much worse; I always feel like I can't really hear right or I'm just not getting it, no matter how hard I try."
