To help me better understand your situation, I\u2019d like to ask if you\u2019ve noticed any new weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, or if you\u2019ve had any difficulty speaking or understanding what others are saying. Also, have you felt more confused lately, or noticed any trouble with your balance or coordination? And at any point, have your symptoms changed\u2014for example, gotten worse, better, or suddenly different?\"baseline",

I\u2019ve just felt so dizzy and out of sorts, and my neck is so stiff \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse or not, but it\u2019s really hard to move or think straight. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any sudden weakness or numbness in my arms or legs, but I\u2019ve felt more confused and just all over the place. It\u2019s like my head is foggy, and I keep feeling worse.\nANSWER: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed any weakness or numbness, but I do feel more confused and off-balance than before. And yes, everything seems worse\u2014my head, my neck, and I just feel so dizzy all the time. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not myself anymore.",
