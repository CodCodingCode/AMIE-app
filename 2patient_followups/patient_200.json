I should be honest about how much it's bothering me and how I keep feeling more off balance, but I also don\u2019t want to scare myself more than I already am.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019ve just been noticing some weird stuff. I see double sometimes, especially when I\u2019m tired or looking at my phone too much. And recently, I\u2019ve been feeling pretty weak in my legs and arms, like I can\u2019t really control them. There\u2019s also some stiffness and spasms, mostly in my calves, and it\u2019s kinda painful. I keep dropping things too, and I feel off balance a lot.
