Since then, I\u2019ve felt very confused, unable to concentrate on anything, and I keep pacing around the room without really knowing why.

Yesterday, I was just in my garage, looking for something, and I saw this spray can, which I thought was just a cleaner. Turns out, I think I might have inhaled some of it by mistake because I started feeling all weird\u2014like I couldn\u2019t really focus or remember things, and I kept pacing around like I was jittery or something. It all came on suddenly, and I\u2019ve never felt like this before, so I guess I just came because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me.",
