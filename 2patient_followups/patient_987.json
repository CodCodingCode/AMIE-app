Have you ever felt any hoarseness, a rough or strained voice, or a feeling of something catching in your throat? Also, have you noticed any passing or recurring fevers, chills, or any new weakness or numbness in your limbs or face that you might not have mentioned yet?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about symptoms I haven't really noticed or thought much about, but I guess I should mention if I have any voice issues or new problems. I do feel pretty weak sometimes, but I haven't thought about numbness or anything like that. I\u2019m worried I might be missing something important, but it's hard to say if I have those specific symptoms.\nANSWER: No, I haven't really noticed anything with my voice\u2014I don\u2019t think I sound different or anything. And I don't think I\u2019ve had fevers or chills lately\u2014maybe just the night sweats, but I feel kind of numb or weak sometimes, especially in my legs, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new or what it means.",
