My chest and breathing are really bad, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s serious but I don\u2019t know what to do or if I should\u2019ve come sooner. I hope the doctor can help me feel better or tell me what\u2019s wrong.\nANSWER: Um, doctor, I\u2014I don\u2019t really notice much about my eye right now, except that it\u2019s been a little red, but I don\u2019t think it got worse today. I haven\u2019t seen any spots or anything blurry, and it doesn\u2019t really hurt or feel more sensitive to light. I\u2019ve been mostly worried about my chest and breathing, honestly.",
