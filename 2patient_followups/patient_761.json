    "input": "2. A 34-year-old woman, G3P2, presents to the emergency department with sudden onset heavy vaginal bleeding and mild lower abdominal cramping, 6 months after a term delivery. She reports persistent nausea, occasional headaches, and unintentional weight loss over the past month. Her menstrual periods have been irregular since delivery, and she has not resumed contraception. Physical examination reveals pallor, tachycardia, and an enlarged, tender uterus on bimanual pelvic exam. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a bulky uterine mass with areas of necrosis but no fetus, and markedly increased vascularity is noted. Serum beta-hCG is elevated at 150,000 mIU/mL, far exceeding normal postpartum levels. A chest CT scan demonstrates multiple small pulmonary nodules consistent with metastases. The clinical and radiographic findings strongly indicate gestational choriocarcinoma, and she is referred urgently to oncology for further management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why I came today, so I should explain my symptoms without overexplaining or sounding like I understand what's happening. I need to mention my recent feelings and what\u2019s been bothering me, especially focusing on the bleeding and maybe some of the other symptoms I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 34, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been bleeding a lot today, and it\u2019s really heavy, like I can\u2019t control it. I also don\u2019t feel right \u2014 I feel kind of tired and dizzy, and I\u2019ve had some nausea and headaches lately, but I didn\u2019t think much of it until now."

    "output": "Um, I guess it\u2019s been pretty hard to do normal stuff, like I get tired really easily and sometimes I feel numb or weak, and I just don\u2019t feel like myself. Sometimes I get these really bad headaches, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of sick and lost weight even though I haven\u2019t been trying. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s been changing fast and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Well, at first, I just thought it was normal after having the baby, but then the bleeding got heavier and didn't stop. I've been feeling kinda sick and weak, and I keep getting headaches that won't go away. Sometimes I feel like I can't really focus or think clearly either. It's all been really overwhelming and scary."

I\u2019ve been feeling really tired and kind of out of it, but I didn\u2019t think it was anything serious."
