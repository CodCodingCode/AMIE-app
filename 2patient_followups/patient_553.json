It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a fog\"Based on what you've shared so far, I want to make sure I understand how much your memory and focus issues are affecting your daily life. Can you tell me again, if possible, how these difficulties are impacting things like your work, your relationships, or managing chores around the house\u2014especially during times when you're feeling more stressed or tired? Also, some people find they notice these problems more when they\u2019re under a lot of pressure or not getting enough rest. How do you feel your own awareness of these issues is\u2014do you think they\u2019re more or less noticeable to you now compared to earlier? And finally, are there particular worries or questions you have about what these changes might mean for you?\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I'm a bit embarrassed to admit how bad things have gotten, but I guess I should be honest. I\u2019ve been putting it off because I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting or that I\u2019m just making excuses, but it\u2019s been a real mess lately. I don\u2019t think anyone else really notices because I try to hide how much I\u2019m struggling, but yeah, it\u2019s affecting my work, and I get super anxious about messing everything up. Do I need meds? I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong; it just feels like I can\u2019t control my brain anymore.\nANSWER: Uh, well, it\u2019s kind of been worse the last few months, and I keep forgetting stuff and all that, especially when I\u2019m stressed or tired. I think I\u2019ve always had some trouble focusing, but now it\u2019s like I can\u2019t concentrate at all, and I\u2019m always moving or fidgeting\u2014like I just can\u2019t sit still. Honestly, I\u2019m worried I might lose my job or mess up my life, but I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just overthinking it.",
