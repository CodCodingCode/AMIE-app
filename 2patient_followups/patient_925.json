I thought my teeth just needed cleaning.\"\n**Questions they would ask:**\n- \"Will I need surgery?\"\n- \"Can this infection spread to my bloodstream?\"\n- \"What are you going to do to make me better?\"\n**Concerns they would express:**\n- Fear of losing teeth or face disfigurement.\n- Anxiety about spreading infection or becoming critically ill.\n- Worry about their underlying health issues making things worse.\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- Frequently touching or rubbing her jaw and face.\n- Wincing or grimacing when speaking or moving her mouth.\n- Clenching her fists or showing signs of discomfort when describing pain.\n- Slightly leaning forward, eager for the doctor\u2019s advice.\n- Sweating lightly from fever, looking fatigued.\n- Occasionally sighing or expressing frustration.\n---\n**INFORMATION FLOW:**\n**VOLUNTEER IMMEDIATELY:**\n- \"It all started with bleeding gums, but then my face started swelling, and I felt feverish.\"\n- \"I\u2019ve just been getting worse, and I feel so weak now.\"\n**SHARE\"Based on what you've told me, I\u2019d like to ask a few more specific questions to understand exactly where the swelling is most noticeable now, how it\u2019s changing, and whether you\u2019re having any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or opening your mouth. For example, can you tell me if the swelling has stayed in the same place or if it\u2019s spread over new areas? Also, do you feel like you're having trouble breathing or swallowing? Have these issues been getting worse or stayed the same? Understanding these details will help me determine how urgent your situation is and the best way we can help you.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m really worried about how much this has escalated. I feel like it\u2019s spreading or something, and I keep thinking about my friend who got really sick from an infection like this. I don\u2019t exactly know if I can breathe okay or swallow right now\u2014I just know it hurts so much, and I\u2019m scared if it gets worse I might not be able to do anything about it.\nANSWER: Well, the swelling\u2019s kind of spreading all over now, I think, and it\u2019s gotten bigger than yesterday. I do feel like I\u2019m having trouble swallowing sometimes, and my throat feels different too\u2014like, more sore or maybe tight? I haven't checked if I\u2019m actually having trouble breathing, but it\u2019s very hard to even open my mouth now, and I get this weird feeling like I might pass out if I stand up too fast or something.",
