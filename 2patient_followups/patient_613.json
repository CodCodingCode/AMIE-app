    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to talk about this, but I know I need to be honest. I haven\u2019t really seen or noticed any strange fluids or anything like that, but I don\u2019t always check down there super carefully. I do feel a little more tired sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related or just from my usual busy days. I don\u2019t think I have a fever or chills, though.\nANSWER: No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any fluids or anything coming out. And I haven\u2019t really felt any chills or been more tired than usual, just this itching and pain and bleeding.",
