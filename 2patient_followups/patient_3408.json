    "input": "1. A 37-year-old male presents with a progressive difficulty in coordination and balance that began two years ago, initially noticed as frequent tripping while walking. He reports slurred speech and occasional involuntary eye movements but denies any sensory loss or muscle weakness. Family history reveals that his father developed similar symptoms in his late 30s and was eventually wheelchair-bound. Neurological examination shows ataxic gait, dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus. MRI of the brain demonstrates marked cerebellar atrophy primarily affecting the vermis. Genetic testing confirms a mutation in the FAT2 gene, consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 45 (SCA45). There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or other systemic involvement. Supportive care including physical therapy and occupational therapy has been initiated to manage symptoms and maintain functional independence.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what\u2019s wrong, so I need to explain my symptoms and how they\u2019ve been bothering me. I should mention the main things I notice lately and maybe how it\u2019s affecting my daily life, but I don\u2019t have to go into medical details. I want to be honest and clear about what I\u2019m experiencing without sounding overly confident or like I understand everything.  \nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having trouble walking straight and keeping my balance for quite some time now. It\u2019s been getting a bit worse, and I feel like my speech is sometimes slurred too. I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s all connected, but it\u2019s starting to really bother me."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s kind of been slowly getting worse, I guess. I trip more often now, even just walking around my house or outside. Sometimes I feel really off balance all of a sudden, and I get nervous about falling. It\u2019s also made it hard to do things I used to do easily, like standing for a while or even just reaching for stuff without feeling shaky."

    "output": "They\u2019ve kind of been getting worse slowly, I think, but I\u2019m not really sure how to tell exactly. Sometimes I feel a bit more off-balance than before, but I haven\u2019t noticed any numbness or memory stuff or anything like that. My mood\u2019s been okay\u2026 I guess."

    "output": "It's gotten pretty hard, honestly. I trip more often now, even just walking around my house or trying to do simple things. Sometimes I feel off-balance for no reason, and I worry about falling or messing up things I used to do easily. I also noticed I get tired faster and feel sort of foggy sometimes, like my mind isn't as sharp as before."
