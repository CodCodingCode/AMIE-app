    "input": "1. A 34-year-old woman presents with a 3-year history of progressive gait instability and frequent falls. She reports increasing difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning her clothes and handwriting becoming increasingly illegible. On examination, she has truncal ataxia, dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing, and mild dysarthria. Family history is significant for a father who had similar symptoms in his late 30s. Brain MRI shows mild cerebellar atrophy without involvement of other brain regions. Genetic testing reveals a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the GRM1 gene, consistent with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 44. No significant sensory or cognitive deficits are identified. The patient is started on physical therapy and symptomatic management for her motor symptoms.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient should honestly express her concerns about her worsening symptoms, maybe mention how confusing and frustrating it feels. She might also bring up her family history to explain why she's worried or unsure what\u2019s happening. The response should sound a bit uncertain and emotional, reflecting her ongoing struggles.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve been falling more often and just feeling really off in my balance. Like, I have trouble walking straight and doing small things like buttoning my shirt or writing, and it\u2019s been going on for a while now. I\u2019m scared it\u2019s getting worse and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been getting kind of worse over time, I think. Some days I feel more unsteady, and I keep falling more often. I don\u2019t really know if anything I do makes it better or worse \u2014 it just sort of is what it is."

    "output": "Um, I guess it started a few years ago, and lately, it\u2019s been worse, like I\u2019m more unsteady or wobbly than before. Sometimes I feel more off when I try to do things like, I don't know, picking up stuff or trying to walk straight, but I can\u2019t really tell why."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess I\u2019ve started to notice that I sometimes feel a bit dizzy or fuzzy in my head, and I\u2019ve had a few times where swallowing feels a little weird or like things get stuck. It\u2019s not all the time, but it\u2019s been happening more lately."

    "output": "Um, yeah, sometimes my eyes don\u2019t seem to follow movements like they used to. I feel like I see double a little, especially when I look to the sides or up, and it kind of makes me dizzy or off-balance."

    "output": "Um, well, I guess my eyes do seem to have a hard time moving smoothly sometimes. Like, I feel like they\u2019re kind of jerky or not coordinated, and I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s just the double vision bothering me or if there\u2019s something else wrong. My eyelids don\u2019t really droop or anything that I\u2019ve noticed, but I do get tired of trying to keep my eyes up sometimes."
