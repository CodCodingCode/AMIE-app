    "input": "1. A 12-year-old boy presented to the pediatric neurology clinic with a 3-month history of progressively worsening headaches and early morning vomiting. His parents also reported recent episodes of blurred vision and difficulty with balance. Physical examination revealed signs of papilledema and mild ataxia. Neuroimaging showed a midline pineal region mass causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Serum markers were negative for alpha-fetoprotein but beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were mildly elevated. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of intracranial germinoma. The patient was started on a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with good initial tumor response. Close follow-up was planned to monitor neurological function and tumor recurrence.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking what symptoms or concerns led me to come here today. I should explain in a way that shows I'm worried but also confused about how I'm feeling, maybe mentioning some symptoms or feelings. I want to sound honest and a bit scared, not too detailed or technical.\n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019ve been having really bad headaches for a few months, and I feel like I\u2019m gonna throw up in the mornings. Sometimes I see blurry stuff and I feel kind of wobbly when I walk. It\u2019s been getting worse, and I don\u2019t really know why."

    "output": "Umm, well, sometimes my eyes feel a little funny, like blurry or stuff is kind of fuzzy. And I do feel stronger dizziness sometimes, like the room spins or I wobble when I walk, but it doesn\u2019t last very long."

    "output": "Um, my head hurts a lot more now, and I keep throwing up in the mornings, like, before I even get out of bed.
