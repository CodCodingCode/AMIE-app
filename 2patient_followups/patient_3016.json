    "input": "1. A 14-year-old female presents to the clinic with a progressively enlarging, soft, painless mass on her left upper arm that has been growing over the past year. She reports occasional tingling and a sensation of numbness in her fingers on the same side but denies any weakness or trauma. On physical examination, there is an ill-defined, \"bag of worms\" consistency swelling extending along the distribution of the brachial plexus. Multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are noted on her torso, raising suspicion for an underlying neurocutaneous disorder. There is no family history of genetic diseases, but the patient recalls several similar lesions in a distant cousin. MRI imaging demonstrates an infiltrative, tortuous mass along the nerve branches consistent with a plexiform neurofibroma. Neurological examination reveals decreased sensation in the C5-C6 dermatomes but preserved motor function. The patient is referred to a multidisciplinary team for further evaluation, including genetic counseling and surgical consultation given the lesion's impact on nerve function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is very young, and I need to be gentle and clear. She might be scared or unsure about explaining her symptoms, and the mass might be worrying her. I should encourage her to share what she's feeling without making her feel pressured or overwhelmed.  \nANSWER: Um, I\u2019m not really sure, I guess I just noticed this lump on my arm that\u2019s been there for a while, and it\u2019s been getting bigger. Sometimes, I feel tingling in my fingers, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Um, well, it\u2019s been getting bigger, I think, but I\u2019m not really sure. It kind of feels, um, lumpy, and sometimes I get this weird tingling stuff in my fingers, but it doesn\u2019t last long or anything. It\u2019s just kinda annoying and makes me worried sometimes."
