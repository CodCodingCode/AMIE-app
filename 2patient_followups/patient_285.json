My legs and face have swollen so much, and I feel dizzy and sick. My urine has been darker lately, and I just feel worse each hour.\u201d\n- **SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \u201cI\u2019ve been on medication for my blood pressure, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been doing well lately.\u201d\n- \u201cI don\u2019t remember having these headaches or vision problems before.\u201d\n- \u201cMy baby has been moving less, especially today, and that\u2019s making me even more anxious.\u201d\n---\n**MAIN CONCERNS:**\"Given the significant symptoms you've described\u2014your visual changes, headache, and swelling\u2014I'd like to understand a bit more about your recent blood pressure measurements, since high blood pressure is a key factor here. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently, or do you have a device at home to monitor it? Also, in your neurological review, have you noticed any trouble with your speech, weakness, or numbness in your face or limbs? Sometimes, those can help us understand how serious this may be. Can you tell me how you're feeling emotionally about all of this\u2014I know it can be very overwhelming\u2014and whether you've felt like this in previous pregnancies or health episodes?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel really scared and overwhelmed because everything is happening so fast. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong, but I know I feel worse and I really need help. I\u2019m worried about my baby and myself, and I don\u2019t remember feeling like this before, so I just want to stay safe.\nANSWER: I haven\u2019t checked my blood pressure at home lately, but I do remember it\u2019s been high before. I do feel really dizzy and my head is hurting so bad, and I keep seeing spots, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something serious or if I should go to the hospital now.",
