Regarding your activity, do you think you might have had any minor injury or hit your eye during soccer? Finally, do you have any other symptoms like light sensitivity, foreign body sensation, or fever?\"  CURRENT CLINICAL PICTURE: Vignette: The patient is a young adult presenting with acute onset of right eye redness, swelling, and tearing after recent physical activity. Symptoms' timing suggests an abrupt start possibly related to recent exertion or minor trauma during sports. The patient reports discomfort and a sensation of blockage, but detailed descriptors of severity, visual disturbance, or discharge are lacking. Emotional distress may influence reporting; thus, targeted questions are needed to clarify signs indicative of conjunctivitis, trauma, or other ocular pathology.baseline",
