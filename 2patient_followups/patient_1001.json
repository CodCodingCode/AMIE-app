Maybe I should have gone sooner, but I kept hoping it was just a bad cold, but now it\u2019s worse. I also keep thinking about my friend Martha who had pneumonia last year, and she was coughing like this too.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve been coughing for about four days now, and it\u2019s gotten really bad \u2014 I mean, I started with a sore throat and a little cough, but then I started wheezing and feeling this tightness in my chest that won\u2019t go away.

And I\u2019ve had a fever the whole time, like around 101, and I keep shivering even though I pull my blankets up. Plus, I sometimes cough up this yellowish stuff, or at least I think it\u2019s yellow. Sorry, I\u2019m rambling, but I\u2019ve never felt this bad before.",
