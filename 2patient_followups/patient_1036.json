    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a bit embarrassed to admit I\u2019ve noticed a few things, like feeling a bit dizzy sometimes, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting. I\u2019m worried the feelings I get before these hot flashes might mean something worse. I also don\u2019t really remember or pay attention to if it happens at certain times or if I\u2019m doing something special, but I know my sleep isn\u2019t as good lately.\nANSWER: Well, I do get this weird feeling in my stomach, and sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s connected. I guess I\u2019ve been waking up more at night, and I just feel more tired during the day.",
