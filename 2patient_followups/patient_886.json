I start shaking or jerking, and I feel like I\u2019m not really in control\u2014like I\u2019m watching myself but can't do anything about it. It happens out of nowhere, and sometimes I don't respond for a little bit. Someone told me I should come in because it\u2019s been happening more often, and honestly, I\u2019m kind of worried I might hurt myself or someone else during one.
