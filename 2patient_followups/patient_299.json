I should \nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m a 28-year-old guy, and I\u2019ve been having really bad chest pain that\u2019s gotten worse over the past couple of days. It hurts when I breathe deep or lie down, and I\u2019ve been feeling short of breath and kind of tight in my chest. I also had a fever suddenly come up last night, and my neck and shoulders are also hurting. I\u2019ve noticed my heartbeat is irregular too. It all started after I was drinking a lot and doing some drugs over the weekend. I\u2019m pretty worried because this pain is really intense and doesn\u2019t go away, and I feel like I can\u2019t breathe properly.",
