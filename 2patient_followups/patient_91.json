I keep thinking it\u2019s something serious, maybe infection from the delivery, and I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening to me. My family is also worried, and I just want to get better for them. I don\u2019t want to make a fuss, but I can\u2019t shake this feeling that it\u2019s worse than I thought.\nANSWER: No, I haven\u2019t noticed any different smell or discharge, but I feel maybe my bottom area looks a little red and sore, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal. It just hurts more when I move around.",
