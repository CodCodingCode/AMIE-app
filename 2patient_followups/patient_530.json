Could you tell me more about how these symptoms have been \u2014 for example, how often they've occurred, how long they've lasted, and whether they seem to get worse or better throughout the day? Also, since your lesion has been enlarging, have you noticed any swelling or changes around it, like it feeling more fluctuant or needing to be drained? Are you experiencing any new pain, or does the skin look different in any way, like becoming more red, warm, or swollen? And have you noticed any swollen lymph nodes in your neck or elsewhere?
