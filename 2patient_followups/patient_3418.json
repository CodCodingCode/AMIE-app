    "input": "1. A 28-year-old male presented with a three-year history of progressive gait instability and frequent falls. He reported difficulty speaking clearly and noted increased stiffness in his legs, making walking increasingly effortful. On examination, he exhibited spasticity in the lower limbs, hyperreflexia, and a broad-based ataxic gait. Mild dysarthria and nystagmus were also observed during the neurological assessment. Family history revealed that his father had similar symptoms starting in his early thirties. MRI of the brain showed mild cerebellar atrophy without other structural abnormalities. Genetic testing confirmed a diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia 1 with expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene. Supportive physical therapy and symptomatic treatment for spasticity were initiated to improve mobility and quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to explain how I've been feeling lately and see if the doctor can help me figure out what's going on since I've been having all these odd symptoms for quite a while now. I might sound a little overwhelmed or unsure because I don't really understand everything myself. I should keep it simple and honest about what I've been experiencing.\n\nANSWER: Well, I guess I've just been having a lot of problems with walking and my speech. I fall a lot more now and everything just feels really hard to do, like my legs are stiff or something. It\u2019s been going on for a few years, but it\u2019s gotten worse recently and I\u2019m pretty confused about why it\u2019s happening."

    "output": "Well, I guess my walking has gotten really harder, and I fall more often now. My speech sometimes gets all mixed up, and I feel like my legs are stiff all the time. There are days I feel more tired or kind of out of it, and I\u2019ve noticed my eyes don\u2019t move quite right sometimes. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell what\u2019s really changing, but everything feels like it\u2019s getting more complicated."

    "output": "Well, I think I\u2019ve been worse at walking and maybe a little more off balance, and my speech is sometimes really hard to understand. I haven\u2019t noticed anything really different with my vision or anything else, but I guess I feel kind of down about how things are going."

    "output": "Well, um, I guess I sometimes see things a little funny, like spots or things moving. And I\u2019ve felt kinda weird in my legs, like they\u2019re heavy or tingly at times, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just me or something else. I haven\u2019t really noticed any problems with going to the bathroom or anything like that."

    "output": "Um, I guess sometimes my eyes feel kind of strange, like they don\u2019t move quite right when I try to look up or down. I haven\u2019t really seen anything double, but it feels a little weird, like my eyes are struggling a bit."

    "output": "Um, yeah, sometimes I notice that my words get kind of jumbled or slurred, like I can\u2019t get them out right. And I think my face feels kind of heavy, like it\u2019s hard to move it normally, but I\u2019m not sure if I really see anything different. It\u2019s been like that for a little while."
