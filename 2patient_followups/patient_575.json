    "output": "THINKING: I feel really overwhelmed and scared because this has suddenly gotten so much worse and I don\u2019t understand why my sight is changing so quickly. My daughter keeps telling me I need to see someone because she\u2019s worried I might lose my independence, and I guess I\u2019m worried I can\u2019t take care of myself if it gets worse. I want to know if this is serious and if I might go blind or something, but I\u2019m also embarrassed I haven\u2019t taken better care of this. I just want it to stop getting worse, but I honestly don\u2019t know what I can do about it.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019ve had those floaters and dark spots for a few months, but just recently, it feels like my vision is really foggy, and I can\u2019t see clearly at all anymore.",
