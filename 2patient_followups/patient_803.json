To better understand, can you tell me how often you experience bleeding or discharge that bothers you\u2014like, is it daily, weekly, or less often\u2014and how heavy or bothersome it tends to be when it happens? Also, when you have pain during activities like sexual intercourse or straining, how intense is that pain\u2014would you rate it as mild, moderate, or severe\u2014and does it ever stop you from doing certain things or make you feel particularly uncomfortable? Understanding these details will help me get a clearer picture of how much these symptoms are affecting your daily life.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: Well, I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, but the bleeding and stuff happen pretty often now. It\u2019s not every day, but sometimes weekly, and it\u2019s a little heavy when it does. The pain during sex or when I strain can be sharp, but I just get through it. It\u2019s enough to bother me, but I usually just deal with things. I guess I\u2019d say moderate, maybe.\nANSWER: It happens pretty often, like weekly, and the bleeding can be a bit much when it does. The pain during sex or when I strain is kinda sharp sometimes, but I get through it most of the time. It's not terrible, but it's enough to bother me.",
