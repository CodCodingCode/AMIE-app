I don\u2019t really understand all these eye problems, but I\u2019ve seen flashes and spots, especially when my eyes feel dry or when I\u2019m tired from the pain. I just want it to stop, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s serious or if it will get worse.\nANSWER: Um, yes, sometimes I see shadows and spots in my eyes, especially when they feel dry or I\u2019ve been looking at things for a long time. They seem worse when I try to read or look at the light, and sometimes my eyes feel heavy or irritated, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal.",
