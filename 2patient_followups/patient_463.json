It\u2019s hard to estimate how much blood I cough up, but I know it\u2019s more now than at first. I\u2019m worried about what all this means, but I don\u2019t really understand all the details.\nANSWER: Well, I\u2019d say I see quite a bit more blood than I did at the start. It\u2019s not just streaks anymore, sometimes it\u2019s kind of a good splash, I guess. It\u2019s been worse lately. And yeah, I\u2019ve been coughing up clots and I get these sharp chest pains when I cough hard, and I just feel out of breath all the time now.",
