    "input": "2. A 28-year-old man presents with a two-year history of progressive difficulty walking, characterized by stiffness and clumsiness in his legs. He also notes frequent episodes of hand tremors and challenges with speech, describing it as slow and slurred. His mother experienced similar symptoms starting in her early thirties and became wheelchair-bound within a decade. On neurological examination, he demonstrates spasticity in the lower limbs with hyperactive reflexes and ankle clonus, along with marked limb ataxia and impaired heel-to-shin testing. Examination of eye movements reveals gaze-evoked nystagmus and slow saccades. MRI of the brain reveals cerebellar atrophy, primarily involving the spinocerebellar region. Genetic testing identifies an expanded CAG repeat in the ATXN7 gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal dominant spastic ataxia type 7. He is advised on symptomatic therapies, including physiotherapy and speech therapy, and referred for genetic counseling.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient might be unsure how to express their feelings but probably wants to explain their symptoms and worries. They might feel a bit scared or overwhelmed by the ongoing progression and the diagnosis. I should keep the response simple and honest, focusing on their main concerns.\nANSWER: Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been having a really hard time with walking and stuff. It\u2019s been getting worse for a couple of years, and I keep dropping things and stuttering more. I don\u2019t really understand what's going on, but I thought I should get it checked out."

    "output": "Um, it's kind of hard to say exactly how it all started or how it\u2019s changed because everything feels a bit blurry or slow now. I noticed I dropped things more often and my walking got worse over time, but I\u2019m not really sure when exactly. Some days, I feel more off-balance than other times, and I guess I\u2019ve been having trouble with my speech, like it\u2019s slower or slurred sometimes. It\u2019s just a lot to handle, really."

    "output": "Um, well, I think it's been getting harder to walk properly, especially the last year or so. I feel more clumsy and stiff, and sometimes I just can\u2019t really control my legs like I used to. My speech feels slower and I notice I slur more, especially when I get tired. I guess I\u2019ve started to feel a bit more off-balance too, like I might fall easier or stumble a lot. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything new lately, but it just keeps kind of piling up, and I don't really know what\u2019s coming next."

    "output": "Uh, well, it's been pretty hard to do some things I used to do without thinking about it. Like, walking around or even holding things steady. Sometimes I get really frustrated because my hands shake, and I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m slower than I should be, like I can\u2019t keep up. And I guess I\u2019ve been a little more tired or spacey, like I don\u2019t always notice things right away or get distracted easily. But I haven\u2019t really noticed any new feelings or anything weird in my body, just the stuff I already mentioned."

Additionally, have you noticed any difficulty moving your eyes, especially downward gaze? Are there any specific features of your tremors, such as whether they occur at rest or during movement? Lastly, have you noticed any odd sensations or deficits in your limb coordination, sensation, or ability to perform complex movements?",
    "output": "Uh, I sometimes feel like my blood pressure gets weird when I stand up too fast, and I\u2019ve had a couple of times where I had to go to the bathroom like all of a sudden. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s incontinence, but I can\u2019t always control it. I\u2019ve also noticed that my eyes sometimes move weird, especially when I try to look down, it feels slow or like my eyes won\u2019t follow right. The tremors I have are kind of there all the time, mostly when I\u2019m sitting still or trying to hold something, but I get shaky sometimes when I try to move. As for my limbs, it\u2019s hard to do certain movements smoothly, and sometimes I feel weird or off when I try to do things quickly or precisely."
