I feel like I need to explain everything perfectly but I don\u2019t even know if I remember right, and I\u2019m scared it\u2019s gonna get worse or something terrible happen. I just want to make sure I understand what\u2019s wrong with me because I keep thinking maybe I\u2019m having a heart attack or I\u2019ll die from this.\nANSWER: Well, it mostly happens when I\u2019m sitting still or just lying down, like when I\u2019m watching TV, but a few times I\u2019ve felt it creeping up even when I was just working in the garden. It\u2019s been happening more lately, like a couple of times a week, and it feels worse than before, like sharper and longer. I\u2019ve never had anything like this before, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any tests, no. I\u2019m really scared it\u2019s something serious.",
