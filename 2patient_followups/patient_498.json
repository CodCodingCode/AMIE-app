I want to be honest and clear, but I\u2019m also nervous about giving the right details.\nANSWER: Well, the dark spots I see are kind of in the middle part of my vision, like I\u2019m looking through a cloudy window sometimes, and they don\u2019t move around much, but I do notice them staying in the same spot. When I first started seeing them, it was kind of slow at first, but then over the last few days, it feels worse, and the spots seem bigger now. I also saw a few flashes of light once or twice, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal or not.",

Also, do these dark patches stay in the same spot all the time, or do they move or change shape? And have you noticed any other changes, like flashes of light, sudden blurriness, or areas where your vision seems worse or looks like it\u2019s missing? Finally, when you first noticed these symptoms, did they happen suddenly or gradually? Your answers will help me understand whether these symptoms my be related to conditions like macular degeneration or something else affecting your eye.\u201dtangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m worried but also a little overwhelmed. The doctor is asking detailed questions about the dark spots, and honestly, I haven't really looked at my vision in that way\u2014it's more like I notice things are fuzzy or dim, and I see shadows. I\u2019m trying to remember if the spots stay put or if they move around, but I get distracted thinking about my garden and how I was pruning the roses earlier when the pain started.\nANSWER: Well, the dark spots, they seem to be right in the middle of what I see, like I\u2019m looking through a cloud or a fog, and it doesn\u2019t really go away. Sometimes they look a little different, like they kind of change shape or move a tiny bit, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just my eyes. I first noticed the whole thing about a week ago, but it\u2019s gotten worse slowly, and I don\u2019t remember any flashes or sudden blurriness, just that it\u2019s all kind of dimmer now, especially in the center. My vision\u2019s been fuzzy, and I keep thinking maybe I should have gone to the eye doctor sooner, but I thought maybe it would get better on its own.",
