Have you ever experienced pauses in your breathing that you might not have been aware of\u2014like waking up suddenly or feeling interrupted during your sleep without realizing? Sometimes, people aren\u2019t aware of these episodes, but they can affect sleep quality and daytime energy. How often do you feel really tired or sleepy during the day\u2014like needing a nap or feeling drowsy in situations where alertness is important? And, if you don\u2019t mind, what are your thoughts or feelings about the possibility that your sleep issues could be related to something like sleep apnea or another sleep disorder?\u201dbaseline",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about my breathing and how tired I feel during the day. I don\u2019t really notice anything about my breathing\u2014no choking or pauses that I know of. I do get really sleepy in the afternoon, like I could just fall asleep standing up, and I worry it might be something like sleep apnea, but I\u2019m not sure. I feel pretty anxious about what this means and if it\u2019s serious.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed any choking or anything like that, but sometimes I do feel so tired during the day I just want to nap. I guess I do worry it could be something like sleep apnea, but I don\u2019t really know what that is or if I have it.",
