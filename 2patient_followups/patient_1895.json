    "input": "2. A 7-year-old girl is brought to the clinic with complaints of episodic dizziness, irritability, and sweating that worsen during overnight fasting. Her growth chart reveals delayed height and weight gain compared to peers, and her parents mention a history of repeated episodes of abdominal fullness and low energy. On examination, her liver is palpably enlarged, measuring 5 cm below the costal margin, and her skin shows mild xanthomas. Laboratory evaluation reveals fasting hypoglycemia (blood glucose 35 mg/dL), hyperlipidemia with triglycerides over 300 mg/dL, elevated lactate, and hyperuricemia. Liver function tests are mildly abnormal, and arterial blood gas shows metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Enzymatic assays from a liver biopsy indicate deficient microsomal glucose-6-phosphate translocase despite normal glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Genetic analysis identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in the SLC37A4 gene, confirming Glycogen Storage Disease Ic. Management includes nocturnal uncooked cornstarch therapy and a carefully monitored high-protein, frequent feeding regimen to prevent hypoglycemia and reduce metabolic complications.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl, so I need to keep my explanation simple and convey her discomfort and why her parents are concerned. She's likely worried about her symptoms and maybe a bit scared. I should mention her symptoms and mention she feels worried and tired.  \nANSWER: I think we\u2019re here because she keeps feeling really sweaty and dizzy, especially when she\u2019s hungry or at night. She\u2019s been acting pretty tired and cranky lately, and her tummy sometimes feels full even if she hasn\u2019t eaten much. She\u2019s worried about not feeling right."

    "output": "Umm, I think it started maybe a little while ago, and it kind of comes and goes. Sometimes I feel really tired and sweaty, especially if I haven\u2019t eaten in a while, like at night. I don\u2019t know if anything makes it better, but eating or resting seems to help a little? But then it can happen again later, even if I\u2019ve just eaten."

    "output": "Well, I get really tired and sometimes I feel all weird and shaky, especially if I haven't eaten for a long time. I get irritable easily, and sometimes I just want to stay in bed or lie down because I feel so worn out. I also get upset because I don\u2019t grow as fast as other kids, and I worry about that a lot."

    "output": "Um, I think I feel more strange when I wake up or if I don\u2019t eat for a long time. Like, my tummy hurts and I get really tired. After I eat, it usually feels a little better, but sometimes I still feel kinda weird after meals too."
