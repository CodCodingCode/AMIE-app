Can you tell me if it usually lasts just a few minutes, or do you notice it sometimes goes on longer\u2014like an hour or even more? And during or after these times, do you ever feel worried or sad that stay with you, or do you feel more clear again pretty quickly? Also, when you\u2019re feeling that way, does it make it harder for you to do your normal things, like going to school or playing?chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m not really sure exactly how long I feel tired afterward. Sometimes I think it\u2019s only a little bit, maybe like a few minutes, but other times it feels longer\u2014like maybe an hour or more? I get kind of mixed up about how long it lasts. I do feel worried and a little sad sometimes, especially when I think I might have more seizures, and it\u2019s hard to do my normal stuff when I feel that way. I just want it to stop or be better.\nANSWER: Um, I think it kinda lasts a while, like maybe an hour or something? And I do feel kinda sad or worried when I feel that way, and it makes it hard to do my normal stuff, like school or playing.",
