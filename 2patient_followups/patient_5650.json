    "input": "1. A 3-year-old male presents with a noticeable midline swelling over the lower neck and upper back since birth, which has recently become ulcerated and occasionally leaks clear fluid. The child exhibits decreased movement and weakness in both upper limbs, with noticeable muscle wasting and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Parents report delayed milestones, including difficulty holding his head up and poor hand grasp. On examination, there is a 5 cm sac-like protrusion covered by a thin, translucent membrane at the cervicothoracic junction, consistent with a myelomeningocele. Sensory testing reveals reduced sensation below the lesion level, and bladder control is impaired with frequent urinary tract infections. MRI confirms a spina bifida cystica with herniation of meninges and spinal cord elements through a vertebral defect at C7-T2. The neurosurgical team plans prompt surgical repair to prevent infection and progressive neurological damage. The child will require multidisciplinary follow-up with neurology, urology, and physical therapy for optimal management.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to express that there's a problem with his neck and back area, and it's been like this for a while but seems worse now. I should mention his difficulty moving and holding his head up, and that he's been leaking stuff. I want to sound worried but also confused about what\u2019s happening to him.\n\nANSWER: He\u2019s my little boy, he\u2019s 3 years old, and he\u2019s been like this since he was born. Lately, he\u2019s been having this swelling on his neck and upper back that\u2019s kind of open and leaking. He also doesn\u2019t seem to move his arms or hold things like he used to, and he\u2019s been acting a bit weaker."

    "output": "The swelling\u2019s been there since he was born, but lately it\u2019s looked more open and it leaks sometimes. He doesn\u2019t seem to be in pain, but he\u2019s not moving his arms very well and that scares me. I haven\u2019t noticed any fever, but he\u2019s also been acting a bit more fussy and tired."

    "output": "Um, he seems a bit more tired than before, and he doesn\u2019t move his arms as much sometimes. He\u2019s fussier when I try to play with him, and I think he\u2019s having trouble grabbing things or holding his bottle properly. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of that, but it\u2019s been worse lately."

    "output": "The parents say the swelling has been there since he was born, but they say it looks a little different now\u2014like it\u2019s gotten more open or maybe leaky. They\u2019re worried because he seems more uncomfortable lately, and he doesn\u2019t move his arms like before. Sometimes he seems fussier, especially around his neck and upper back. They don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s worse or what it means, but they\u2019re worried about him."

Also, Has there been any change in the appearance, color, or bleeding from the lesion?",
    "output": "Um, he seems the same to me, I think. I haven't seen anything new or worse with his arms or legs, but the swelling on his neck, it\u2019s still kinda the same, sometimes it leaks clear stuff, and I guess it looks the same. I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s changed or not."

And are there any bony abnormalities or signs of spinal involvement on imaging studies?",
    "output": "Um, I think the swelling looks like it's kinda soft but sometimes it seems... I don't know, maybe like it's filled with something? It's hard to tell. And the pictures, I saw some bones in there, but they look a little different from what I remember. There's some part of the spine that looks like it's not normal, I guess."

    "output": "Well, um, I think the area has looked a little more... reddish maybe? And sometimes it seems like it's a bit more swollen. He\u2019s been acting kind of funny lately, like more tired or something. His arms and his belly\u2014like, he\u2019s having more trouble with those? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s worse or not, I just feel a little scared because he\u2019s not acting like himself."
