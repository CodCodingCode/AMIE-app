For example, would you say it's just streaked in your sputum, or have you noticed larger amounts, like a teaspoon or more? Also, how often would you say this has been happening\u2014every day, several times a day, or only now and then? And besides the cough and blood, have you been feeling more tired than usual, losing weight, or experiencing more night sweats or shortness of breath? Are there any new symptoms or anything that\u2019s been bothering you that we haven't talked about yet?\"baseline",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m a little embarrassed talking about the blood, but I guess I should say something. I\u2019m worried it might be worse than I think, but I don\u2019t really know what it means. I\u2019ve noticed a tiny bit of blood in my spit some days, but I didn\u2019t think it was a lot. I don\u2019t remember if it\u2019s every day or just once in a while; it\u2019s kind of all over the place. I\u2019ve also been feeling more tired, like I can\u2019t catch my breath and I just want to sleep all the time. No weight loss or anything obvious, but I feel kind of scared, honestly.\nANSWER: Um, yeah, I\u2019ve coughed up a little blood maybe once or twice, like streaks or small amounts. I don\u2019t know how often\u2014sometimes I notice it, sometimes I don\u2019t. And yeah, I\u2019ve been way more tired than usual, and I get short of breath just doing my work stuff. Nothing else really, but I feel pretty worried about what\u2019s going on.",
