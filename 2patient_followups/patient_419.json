But I get distracted by other stuff in my head, like maybe I drank too much coffee today or maybe I just overexerted myself during that hike last weekend, I don\u2019t know. I also wonder if this is somehow related to my friend's cousin who had something similar and had to go to the hospital, but I can't really remember the details. I'm pretty scared and just want it to stop.\nANSWER: Well, yeah, my chest on the right side looks really puffed up and bigger than the other side, and it\u2019s kind of hard to tell, but it feels like it\u2019s all swollen there. When I breathe in deep, it kinda hurts more, and I keep feeling like I might pass out or something, especially when I try to breathe fast. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen my chest like this before, and I haven\u2019t hurt myself or anything, but I keep thinking maybe my lung is gonna collapse completely or I\u2019ll stop breathing.",
