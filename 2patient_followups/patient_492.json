    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my symptoms clearly, but I'm worried the doctor might not understand how serious it feels. I want to emphasize how quickly things got worse, especially the breathing part, since that's scaring me. I also think mentioning work and the birds might be important, even if I'm nervous to sound like I\u2019m overreacting.\nANSWER: Well, it started about three days ago, I think, with a mild fever and a sore throat, but yesterday it suddenly got a lot worse. I\u2019ve been coughing all the time, and I feel like I can't breathe properly sometimes, especially when I lie down or try to rest. I handle a lot of sick birds at work\u2014I was dealing with some who looked really ill during this outbreak\u2014so I don\u2019t know if I caught something from them, but it\u2019s just been scary how fast I got this way.",
