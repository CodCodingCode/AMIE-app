You are experiencing the following symptoms:\n- A clicking sound in your right ear whenever your soft palate contracts\n- Repetitive, rhythmic movements of the soft palate that you notice especially when lying down or trying to sleep\n- Occasional popping sensations in your ear during these contractions\n- Mild discomfort in your ear and a feeling of fullness at times\n- You have noticed these symptoms have been occurring consistently for about three weeks.\nThese symptoms began gradually, starting with subtle clicking that you initially thought was earwax or a temporary ear issue. Over time, the contractions became more noticeable and rhythmic, especially at night, and the clicking sounds have persisted daily. You have a history of a minor head injury a few months ago during a fall while wearing a heavy helmet, and you're worried it might be related.

It started out pretty subtle, like I thought it was just earwax or something, but then it got worse. Now I hear this rhythmic clicking whenever I try to sleep or lie down, and it kinda pops in my ear sometimes too. My wife\u2019s worried I should get it checked, and honestly, it\u2019s been bothering me because I feel a bit full in that ear and a little discomfort. I also had a fall a few months ago when I was wearing a helmet, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related or not, but I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on.",
