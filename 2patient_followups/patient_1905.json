    "input": "2. A 9-year-old male is brought to the clinic due to gradually worsening gait instability and frequent falls over the last six months. His parents also note difficulty with eye movements, complaining of double vision and trouble focusing. On examination, he demonstrates spastic paraparesis, brisk reflexes, and mild limb ataxia, along with horizontal nystagmus. Brain and spinal cord MRI reveal widespread signal abnormalities in the cerebral white matter, brainstem, and dorsal columns of the spinal cord, with magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicating elevated lactate levels. Blood lactate is also elevated at rest, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is normal aside from lactate elevation. There is no significant family history, and infectious and inflammatory causes have been excluded. Genetic sequencing identifies pathogenic variants in the DARS2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Leukoencephalopathy with Brainstem and Spinal Cord Involvement and Lactate Elevation (LBSL). The patient is referred for multidisciplinary management including neurology, physical therapy, and genetic counseling.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: Since the patient is a child, but I need to answer as a caregiver or the child himself, I should keep it simple and focused on what has been going on lately. The main concern is the worsening of movement problems and eye issues over time. It's important to mention the recent progression and that he's been falling more often.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 9 years old and I\u2019m a boy. I\u2019ve been falling more and more and I have trouble walking straight, especially when I try to run or play. My eyes bother me too; I see things double and it\u2019s hard to focus."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been getting worse little by little for a few months now. I\u2019ve been falling more and it\u2019s harder to keep my balance. Usually I get double vision sometimes and I feel kinda of out of it sometimes, like I don\u2019t see straight. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m acting differently or anything, but I just feel kind of weird a lot."

    "output": "When I try to run or play, it\u2019s like my legs aren\u2019t really working right. I feel really wobbly, and sometimes I fall down even if I don\u2019t mean to. When I get double vision, everything looks like it\u2019s split in two or kinda blurry, and it\u2019s hard to focus on stuff. I don\u2019t always know when I\u2019ll feel like that, but it makes me nervous."

    "output": "Well, he\u2019s been falling more than before, even just while trying to walk around the house or play outside. Sometimes he gets really tired and doesn\u2019t want to do much, and he seems almost confused or distracted a lot. We haven\u2019t really noticed anything that helps or makes it worse, honestly \u2014 it just seems to be getting worse gradually."

    "output": "Um, I think he had a cold maybe a little while ago, but I'm not really sure if it was recent... it's all been kind of blurry with everything else going on."

    "output": "No, he hasn't had any seizures or sudden weakness or speech problems that I saw. But sometimes he really gets tired or kind of struggles more with moving his legs, and I worry about that."

    "output": "Um, he\u2019s never had really bad headaches or throwing up that I remember, and he doesn\u2019t seem stiff or different in his neck that way. Sometimes, he does look kind of out of it, like he's staring or confused, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to anything particular. It happens randomly, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s after eating or anything like that. And his eyes being weird \u2014 it just kind of happens randomly too."

    "output": "Um, yeah, he's been having some headaches, but I think they come and go. Sometimes he seems really tired or tried to fall asleep more easily, even during the day. I\u2019m not sure if it's, like, things getting worse or just normal tiredness."

    "output": "Um, sometimes his eyes feel weird, like things look double or blurry, and I guess it gets worse when he\u2019s been running around or tired, but then if he rests a little, it\u2019s a bit better. I\u2019m not really sure if it always changes\u2014sometimes it just stays the same."
