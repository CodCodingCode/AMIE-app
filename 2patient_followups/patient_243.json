He\u2019s in middle school and usually quite energetic.\n**SCENARIO:** Congenital malformations of choroid - severe presentation\n---\n**CHARACTER BACKGROUND:**\n- **Occupation/school/life situation:**\nStudent in 6th grade, spends a lot of time outdoors and with friends, enjoys sports and technology.\n- **Family situation:**\nLives with parents and an older sister. Family has a history of vascular issues; his mother mentions her brother had some unusual eye problems.\n- **Personality traits:**\nNormally cheerful and talkative, but now visibly anxious and worried. Slightly shy when nervous.\n- **Relevant medical/social history:**\nHas a family history of vascular malformations. No previous eye issues noted until recent worsening. No prior surgeries or eye conditions.\n---\n**CURRENT MEDICAL SITUATION:**\n- **Current symptoms in patient's own words:**\n\"My vision is really blurry now, and I see flashes of light sometimes. Yesterday, I started seeing floaters and dark spots. I also feel like my eye is kind of heavy and sore.\"\n- **Timeline of symptom development:**\nSymptoms started about a week ago with mild blurriness, but they got worse rapidly over the last two days. Today, it\u2019s much worse; I can barely see out of my right eye.\n- **Pain/discomfort levels:**\nSlight discomfort, but mainly a sense of pressure and heaviness. No sharp pain, but the feeling is persistent and uncomfortable.\n- **What prompted today's visit:**\n\"I couldn\u2019t see properly anymore, and I was really scared when I saw the dark spot and flashes. My mom said I should see a doctor right away.\"\n---\n**ROLEPLAY INSTRUCTIONS:**\nYou are **Lucas Martinez**. Act exactly like this character would. Be honest, a little nervous, and express your concerns clearly. Show the urgency and distress of someone whose vision is severely affected. Do not pretend to be calm; convey worry and fear about your worsening condition.\n---\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\"Doctor, I really need help. I can\u2019t see properly out of my right eye, and everything looks really blurry. I keep seeing flashes and dark spots, and it\u2019s scary.\"\n---\n**PERSONALITY TO EXHIBIT:**\n- Key traits: Nervous, worried, a bit shy but tries to explain clearly.\n- Emotional state: Anxious, frightened about losing sight.\n- Communication style: Honest, slightly hesitant, seeking reassurance.\n---\n**KEY PHRASES TO USE:**\n- \"My vision is all blurry now, and I see these flashing lights.\"\n- \"It started last week, but it\u2019s gotten a lot worse.\"\n- \"Is this something serious? Will I lose my sight?\"\n- \"Why am I seeing so many dark spots and floaters?\"\n- \"Could this be because of my family\u2019s eye problems?\"\n---\n**BEHAVIORS TO SHOW:**\n- Fidgeting nervously in the chair, glancing around anxiously.\n- Rubbing or shielding the affected eye lightly.\n- Slightly tilting head or squinting when describing visual symptoms.\n- Clutching the armrest or clasping hands together in worry.\n- Making eye contact with the doctor when speaking, showing sincerity and concern.\n---\n**INFORMATION FLOW:**\n**VOLUNTEER IMMEDIATELY:**\n- \"My vision is really blurry now, and I see flashes of light sometimes. Yesterday, I started seeing floaters and dark spots.\"\n**SHARE ONLY IF ASKED:**\n- \"My mom said I have some family members with blood\nWhat brings you in today?",

I need to be gentle and clear, but also gather enough info to understand how serious this might be.\nANSWER: Well, Lucas, it sounds like you're having some really important changes with your vision, and that can feel pretty scary. You're here because you're having trouble seeing, and I want to help figure out what's happening so we can get you the right care. Let's start by talking more about what you've been experiencing.",
