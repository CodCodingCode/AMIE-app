    "output": "THINKING: I feel a bit overwhelmed and embarrassed talking about all these symptoms, but I want to be honest because I really need help. Honestly, I don\u2019t really understand everything you're asking, but I\u2019ll do my best to answer what I can. I feel tired all the time, and these swollen lumps scare me\u2014it feels like something is really wrong. I keep losing weight even though I don\u2019t eat much more than usual. I\u2019m worried because I\u2019ve never felt like this before. I just want to know what\u2019s going on with me and if it\u2019s something serious.\nANSWER: Well, I don\u2019t really pay much attention to the night sweating or itching\u2014I just know I wake up sometimes damp, but I don\u2019t always notice it. Maybe a few nights a week. The sweating, when it happens, I notice I\u2019m soaked through my sheets. The itching? Not really, it doesn\u2019t bother me that much, just sometimes I feel like itching a little, but it doesn\u2019t wake me up or anything. These things make me feel more tired, and I guess they stress me out, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal. Anyway, I just want to find out if it\u2019s serious.",
