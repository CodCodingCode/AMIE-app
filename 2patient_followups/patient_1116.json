    "output": "THINKING: Okay, so I guess I should answer honestly, but I\u2019m really worried that this might be worse than I think. Like, are these voices always gonna be there? What if it means something terrible? I feel like I\u2019m losing control, but I don\u2019t want to sound too crazy. I just want to get some clarity.\nANSWER: Um, the voices, they come when I\u2019m feeling really bad, but lately it\u2019s like they\u2019re just always there, even when I feel a little okay or not so depressed. Sometimes they\u2019re worse on some days, and other times they kind of fade away for a bit, but they never completely go away.",
