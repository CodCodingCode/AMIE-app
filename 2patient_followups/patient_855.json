Also, have you experienced any changes in your vision, light sensitivity, or any discharge from your eyes since then? If it's helpful, you can tell me whether these symptoms came all at once or gradually, and what has seemed to make them better or worse.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: Hmm, the doctor is asking about the eye symptoms, like dryness and yellowing, and whether they came before or after the skin changes. I'm trying to remember, but everything's kind of a blur and I get mixed up easily. I think the yellowing and dryness started around the same time, but maybe the eye stuff was just a little before the skin got worse? Or was it after? I can't really tell. I also feel nervous because I don't know if the vision or light sensitivity has changed\u2014I haven't noticed much of that. I just know my eyes look yellow sometimes and they're really dry, but I haven't looked for discharge or anything.\nANSWER: I think it all kind of happened around the same time, maybe my eyes looked yellow first, or maybe after the skin got worse\u2014I\u2019m not really sure. I haven\u2019t noticed any discharge or anything, just that my eyes are really dry and sometimes they look kind of yellow, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed or if my vision\u2019s been different. It\u2019s all a bit confusing, honestly.",
