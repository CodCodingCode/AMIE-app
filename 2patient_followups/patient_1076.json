The fever spiked higher, and I started feeling more tired and achy all over.\"\n- Pain/discomfort levels:\n\"The headache is pretty bad, and my muscles are sore all over. My chest feels tight and makes me cough even more.\"\n- What prompted today's visit:\n\"I decided to come in because I can't shake this fever, and I keep feeling worse.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient is clearly worried about her symptoms and possibly the risk of a serious infection like SARS, especially given her contact with a sick neighbor. She\u2019s been feeling bad for a few days and her symptoms seem to have worsened. She\u2019s anxious and wants reassurance but also needs proper evaluation. I should acknowledge her concern and gather more details about her symptoms and contact history, while calming her down a bit.\nANSWER: Well, Mrs. Carter, I understand you're feeling quite unwell, and it\u2019s good you came in. Can you tell me more about how your fever started and if you\u2019ve noticed anything else, like difficulty breathing or any other new symptoms?",
