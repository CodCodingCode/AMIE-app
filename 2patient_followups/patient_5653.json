    "input": "2. A 45-year-old female presents with a four-year history of involuntary, rapid myoclonic jerks predominantly involving both upper limbs, which are exacerbated by caffeine intake and lack of sleep. She describes difficulty in performing precise hand movements, such as typing and sewing, and notes mild postural tremors. Her older brother was diagnosed with a similar movement disorder in his 40s, and their father had recurrent myoclonic jerks beginning in mid-adulthood. Neurological examination shows stimulus-sensitive myoclonus without significant muscle weakness or cognitive deficits. EEG demonstrates bursts of generalized polyspike-and-wave activity, mostly triggered by photic stimulation and voluntary movement. Brain MRI is normal, and metabolic panels are unremarkable. The patient reports occasional mild generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring during periods of high stress. Genetic analysis identifies a repeat expansion mutation consistent with Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy type 4.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is here because of long-standing twitching and jerking, which seem to be getting worse or bothersome. She might be worried about her movements or if something serious is going on. She may also feel nervous or unsure how to explain what she\u2019s experiencing.\n\nANSWER: I guess I\u2019ve just been really worried about all these strange jerks I keep having. They\u2019ve been happening for years, and I don\u2019t really know why, but lately, they feel a bit worse or more out of control, and I\u2019m not sure what to do about it."

    "output": "Um, well, the jerks make it hard sometimes to do things like typing or sewing, especially when I don\u2019t get much sleep or if I drink coffee. I don\u2019t really notice any numbness or weird feelings in my hands or anything, but I do feel kinda anxious or tense when they happen a lot. Sometimes I get really stressed out because of it all."

    "output": "Um, it kind of started gradually, I think maybe a few years ago? At first, it was just little twitches here and there, but now it\u2019s more like jerks that happen more often and sometimes suddenly. They get worse if I\u2019m really tired or if I drink coffee, and I think they make it harder to sleep sometimes because I wake up feeling shaky or jittery. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of that, but I\u2019ve been feeling kind of anxious or down sometimes, and it\u2019s hard to focus on things or do my usual stuff, especially if the jerks get bad."

    "output": "Um, I think usually if I\u2019m really anxious or \u2014 I dunno \u2014 kind of overwhelmed, it feels like the jerks get worse, but maybe it\u2019s just when I\u2019m tired or stressed out. Sometimes they come more when I\u2019m really tired or sometimes if I see something bright or flashing. It\u2019s all kind of mixed up."

    "output": "Yeah, um, my brother used to have something like this too, especially when he was a bit younger. My dad sometimes had these strange movements, I think, but I don't really know if it was exactly the same."

    "output": "No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost consciousness or felt dizzy or anything like that. Sometimes, I just get these jerks suddenly, and they sort of catch me off guard, but I don\u2019t really remember feeling disoriented afterward. It\u2019s more like my muscles just jerk involuntarily."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel a bit... out of it or confused afterward, like I don\u2019t really remember what just happened. And once or twice, I think I smelled something strange, kind of like a weird smell that I don\u2019t recognize, but I\u2019m not sure if it was real or just in my head. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything strange with my vision or taste, though."

    "output": "Well, I guess sometimes if I relax or try to stay calm, the jerks aren\u2019t as bad, but it\u2019s hard to always do that. I\u2019m willing to try whatever might help, I just want these things to be less tricky to deal with."

    "output": "Um, yeah, I guess they do get worse when I'm really stressed out or if I have a lot of caffeine. I think when I try to relax, sometimes it helps a little, but not always. It's kind of confusing because I can't always tell what makes it better or worse."
