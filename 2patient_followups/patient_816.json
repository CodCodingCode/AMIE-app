Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling this tight, kind of squeezing feeling in my chest, and it\u2019s been happening on and off for a few weeks. Sometimes it gets worse when I\u2019m stressed or if I go outside into the cold. It\u2019s not so bad that I can\u2019t breathe or anything, but I do get a sort of pressure, and it sometimes radiates to my neck, jaw, or left arm. It\u2019s enough to make me worried\u2014like maybe it\u2019s something serious, and I thought I should get checked out.",
