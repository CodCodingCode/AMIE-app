Also, regarding your overall health, have you noticed whether these symptoms\u2014with fatigue, bruising, or other issues\u2014have been getting worse or if they seem stable? Understanding these details helps me get a clearer picture of what's going on for you.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying to sort through everything in my head. It\u2019s all so confusing\u2014 I mean, I haven\u2019t really been doing much different, just kind of resting after I retired, but I feel terrible all the time now. Sometimes I think about my mom and dad\u2014they both had issues with blood and bruising too, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s the same. I guess I\u2019m just worried it might be serious, but I don\u2019t want to overthink it too much in front of y\u2019all.\nANSWER: Doctor, honestly, I don\u2019t really know if my eye pain has gotten worse or better\u2014 I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s really pain, just kind of an uncomfortable feeling, you know? I didn\u2019t notice any flashing lights or spots that I remember, but I\u2019ve been so tired, I kind of forget stuff sometimes. And as for the other symptoms, like the bruising and bleeding, I think it\u2019s been getting worse but maybe not every day, I guess. It\u2019s just all so confusing, and I feel like I\u2019m losing track of what\u2019s normal anymore.",
