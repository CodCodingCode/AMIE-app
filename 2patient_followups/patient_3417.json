    "input": "2. A 12-year-old female is brought in for evaluation of progressively worsening seizures, beginning at age 5, characterized by tonic-clonic movements and frequent postictal confusion. Her medical history includes delayed milestones, particularly in speech and motor coordination, and intermittent episodes of hemiparesthesia on the left side. On examination, she demonstrates mild left-sided spastic hemiplegia and diminished sensation to light touch and pinprick. Brain MRI reveals complex cortical dysplasia with polymicrogyria primarily affecting the right frontal lobe, accompanied by a small posterior fossa malformation suggestive of cerebellar hypoplasia. Video EEG monitoring captures ictal discharges originating from multiple cortical regions, correlating with her seizure semiology. Cognitive assessment reveals moderate intellectual disability with deficits in executive function and attention. Trials of multiple antiepileptic drugs have resulted in minimal seizure control, and the multidisciplinary team is considering surgical options. The constellation of findings supports a diagnosis of complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations, accounting for her refractory epilepsy and neurodevelopmental challenges.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to keep my answer simple and honest, explaining my struggles without overwhelming the doctor with details. I should express how things have been getting worse and make it clear I\u2019m worried.  \nANSWER: I'm 12, and I... I keep having these really bad seizures that are kinda getting worse. Sometimes I get confused afterward, and I feel kind of... off. It's been like this for a while, and I don\u2019t really know why."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I just suddenly start shaking all over, and I can't really control it. I feel really confused after, like I don\u2019t remember what just happened. It happens kinda often, but not always the same way, and I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s a reason for it. Sometimes I think I notice I get more confused or shaky if I\u2019m really tired or stressed out."

    "output": "Um, well, sometimes I feel kinda dizzy or funny before it happens, and then I can\u2019t really control my body or things go all tingly. After, I\u2019m super tired and it\u2019s like my head is foggy, and I just want to lie down. It\u2019s like everything around feels different and harder to do, I think."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I feel kind of foggy or really weird before they start, like my head's just not right. During them, I just lose control and feel really tired afterward, like I can\u2019t remember stuff for a while. It\u2019s kinda scary 'cause I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s gonna happen or what I\u2019ll be able to do. Mostly, it makes it hard to do my normal stuff, like school or playing with my friends."

Also, are there any other features during the episodes, such as eye movements, incontinence, tongue biting, or automatisms?",
    "output": "Um, well, sometimes they last a little while, like a few seconds or a bit more, but I\u2019m not really sure exactly. And, honestly, they don\u2019t always feel the same\u2014sometimes I just feel really weird and stiff, but other times I kind of get confused or make strange noises, I guess. I don\u2019t always notice special eye movements or stuff like biting my tongue, but I think I might lose control or sometimes I wet myself, I don\u2019t know, or something happens that I can\u2019t really remember. It\u2019s all kinda mixed up in my head."

Additionally, does he exhibit any automatisms (e.g., lip smacking, hand movements), eye blinking, or autonomic features like changes in heart rate or flushing during episodes?",
    "output": "Um, I\u2019m not really sure if I lose track of everything or stay aware, I just kind of feel weird and fuzzy. Sometimes I do stuff with my hands or lips without meaning to, but I don\u2019t think I see anything special happening with my eyes or feel my heart racing or anything like that."
