I feel really tired and my chest feels heavy, like something\u2019s really heavy on it. I fainted yesterday when I got up from sitting, and my lips even look kind of bluish sometimes. My heart's always been a little funny because of my condition, but I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it. People told me to come in 'cause I guess it\u2019s serious now.",
