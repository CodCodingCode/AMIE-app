    "input": "2. A 7-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric urology clinic due to concerns raised during a routine school physical exam that noted an empty left hemiscrotum. The parents report no history of scrotal pain, swelling, or trauma, and the child has normal developmental milestones with no urinary symptoms. On examination, the left side of the scrotum is hypoplastic and no testis is palpable within the left scrotal sac or inguinal canal. The right testicle is normal in size, firm, and descended. Scrotal ultrasound confirms absence of testicular tissue on the left side, with no evidence of ectopic or undescended testis in the inguinal or abdominal regions. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone are within normal limits for age, but anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone is decreased, suggesting absent viable testicular tissue on the affected side. The diagnosis of left-sided Testicular Regression Syndrome is made, likely due to an intrauterine vascular event leading to fetal testicular loss. The family is counseled regarding the benign nature of the condition, the possibility of testicular prosthesis implantation for cosmetic reasons, and the importance of regular follow-up to monitor the contralateral testis.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why we're here today, so I should try to tell them what's been bothering me, even if I don't really understand everything myself. I might be nervous or embarrassed to explain, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and honest.  \nANSWER: Um, I guess I just came because my mom and dad said I should see the doctor. Nothing really hurts, but I keep feeling kinda weird down there, and I worried something was wrong, even though I don\u2019t really know what or why."
