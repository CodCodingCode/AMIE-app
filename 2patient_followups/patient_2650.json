    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy presents to the neurology clinic with progressive muscle weakness and frequent falls over the past year. His parents report delayed motor milestones, including walking independently only at 24 months, and difficulty climbing stairs. On examination, he exhibits hypotonia, calf hypertrophy, and reduced deep tendon reflexes. He also has a mild intellectual disability and exhibits subtle facial dysmorphism with a high-arched palate. Serum creatine kinase levels are elevated at 1,200 U/L, and brain MRI reveals mild cerebellar hypoplasia. Electromyography shows myopathic changes, and muscle biopsy demonstrates dystrophic features with reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Genetic testing confirms a pathogenic mutation in the assigned gene responsible for Muscular Dystrophy-Dystroglycanopathy Type a, 8. Multidisciplinary management including physical therapy and cardiac monitoring is initiated to optimize function and monitor disease progression.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain what\u2019s been going on in a way that makes sense but also honestly shows that I don\u2019t really get what\u2019s happening. I should mention my symptoms clearly but keep it simple, and maybe sound a little worried or confused.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m not sure how to say it exactly, but I\u2019ve been feeling really tired and weak, and sometimes I fall down a lot even when I don\u2019t think I should. It\u2019s been happening for quite a while, and I just don\u2019t have the energy to do things like before."

    "output": "Um, I dunno... I feel kinda tired a lot, even when I sleep. Sometimes my legs feel like they\u2019re really heavy, and I get scared I\u2019ll fall more. I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything else wrong, but I just don\u2019t feel right sometimes."

    "output": "I guess I get really tired sometimes, especially when I try to run or play for a long time. I fall more than I used to, and my legs feel funny\u2014like heavy or wobbly\u2014especially if I\u2019ve been on them a lot. Sometimes, I feel worse after I\u2019ve been sitting for a while and then try to stand up."

I think I need to talk to my mom and dad about it too."
