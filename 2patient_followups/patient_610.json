Also, have you noticed if these episodes happen more after using any substances, or do they seem to occur regardless of substance use? Understanding this will help me get a clearer picture of what you're experiencing.\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m worried because these things I see don\u2019t seem to go away, but I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re always there or just sometimes. I get really scared when I see shadows or shapes, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse after I use that stuff or if it\u2019s just always like this now.\nANSWER: Um, I think I keep seeing shadows and weird things, even when I\u2019m not using anything anymore, but sometimes I feel okay. It\u2019s like, sometimes they come back suddenly and then go away, but other times they stay for a while. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the drugs I took or just happening all the time now.",
