    "input": "1. A 12-year-old boy presents with recurrent left-sided neck swelling and tenderness that has persisted for several months. His parents report intermittent episodes of a foul-smelling discharge from a small opening on the lower anterior neck near the sternocleidomastoid muscle. He occasionally experiences mild dysphagia and hoarseness but denies fever or systemic symptoms. Physical examination reveals a palpable, soft, fluctuant mass in the left lower neck and an external sinus tract with mucopurulent drainage. Ultrasonography shows a cystic lesion adjacent to the thyroid gland and vocal cords, raising suspicion for a branchial cleft anomaly. A barium swallow demonstrates a fistulous tract originating near the pyriform sinus. The patient has no history of trauma or prior neck infections. Given the recurrent infections and location, a diagnosis of fourth branchial cleft anomaly is considered, and surgical excision is planned.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young boy, very young, probably nervous about what's happening. He might find it confusing or embarrassing to talk about his neck issues. I should keep it simple, emphasize discomfort and concern about the ongoing problem without making it seem too serious or alarming. \n\nANSWER: Um, I\u2019ve had this lump on my neck for a long time, and it\u2019s been hurting and sometimes I see stuff coming out of a tiny hole there. It\u2019s been bothering me, and I guess I just want it gone or something."

    "output": "Um, the lump... it\u2019s kind of been there for a long time, but sometimes it feels bigger or more tender, especially if it gets infected. I don\u2019t really have a fever, but I do feel a little stuffy or like my voice is changing sometimes, and swallowing can be strange now and then."

    "output": "Um, well, it sometimes hurts a little when the swelling is there, and I feel kinda worried about the stuff coming out of that bump. I get scared it might happen again and I don\u2019t really want people to see it, so I just try to stay away from friends sometimes. I haven't noticed anything else really, but I get nervous when it acts up."

And is there any history of recent infections or illnesses that could be related to your neck swelling?",
    "output": "Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost any weight or had night sweats, but I\u2019ve been feeling kinda tired sometimes, and I\u2019ve been getting those neck infections on and off, I guess. It\u2019s hard to say if they\u2019re all related or just separate things."

Also, could you describe the duration of your nasal stuffiness and voice changes \u2013 have they been persistent or recent?",
    "output": "Um, I think it's more on the side, kinda lower down near my neck, not really in the middle. The stuffiness in my nose has been kind of there off and on, but I can't really say exactly how long. As for my voice, it\u2019s been a little weird sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s recent or been going on for a while."

    "output": "Uh, I guess I can try to understand, but I\u2019m kind of nervous about what that means. I dunno if I want it to be cut open or whatever, but I guess if it helps stop the infections? I just don\u2019t want it to hurt or get worse. Can you tell me what will happen if I do that?"
