    "input": "2. A 45-year-old female presents with a 10-year history of progressive lower limb stiffness and mild weakness that started as occasional muscle cramps and evolved into a noticeable gait disturbance. She describes difficulty with balance and a tendency to drag her feet, particularly after prolonged walking. Her mother experienced similar symptoms in her fifth decade, consistent with an inherited neurological condition. On examination, she demonstrates increased muscle tone and spasticity in both legs, along with brisk deep tendon reflexes and bilateral Babinski signs. Sensory testing is normal, and there are no cognitive or sphincter abnormalities. MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord show no structural abnormalities, ruling out other causes such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord lesions. Electromyography is unremarkable, further supporting a hereditary spastic paraparesis diagnosis. Genetic analysis reveals a pathogenic variant in the SPAST gene, confirming Spastic Paraplegia 17, Autosomal Dominant, and she is referred for multidisciplinary rehabilitation including physical therapy and symptomatic pharmacological treatment.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is here because her symptoms have been worsening over a long time, and she might be feeling worried or unsure about what\u2019s happening. She could be experiencing some anxiety or embarrassment about her condition, so her response may be hesitant or vague, sharing her concerns without clear medical terms.\n\nANSWER: I'm not really sure why I\u2019m here, honestly. It's just that my legs have been acting up more than before, and I keep stumbling or dragging my feet, especially after walking around a lot. It\u2019s been going on for quite a while, and I guess I just wanted to see if there\u2019s something I can do about it."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s been happening for quite a while, like more than ten years, I guess. It started off kind of small, just some cramping in my legs, and then it slowly got worse, especially after I walk for a long time. Now I notice I\u2019m dragging my feet and sometimes I feel off balance, like I might fall. I don\u2019t really feel any numbness or tingling, just this stiffness and some weakness, I think."
