    "output": "THINKING: I feel a little nervous talking about this stuff because I don't really know what it means, but I want to be honest and tell the doctor everything. I'm worried maybe it's serious, but I also feel embarrassed about my periods and feeling so weak all the time.\nANSWER: Yes, sometimes I look more pale or feel short of breath even when I'm just sitting around. My periods have been way heavier than usual, and I do feel more tired and weak after them. It\u2019s like I lose a lot of blood or something, and it makes me feel worse.",
