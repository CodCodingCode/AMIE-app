    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking about whether I try to do any rituals or behaviors to feel better, and if I can control these thoughts. Honestly, I just want to get rid of these thoughts, but they come so strong and uncontrollable, and I often feel like I have to do something to fix or stop them, but nothing really helps. I keep thinking about hurting people or myself, and I don't know if I can stop, especially when the thoughts are the worst. I'm scared that these thoughts are signs I might do something terrible or that I can't control them, and I feel kind of helpless about all of it.\nANSWER: Um, I don\u2019t really have specific rituals or anything I do to try to stop these thoughts. They just keep coming back, and I feel like I can\u2019t control it, like they take over my mind. And yes, the thoughts are mostly about hurting myself or others, and I really don\u2019t want that, but they feel so real and terrible that I worry I might act on them one day if I don\u2019t get help.",
