    "input": "2. A 4-year-old girl is brought to the clinic for evaluation of progressive muscle weakness observed since infancy, characterized by difficulties in smiling, sucking, and neck holding. Her parents note intermittent episodes of ptosis that worsen with fatigue and improve slightly with rest. Neurological examination reveals facial weakness, hypotonia, and reduced strength in both proximal and distal muscles, along with diminished deep tendon reflexes. Repetitive nerve stimulation testing demonstrates a decremental response indicative of impaired neuromuscular transmission at the presynaptic level. There is no known family history of neuromuscular diseases, and brain imaging is unremarkable. Genetic analysis identifies a pathogenic variant associated with congenital presynaptic myasthenic syndrome type 21. The patient experiences frequent respiratory infections likely related to weak cough and swallowing difficulties, requiring close pulmonary monitoring. Treatment includes a trial of 3,4-diaminopyridine to enhance acetylcholine release and supportive therapies focused on nutrition and respiratory function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young girl with complex muscle weakness and fatigue, and I need to keep her explanation simple and vague. She might be worried or scared, so I should encourage her to share what she\u2019s feeling without making her feel pressured.\n\nANSWER: I guess... I don\u2019t feel right. My face feels all wiggly, and I get tired a lot, even just trying to smile or hold my head up. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m not as strong as I used to be, and I\u2019ve been getting sick more than usual."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, like I just don\u2019t have as much energy, especially when I try to play or do stuff. Sometimes I feel kind of sleepy even when I wake up, and my face feels weird, like it\u2019s not moving right. I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s new or if it\u2019s just always been like that."

    "output": "Um, she\u2019s been like this for a long time, I think since she was really little, and it\u2019s gotten a bit worse sometimes, especially when she\u2019s tired or after lots of crying. Sometimes, she seems to get more tired and her face looks more floppy, but then if she rests for a bit, she feels a little better. I don\u2019t really know what makes it better or worse, just that it\u2019s more when she\u2019s tired."

    "output": "I guess I get tired really fast and sometimes I can\u2019t do things like smile or hold my head up good. It feels worse when I try to do lots of things, and I get more tired at the end of the day or when I try to eat or play."

    "output": "Uh, sometimes I feel kind of funny in my face, like maybe a little tingly or something, but I don't know if that's normal or not. I haven't really noticed anything else, but I don\u2019t really understand what it all means."

    "output": "Well, she\u2019s always kind of struggled with her arms and legs, and sometimes it gets worse when she\u2019s tired. Her swallowing isn\u2019t great, and she kinda sounds hoarse sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean. Her eyes sometimes get droopy, especially after she\u2019s been playing a lot."
