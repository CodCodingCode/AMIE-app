    "output": "THINKING: I feel really overwhelmed by all these symptoms and I\u2019m not sure how they fit together or how serious they are. I keep mixing up timelines, and I don\u2019t really remember when each thing started, so I just want to explain it all honestly without messing up the order. I hope the doctor understands that I\u2019m feeling a bit lost about it all.\nANSWER: Well, um, the vision thing started a while ago, I think maybe a few months, but it could be shorter\u2014I\u2019m not really sure, maybe last week or so? And the hearing stuff, that just kind of happened around the same time or maybe a little after. I notice everything looks foggy, like a haze, and I can't hear normal sounds properly sometimes. My memory\u2019s worse now\u2014I forget stuff I just did, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all connected or what, but I\u2019ve never felt like this before.",
