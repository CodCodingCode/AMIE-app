    "input": "1. A 16-year-old phenotypic female presents to the clinic with concerns about primary amenorrhea and minimal breast development. She reports scant pubic and axillary hair growth, and her height is above average for her age. On physical examination, her external genitalia appear typically female, but the vagina ends in a blind pouch, approximately 5 cm in length. She also mentions a history of scant body hair and no deepening of the voice. Laboratory studies reveal elevated serum testosterone levels within the male range, alongside elevated luteinizing hormone and normal follicle-stimulating hormone. Pelvic ultrasound identifies absent uterus and ovaries, with testes located intra-abdominally. Karyotyping confirms a 46,XY genotype. A diagnosis of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is made, and the patient is referred to endocrinology and psychology services for management and counseling.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to explain my situation without sounding too weird or embarrassed. I should mention the main issues that are bothering me, like not having periods or developing normally. I want to be honest but also clear that I'm a bit confused about everything.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 16, and I haven\u2019t gotten my period or developed breast stuff like most girls do. I also don\u2019t have much body hair, and I\u2019ve always been taller than most people my age. It\u2019s just been kind of confusing and makes me feel different."
