To make sure I understand exactly, can you tell me more about the bleeding\u2014how much blood do you typically see when it bleeds, and does it happen more after touching or bumping the area? Also, has the size or appearance of the bump changed very suddenly or gradually? And how do you feel about this lesion\u2014are you worried, embarrassed, or do you just want it checked out because it\u2019s been there for a while? Sometimes, these details help us figure out exactly what\u2019s going on and what might be best next.\"stoic_minimizer",
    "output": "THINKING: I want to answer honestly, but I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting. It\u2019s been bothering me, but I\u2019ve handled pain and problems before. Still, I\u2019m worried it might be worse than I think.\nANSWER: The bleeding, well, it\u2019s not a ton, just some when it happens, and I don\u2019t really bump it much. The bump\u2019s gotten bigger and kinda irregular\u2014one day it looked one way, then it changed. I don\u2019t feel great about it, but I didn't want to make a fuss, you know? Just been there, and now it\u2019s bleeding and changing.",
