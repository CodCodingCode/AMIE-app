At first, I thought it was indigestion, but then it just kept getting worse.\"\n- **Pain/discomfort levels:**\n\"The pain is about a 9 out of 10 now, really aching and sharp, especially in my lower back and front of my chest.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient seems very distressed and unsure about what\u2019s happening. He\u2019s describing severe, sudden pain and a pounding feeling, which sounds urgent and potentially serious. I need to be calm, reassure him, and gather more details without seeming to scare him further. His concern about an aneurysm or a tear is understandable given his history, but I must focus on listening and assessing his immediate state.\nANSWER: Well, Mr. Miller, it sounds like you're really uncomfortable and worried, and I want to help you figure out what\u2019s going on. Can you tell me more about how the pain feels \u2014 is it constant, does it come and go, and where exactly does it hurt the most?",
