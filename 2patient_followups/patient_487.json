She's probably scared about her health, worried that she's losing too much blood, and wants reassurance that she's going to be okay. She also might be overwhelmed, trying to describe how bad she feels and immediately seeking help. I need to listen carefully, acknowledge her fears, and ask about the severity of her symptoms while providing calm reassurance.\nANSWER: I keep passing these big blood clots\u2014like golf balls. I feel so dizzy and faint, I think I might fall over. My heart's pounding so hard, I can feel it. I just can't seem to stop bleeding, and it\u2019s gotten really, really bad.

When the doctor checked my uterus, it felt a little softer than earlier, and I guess that\u2019s not good? My heart's pounding so hard\u2014like I can feel it in my chest\u2014and I feel like I might fall over any minute now. I\u2019m really scared something bad is happening, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal because no one told me this could happen so suddenly, and I just want help because I think I might lose too much blood.",
