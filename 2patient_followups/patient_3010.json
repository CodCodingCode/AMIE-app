    "input": "1. A 3-year-old female toddler presents with developmental delays and noticeable microcephaly since infancy, with a head circumference persistently below the 2nd percentile. Her parents mention she has struggled with delayed speech and motor milestones, including late sitting and walking. On examination, the child exhibits mild intellectual disability but no significant dysmorphic facial features or seizures. There is no history of prenatal infections or perinatal complications, and both parents are healthy with no family history of neurological disorders. Brain MRI reveals simplified gyral patterns consistent with primary microcephaly but no other structural abnormalities. Genetic testing identifies homozygous mutations in the MCPH1 gene, confirming autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Ongoing management includes early intervention with physical, occupational, and speech therapies to support developmental skills. The family receives genetic counseling regarding recurrence risk in future pregnancies.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor is asking why we're here today, so I should explain what\u2019s been bothering me or making me worried. Since she's so young, I might say something about how she's been doing or feeling, but I need to keep it simple and honest, even if I\u2019m worried or not sure what\u2019s normal.\n\nANSWER: My little girl is almost three, and she\u2019s been having a hard time with some things she should be doing already, like talking and moving around better. I just feel worried because she seems a bit behind, and I want to make sure everything\u2019s okay."

    "output": "Well, she mostly just kind of looks around and doesn't really play much with us or other kids like I thought she would. She sometimes seems to get upset easily or just stares at things for a long time. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not, but she doesn\u2019t really talk or try to do things with us much. She\u2019s a little bit different than I expected, I guess."

    "output": "Um, she usually likes to be around us and hi, she\u2019s pretty quiet most of the time. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t seem to respond much when we call her, and I guess she\u2019s been a little different lately\u2014like, sometimes she\u2019s more upset or just sort of not as interested in playing or doing things she used to. I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Well, she\u2019s pretty much the same most days, I guess. She doesn't really do much different lately, but sometimes she gets upset or frustrated and it\u2019s hard to tell what she wants. She\u2019s not really talking much more than before, and she\u2019s a little more tired sometimes. It\u2019s like she tries to do things but then gives up quickly."

    "output": "Um, sometimes she looks at things, like, when I show her her toys, but I\u2019m not sure if she really understands or cares. She sort of stares for a little, then looks away, or maybe she just doesn\u2019t really make much eye contact like I\u2019d expect. It\u2019s hard to tell if she\u2019s paying attention or not."

    "output": "Um, she doesn\u2019t really say much about liking or disliking things, but sometimes she seems kind of bothered by loud noises or bright lights, I think. She might prefer softer sounds or gentle things, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking."

    "output": "Um, she sometimes looks at us when we call her, but it\u2019s kind of random. She doesn\u2019t really smile or play the usual games like I\u2019d expect, and she doesn\u2019t seem to really respond when we try to get her to look at things or do stuff with us."

    "output": "Um, she\u2019s been a little more... I don\u2019t know, maybe more upset when things change, like if something\u2019s different or if people get loud. Sometimes she seems to just want to be by herself more, and she doesn\u2019t react the same way she used to when we try to get her to play or interact. But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just her being tired or if something\u2019s wrong."

    "output": "Um, I think... maybe that could help? I, uh, I just want her to get better with everything, but I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s best or what to do first."
