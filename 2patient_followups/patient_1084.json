    "output": "THINKING: I\u2019m trying not to make a big deal out of this, but I guess I should tell her everything so she understands. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting, but I do wonder if it\u2019s something serious, like a tumor or a bone thing. I just want it to stop hurting.\nANSWER: It\u2019s kind of sore and swollen sometimes, and it feels a little stiff. It\u2019s not hot or red that I\u2019ve noticed. The pain is mostly when I move it a certain way or after I\u2019ve been running around.",
