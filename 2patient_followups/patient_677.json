For example, do your feelings of tingling or numbness come and go, or are they persistent throughout the day? When you experience dizziness or the fuzzy vision, do these symptoms happen suddenly or gradually? Are there particular activities or times of day when these symptoms seem worse or better? Also, have you noticed any new weakness, difficulty with coordination, or problems walking that seem related to these episodes? Understanding the pattern and severity of these symptoms will really help me determine whether they fit with conditions like nerve issues or neurological disease, and how we should proceed.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: The doctor wants to know if my symptoms are happening all the time or only sometimes, which makes me a little anxious because I honestly don\u2019t keep perfect track. I do notice that the tingling in my fingers and toes is pretty constant now, but it kind of comes and goes in intensity. I think the dizziness happens more when I stand up quickly, but I can't always tell if it\u2019s worse at certain times\u2014maybe when I haven\u2019t eaten enough or after a busy day with the grandkids. I also worry about my legs feeling weak, especially when I walk around my garden, but I don\u2019t remember if it\u2019s all the time or just when I\u2019ve been on my feet a lot.\nANSWER: Well, the numb feeling in my hands and feet, it\u2019s there most of the time now, but sometimes it feels worse \u2014 especially if I\u2019ve been walking or if I haven\u2019t eaten much. The dizziness happens suddenly when I stand up fast, but I also get this woozy feeling sometimes when I\u2019m just sitting, like I might fall over. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything serious, but it\u2019s been bothering me because I feel kind of wobbly and tired all the time.",
