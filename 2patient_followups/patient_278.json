I should mention my symptoms and how they\u2019re affecting me, without sounding too technical or alarmed.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m 72, and I guess I just feel all mixed up lately. I keep forgetting things\u2014more than before\u2014and sometimes I see things that I don\u2019t think are really there, like little animals or something. I also feel very slow and stiff, especially in the mornings, and I\u2019ve fallen a couple of times. Oh, and I\u2019ve been acting out my dreams too, like moving around in my sleep a lot. It\u2019s all kind of scary and puzzling.",
