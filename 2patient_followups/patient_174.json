Since I saw the blood, I feel even more weak and dizzy, like I might faint, and I keep thinking it\u2019s because of bleeding. I also had nausea before, but the pain, it\u2019s just terrible \u2014 like a sharp stabbing that keeps getting worse, always worse when I move or cough.\nANSWER: Well, I think I vomited a pretty large amount of bright red blood last night, and the black stool \u2014 I mean, it looked like a lot, like almost everything I\u2019d eaten, and it was thick and sticky. Since then, I\u2019ve felt more dizzy and weak, like I might fall over any second, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because of the bleeding or what\u2019s happening. Before all this, I just had nausea and that terrible pain in my side, like a sharp stabbing that keeps getting worse and worse.",
