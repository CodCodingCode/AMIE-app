    "input": "2. A 2-month-old male infant is brought to the emergency department with progressive stridor and intermittent episodes of cyanosis, especially during feeding. The mother notes that the baby has had persistent hoarseness and mild difficulty swallowing since birth but has worsened over the past week. Physical examination reveals biphasic stridor, suprasternal retractions, and mild tachypnea without fever. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, and cardiac auscultation is normal. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrates a smooth, translucent cystic mass arising from the right ventricular fold, causing partial glottic obstruction. The prenatal history was unremarkable, and the infant was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. A neck MRI confirms a well-circumscribed cystic lesion confined to the larynx without deeper tissue invasion. The clinical picture suggests a congenital laryngeal cyst contributing to airway compromise and feeding difficulties.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should describe what\u2019s been happening with the baby and how he seems different or worse lately. I need to mention the breathing and feeding problems, but in a straightforward, simple way, without overdoing it or sounding like I understand medical terms.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m here because my baby has been having trouble breathing, especially when he\u2019s eating, and he gets really noisy when he breathes. It\u2019s gotten worse over the past week, and I\u2019m worried because he looks like he's struggling more and sometimes his skin turns kind of blue."

    "output": "Well, um, he's been making these strange noises more and more, especially when he tries to breathe or eat. Sometimes it sounds like he\u2019s struggling, and he gets really fussy during feeds. He's also been kind of tired and seems like he's not swallowing right, I guess. It\u2019s just... everything kind of seems worse lately, and I don\u2019t really know what to expect."

    "output": "Well, he's been kinda fussy sometimes during feeding, like he chokes or coughs a little. He seems more irritable and tired, and I think he\u2019s not sleeping as well as before. But I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s just because he\u2019s tiny and everything feels worse now."

    "output": "Um, he's been kind of fussy sometimes, like he seems uncomfortable, and he wakes up more during the night. He's also been making these weird sounds, kind of like he\u2019s struggling to breathe or something."

    "output": "Um, sometimes he kind of stops breathing for a little bit, and I\u2019ve seen his lips look a bit bluish when it happens, but I don\u2019t really know how often it occurs. It\u2019s scary to watch."
