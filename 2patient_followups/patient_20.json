Has it grown or changed in color or appearance since then? Also, regarding your dizziness and weakness\u2014have these feelings gotten worse or stayed the same since you first noticed them? Did your dizziness start before or after the rash appeared? And if you're comfortable sharing, how would you describe the severity of these symptoms today compared to when they first started?\"chronology_confused",
    "output": "THINKING: Wow, this all feels overwhelming and I keep mixing up when things started or what came first. I want to tell the doctor everything, but I\u2019m worried I might forget or get the order wrong, and I feel so tired and scared. I hope they understand I don\u2019t really know exactly how it all happened, just that I feel worse now.\nANSWER: Well, I think I saw the rash yesterday, like on my chest, and it looked kind of red and bumpy, but I\u2019m not sure if it got bigger or changed color since then. And the dizziness and weakness\u2014I think I started feeling more dizzy maybe last night, but I also felt weak earlier today before that. It\u2019s hard to say which thing came first and how they\u2019ve gone\u2014everything\u2019s kind of happening all at once now, and I just feel worse the more I sit here.",
