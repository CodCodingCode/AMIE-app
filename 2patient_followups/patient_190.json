I want to tell the doctor everything that\u2019s been bothering me without making it sound worse than it is, but honestly, I\u2019m scared and everything just feels so bad to me.\nANSWER: No, I haven't noticed anything strange with my vision, like spots or blurriness. But sometimes when I get these headaches or when I try to breathe, I feel kind of tingling in my hands or face, and it worries me. I did check my blood pressure at home, and it\u2019s been high lately, but I don\u2019t really remember the exact numbers. I just know it\u2019s been worse.",
