    "input": "2. A 7-year-old male is referred to a developmental pediatrician due to severe intellectual disability and absent verbal communication. The child has a history of neonatal feeding issues requiring supplemental nutrition and persistent hypotonia noted during infancy. His parents describe frequent episodes of unexplained crying, sleep disturbances, and poor eye contact since early childhood. Physical examination reveals a prominent forehead, arched eyebrows, deep-set eyes, and a small mouth with a thin upper lip. He demonstrates significant motor delays, inability to walk independently, and stereotypic repetitive movements such as hand wringing. Brain MRI shows nonspecific white matter changes without gross anomalies. Genetic analysis uncovers a pathogenic mutation in the ASXL3 gene, consistent with Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome. Supportive care involving occupational therapy, nutritional support, and behavioral management is recommended to optimize quality of life.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should be honest about the main reason I'm here, but I might also hint at feeling overwhelmed or unsure since I don't really understand everything myself. I want to ensure the doctor knows I\u2019ve been worried and that things have been hard to manage at home.\n\nANSWER: Um, I guess I\u2019m here because my boy has been really having a tough time lately, and it\u2019s making us all pretty worried. He keeps crying a lot and it\u2019s hard to figure out why, and he doesn\u2019t sleep well either."

    "output": "Um, I think it\u2019s been happening for a long time, maybe since he was really little, like just not acting like other kids and crying a lot, even when he shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s been strange seeing him do the same things over and over, and he doesn\u2019t seem to look at me much."

    "output": "Um, he doesn\u2019t really play or look like he notices other kids much. Sometimes he just stares or flaps his hands. Lately, he\u2019s been crying more and seems more upset when we try to get him to interact. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new or if he\u2019s just more tired or something."

    "output": "Um, well, he mostly just kind of does the same things every day, like sitting and watching stuff, but he's been crying more sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t really like new places or people, I think? When things change or there\u2019s new stuff, he gets really upset or just seems overwhelmed, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if it\u2019s worse now."

    "output": "Yeah, he\u2019s pretty behind on stuff like talking and walking. He barely babbles sometimes, and he\u2019s not walking on his own at all. It all feels like it\u2019s taking much longer than it should."

He hasn\u2019t had any fevers or anything that I can tell, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s had any ear infections or allergies recently."

    "output": "Um, I don't think he's lost anything exactly, but sometimes he just kind of looks away or ignores us more than before, and he doesn't really try to talk or anything like he used to maybe. It's hard to tell if he's changing or just how he is."

    "output": "Um, I think it's been kinda the same... or maybe he's a little more upset sometimes when things change, but I can't really tell if it's worse or just how it always is. Honestly, he's been pretty tough to read, so I just notice he's fussier or more withdrawn sometimes."

    "output": "Well, she... um, she has always been kind of quiet, but lately she's not really... I don't know, like she's not doing the same things she used to maybe? She doesn't look at us as much, and she doesn\u2019t seem to try to mimic or repeat things like before. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell if she\u2019s actually losing stuff, but it feels different."
