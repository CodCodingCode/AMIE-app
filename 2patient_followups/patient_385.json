    "input": "2. A 14-year-old girl is brought to the pediatric endocrinologist due to lack of menstrual periods and absent breast development, despite normal growth velocity. Her parents deny any chronic illnesses or significant family history of reproductive disorders. Physical examination reveals a Tanner stage I for breast and pubic hair development and a slight increase in height percentile compared to peers. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates hypoplastic uterine tissue and underdeveloped ovaries without follicular activity. Hormonal studies reveal markedly elevated serum FSH and LH levels with very low estradiol, indicative of primary ovarian failure. Chromosomal analysis shows a normal 46,XX karyotype, but further genetic testing identifies pathogenic variants in the BMP15 gene. There are no dysmorphic features or signs of systemic illness. She is diagnosed with ovarian dysgenesis type 2 and is started on low-dose estrogen replacement therapy to initiate secondary sexual characteristic development and promote bone health.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a teenage girl who might be feeling nervous or unsure about her situation. She may find it hard to explain her feelings or understand what's happening to her, so I should encourage her to share what\u2019s bothering her without pressure. I want to make her feel comfortable and not judged.\n\nANSWER: I guess I came because... I don\u2019t really have my period, and I don\u2019t have the breasts or anything. I feel pretty weird about it all and just wanted to find out what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s kind of confusing and a little scary."

    "output": "Um, well, I haven't really started anything like most of my friends. No breasts, no period, and I sometimes feel a bit... off or different. Honestly, I kind of worry about why my body isn\u2019t changing like it\u2019s supposed to and I feel weird about it all."

    "output": "Um, I guess I don\u2019t really notice much change, and sometimes I feel a little weird about not growing like the other girls. I\u2019ve been kinda worried if something is wrong or if it will ever get better."
