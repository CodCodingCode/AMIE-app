I don\u2019t really check my blood pressure myself, but I think it\u2019s been a bit higher lately, maybe. I haven\u2019t felt short of breath or anything when I lie down or walk, just those other symptoms I told you about, the swelling and feeling more tired. I\u2019m just worried about what this all means and if it\u2019s something serious with my kidneys or my health.",
