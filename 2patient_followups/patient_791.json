    "input": "1. A 12-year-old boy was referred to the pediatric genetics clinic for evaluation of congenital limb anomalies and unusual chest wall development. He exhibited bilateral hypoplastic thumbs and forearms, along with mild syndactyly between the second and third fingers on both hands. His mother reported that he had underdeveloped pectoral muscles and asymmetrical nipple placement, which became more noticeable during puberty. The patient also complained of occasional difficulties with fine motor tasks and some limitation in wrist movement. There was no reported family history of limb or breast abnormalities. Physical examination confirmed absent thenar muscles and nipple hypoplasia, with no signs of cardiac or renal involvement. Radiographic imaging revealed radial ray dysplasia, and genetic analysis showed a pathogenic variant in the TP63 gene. The patient was scheduled for multidisciplinary management including orthopedic intervention and endocrinology consultations to monitor development and address functional impairments.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is quite young and might be unsure or embarrassed about talking about his body or any changes he's noticed. I should keep my response simple and focus on how he's feeling physically or emotionally, and try to make him feel comfortable.  \nANSWER: I\u2019m 12, and I guess I just feel kind of weird. Sometimes my hands don\u2019t move like I want them to, and I\u2019m a little worried because I\u2019ve noticed my chest looks different now that I\u2019m getting older."

    "output": "Um, sometimes I get frustrated because I can't do things as easy as other kids, like tying my shoes or writing for a long time, and I feel kind of weird about how I look sometimes, especially when I see my chest or hands. It's a little confusing and makes me sometimes not want to do stuff or be around people."

    "output": "Well, sometimes I just feel like... I don't know, kind of strange or off, like my body is doing weird stuff I can't really explain. It makes it hard to focus on things or do stuff with my hands like I used to. I feel a little embarrassed about it too, like I don't really understand what\u2019s happening."

And at your recent check-ups, did your doctor mention anything about your growth or puberty?",
    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know about anything like a webbed neck or being short, and I don\u2019t remember my doctor saying anything special about my size or puberty time.

Are they symmetrical or asymmetrical? Have you experienced any pain, tenderness, or skin changes around your chest?",
    "output": "Um, I guess I started noticing it more as I got older, like, maybe a couple of years ago? It\u2019s kinda different on one side from the other, I think. Like, one nipple looks different or not as full or something. No, I don\u2019t really feel any pain or anything, just different, I guess. Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s supposed to be like that, or if it\u2019s gotten worse or anything."

Also, has anyone in the family experienced similar growth asymmetries or developmental concerns?",
    "output": "Um, I guess I haven't really noticed anything else odd. Sometimes my hands feel a little numb or tingly when I try to do stuff, but I don't know if that's normal or not. No one in my family has ever had anything like this, at least that I know of."
