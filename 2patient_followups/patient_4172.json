    "input": "1. A 7-year-old boy was brought to the pediatric neurology clinic due to delayed developmental milestones and challenges with speech and communication. His parents reported that he was slow to sit and walk, and he exhibits repetitive hand movements and episodes of irritability. Physical examination revealed distinct facial dysmorphisms, including a broad nasal bridge and a prominent forehead, along with hypotonia and joint hypermobility. Cognitive evaluation demonstrated moderate intellectual disability, and he showed difficulty with social interactions and adapting to new environments. Family history uncovered similar traits on the maternal side, suggesting an X-linked inheritance pattern. Brain MRI was unremarkable, but genetic testing confirmed a mutation consistent with Syndromic X-Linked Intellectual Disability Type 10. He is currently receiving multidisciplinary support with speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral interventions. The clinical team is monitoring for potential comorbidities such as seizures or cardiac anomalies, which can occasionally be associated with this condition.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to share that I'm feeling something weird and maybe a little scared, but I should keep it simple and honest. I want to explain how I feel without making it sound worse than it is, just enough to let the doctor know I\u2019m worried.  \nANSWER: I don\u2019t know, I just feel kind of different today. Like, my head feels funny and my stomach hurts a little, and I just don\u2019t really feel right. It\u2019s been like this for a while now."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really remember exactly when it started, but I guess I\u2019ve always kind of struggled with talking and moving around like other kids. Things feel harder for me, especially when I have to do new stuff, and I get pretty upset sometimes. Nothing really makes it better or worse on purpose, it just kind of happens."

    "output": "Uh, he's been, um, a little more tired than usual, I think. And sometimes he seems upset or bothered, but I\u2019m not sure why. He\u2019s been a bit more fussy and not really wanting to play or do things like he used to."

    "output": "Um, lately he's been more irritable than usual, like he gets really upset over small things, and sometimes he just seems upset for no clear reason. He\u2019s also been a bit more clumsy, knocking things over or not doing things as smoothly. I think he doesn't really like when things change suddenly, and maybe he feels more anxious? Sometimes, if he\u2019s focused on his favorite toy or watching TV, he seems calmer, but if he\u2019s tired or hungry, he gets cranky faster. I don\u2019t know if anything makes it better or worse, it just seems like he\u2019s different lately."

    "output": "Um, I don\u2019t really know if I lose my what they call awareness or if I respond or not, I just kinda zone out for a little while.

It happens maybe a few times a week, but I don\u2019t always remember what I was doing before or after."
