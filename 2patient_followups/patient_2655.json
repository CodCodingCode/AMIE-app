    "input": "2. A 5-year-old male was referred to a developmental pediatrician due to delayed milestones and limited expressive language. His parents reported that he rarely made eye contact and exhibited repetitive hand-flapping behaviors. Neurological examination revealed generalized hypotonia and mild joint hypermobility. The child had difficulty with problem-solving tasks and showed poor social interaction compared to peers. There was no history of seizures, but he experienced frequent ear infections during infancy. Brain MRI was unremarkable, and metabolic screening was normal. Family history was notable for intellectual disability in the mother\u2019s brother, suggesting an X-linked pattern. Genetic analysis confirmed a mutation in the gene associated with Mental Retardation, X-Linked 97.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The parent seems worried but maybe also unsure what exactly is going on. They might be feeling overwhelmed or confused about their child's condition and what to expect. I should keep my response simple and show understanding without overwhelming them with medical jargon.\n\nANSWER: I'm his mom, and I guess I'm just really worried because he's not like other kids his age. He doesn't talk much or look at us, and sometimes he does things over and over, and I don't know if that's normal or not."

    "output": "Um, he doesn\u2019t really play or talk with other kids much, and he seems kind of shy or maybe confused sometimes. He mostly just does his own thing, like flapping his hands or staring, and I\u2019ve noticed he doesn\u2019t look at us much either. Sometimes he gets really upset or cranky for no clear reason, and I worry it\u2019s more than just being little."

    "output": "Well, he mostly likes just playing with his favorite toys, but sometimes he gets really upset when things change or if he's asked to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do. He doesn\u2019t seem to really enjoy sitting still for long, and he sometimes gets very upset in noisy places or when he's tired."

    "output": "Well, um, during playtime, he doesn't seem to really want to play with others much. He often just kind of flaps his hands and looks away. At mealtime, he sometimes doesn't eat much and seems distracted, like he's not really paying attention. When he's with other kids or family, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't really talk or look at us much. Sometimes he gets pretty clingy or just sort of stares off."
