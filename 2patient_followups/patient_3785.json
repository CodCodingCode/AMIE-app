    "input": "2. A 45-year-old man presents with a four-month history of gradually worsening neck stiffness and radiating pain down both arms. He also reports intermittent numbness in his hands and difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning his shirt. On examination, there is hyperreflexia in the upper limbs and subtle weakness of hand grip bilaterally. MRI of the cervical and upper thoracic spine reveals several well-circumscribed, extra-axial masses along the dural lining, compressing the spinal cord at multiple levels. He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction but mentions occasional episodes of unsteady gait. His past medical history is significant only for untreated hypertension, and there is no familial history of neurological disorders. A biopsy obtained via laminectomy confirms multiple spinal meningiomas, showing typical meningothelial features. Given the multiplicity of lesions, a multidisciplinary team is considering staged surgical resection combined with careful radiotherapy planning to preserve neurological function.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is in pain and feels some weakness and numbness, which are worrying signs. They might be scared or unsure but are trying to explain their symptoms clearly. I should focus on their physical feelings and what\u2019s changed lately.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m a 45-year-old man, and I\u2019ve been having this weird stiff feeling in my neck for a few months now. It\u2019s been getting worse, and I started feeling it in my arms too, like a tingling and some weakness. Sometimes I feel a bit unsteady when I walk, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on."

    "output": "Well, it\u2019s like, the stiffness has been slowly getting worse and sometimes it feels like I can\u2019t really move my arms right, especially in my hands. I stumble a bit more when I walk, and it\u2019s harder to do things like button my shirt or hold small things. It\u2019s kind of frustrating and makes me worried because I don\u2019t know if it will get worse or if I can still do stuff the way I used to."

    "output": "Well, it kinda started slow, but lately, I feel like I\u2019m just worse or something, and it\u2019s hard to do even simple stuff like tying my shoes or holding things.
