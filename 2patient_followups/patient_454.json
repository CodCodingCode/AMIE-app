I should explain my back pain, how it's been bothering me for months and getting worse, and include the leg numbness and weakness I recently noticed. I might also mention my age and that I\u2019ve had some back problems, so the doctor understands it\u2019s been a gradual thing. I need to be clear but also honest about how it's affecting me and maybe hint at my worries about it being serious.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, I\u2019m 58 and I\u2019ve been having this nagging pain in my lower back for several months now. It\u2019s mostly just this dull ache, but lately, when I sit or bend over, it feels worse, and sometimes I even feel this kind of numbness and weakness in my legs. I also notice my legs get kind of numb after sitting a while. It\u2019s been bothering me enough that I figured I better get it checked out before it gets any worse.",

Can you tell me, do these sensations happen all the time, or do they come and go? Also, have you noticed any problems with your bladder or bowel\u2014like needing to go more often, trouble controlling them, or any leaks\u2014either now or in recent weeks?\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, this question about numbness and bowel or bladder issues makes me a little nervous. I mean, I\u2019ve noticed the numbness comes and goes, especially after sitting for a while, and I think it\u2019s worse some days than others. I haven\u2019t had any leaks or anything but sometimes I feel like I need to pee more often, even when I don\u2019t really have to go, and that\u2019s been bothering me too, especially during the night when I wake up a lot. It\u2019s all kinda confusing and I worry it\u2019s something serious, but I don\u2019t really know how all these things connect.\nANSWER: Well, the numbness in my legs kind of comes and goes, especially after sitting for long, like when I\u2019m watching TV or helping my wife in the garden. I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with my bladder or bowel, no leaks or changes like that, but I\u2019ve been waking up more at night to pee, which is kind of new for me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all related or just old age or maybe stress from work earlier in life\u2014I used to lift a lot of heavy stuff.",
