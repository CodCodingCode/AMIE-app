    "input": "1. A 3-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatric clinic by his parents due to the absence of one testicle in the scrotum, noted since birth. The mother reports that the right side of the scrotum appears smaller and less developed compared to the left. There is no history of pain, swelling, or redness in the groin area, and the infant is feeding well with normal growth parameters. On physical examination, the right hemiscrotum is smaller and has no palpable testicular tissue, while the left testicle is normal in size and consistency. No inguinal masses or hernias are palpable. Ultrasound of the scrotum reveals an absent right testis with no evidence of intra-abdominal or inguinal testicular tissue. Hormonal evaluation shows normal levels of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone and inhibin B, supporting the presence of functioning testicular tissue. The diagnosis of Testicular Regression Syndrome, likely due to antenatal testicular torsion or vascular accident, is made, and the family is counseled about surgical exploration and possible prosthesis placement.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a 25-year-old woman who is confused about her symptoms and feeling a little embarrassed. She needs to explain her feelings without sounding overly medical or specific, just showing her concern and uncertainty.  \nANSWER: I'm not feeling right, I guess. I've been kind of worried because lately, I keep feeling weird, like, tired all the time and some sort of discomfort that I can't really explain. It's been bothering me for a little while now."

    "output": "Um, I guess he's been okay mostly, but sometimes I worry about him not crying as much or seeming kinda tired more than usual. But he still feeds fine and acts okay most of the time. I'm just worried about if there's anything else I should be watching out for."
