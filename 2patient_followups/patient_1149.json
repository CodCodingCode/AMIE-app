When you say it's 'not a lot,' can you tell me if it's just a few streaks or more than a spoonful? Has the amount changed recently? Also, have you noticed your symptoms getting worse over the past couple of weeks, like more cough, fever, or feeling more out of breath? And regarding your exposure, have you been around anyone with a cough or illness, especially recently? These details will really help us figure out the best way to help you.\"tangential_storyteller",
    "output": "THINKING: Okay, I need to tell him about the blood, but honestly, I don't know how much is too much, and I feel like I\u2019m rambling. I keep thinking about my cousin who had TB and how he looked worse than me before he got help. Also, I'm worried about how I\u2019ve been feeling at work lately, like I can\u2019t catch my breath sometimes, and forgot to mention that I\u2019ve been sweating like crazy every night even with the fan on. I just want him to understand how bad it\u2019s gotten, but I keep thinking there might be other stuff I should mention too.\nANSWER: Well, doctor, the blood I cough up \u2014 I think it\u2019s just little streaks, like when I clear my throat, but sometimes it\u2019s more like it\u2019s more than a little, just a little more than spit, you know? And the cough\u2019s been really bad, worse than before, especially at night, and I get these fevers that just won\u2019t go away, I wake up drenched in sweat every night. I was just thinking, maybe it\u2019s TB or something worse, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so scared I might die, honestly. And I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more out of breath at work, and I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore.",
