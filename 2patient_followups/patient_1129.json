    "input": "2. A 10-year-old boy is brought to the endocrinology clinic for evaluation of short stature and uneven limb length. His parents note that he began showing signs of puberty at age 6, including testicular enlargement and pubic hair growth, which has progressed rapidly compared to his peers. On examination, multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait spots with irregular, \"coast-of-Maine\" borders are observed on his trunk and back. There is noticeable bowing of the left tibia and swelling over the right femur. Radiologic imaging reveals extensive fibrous dysplasia affecting multiple bones, including the pelvis and long bones. Laboratory studies show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and increased levels of sex steroids with suppressed gonadotropins, indicating peripheral precocious puberty. The patient also complains of intermittent bone pain that intensifies with physical activity. Genetic testing from affected tissue detects somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, confirming a diagnosis of McCune-Albright Syndrome.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: As a young patient, I want to be honest but also show that I am worried and maybe a little embarrassed about how I feel. I should mention the main reasons I or my parents are concerned, focusing on my symptoms and how they are affecting me.\n\nANSWER: I\u2019m 10 years old, and I\u2019ve been feeling really weird lately. My bones hurt sometimes, especially when I play, and I\u2019ve been growing faster than the other kids and... um, I think my stuff is changing faster too. My parents said I should see someone about it."

For example, does it interfere with playing, walking, or other movements? Have you noticed any other symptoms like fever, weight changes, or feeling very tired?",
    "output": "Um, the pain makes it kinda hard to run around or play like I used to. Sometimes it hurts a lot, especially after I do stuff like climb or jump. I haven\u2019t really noticed if I\u2019m losing weight or feeling super tired, but the pain is pretty annoying and makes me want to rest more."

Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth around your bones or joints?",
    "output": "Um, I think the pain gets worse when I play or run around, but resting for a little while helps a bit. I haven't really seen any redness or looked for swelling, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s there."

    "output": "He says it hurts kinda sharp and makes his bones feel really heavy, especially when he's moving around a lot. Sometimes it\u2019s worse after he runs or plays, and resting doesn\u2019t totally make it go away, but it feels a little better when he sits still for a while. He seems upset about it, but he can\u2019t explain exactly how or why it hurts."

    "output": "Yeah, um, he's like, grown up really fast recently. He started showing these, uh, signs of puberty way before other kids his age. I think it's been happening for a while, but it\u2019s kind of confusing, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s normal or not."

    "output": "Um, it\u2019s mostly just in the right leg, and sometimes it\u2019s really sharp and sudden, but other times it just kind of stays there, like a dull ache. I haven't really had any clicking or locking in the joints, but I feel kind of unstable sometimes when I walk or run."

    "output": "Um, I guess I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s just because I\u2019m growing or if something else is causing it. Rest does help sometimes, but then it comes back again. I don\u2019t really know what I should do or if there\u2019s anything I can do to make it better."
