Can you tell me if you've been feeling very thirsty all the time, or if your mouth feels very dry? Have you noticed if your skin feels more dry or your eyes look a bit sunken? Also, have you experienced any dizziness or felt faint when standing up? And regarding your fatigue, do you find it hard to stay awake during the day or notice any confusion or trouble focusing? Your answers will help me understand whether your symptoms are getting worse and if you might need further help quickly.\"information_withholder",
