Can you tell me more\u2014does the twitching happen at specific times, like when you're resting, or does it come and go unexpectedly? Also, do you notice any other movements or sensations in the area around your palate or face when this happens? And have you noticed any weakness, numbness, or changes in your voice or swallowing that you think might be related?\"worried_family_involved",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and worried because this twitching has been happening for a few months now and it's worse lately. My family is concerned too, especially my daughter, and I really just want to understand what\u2019s wrong and if it\u2019s serious. I don\u2019t know if I should be worried about my face or my brain or something, and I keep thinking about how this might affect my ability to take care of myself and others.\nANSWER: Well, the twitching kind of comes and goes, but now it's almost constant, even when I\u2019m sleeping. It\u2019s always in the back of my mouth, and sometimes I hear a clicking noise in my ear\u2014like a little click every time it happens. It started on one side, but now both sides are doing it. I don\u2019t feel any weakness or numbness or anything, but it just feels so strange, and I\u2019m really scared it\u2019s something serious.",
