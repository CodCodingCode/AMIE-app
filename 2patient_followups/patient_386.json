    "input": "1. A 16-year-old female presents to the clinic with primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. She reports never having had a menstrual period despite normal growth in height and weight for her age. Physical examination reveals Tanner stage 2 breast development and sparse pubic hair. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrates a small, underdeveloped uterus measuring significantly below the expected size for her age. She denies any chronic illnesses or prior pelvic surgeries. Hormonal assays reveal normal levels of FSH and LH, suggesting normal ovarian function. Karyotype analysis confirms a 46,XX genotype without abnormalities. The diagnosis of uterine hypoplasia is considered after excluding other causes of primary amenorrhea.\nWhat brings you in today?",
    "output": "THINKING: I should keep it simple and honest, just describing my main concern and how I feel about it. I want to seem worried but not overdramatic.  \nANSWER: Um, I guess I just don\u2019t get my period, and I\u2019ve never had it, like, ever. It kinda makes me feel weird, and I don\u2019t really know why. I\u2019ve been okay otherwise, I think."

    "output": "Umm, well, I guess I\u2019ve grown taller like everyone else, but I don\u2019t really have a lot of hair in certain places, and I haven't really gotten my period or anything, so I think some of my body is just not changing like it\u2019s supposed to? It\u2019s kinda confusing."
