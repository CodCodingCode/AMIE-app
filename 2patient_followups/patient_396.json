I want to give enough detail about my symptoms, mention my family history since it\u2019s relevant, and ask about what I should do next without sounding too confident or denying any concern. I should keep my tone gentle, a little anxious, and focus on my main worries, especially about serious problems like cancer or polyps.\nANSWER: Like I said, I\u2019ve just been feeling some dull pain in my lower abdomen, especially after meals. It\u2019s been gradually getting worse over the past few months. I haven\u2019t noticed any bleeding or big changes in my bowel habits, but I do feel a bit bloated sometimes.
