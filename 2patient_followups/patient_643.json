Along with that, I\u2019ve had this dull ache in my pelvis that doesn\u2019t go away, especially when I sit for a while, and sometimes, during intimacy, it gets sharp and excruciating.

To help me understand exactly how things are currently, could you tell me how much bleeding you're experiencing each day\u2014like, do you need to change your pad very often or notice that blood soaks through quickly? Also, have you noticed if the foul smell of your discharge has changed at all, or if you\u2019ve been having any other symptoms like night sweats, fever, or weight loss? And just to be sure, what are your thoughts about what might be causing these symptoms, and how worried are you feeling about everything right now?\"anxious_amplifier",
    "output": "THINKING: I feel overwhelmed and worried that this bleeding might be something really serious, maybe even cancer. I\u2019m scared about how much blood I\u2019m losing and whether it means it\u2019s worse than I think, and I don\u2019t really understand what all these symptoms could mean together.\nANSWER: Well, the bleeding is pretty bad now, and I have to change my pad a lot, like every hour or so, and sometimes it soaks through really quickly. The discharge smells worse than before, and I\u2019ve been having weird night sweats and feeling more tired than usual, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost weight. Honestly, I just keep thinking it\u2019s something terrible, and I worry it\u2019s cancer, or that I\u2019ve left it too long to do anything about it. I feel really anxious and I don\u2019t know if this is normal or what\u2019s going on, but I feel like it\u2019s all just getting worse and worse.",
