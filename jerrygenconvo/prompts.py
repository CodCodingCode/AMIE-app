# === Patient Interpreter Prompts ===
PATIENT_INTERPRETER_PROMPT = """TASK: Use Chain of Thought reasoning to analyze this patient's communication pattern and extract the true clinical picture.

DETECTED PATIENT BEHAVIOR: {detected_behavior}

CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_history}

CURRENT VIGNETTE SUMMARY:
{current_vignette}

YOU MUST RESPOND IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

THINKING:
Use the following Chain of Thought process:

STEP 1 - INITIAL OBSERVATION:
Let me first observe what the patient is literally saying versus how they're saying it.
- Direct statements made: <list explicit statements>
- Communication style observed: <tone, word choice, length of responses>
- Non-verbal cues in language: <hesitation, minimization, amplification>

STEP 2 - PATTERN RECOGNITION:
Now I'll identify specific communication patterns that suggest bias.
- If the patient uses minimizing language ("just a little", "not that bad"), this suggests they may be downplaying severity
- If the patient gives vague responses when asked direct questions, this suggests potential withholding
- If the patient uses catastrophic language ("terrible", "worst pain ever"), this suggests potential amplification
- If timeline responses are inconsistent or vague, this suggests memory issues or confusion

STEP 3 - BIAS IDENTIFICATION:
Based on the patterns, let me identify the specific biases affecting their reporting.
- Type of bias detected: <minimization/amplification/withholding/confusion>
- Evidence for this bias: <specific examples from conversation>
- Severity of bias: <how much it's affecting their reporting>

STEP 4 - HIDDEN INFORMATION ANALYSIS:
Now I'll deduce what information might be missing or distorted.
- What symptoms might be worse than reported? <reasoning>
- What information might they be embarrassed to share? <reasoning>
- What timeline distortions might exist? <reasoning>
- What associated symptoms might they be omitting? <reasoning>

STEP 5 - OBJECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION:
Let me reconstruct what the objective clinical picture likely looks like.
- Taking minimization into account: <adjusted symptom severity>
- Accounting for withheld information: <likely missing symptoms>
- Correcting timeline distortions: <more accurate progression>
- Considering amplified concerns: <appropriately scaled worries>

STEP 6 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Finally, let me determine the clinical implications of these communication patterns.
- How reliable is the current vignette? <assessment>
- What critical information are we missing? <gaps>
- What should the doctor probe for next? <recommendations>

ANSWER:
COMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:
- Pattern observed: <description of how patient is communicating>
- Bias detected: <what kind of bias is affecting their reporting>
- Confidence level: <high/medium/low>
- Reasoning: <why I believe this based on my step-by-step analysis>

LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION:
- Minimized symptoms: <symptoms patient is downplaying + reasoning>
- Withheld information: <information patient may be embarrassed to share + reasoning>
- Amplified concerns: <symptoms patient may be exaggerating + reasoning>
- Temporal distortions: <timeline issues or sequence problems + reasoning>

OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE:
Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include:
<Detailed reconstruction accounting for identified biases with reasoning for each adjustment>

RECOMMENDED_PROBING:
- Specific questions to ask: <targeted questions to get missing information + rationale>
- Approach strategy: <how to ask sensitively + psychological reasoning>
