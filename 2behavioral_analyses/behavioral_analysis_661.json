    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me systematically analyze this initial patient statement. The patient, Maria, begins by expressing uncertainty and fear, emphasizing her feeling of not knowing what is happening, and highlighting her concern that she might pass out or experience something worse. Her language indicates high distress, with emotionally charged phrases like \"really don\u2019t know,\" \"feels this bad,\" and \"scared.\" She also makes no attempt to minimize her symptoms; instead, she emphasizes their severity. The response is relatively short but packed with emotionally significant content that aligns with her distressed state. She doesn\u2019t seem to withhold key details here but is clearly overwhelmed. Her focus on the severity and her fear suggest her main bias may involve amplification of her symptoms, or at least a heightened perception of danger. The immediacy of her distress might also lead her to overstate certain aspects. However, she does not display denial or minimization at this point, but her emotional state is prominent.\nANSWER: THINKING: - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Maria\u2019s words are emotionally charged, using descriptors like \"really don\u2019t know,\" \"felt this bad,\" \"scared,\" \"pass out or something worse.\" She does not minimize or vague her symptoms but emphasizes their severity, indicating high emotional impact and concern. Her language suggests genuine distress but also a focus on danger, which could mean amplification bias. - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Her response is direct, concise, and emotionally driven. She talks about her feelings of fear upfront without deflecting or withholding \u2013 she\u2019s volunteering her emotional state clearly. No signs of detachment or avoidance are evident. - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: She exhibits signs of high emotional arousal, possibly over-attributing severity to her symptoms, which might lean toward amplification bias. Her distress and the urgency in her tone suggest she's possibly overestimating the seriousness at this moment, although her physical complaints are consistent with her medical background. - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Main bias type appears to involve amplification of symptoms or danger perception, driven by her acute distress. Severity seems moderate because she is highly emotionally affected but not denying her symptoms or minimizing. The bias primarily impacts her emotional reporting rather than factual accuracy. - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Likely, Maria may be overestimating how critical her condition is due to her emotional distress \u2014 her fear may lead her to perceive her symptoms as more severe than they are objectively. The actual progression seems consistent with her timeline but her emotional state might magnify her perception of how rapidly her condition deteriorated. Her self-report could be influenced by anxiety, possibly leading to over-reporting of symptom severity or urgency."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient, Maria, is expressing significant distress, which is clear from her use of emotional language (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"worried\") and physical signs such as fidgeting and clutching her chest. She describes her symptoms as worsening and urgent, but her responses also include vagueness\u2014particularly when she describes her eye feeling weird, indicating potential difficulty in pinpointing or fully articulating her experience. She emphasizes her respiratory difficulty, blue lips and fingertips, and dizziness, suggesting these symptoms are most salient for her. Her reluctance to detail her eye specifically may reflect discomfort or embarrassment, or an attempt to focus on the most alarming symptoms to seek urgent help. Her responses suggest possible amplifying of her symptoms due to anxiety, but also some minimization, as she dismisses past mild fatigue and discomfort in a way that downplays previous issues. The consistent anxiety-driven focus might lead her to over-report perceived severity, but her physical signs show genuine distress. This pattern indicates that her communication might be biased by her emotional state, with potential for overestimation of danger in some areas and underreporting or vague descriptions in others, possibly influenced by her distress and personality.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria uses emotional and distress-focused language (\"so dizzy,\" \"breathless,\" \"worried,\" \"scared\"), which indicates heightened anxiety. Her description of her eye as \"weird\" and telling the doctor she \"doesn't really know how to describe it\" reflects vagueness and difficulty articulating certain symptoms. She downplays some prior mild symptoms (\"just tired,\" \"some mild fatigue\") which could suggest minimization or a desire to focus on current severity. Her emphasis on her lips and fingertips turning blue heightens perceived urgency, indicating she is highlighting the most alarming signs. - Information flow: She responds with detailed accounts of her worsening symptoms but does not spontaneously mention sleep patterns or other systems, suggesting selective emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular concerns. Her responses are somewhat scattered\u2014initially describing overall distress, then focusing on specific symptoms\u2014showing a pattern of emotionally driven rather than strictly organized reporting. She provides additional emotional context (\"I keep worrying,\" \"I keep feeling\") when prompted, indicating a response style that becomes more elaborative under stress. - Response style: Her responses are emotionally charged, often quick and interrupted by physical cues like catching her breath or fidgeting, consistent with her distressed state. She tends to describe her symptoms in a way that amplifies her urgency, yet she labels some symptoms as \"not that bad\" when minimally describing past fatigue, indicating some degree of minimization or at least accounting for prior less severe symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Maria avoids detailed discussion of her eye, possibly due to discomfort or inability to describe it precisely, indicating a withholding or difficulty in articulating certain symptoms. She may also underplay past mild symptoms which could have been more relevant to her current condition but she chooses to prioritize the current crisis. - Minimization behaviors: She dismisses previous fatigue and chest discomfort as \"just tired\" or \"a little,\" possibly underreporting baseline issues that could provide context for her current state. - Amplification patterns: Her emphasis on symptoms such as blue lips, fainting, and severe shortness of breath suggests she is amplifying her distress\u2014likely driven by her fear of sudden deterioration or death. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There is no explicit evidence of embarrassment, but hesitation when discussing her eye or vague descriptions could indicate discomfort or shame about less typical symptoms or difficulty in understanding her own sensations. - Confusion/memory issues: Her vague references (\"like maybe it's tired,\" \"kind of feels weird\") suggest some difficulty in precise symptom description, possibly exacerbated by her distress. - Family influence: She mentions her family history of rheumatic fever, which might heighten her concern and possibly influence her interpretation of symptoms, possibly amplifying her fears of serious heart issues.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be emotional amplification, driven by her anxiety and fear, causing her to over-report severity and potential risks. There is also some evidence of minimization of baseline or past symptoms, likely due to emotional overload or desire not to appear overly concerned initially. - Severity: Moderate to severe, because her emotional state significantly influences her reporting, possibly exaggerating some symptoms like blue lips and dizziness, while underemphasizing others. Her distress may distort the clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Her perception and description of symptom severity, especially respiratory and cyanotic signs, are most influenced by her anxiety. Her description of the eye, which is vague, might also be underreported or mischaracterized. - Reliability: Her self-report is affected by acute distress, making it less objectively reliable; her overemphasis on certain symptoms and vagueness about others suggest some bias in her narrative.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be withholding detailed or accurate descriptions of less alarming symptoms or subtle signs, possibly due to distress, shame, or confusion. Her focus on severe symptoms might overshadow a broader clinical picture. - Symptoms probably minimized: Chronic mild fatigue and chest discomfort might be underreported as she concentrates on more pressing, alarming signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of passing out, needing surgery, or dying seem over-emphasized, possibly driven by her anxiety rather than clinical severity alone. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent with her report\u2014initial mild symptoms worsening over two weeks\u2014though her perception might be skewed towards emphasizing recent deterioration due to anxiety amplification."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient frequently describes her symptoms with words like \"just\" (\"just tired,\" \"just sitting\"), which can downplay severity. She mentions her chest as feeling \"tight\" and \"like I can't catch my breath,\" but refrains from describing pain as \"excruciating\" or \"unbearable,\" possibly indicating an attempt to minimize discomfort. Her description of her eye feeling \"weird\" and \"maybe tired\" suggests vagueness and an attempt to soften the symptoms. The phrase \"like I can\u2019t get enough air\" could be an exaggeration, potentially amplifying her distress. - Amplifying language: She uses strong words like \"really bad,\" \"fainting,\" \"dizzy,\" \"scared,\" and \"really scared,\" which indicate high emotional distress and possible amplification of her symptoms due to anxiety. - Vague language: Phrases such as \"kind of feels weird,\" \"maybe it's tired,\" and \"like I can't get enough air\" suggest she may be uncertain or hesitant, possibly trying to avoid specific details. - Emotional language: She shows clear signs of anxiety and fear, with words like \"scared,\" \"really hard to breathe,\" \"worried,\" and \"dizzy.\" Her tears and sense of urgency further emphasize her emotional distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her responses are detailed but include emotional qualifiers, which can suggest an attempt to evoke sympathy or emphasize distress. She provides extensive symptom descriptions when asked about her overall state, indicating a tendency to elaborate when she wants to communicate urgency. - Directness: Despite generally answering directly, she tends to use vague descriptors, perhaps attempting to avoid overstatement or due to uncertainty. - Information volunteering: She voluntarily provides a chronological account of symptom worsening, showing willingness to share key details but with emotional qualifiers that may distort actual severity. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent regarding the timeline of symptom worsening, but her descriptions of severity fluctuate between downplaying (\"just tired\") and amplifying (\"really bad,\" \"fainting\").  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitation in describing her eye sensation (\"I guess I\u2019m anxious about what might be wrong\") and focusing more on breathing and cyanosis suggests she might be withholding or minimizing certain sensations. - Minimization behaviors: Her frequent use of \"just\" (\"just sitting,\" \"just tired\") indicates an attempt to downplay symptom severity. - Amplification patterns: Words like \"really bad\" and \"so scared\" suggest amplification of her distress, likely influenced by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her hesitance about describing her eye feels like a subtle self-consciousness about her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant evidence of confusion; her timeline appears cohesive. - Family influence: The consistent mention of family history of rheumatic fever might influence her health concerns, possibly heightening her worry.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification and possible symptom minimization co-occurring. Her anxiety likely causes her to inflate her distress (\"really scared,\" \"fainting\") while also downplaying some sensations with \"just tired\" or \"kind of feels weird.\" - Severity level: Moderate. Her emotional distress seems to influence her reporting significantly, but her detailed timeline suggests her core concerns are genuine. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity around breathing and cyanosis (\"look like I\u2019m not getting enough oxygen\") are likely exaggerated. She might also be minimizing or ambiguous about the eye sensation. - Reliability: Moderate to high; her detailed history supports her concerns, but her emotional state may distort perceived severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might be withholding or minimizing details about her eye sensation and specific degree of chest discomfort. She may also be overstating her fear to elicit reassurance. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity of her cardiovascular compromise might be worse\u2014she could be unaware of or unwilling to articulate the true extent of her cyanosis or hypoxia. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety-driven expressions (\"really scared,\" \"scared I might pass out\") could be magnifying her perceived danger. - True timeline: Symptoms have indeed worsened over two weeks, but the emphasis on rapid deterioration and emotional reactions might exaggerate the actual trajectory.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotional, often vague language (\"kind of feels weird,\" \"like I can't get enough air\") and emphasizes distress with words like \"really bad\" or \"so scared.\" These choices suggest emotional amplification but also some minimization to avoid alarming the clinician. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about key symptoms\u2014shortness of breath, cyanosis, fainting\u2014but her descriptors are emotionally charged, which may bias her overall reporting. - Response style: She tends to elaborate when describing symptoms, with a pattern of emotional overstatement, and sometimes uses ambiguous words to soften the perceived severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitation when describing her eye sensation and her use of vague language may indicate some withholding of minor symptoms or uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just tired\" and \"kind of feels weird\" to describe symptoms suggest she is minimizing their true impact. - Amplification patterns: Her frequent use of \"really bad,\" \"so scared,\" and descriptions of cyanosis and fainting support an emotional exaggeration of her distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but hesitation around the eye symptom indicates subtle discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: Her awareness of rheumatic fever in her family might heighten her health anxiety, contributing to amplification.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification influenced by anxiety, coupled with some minimization of less overt symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional responses likely skew her perception, but her detailed account indicates genuine concern. - Areas most affected: Her perception of oxygen deprivation and chest discomfort are most biased, with possible exaggeration. - Reliability: Moderate, as her emotional state influences her descriptions, but her observable signs (cyanosis, fainting) support real severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be underreporting or unaware of the full extent of her eye sensation issues or the subtle signs of hypoxia. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual degree of cyanosis and hypoxia might be worse than described, as she could be downplaying her eye or mild chest sensations. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of passing out or having heart failure are likely intensified by her anxiety, potentially overestimating her immediate danger. - True timeline: The progression over two weeks appears accurate, but her emotional reactions might make the current state seem more urgent than it truly is."

    "analysis": "THINKING: STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses words like \"kind of,\" \"like,\" and \"some,\" indicating vagueness and a tendency to downplay or minimize her symptoms. She describes her eye as \"weird,\" \"red and swollen,\" and \"kind of hurts,\" which suggests discomfort but with non-specificity. Her mention of \"not seen anything weird in my vision\" downplays possible visual symptoms, while her statement that she \"feels more tired\" and that her chest symptoms are \"worse\" indicates some awareness of worsening but lacks precise detail. Her tone appears anxious and somewhat embarrassed, evident in her hesitant explanations and focus on her physical sensations without elaborating on emotional impact.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Her responses tend to be brief and somewhat guarded, especially when describing her eye, showing reluctance to fully describe her discomfort. She offers some details about the progression (\"it\u2019s gotten worse over these past few days\"), yet remains vague about the severity (\"kind of hurts,\" \"red and swollen\"). Her answers are somewhat reactive\u2014she responds directly to questions about her eye but avoids elaborating on her overall state, indicating possible hesitation or discomfort in sharing full information immediately.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of information withholding include her non-specific description of her eye discomfort and minimal elaboration on other symptoms, especially when asked about visual changes or associated symptoms like headache or fever. The downplaying of her eye redness and swelling, coupled with focus on her breathing and blue fingertips, suggests she might be more concerned or worried than she's letting on. No clear evidence of exaggeration or amplification of concerns; rather, she seems to underreport her eye issues.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The primary bias appears to be minimization\u2014she downplays her eye symptoms and possibly her overall severity to avoid alarming herself or others. The bias is moderate, as her descriptions are vague but consistent with her anxious state; she acknowledges worsening symptoms but avoids detailed explanation, which could hinder accurate assessment. The most affected areas are her eye and the overall severity of her condition, with potential underreporting of visual symptoms and emotional distress.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Most likely, she's not fully revealing the extent of her eye involvement, possibly minimizing its severity or significance. She might also be underplaying her overall health deterioration, focusing more on breathing and cyanosis, which she perceives as more urgent. Her anxiety may lead her to overemphasize certain fears (like passing out) but understate others (like her eye condition). The reported timeline suggests rapid worsening, but her non-specific language indicates she may not be fully aware of the seriousness or may be trying to avoid alarming herself or the clinician.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She favors vague and non-specific terms like \"kind of,\" \"like,\" \"some,\" and \"weird,\" indicating a tendency to downplay or avoid detailed descriptions. Her emotional tone is anxious but guarded, avoiding explicit descriptions of her eye symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant or cautious, providing limited information initially, and responds reactively rather than proactively elaborating on her symptoms. - Response style: Responses are brief and guarded, with occasional emotional undertones. When describing her eye, she mentions discomfort but avoids detailed or assertive language, possibly to obscure the full extent of her issue.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The vagueness about her eye symptoms and reluctance to describe visual changes suggest she may be withholding the true severity. Her focus on breathing issues possibly diverts attention from her eye concerns. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her eye as \"weird,\" \"red and swollen,\" and \"kind of hurts,\" which downplays possible more serious visual or inflammatory problems, potentially minimizing the eye's clinical significance. - Amplification patterns: She displays some distress and anxiety about her breathing and cyanosis, but her descriptions partially minimize her discomfort related to her eye, indicating she may not be fully aware of or willing to acknowledge the seriousness there. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitancy and vague language suggest she might feel embarrassed or unsure about describing her eye issues or worried about appearing overly anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; her timeline appears consistent, though her language may reflect emotional distress more than factual uncertainty. - Family influence: Her background with rheumatic fever might influence her awareness of possible complications but doesn't show clear external influence on her current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization, particularly about her eye symptoms and possibly the overall severity of her condition. - Severity: Moderate, as her language suggests a tendency to understate symptoms but not outright deny them, which could impact clinical judgment. - Areas most affected: Eye symptoms and overall perceived severity are most biased; her responses might underestimate visual or inflammatory issues. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat reliable for her breathing and cyanosis but less so for her eye symptoms, which she downplays, making clinical correlation essential.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Most likely missing information: She probably isn't fully communicating the severity or nature of her eye issues, such as possible redness, swelling, or pain, which could be clinically significant. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her eye redness and swelling, which could be signs of inflammation or infection, are likely understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about dying or passing out is evident and may be exaggerated, but it also indicates genuine distress. - True timeline: Her symptoms may have developed more rapidly or severely than she reports, especially if her emotional state leads her to understate or fragment her history. She may also be experiencing more significant visual or inflammatory symptoms than acknowledged."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Phrases like \"kind of swollen,\" \"feels a little sore,\" \"not really hurting a lot,\" \"just that it looks different,\" indicate downplaying symptom severity. - Amplifying language: Descriptions of the eye being \"swollen,\" \"red and tender,\" and \"sensitive to light\" suggest some acknowledgment of discomfort but without strong emotional exaggeration. - Vague language: The use of \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" and \"sometimes\" suggests non-specificity in their descriptions, possibly indicating reluctance to provide precise details. - Emotional language: Feelings of being \"worried,\" \"anxious,\" and \"noticing that it looks different\" reflect some emotional concern but mixed with uncertainty.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are concise but include some additional details (\"feels kind of swollen,\" \"sensitive to light\"). They respond directly but with some hedging. - Directness: The responses are generally direct regarding the eye symptoms but are somewhat vague about the severity (\"kind of swollen,\" \"not really hurting a lot\"). - Information volunteering: Patient tends to give minimal details unless asked explicitly, but does mention that the eye currently looks different and is tender. - Consistency: The responses are consistent with previous descriptions; no contradictions appear.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Apparent reluctance to describe the eye as very painful or worsening, possibly to avoid seeming overly concerned or to minimize the issue. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"not really hurting a lot\" and \"just that it looks different\" suggest downplaying the actual severity. - Amplification patterns: Patient verbalizes significant respiratory distress and cyanosis, which are objectively serious, but appears somewhat dismissive about the eye's problem. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild discomfort when discussing the eye and response to their own symptoms suggest some internal discomfort with certain symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear contradictions or inconsistencies. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but given her family history, she might feel compelled to minimize symptoms to avoid alarm, although this is speculative.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Evidence points to symptom minimization, especially about the eye \u2014 describing it as \"kind of swollen\" and \"not hurting a lot\" despite potential concern. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 she downplays the eye symptoms, potentially to avoid alarm or because she's uncertain of their seriousness. - Areas most affected: Eye symptoms are likely being minimized; respiratory symptoms are described more openly but still with some vagueness. - Reliability: Their self-report of eye symptoms may be less reliable; respiratory symptoms seem more vividly expressed, making those more trustworthy.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully aware of or may be intentionally downplaying the severity of her eye condition; she might also underreport the degree of her respiratory distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: The seriousness of the eye swelling, redness, and sensitivity might be greater than expressed. Respiratory symptoms seem more evident. - Concerns probably amplified: General worry about health (\"what's wrong,\" \"maybe serious\") is genuine but might be intensified due to anxiety, possibly leading to over-reporting symptoms like dizziness. - True timeline: The timeline seems consistent; she reports progression over two weeks, with recent worsening; likelihood of some underestimation of symptom severity, especially minor sensations.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses somewhat vague and minimizing language (\"kind of swollen,\" \"not really hurting a lot,\" \"looks different\"), likely to diminish perceived severity. - Information flow: She responds directly but with hesitations and qualifiers, suggesting some reluctance to fully disclose or emphasize seriousness; tends to volunteer limited details unless prompted. - Response style: Responses are concise yet include some hedging, indicating cautiousness or uncertainty, consistent with a tendency to downplay or avoid alarm.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague and minimizes descriptions (\"kind of swollen,\" \"not hurting a lot\") suggest the patient might be holding back the true extent of her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying eye symptoms despite potential clinical significance, possibly to avoid causing concern or out of uncertainty. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity of respiratory issues more openly, indicating that these are more genuinely distressing or frightening. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild discomfort in discussing the eye symptoms, possibly feeling vulnerable about its appearance or seriousness. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident inconsistency. - Family influence: Not direct, but her familiarity with rheumatic fever may influence her perception of symptoms, perhaps leading her to minimize concern for the eye or overemphasize breathing problems.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization bias, especially regarding the eye, likely influenced by uncertainty or a desire to avoid unnecessary worry. - Severity: Moderate, since she is downplaying the ocular symptoms even though they could be significant. - Areas most affected: Eye symptoms are most biased; respiratory symptoms are more openly expressed but still contain qualifiers. - Reliability: Self-report of eye symptoms may be less reliable, warranting cautious interpretation; respiratory reports seem more credible.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of ocular involvement, possibly with more serious features like increased pain, discharge, or vision changes, is understated. - Symptoms probably minimized: Eye severity\u2014potentially requiring urgent examination\u2014is underrepresented. - Concerns probably amplified: Overall anxiety about health may lead her to overemphasize certain symptoms (\"fainting,\" \"blue lips\") though those are visually alarming. - True timeline: Unlikely to be significantly inaccurate, but the degree of severity for her eye issue may be underestimated."
