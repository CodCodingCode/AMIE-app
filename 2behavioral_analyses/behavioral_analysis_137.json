They describe their symptoms with straightforward, factual language\u2014\"red and it hurts,\" \"sensitive \nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: Predominantly specific and direct, with clear descriptions of symptoms; minimal use of vague or emotionally charged language, indicating openness. However, the phrase \"I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on\" suggests some uncertainty.\n- Information flow: Responds promptly and voluntarily offers key details, demonstrating organized and forthcoming communication; few signs of withholding.\n- Response style: Balanced\u2014neither overly elaborative nor minimalistic; responses are appropriate and measured, reflecting confidence in symptom description but some underlying hesitation.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Minimal; while the patient states they are unsure about the cause, they do not appear to hide or omit vital symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Little evidence; symptoms are described plainly, suggesting they are reporting rather than minimizing.\n- Amplification patterns: Absent; the patient does not exaggerate symptoms but mentions the rapid progression, which is clinically relevant.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight indication when they note \"I feel a bit embarrassed about the floaters and the light sensitivity,\" but it doesn't significantly impede sharing.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion or memory difficulties; their timeline is consistent.\n- Family influence: Not indicated in their responses, though they mention family history, which shows awareness of medical background.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mostly accurate reporting with mild cautiousness, possibly influenced by fears of stigmatization or misunderstanding of symptoms.\n- Severity: Mild to moderate; overall, their responses seem honest, but the slight hesitation about the cause indicates some internal bias or emotional defensiveness.\n- Areas most affected: Slight underplaying of emotional impact rather than symptoms, with subtle signs of embarrassment about floaters.\n- Reliability: Fairly reliable; their descriptions are consistent and detailed, but being aware of potential underreporting of distress levels is prudent.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: They may not fully articulate their emotional distress or fears about potential vision loss, possibly underplaying concerns.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The distress related to floaters or the severity of visual changes might be understated.\n- Concerns probably amplified: They might be slightly over-worried about the speed of symptom progression, but this appears well-founded.\n- True timeline: Their reported rapid worsening aligns with typical anterior uveitis presentation; no clear discrepancies are evident.\nIn summary, the patient presents as straightforward and honest but exhibits mild hesitation likely rooted in embarrassment or uncertainty, which could mask some emotional reactions. Their symptom reporting appears credible, with minor signs of cautiousness."

These choices suggest some reluctance or discomfort with certain topics\u2014possibly out of fear or embarrassment about personal or stigmatized symptoms.\n- Information flow: Responses are generally organized but somewhat guarded, with initial detailed description and subsequent minimal answers to specific follow-up questions. They seem willing to share enough to be understood but avoid elaboration on certain aspects, indicating selective disclosure.\n- Response style: The patient balances brief, direct answers with hints of hesitation (\"Um\") and qualifiers, reflecting probably a cautious or avoidant response style\u2014avoiding elaboration on sensitive details.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of vague language (\"kind of blurry,\" \"really red\") and reluctance to affirm the presence of flashes/shadows suggests withholding or minimizing peripheral symptoms that may be distressing or complicated.\n- Minimization behaviors: Descriptions focus on discomfort but lack intensity; they avoid emphasizing severity, indicating potential minimization of symptoms like pain or visual disturbances.\n- Amplification patterns: No significant amplification; reporting appears measured and plausible.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Initial hesitation (\"Um\") and the vague dismissal of certain symptoms indicate possible discomfort or embarrassment about revealing more detailed or subjective visual phenomena, such as shadows or flashes, which might seem alarming or stigmatized.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Responses are consistent and logical; no signs of confusion.\n- Family influence: Mention of autoimmune family history suggests awareness of the seriousness but doesn't seem to influence withholding, more likely informing symptom concern.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main concern is \"information withholding,\" especially regarding symptoms perceived as embarrassing or less objectively observable, such as flashes or shadows.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014The patient provides primary symptoms honestly but withholds or downplays certain details, possibly affecting diagnostic clarity.\n- Areas most affected: Visual phenomena like flashes/shadows, subtle discomfort signals, which could be crucial to accurate assessment if underreported.\n- Reliability: Moderate\u2014Core symptoms for uveitis are well communicated, but auxiliary symptoms may be underestimated, requiring thorough probing.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The clinician may not get full details on specific visual disturbances like flashes or shadows, which are important in ocular inflammation assessment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Visual phenomena and perhaps pain intensity could be underestimated, risking underappreciation of severity.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s focus on certain symptoms might be driven by worry, but explicit signs of over-worry or catastrophizing are limited.\n- True timeline: The rapid onset over two days appears accurate; responses are consistent and plausible, suggesting actual progression.\nThis analysis indicates the patient is somewhat guarded, especially about specific visual symptoms, necessitating careful, empathetic follow-up questions to elicit full details for accurate diagnosis."

There is emotional discomfort indicated by hesitations, suggesting they are not fully comfortable sharing detailed symptoms.\n- Information flow: They are somewhat reluctant or guarded, providing minimal details unless prompted. When asked about specific symptoms, responses are cautious and circumscribed.\n- Response style: Responses are brief, with some elaboration when describing general symptoms but minimal detail about specific phenomena, likely due to embarrassment or uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient consistently omits or downplays detailed descriptions of visual disturbances, possibly to avoid anxiety or embarrassment. For example, denying noticing flashes but describing visual phenomena suggests selective disclosure.\n- Minimization behaviors: Using vague terms such as \"kind of blurry\" and \"little shapes\" to describe symptoms indicates effort to downplay severity.\n- Amplification patterns: Slight expressions of worsening (\"getting worse pretty fast\") indicate concern, but overall responses are guarded rather than alarmist.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitations (\"Um,\" \"I don\u2019t really understand\") and vague language imply discomfort discussing specific symptoms, possibly due to shame or fear.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Admits to not understanding symptom significance, but no evidence of factual inconsistencies.\n- Family influence: No notable indication in responses, though family history of autoimmune conditions might impact their perceptions indirectly.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: \"Information withholding\" dominates, with the patient intentionally or unconsciously omitting or softening some symptoms\u2014likely to avoid alarm or due to embarrassment.\n- Severity: Moderate bias, since core symptoms are relayed but with caution and vague descriptions, which could hinder complete clinical understanding.\n- Areas most affected: Visual phenomena like flashes or shadows are most biased, as these are described with reluctance or vagueness.\n- Reliability: Moderate; general symptoms are conveyed, but critical details might be underreported, implying some caution in relying solely on their verbal report.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The clinician should anticipate that more alarming visual phenomena (flashes, shadows, moving areas) may be present but are underreported due to patient discomfort or embarrassment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Any serious complications involving retinal detachment or severe inflammation are likely underemphasized by the patient.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient displays some genuine concern related to worsening symptoms but does not overstate fears, suggesting a realistic but guarded perspective.\n- True timeline: Rapid worsening within two days appears credible and aligned with their account, but their guarded responses suggest some details about symptom severity could be understated."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses systematically.\n\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\n- Minimizing language: The patient frequently uses soft qualifying words like \"just,\" \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" suggest\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and qualifying language (\"kind of,\" \"just,\" \"a little\") which suggests a tendency to downplay or self-censor symptom severity. Emotional words like \"scary\" indicate expressed distress but may serve to emphasize their discomfort.\n- Information flow: Responses are somewhat hesitant, with partial disclosures, often hedging or expressing uncertainty, indicating reluctance or difficulty in fully describing symptoms. They tend to volunteer some details but avoid precise descriptions.\n- Response style: They respond tentatively, with elaborations mainly when discussing emotional state, but remain brief or vague when describing symptoms, reflecting possible discomfort or uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The consistent use of vague terminology and expressions of uncertainty point toward mild withholding or difficulty articulating symptoms comprehensively.\n- Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"pretty quickly\" and \"little shapes\" likely serve to minimize perceived severity or impact.\n- Amplification patterns: Emotional language like \"scary\" and \"overwhelmed\" suggests they are amplifying their distress to communicate concern or seek reassurance.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt embarrassment, but hesitance and vague descriptions could hint at discomfort discussing symptoms perceived as abnormal.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The frequent use of uncertain language indicates some confusion or difficulty in accurately conveying symptom characteristics.\n- Family influence: While no direct signs, the mention of family autoimmunity may heighten their health anxieties, influencing their responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Response uncertainty coupled with mild to moderate minimization and emotional amplification.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014responses are affected enough to warrant cautious interpretation; some descriptions may underestimate actual severity, while emotional words could overstate distress.\n- Areas most affected: Visual symptoms (\"floaters,\" \"flickers\") owing to vague descriptions, and emotional response to symptoms.\n- Reliability: Moderate\u2014responses are partially reliable but should be cross-verified with objective findings due to hedging and emotional influence.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise details on symptom frequency, duration, and severity; the true impact might be more significant than expressed.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The quick resolution descriptions and soft language may hide ongoing or severe visual disturbances.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional descriptors might overstate distress levels, affecting perceived urgency.\n- True timeline: The rapid onset fits with clinical expectations but patient\u2019s uncertainty may obscure the full trajectory of symptom development.\n# Short Answer\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\n- Minimizing language: The patient frequently uses soft qualifying words like \"just,\" \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" suggesting an attempt to downplay the severity or clarity of symptoms (\"I don't really understand what it means,\" \"they seem to come and go pretty quickly\"). This indicates possible minimization or uncertainty.\n- Amplifying language: Phrases like \"kind of scary,\" \"a little scary\" imply some emotional distress, possibly amplifying concern to justify their level of worry.\n- Vague language: Use of terms like \"stuff,\" \"little images,\" \"kind of,\" \"looks like,\" shows vague descriptions, possibly due to embarrassment, uncertainty, or difficulty articulating symptoms.\n- Emotional language: Words like \"scared,\" \"worry,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"scared\" show emotional distress, but also suggest the patient may be amplifying emotional concern slightly to communicate distress or seek reassurance.\nSTEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS:\n- Response length: They tend to give short or medium-length responses but become more descriptive when discussing their feelings (\"it's kind of scary...\"). Longer elaborations often occur when expressing emotional reactions, possibly indicating comfort in sharing fears rather than factual details.\n- Directness: Responses are generally somewhat indirect, hedging (\"I guess,\" \"I'm not really sure how to explain\"). This suggests reluctance or difficulty in fully trusting or understanding the symptoms.\n- Information volunteering: The patient offers some details proactively (\"little shapes drifting,\" \"flickers\") but uses vague descriptors, indicating partial disclosure possibly constrained by discomfort or uncertainty.\n- Consistency: Their descriptions are consistent regarding the presence of visual disturbances, though there are fluctuations in clarity about frequency and intensity, which could reflect genuine symptom variability or inconsistent reporting.\nSTEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION:\n- Information withholding signs: The use of vague terms and the acknowledgment of uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t really know,\" \"I guess\") suggest some withholding or reluctance to fully describe symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just... kind of annoying\" and \"they seem to come and go pretty quickly\" might downplay severity, hiding how impactful or persistent the symptoms are.\n- Amplification patterns: Emotional descriptors such as \"scary\" and \"overwhelmed\" indicate they may be magnifying emotional distress to communicate urgency or seek empathy.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but hesitance in explanation and use of vague language may imply mild discomfort discussing symptoms.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The patient seems unsure about the nature of their symptoms (\"I don\u2019t really understand what it means,\" \"I don\u2019t really know how to explain it\"), indicating some confusion or difficulty in describing complex visual phenomena.\n- Family influence: No clear evidence of family influence in responses, but their mention of family history of autoimmune conditions could contribute to heightened concern.\nSTEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be **response uncertainty coupled with mild minimization**, possibly attributed to embarrassment or fear.\n- Severity: Moderate \u2014 the patient\u2019s vagueness complicates accurate assessment; their emotional responses could distort symptom severity perception.\n- Areas most affected: Visual disturbances (\"floaters,\" \"flickers\") are described vaguely, possibly underestimating their impact; emotional descriptors may inflate concern about the seriousness.\n- Reliability: Self-reporting is somewhat compromised; responses are tinged with uncertainty, hedging, and emotional overtones, so clinical interpretation should consider this.\nSTEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Specific details about symptom frequency, intensity, and impact are underreported or described vaguely. The patient may be experiencing more persistent or severe visual disturbances than fully communicated.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The quick resolution implied by \"pretty quickly\" and \"just little shapes\" could be an underreporting of their persistence or severity.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Descriptions like \"scary,\" \"overwhelmed\" suggest emotional amplification; their distress may be heightened beyond objective severity.\n- True timeline: The recent onset and progression appear consistent, but their uncertainty indicates they may not fully grasp or remember symptom patterns accurately."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will systematically review the patterns in the patient's responses, focusing on language, response behaviors, and potential biases. The patient's language frequently\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient prefers vague, non-specific language (\"kind of flickers,\" \"little images,\" \"come and go\") and uses tentative words (\"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" \"not really\") that soften the description of symptoms. They often qualify statements with \"I guess\" or \"sometimes,\" which reduces clarity and indicates hesitance. Such language suggests discomfort in fully articulating their experiences or an attempt to downplay severity. Their emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"worried,\" \"honestly\") are present but restrained, implying internal conflict or reluctance to express concern openly. Overall, responses balance between minimal detail and emotional cues, leaning toward self-protective vagueness.\n- Information flow: The patient initially shares some symptoms when prompted but then offers partial or non-committal answers to questions about frequency, duration, and severity. They seem to avoid elaborating on specific aspects, possibly to prevent exposing perceived vulnerabilities or because they are uncertain themselves. There is a pattern of response hesitation, particularly when asked to quantify or describe the intensity, suggesting discomfort or uncertainty about their symptoms.\n- Response style: Responses are concise, somewhat scattered, and often contain qualifying language, which diminishes directness and detailed reporting. They tend to respond appropriately to direct questions but with hedging, mirroring a pattern of guarded disclosure. This behavior indicates a tendency toward information withholding, especially about how severe or disturbing their visual phenomena truly are.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The consistent use of vague terminology (\"kind of flickers,\" \"sometimes,\" \"a little\") and qualifying language hints at reluctance to provide full details. The patient seems to prevent full disclosure of symptom severity, possibly out of fear or shame.\n- Minimization behaviors: By describing symptoms as \"kind of\" or \"a little,\" they appear to downplay potential urgency or severity, which might mask the problem's actual seriousness.\n- Amplification patterns: There is minimal evidence of exaggeration; instead, the patient underreports or softens symptoms, suggesting minimization rather than amplification.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The tentative language and discomfort expressed (\"don't really know how to explain,\" \"kind of annoying and, honestly, a little scary\") suggest potential embarrassment or discomfort discussing symptoms that may evoke concern or shame, like visual disturbances.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion or memory gaps; responses are coherent, but their vagueness may stem more from emotional reluctance than cognitive impairment.\n- Family influence: The initial vignette notes a family history, but there is no explicit evidence in responses of family influence affecting their answers.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant pattern is a minimization bias, where the patient underreports or softens descriptions of symptoms to avoid concern or judgment. The hesitation and hedging reinforce this, indicating a tendency toward guarded reporting.\n- Severity: Moderate. While the patient does acknowledge experiencing symptoms and their recent onset, their tendency toward vagueness and downplaying makes it difficult to gauge true severity. The responses suggest they may be underestimating the distress or impact, which could lead to underassessment.\n- Areas most affected: Accurate assessment of symptom severity and frequency is most compromised. They understate how often and how intense the symptoms might be, which impacts clinical decision-making.\n- Reliability: Their self-report is somewhat unreliable due to avoidance of full disclosure, requiring clinicians to probe carefully for more detailed information or corroborate with objective findings.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient is probably withholding or minimizing the true severity of their visual disturbances, especially the disruptive or alarming aspects such as the severity of floaters or flickering lights. They may also be underreporting how much these symptoms affect their daily life.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The impact and emotional distress related to their symptoms are likely greater than portrayed. Their soft language and hesitation suggest they're downplaying potential danger, which could delay urgent interventions.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient appears genuinely worried (\"scared,\" \"worried\") but is reluctant to express the full extent of their alarm. Their reluctance may stem from fear of appearing overly anxious or from shame about their experience.\n- True timeline: The timeline the patient reports appears consistent with recent onset, but their underemphasis on the severity could obscure how rapidly symptoms might have worsened or persisted, necessitating further probing.\nIn summary, the patient's communication pattern is characterized by deliberate vagueness and downplaying of symptoms, mainly driven by psychological hesitation or discomfort. Such bias toward minimization underscores the need for careful, probing follow-up questions and potentially corroborating with objective findings to ensure accurate assessment and timely management."

Emotional words like \"scared\" and \"overwhelmed\" show distress but are balanced with qualifiers, possibly to soften descriptions.\n- Information flow: The patient provides moderate details but with disclaimers, suggesting reluctance or discomfort. Their responses seem organized but moderated, likely to avoid exaggeration or underplaying.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborated but peppered with qualifiers, indicating a cautious approach. They tend to answer directly but with hedging, reflecting internal uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of hedging (\"I think,\" \"kinda,\" \"maybe\") and qualifiers suggest some withholding or uncertainty about the full extent of symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just recently\" and cautious wording suggest an attempt to minimize the severity or immediacy of symptoms.\n- Amplification patterns: Emotional expressions such as \"overwhelmed\" and \"scared\" may magnify overall distress, but symptom descriptions remain cautious.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous qualifiers imply possible discomfort discussing symptoms perceived as serious or alarming.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent with the described timeline.\n- Family influence: The mention of family autoimmune history might heighten concern but doesn\u2019t seem to bias responses overtly.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: \"Information withholding\" (hedging language) is most prominent, reflecting reluctance or uncertainty.\n- Severity: Moderate bias due to frequent qualifiers that may mask the true severity or frequency of symptoms.\n- Areas most affected: Symptom intensity, triggers, and variability are most biased; details are softened or uncertain.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses provide a reasonably accurate account but likely understated due to cautious language.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient may not fully disclose the frequency or severity of visual disturbances, possibly underestimating their clinical significance.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Visual phenomena may be more persistent or intense than described.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The emotional distress indicates genuine anxiety that could be overrepresented in verbal responses, but potentially they worry more than they communicate.\n- True timeline: Symptoms probably appeared suddenly as reported, but the patient\u2019s cautious language suggests they might perceive or report them as less severe than their actual experience."

You have no recent trauma but do have a family history of autoimmune conditions.Can you tell me if any of the flashes of light, shadows, or moving shapes you've seen come suddenly and feel very bright or alarming, especially when you\\u2019re looking in certain directions or changing your position?information_withholder\", \"output\": \"THINKING: I feel a bit overwhelmed by all these new, strange things happening to my eye.

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I first examine the language the patient employs. The patient describes seeing \"some sort of flashing lights or shadows\" and admits that these are \"kinda jarring\" and \nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague, non-specific language (\"some sort of flashing lights,\" \"kinda startling,\" \"kind of\"), indicating discomfort or reluctance to specify symptoms clearly. There is a tendency to soften or downplay potential concerns.\n- Information flow: Responses tend to be brief and somewhat guarded, with minimal elaboration, especially about symptoms perceived as more alarming. They seem hesitant to fully disclose details unless directly prompted.\n- Response style: Their answers are concise, often non-committal, and show signs of avoidance or uncertainty. They are willing to acknowledge but not fully detail disturbing sensations.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The use of vague terms (\"sort of,\" \"kind of\") and expressions like \"I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s normal\" suggest hesitance and potential withholding of more alarming concerns, particularly about the flashes or shadows.\n- Minimization behaviors: The patient appears to downplay the severity of their visual symptoms, describing them in uncertain terms and avoiding asserting that they are severe or dangerous.\n- Amplification patterns: Not evident\u2014responses are cautious and non-exaggerative.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: There's a subtle discomfort around symptoms that could imply serious eye issues; hesitations and uncertainty may be signs of unease.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of cognitive confusion; responses are consistent but cautious.\n- Family influence: Mention of family history indicates that family health may influence responses but doesn\u2019t directly show external influence on their disclosures.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: This pattern suggests an underreporting bias\u2014specifically, a tendency to withhold or minimize key symptoms, likely driven by discomfort, uncertainty, or fear.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014important physical symptoms are described with vagueness, which can impact clinical assessment accuracy.\n- Areas most affected: Visual phenomena (flashes/shadows) are most impacted\u2014the patient\u2019s descriptions are non-specific, indicating possible underreporting.\n- Reliability: While core symptoms are acknowledged, the subtle withholding and vague language imply some level of underestimation; thus, self-reporting must be interpreted with caution.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient may be experiencing more severe or frequent visual disturbances than reported, especially if they are hesitant to detail them fully.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Visual symptoms like flashes might be more problematic than the patient indicates, potentially critical for diagnosis.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s cautious language suggests they might be over-worried or anxious about their eye issues, yet minimized in their descriptions.\n- True timeline: The patient reports sudden onset within two days, which likely aligns with reality; however, the degree of distress or severity may be under-communicated due to discomfort with the topic.\nThis analysis indicates the importance of probing further with supportive, non-threatening language and perhaps confirming symptom severity through functional questions, given their tendency to withhold or soften reports."
