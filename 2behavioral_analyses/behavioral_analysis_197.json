    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will systematically deconstruct the patient's responses along the five steps.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient employs emotionally charged and descriptive language, such as \"really red and sore,\" \"like a stabbing pain,\" and \"bright lights hurt so much.\" These phrases reflect genuine distress and fear. There are no evident minimizations (e.g., saying symptoms are \"not that bad\") nor vague descriptions; their language is specific and vivid, indicating high emotional engagement. The use of \"really\" and expressions of concern (\"I'm really worried\") emphasizes anxiety rather than downplaying severity.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: The patient responds directly to the initial question with detailed symptom descriptions, suggesting openness in describing her current experience. She does NOT show reluctance or ambiguity in sharing her symptoms. Instead, her responses are elaborative and consistent when discussing symptom progression and fears. She voluntarily offers additional details, such as symptom worsening and personal fears, indicating a willingness to communicate distress.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of emotional distress, such as tearfulness and gestural cues (covering her eye, shielding it), indicate genuine concern. No overt signs of withholding, minimization, or embarrassment are evident; her language and behaviors seem authentic and uninhibited regarding her symptoms. There is no apparent confusion or inconsistency in her timeline or account; her narrative is coherent.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The primary bias appears minimal; her communication is straightforward, emotionally expressive, and consistent. Her anxiety may amplify her perception of severity, but her detailed descriptions suggest accurate reporting rather than distortion. Severity of communication bias is low; her openness and clarity make her responses reliable for clinical assessment.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is unlikely that significant symptoms are being concealed or minimized. However, her anxiety may lead her to overemphasize her fears of blindness or permanent damage, potentially inflating her perceived threat level. Her emotional state might also cause her to focus more on worst-case scenarios, although her detailed symptom report appears trustworthy and comprehensive.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, emotionally expressive language (\"stabbing pain,\" \"bright lights hurt so much\") indicating genuine distress. Her descriptions are detailed and vivid, lacking vagueness or minimization. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, providing thorough symptom details without hesitation, and responds directly to questions. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and emotionally charged, with consistent narratives aligned with her expressed anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evidence; she openly shares her symptoms and concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Absent; she consistently emphasizes severity. - Amplification patterns: Her anxiety-driven fears about blindness may overstate actual risk, but her detailed subjective reports suggest accurate perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None; her emotional expression appears authentic. - Confusion/memory issues: No, her timeline and symptom description are coherent. - Family influence: None observed in her responses; her account seems internally consistent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Predominantly emotional amplification of symptoms due to anxiety, leading to heightened perception of severity. - Severity: Mild; her vivid descriptions and openness mitigate concern about distortion, though her anxiety may exaggerate perceived threat. - Areas most affected: Her appraisal of symptom severity and potential prognosis, influenced by fear of vision loss. - Reliability: Good; her detailed, consistent reports lend confidence in her self-reporting despite anxiety-induced overestimation.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of any denial or minimization that anxiety might cause, but current signs suggest she is candid. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not much evidence; her descriptions reflect heightened concern but not obvious denial. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of blindness and severity are likely magnified by anxiety rather than factual inaccuracy. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to be worsening as she reports; her explicit statement aligns with real progression, and her behaviors support genuine distress.  In summary, Maria's communication exhibits high emotional involvement aligned with her anxiety, but her descriptions are detailed, consistent, and trustworthy. Her primary bias is emotional amplification, yet her openness suggests reliable self-reporting for clinical assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses systematically. First, examining her phrasing for signs of minimization or exaggeration. She states her symptoms began \"maybe a couple of days ago,\" noting it was \"red and a little sore,\" which suggests a tendency to downplay initial symptoms with the word \"just\" and \"a little,\" indicating shielded detail. As symptoms worsened, she describes the pain as \"really red and sore,\" and \"it hurts a lot,\" showing an increase in severity that possibly surpasses what she initially reports, hinting at some amplification of discomfort. Her description of \"not thinking much of it\" initially indicates possible minimization of seriousness at onset, but her emphasis on worsening indicates she recognizes escalation, yet perhaps still reluctant to fully convey severity early on.  Response-wise, she provides brief, chronological descriptions without much elaboration unless prompted, demonstrating response pattern of initial under-sharing and eventual openness about worsening symptoms. She answers questions directly about timeline, but tends to use vague qualifiers like \"a couple of days ago,\" not providing precise dates, which could suggest some uncertainty or an unconscious attempt to obscure the exact progression. She seems more forthcoming when describing the current severity, but less detailed about prior aspects unless asked.  Behavioral indicators pointing towards information withholding include her initial statement, minimizing symptoms with \"just noticed\" and \"not much,\" potentially to avoid admitting concern or severity at first. She also appears somewhat overwhelmed, perhaps hesitant, but not overtly embarrassed about sharing symptoms\u2014more likely an anxious response than shame.  As for bias severity, the main issue is a likely tendency to minimize early symptoms and perhaps overemphasize current distress, reflecting response bias influenced by anxiety. Given her heightened emotional state, severity is moderate; she navigates between minimization and amplification but remains largely trustworthy with careful interpretation.  Implications suggest the early timeline and severity may be underreported, and her current concern likely reflects genuine distress. She might be over- or underestimating specific aspects, but overall, her report appears reasonably accurate when cross-verified with physical findings.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague qualifiers like \"just\" and \"maybe\" to downplay initial symptoms, but shifts to more emotive and specific language (\"hurts a lot,\" \"really red\") when describing the worsening, indicating a possible bias towards minimizing early issues and amplifying current discomfort. - Information flow: Initially reluctant to share detailed onset information, possibly withholds early symptom severity, becoming more detailed as her distress grows. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded initially, more open with explicit prompts. - Response style: She tends to give brief, chronological responses that become more detailed with prompting, showing a pattern of initial withholding followed by disclosure under pressure.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Early vague descriptions (\"a couple of days ago,\" \"not much at first\") suggest she's hesitant to fully disclose the initial severity or how worried she was, possibly to avoid appearing overly anxious or to mask the problem's gravity initially. - Minimization behaviors: Using \"just\" and \"a little\" when describing initial symptoms indicates she may have minimized the initial seriousness. She might not have fully appreciated or admitted the seriousness early on. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions later (\"hurts a lot,\" \"really red\") may be genuine but also could reflect amplification of her current discomfort due to anxiety or fear, especially given her distressed tone. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There\u2019s no clear evidence suggesting shame or embarrassment; more, her nervousness likely stems from fear. - Confusion/memory issues: No notable inconsistencies; her timeline appears coherent but somewhat vague, which might reflect anxiety rather than confusion. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence in responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response bias involving initial minimization of symptoms, transitioning to amplified concern as symptoms worsen. - Severity: Moderate\u2014early underreporting with later overemphasis on severity influenced by anxiety, affects reliability in early history but less so in current state. - Areas most affected: The initial onset and severity of symptoms are most biased; she underplays when symptoms first started, possibly delaying help-seeking. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her current description of symptoms is likely accurate; early accounts may be understated, so clinical judgment should consider potential underestimation of initial severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She probably minimized her early symptoms, possibly underrepresenting initial severity or delay in recognizing importance, which can affect early assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: The initial onset may have been more severe than described, since patients tend to downplay early issues; also, her emotional distress suggests more significant concern than portrayed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current fear of permanent damage and visual loss might be somewhat magnified by anxiety, but these are valid fears, and her distress indicates genuine concern. - True timeline: The progression likely started more insidiously, with initial symptoms less severe than she states, then rapidly worsening, typical in uveitis cases; her reporting may understate early discomfort."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses systematically. Starting with language choices, the patient uses words like \"just\" and \"a little\" when describing initial symptoms, which may indicate minimization of their initial experience. The use of \"really bad\" and \"really fast\" suggests amplified concern about how quickly and severely symptoms have progressed. The vivid descriptions of stabbing pain and floaters demonstrate emotional distress and fear, but also the potential exaggeration of symptom severity.  In response pattern analysis, the patient provides a summary of onset and worsening without much hesitation, indicating a tendency to disclose essential details. However, the progression is described as rapid and severe, which could be an attempt to communicate urgency. Responses are consistent with their expressed concern, yet they seem to focus heavily on pain and visual disturbance, possibly overshadowing less noticeable symptoms like initial discomfort.  Behavioral indicators point to potential information withholding about prior health or autoimmune history, possibly due to discomfort or perceiving it as less relevant. The mention of feelings like being overwhelmed and scared, combined with vivid symptom descriptions, suggests high emotional arousal accompanied by possible exaggeration. There\u2019s no clear evidence of shame, but some response patterns hint at a reflex to magnify the urgency.  As for bias severity, the main influence appears to be symptom amplification driven by fear\u2014particularly regarding vision loss. The severity level seems moderate to high, given the patient's emotional distress and vivid symptom description. Biases most affect the description of pain, progression, and urgency, which could influence clinical prioritization.  Clinically, these behaviors suggest that while the patient's self-report includes critical signs, she may exaggerate urgency due to anxiety, and possibly understate baseline or antecedent autoimmune status. The true timeline may be more gradual initially but feels accelerated to her emotionally. Her worry about severity and prognosis might be somewhat magnified, impacting her perception of the threat and response.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient alternates between specific, vivid descriptions (\"stabbing pain\", \"floaters\") and minimizes initial symptoms with words like \"just\" and \"a little.\" Her emotional language underscores distress, but her tendency to focus on worst-case scenarios indicates amplification. Her responses are organized around her fears and symptoms, showing a pattern of emphasizing severity. - Information flow: She discloses key symptoms proactively but may withhold or less clearly state prior health details, possibly due to discomfort or perceiving them as less relevant. Her responses are generally organized, but she seems particularly focused on describing progression and pain. - Response style: She elaborates on symptoms with emotional qualifiers, providing detailed descriptions. Her answers tend to be expressive and sometimes exaggerated, aligning with her anxious personality.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Potential reluctance to disclose autoimmune history fully, perhaps perceiving it as less directly relevant or feeling embarrassed about underlying health issues. - Minimization behaviors: Initial symptoms are described as \"just\" red and sore, potentially downplaying their severity early on. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes \"really bad,\" \"really fast,\" and describes her pain as \"like a stabbing inside,\" highlighting heightened concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt evidence, but the tendency to describe symptoms exaggeratedly might reflect an attempt to seek urgent care, possibly masking underlying hesitation. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indication, responses are consistent. - Family influence: No explicit influence evident; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom amplification rooted in anxiety, especially about vision loss, influences her description of severity and urgency. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as emotional distress appears to amplify perceived threat; this impacts her reporting especially of pain and sudden progression. - Areas most affected: Pain intensity, rapid progression, and worry over vision loss are most biased; baseline or autoimmune health details may be underreported. - Reliability: Self-reporting is influenced by emotional state, so caution is needed; symptoms may be exaggerated, especially in urgency and intensity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about prior autoimmune symptoms, autoimmune disease management, or subtle prior ocular issues are possibly underreported. She might be hiding or minimizing past health concerns. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial discomfort and autoimmune background may be understated; early symptoms might have been less severe than described, but she frames progression as rapid, possibly overstating actual timeline. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of blindness and severity are likely exaggerated; her distress emphasizes perceived urgency, which may lead to overestimation of danger. - True timeline: Nature of symptom progression might be more gradual initially, with her emotional state causing her to perceive it as sudden and severe."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Let me examine the specific words and phrases used. - Minimizing language: The patient says, \"It started maybe a couple of days ago, I just noticed my eye was red and a little sore, but I didn\u2019t think much of it at first.\" The phrase \"a little\" and \"didn't think much of it\" suggest minimization. - Amplifying language: In subsequent responses, she describes her pain as \"really bad,\" \"really painful,\" \"so much,\" and \"hurts so much.\" The phrase \"sharp stabbing pain\" highlights perceived severity. - Vague language: Usage of \"maybe,\" \"a little,\" and \"kind of\" indicates some vagueness about initial symptoms. - Emotional language: She expresses feelings of being overwhelmed, scared, and her statement \"I keep thinking maybe it's something serious\" shows anxiety. Descriptions like \"really bad\" and \"hurts so much\" show emotional distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her responses tend to be concise when asked about specific timelines (\"It started maybe a couple of days ago...\"). Longer elaborations occur when she describes the progression and her fears. - Directness: She answers questions with some directness but often adds emotional qualifiers, e.g., \"I keep thinking maybe it's something serious,\" which indicates concern but also uncertainty. - Information volunteering: She volunteers minimal info about her history (\"I don\u2019t really know much about eye stuff\") and most details come after prompting. She shows reluctance to disclose prior issues unless asked explicitly. - Consistency: Her responses are fairly consistent, emphasizing rapid worsening and fear.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She delays providing concrete history about prior eye problems, autoimmune issues, and previous episodes, suggesting possible withholding or discomfort discussing potentially embarrassing or concerning details. - Minimization behaviors: Initial statement that symptoms \"started maybe a couple of days ago\" with \"a little sore\" despite later reports of severe pain suggests initial minimization. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"hurts so much\" and \"really bad\" show heightening of her subjective experience, which may reflect anxiety amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her statement \"I don\u2019t really know much about eye stuff\" might indicate discomfort in discussing her own medical knowledge, possibly also feeling vulnerable. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about the timeline (\"maybe a couple of days\") and the sequence suggests some uncertainty. - Family influence: Mentions of \"family history of autoimmune diseases\" show awareness but no evidence she feels pressured or influenced by others actively.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be pain or symptom amplification driven by anxiety; she exaggerates the severity of pain and urgency. - Severity level: Moderate, as her descriptions of pain and worsening are heightened, but she reports consistent timeline info. - Areas most affected: Her pain severity and concern about vision loss are most biased; she overemphasizes the rapid worsening and severity to seek reassurance. - Reliability assessment: Her self-report may overstate the pain level and urgency due to anxiety; history and physical exam would clarify actual severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport previous mild eye issues or autoimmune symptoms, possibly minimizing prior episodes or systemic involvement. - Symptoms probably minimized: She downplays initial symptoms as \"a little sore,\" which may have been more significant internally or initially more mild than she perceives. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of permanent damage and sudden severity suggest anxiety-driven overestimation of danger. - True timeline: Symptoms likely started subtly and worsened rapidly, but her reports emphasize a swift progression\u2014this may be accurate but could be emotionally magnified.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotive and subjective descriptors (\"hurts so much,\" \"really bad\") that heighten perceived severity, yet also incorporates vagueness (\"maybe a couple of days,\" \"a little sore\"). She balances emotional distress with some factual reporting but often dilutes initial symptoms with minimization. - Information flow: Initially hesitant to disclose detailed past medical history, providing limited info until specifically prompted; her responses are organized but tend to be emotionally driven, with some scattered concern about severity. - Response style: Tends to be concise and emotionally expressive. She elaborates more when describing fears and her perceived deterioration but remains somewhat guarded initially.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Delay in fully disclosing previous eye or systemic issues, possibly due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplays initial symptoms as \"a little sore,\" despite later describing severe pain, indicating possible underreporting or minimization. - Amplification patterns: She overstates pain (\"hurts so much,\" \"really bad\") to emphasize urgency, likely driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The comment about her limited knowledge suggests mild discomfort discussing her health literacy, which could also mask deeper concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about timeline (\"maybe a couple of days\") and symptom onset, reflecting uncertainty or emotional distress. - Family influence: Mention of autoimmune history indicates awareness but not necessarily external influence on her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom amplification related to anxiety, affecting her perceived severity and urgency. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she accurately reports rapid worsening but may exaggerate the intensity of pain and distress. - Areas most affected: Pain severity and urgency related to visual symptoms, as her descriptions are emotionally charged. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her emotional state likely inflates perceived severity; her timeline and some initial symptom descriptions should be interpreted cautiously.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Prior subtle or mild eye symptoms and baseline ocular health, which could influence management. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial soreness and mild discomfort, which may have been more than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of blindness and rapid deterioration, which seem driven by anxiety rather than purely objective findings. - True timeline: Symptoms likely began subtly and escalated quickly; her emotional reaction emphasizes severity, which could distort the clinical sense of urgency."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"No, I\u2019ve never had anything like this before,\" suggesting an attempt to downplay or deny previous issues possibly to avoid seeming overly health-anxious or to minimize perceived severity. - Amplifying language: She describes her symptoms as \"really bad,\" \"so red,\" \"hurts so much,\" \"sharp stabbing pain,\" which indicates some degree of emotional exaggeration, perhaps driven by fear. - Vague language: She mentions \"I don\u2019t really know much about eye stuff,\" indicating uncertainty or low knowledge about her condition. - Emotional language: Phrases like \"really worried,\" \"fear,\" \"I don\u2019t want to lose my sight,\" and the mention of feeling embarrassed about discussing her eye suggest underlying anxiety and emotional distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her responses are brief and straightforward, likely due to discomfort or anxiety, with minimal elaboration unless prompted. - Directness: She answers simple questions directly (\"No, I\u2019ve never had anything like this before\") but avoids or skirts around more detailed history unless explicitly asked (\"No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve hurt my eye\"). - Information volunteering: She tends to withhold details unless directly asked, such as avoiding mentioning past autoimmune symptoms unless prompted, indicating possible discomfort or reluctance. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent but limited, reinforcing her tendency to restrict information to essentials, possibly due to shame or fear of judgment.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She explicitly states she hasn't experienced similar issues before, possibly underreporting minor prior symptoms or autoimmune history due to discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays previous medical issues (\"No, I\u2019ve never had anything like this before\") despite her history of mild autoimmune symptoms, which may be underreported. - Amplification patterns: She describes her current symptoms as \"really bad,\" \"hurts so much,\" which could be emotional exaggeration driven by fright. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Expressing reluctance to share full medical history (\"I don\u2019t really know much about eye stuff\") and overtly stating she might withhold info suggests possible embarrassment or shame. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports no prior issues, but her lack of detailed history indicates possible difficulty recalling or reluctance to share nuance. - Family influence: No explicit evidence; responses seem internally motivated rather than externally influenced.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely a combination of information withholding and emotional amplification biases, primarily withholding detailed medical history out of discomfort or lack of knowledge, while possibly overemphasizing current symptoms due to anxiety. - Severity: Moderate - her reluctance to share complete history impacts assessment accuracy; emotional exaggeration may skew perceived severity. - Areas most affected: Past medical and autoimmune history are most biased; her perception of the severity of current symptoms may also be exaggerated. - Reliability assessment: Moderate - current complaints seem plausible but may be amplified; her limited sharing suggests some details are missing or minimized.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be withholding details about prior autoimmune symptoms, minor eye issues, or exposures that could refine diagnosis; her limited history impacts understanding of systemic risk factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: She possibly underreports prior autoimmune conditions or mild symptoms that could be relevant. - Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional distress and anxious language suggest her worries about vision loss may be overemphasized. - True timeline: The reported rapid worsening might be accurate, but given her anxiety, some perception of speed and severity could be exaggerated compared to actual progression.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses both emotional and somewhat vague language, such as \"really bad,\" \"hurts so much,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know much about eye stuff,\" combining emotional distress with uncertainty, which can obscure precise clinical details. - Information flow: She is reluctant and guarded, offering only minimal details unless directly questioned, indicating a tendency to withhold info and a limited willingness to share full context. - Response style: Her answers are concise, possibly due to discomfort, and she avoids elaborating unless prompted, which suggests possible hesitance or anxiety-driven response.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She explicitly states no prior issues, potentially to minimize or avoid unnecessary explanations, or due to embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying previous autoimmune symptoms despite her history, indicating possible internal minimization of her systemic issues. - Amplification patterns: She describes her current symptoms with strong, emotional language (\"really bad,\" \"hurts so much\") that likely overstates the severity due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: She admits she does not know much about eye issues, possibly feeling ashamed or insecure about her medical knowledge or experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: Limited details about prior health conditions suggest possible difficulty recalling or reluctance to disclose past minor symptoms. - Family influence: Not explicitly indicated; responses appear dominated by her own perceptions rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main biases are emotional amplification and information withholding, with some minimization of her past systemic symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as her guarded responses and emotional language influence the completeness and accuracy of her self-report. - Areas most affected: Her autoimmune history and prior eye health are most biased; her current symptom severity may also be exaggerated. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014while current symptoms are plausible, incomplete history and emotional exaggeration suggest caution when relying solely on her self-report.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about her prior autoimmune symptoms, past eye issues, and environmental exposures are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her prior health background might be more complex than she admits; she may have mild autoimmune or ocular symptoms she omits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of losing sight and the description of pain could be overstated due to anxiety. - True timeline: The rapid progression may be accurate, but her heightened emotional state might lead her to perceive or report it as faster or more severe than it is.  This comprehensive analysis suggests careful follow-up and sensitive probing are essential to obtain accurate information for diagnosis and management."
