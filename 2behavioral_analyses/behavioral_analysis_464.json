    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze her responses step by step. First, language analysis: she describes her symptoms using phrases like \"really sick,\" \"fever that comes and goes,\" \"feel cold and sweaty a lot,\" \"muscles and joints hurt all over,\" and \"felt very tired.\" These are relatively vivid but also somewhat general descriptions. She says \"just feel like I might be really sick,\" which indicates some degree of minimization\u2014perhaps trying not to alarm herself or others. Her mention of recent travel to a malaria-endemic area is explicit and important.  Next, response pattern analysis: she provides a succinct summary initially, volunteering her travel history and recent symptoms without much prompting. Her responses are straightforward; she answers directly to questions about her symptoms and history. She does not volunteer extensive details beyond her immediate concern, likely due to anxiety. Her communication appears organized: she consistently emphasizes her worry about malaria and her HIV status, showing a pattern of linking her symptoms to her known risk factors.  Regarding behavioral indicators: her language shows mild minimization (\u201cfeel really sick\u201d vs. \"excruciating\" or \"terrible\") but not outright denial. She seems open and cooperative, so withholding is minimal. Her concern-driven language (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"I just feel like I might be really sick\") suggests some anxious amplification of her health worries. Her body language cues (fidgeting, leaning forward, covering mouth) are consistent with anxiety and discomfort, which fit her verbal expressions. She does not show obvious embarrassment nor avoidance of specific topics. Her timeline seems clear, with symptoms starting three days ago and gradually worsening, but her focus on her travel and pregnancy indicates she is attentive to their relevance.  In terms of bias severity: her primary bias appears to be mild anxiety amplification\u2014she is understandably worried about malaria and her pregnancy, which amplifies her concern but does not distort her symptom descriptions significantly. Slight minimization exists, perhaps to avoid frightening herself or from cultural tendencies to downplay symptoms, but overall, her report seems reliable with some emotional overlay.  Clinically, the main concern is that her anxiety might cause her to overemphasize or misinterpret certain sensations, but her explicit mention of specific symptoms and their timeline suggests her account is fairly accurate. However, she might be minimizing the severity of her fatigue or joint pains if she is trying to stay positive or avoid panic.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses clear, specific language for key symptoms (\"fever that comes and goes,\" \"muscles and joints hurt all over,\" \"feeling really tired\"). There is mild minimization (\"really sick\" rather than more descriptive terms), and emotional language reflects her worry, especially when mentioning her travel and pregnancy. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming, volunteering her travel history, symptoms, and concerns without much hesitation. Her responses are organized, indicating a conscious effort to communicate effectively but with underlying anxiety. - Response style: She provides elaborated descriptions when describing her symptoms, but her responses are also concise, indicating a focus driven by concern rather than excess detail. Her tone suggests openness and cooperation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal. She openly states her history and symptoms, likely because she perceives the importance of sharing these details. - Minimization behaviors: Possible mild downplaying through language like \"really sick\" rather than more extreme descriptors; she avoids alarmist language. - Amplification patterns: She seems slightly worried but doesn\u2019t exaggerate symptoms beyond typical concern expressions; some worry about severity, possibly amplifying her perception of risk. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident\u2014she appears comfortable discussing her health. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: She mentions living with family but does not indicate family input affecting her responses much; her answers seem internally consistent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild anxiety amplification influencing her health perception, especially regarding malaria and her pregnancy. - Severity: Moderate. Her concern is genuine but may lead her to interpret benign sensations as more serious. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity may be slightly exaggerated; her concern about malaria and HIV could lead to heightened distress. - Reliability: Generally credible, but her emotional state suggests some overestimation of severity, so her self-report should be interpreted with awareness of anxiety's influence.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of tolerable symptoms or minimization of fatigue severity; she might downplay ongoing discomfort if she fears worsening or being perceived as overreacting. - Symptoms probably minimized: Fatigue, joint pains, or other subtle symptoms may be understated if her focus is on her acute concerns. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of severe illness, especially related to malaria and her pregnancy risks, may cause her to overestimate danger beyond objective findings. - True timeline: Symptoms onset three days ago with a gradual increase; her report aligns with typical malaria presentation, but her emotional state might intensify perceived severity."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states \"I just feel like I might be really sick,\" which suggests some downplaying of certainty; she avoids definitive claims about severity. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"really bad,\" \"terrible headaches,\" \"so tired all the time,\" and \"trying to stay calm\" imply that she perceives her symptoms as severe and distressing. - Vague language: She uses expressions like \"I don\u2019t know,\" \"like I might be really sick,\" which indicates uncertainty or fear rather than precise descriptions. - Emotional language: Words such as \"worried,\" \"don\u2019t know,\" \"I feel very bad\" show emotional distress and concern about her health.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides detailed descriptions when describing her symptoms, suggesting openness but perhaps anxiety-driven elaboration. - Directness: Answers her questions directly but inserts uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"maybe\"), indicating some reluctance to assert certainty. - Information volunteering: She volunteers a lot of context about her travel and feelings, but avoids specifics like exact fever readings or prior health issues beyond HIV. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent across her descriptions\u2014emphasizing her concern and symptoms, indicating reliability in reporting her experiences.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She seems eager to share symptoms, so little evidence of withholding. - Minimization behaviors: She calls her symptoms \"really bad\" but also states \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong,\" possibly downplaying the potential severity initially but overall no strong evidence of deliberate minimization. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes how bad she feels, possibly magnifying her distress to seek reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of discomfort about her HIV status or travel history, but slight hesitation when discussing how serious her symptoms may be. - Confusion/memory issues: Some uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t know\"), but no obvious confusion or memory lapses. - Family influence: No explicit evidence of family involvement affecting her responses.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven bias; her slight hesitations and emotional language suggest she may overestimate the seriousness due to worry, particularly about her pregnancy and HIV. - Severity level: Moderate; her expressed concern is genuine, but her hesitance and the possible magnification of symptoms could skew clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Perception of severity and certainty\u2014she emphasizes how bad she feels but is unsure about the diagnosis, which may lead her to overreport subjective discomfort. - Reliability assessment: Mostly reliable in her symptom descriptions, but her emotional state indicates some bias in severity perception.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about specific symptom progression (e.g., fever pattern, other signs), previous health status, medication adherence, or other comorbidities. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be underreporting the level of danger because of her anxiety (\"don\u2019t know if it's serious,\" \"I just feel very bad\" but less about specific objective measures). She might not fully convey the urgency she feels internally. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about malaria and her pregnancy might lead her to overestablish the severity, possibly making her perceive her condition as worse than it clinically is. - True timeline: She reports symptoms starting three days ago with gradual onset; her narrative seems consistent, but her emotional distress might lead her to perceive the timeline as more urgent or severe.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged words like \"really bad,\" \"terrible,\" and \"so tired,\" which convey distress. She also employs vague expressions (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"like I might be really sick\") that indicate uncertainty or anxiety. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer lots of context about her feelings and travel history but is somewhat cautious, seeking reassurance, suggesting openness overall but with underlying worry. - Response style: She provides elaborated descriptions that are mostly direct but flavored with emotional qualifiers, indicating genuine concern but also anxiety-driven exaggeration.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; she seems willing to share her symptoms, but the hesitations suggest internal concern rather than secrecy. - Minimization behaviors: Occasional softening of severity (\"really bad\" vs \"so bad\" might indicate some attempt to appear manageable), but overall her level of distress suggests she communicates her experience openly. - Amplification patterns: Her repetitive emphasis on how unwell she feels and her fears about seriousness suggest some emotional amplification to elicit reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, though hesitant phrasing about severity could reflect internal discomfort about her health status or fear of diagnosis. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about the status of her symptoms but no evidence of confusion about facts. - Family influence: No clear evidence, although her expressions of concern may be influenced by her familial status and worries about her pregnancy.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-related bias; her worry about her health, her pregnancy, and the unfamiliarity with her symptoms predisposes her to perceiving her condition as more serious. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she openly expresses distress and concern, which could influence how she reports symptoms but doesn't appear to distort facts intentionally. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity and certainty about her state, possibly leading her to overstate how ill she feels. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy in presenting her symptoms, but her emotional state indicates that her subjective distress may inflate perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Objective measures such as fever pattern, other systemic signs, medication adherence, or prior testing results. - Symptoms probably minimized: Given her anxiety, she might underreport or not fully recognize signs that are less obvious to her, potentially understating severity. - Concerns probably amplified: She over-worries about being seriously ill, which could lead to seeking urgent care or overestimating danger. - True timeline: Likely accurate, as her report is consistent, but her emotional distress might make her perceive the timeline as more urgent\u2014possibly overstating her distress level in the current context."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully analyze the language and response patterns the patient exhibits across her responses. Starting with her speech, she uses words like \"really sick,\" \"terrible,\" \"fever that comes and goes,\" \"feels cold and sweaty,\" \"head hurts,\" and \"tired all the time,\" which suggest significant discomfort, with some emphasis on severity but also possible exaggeration for reassurance or to gain attention. Her repeated use of concern-related phrases such as \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong,\" \"worried,\" and \"especially since I\u2019ve been in that malaria place\" indicates high anxiety about her health, potentially amplifying worries around her recent travel and symptoms.  In response to questions, her responses are fairly detailed, but she tends to focus heavily on the distressing aspects of her symptoms, which may lead to over-reporting or emphasis on worse-case scenarios. She volunteers some information about her travel and HIV status but might withhold or downplay other details, such as specific symptom history before travel or whether she experienced similar symptoms previously, indicating possible selective sharing driven by anxiety.  Her behaviors, like rubbing her forehead or neck, leaning forward, yawning, and seeking eye contact, show discomfort and concern but do not strongly suggest withholding information overtly. Her responses seem somewhat variable\u2014sometimes emphasizing how bad she feels, other times seeking reassurance\u2014indicating emotional distress influencing her communication style.  Overall, these patterns suggest moderate bias. Her heightened concern might lead to overestimating symptom severity, and her anxiety could cause her to magnify worries about her illness, perhaps exaggerating the urgency or anticipated severity. She appears to understate or omit less concerning details, possibly to keep the focus on the worst-case scenarios.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs both specific descriptions like \"fever that comes and goes,\" \"head hurts,\" and \"muscles and joints hurt,\" but also uses emotionally charged words like \"terrible\" and \"really sick,\" indicating an amplification of her distress. Her repetition of worries about malaria and her pregnancy reflects heightened concern influencing her speech. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer detailed, emotionally laden descriptions, especially emphasizing her discomfort and worries. Responses are organized around her primary concerns but may lack broader context or detailed symptom timeline outside what directly relates to her fears. - Response style: Slightly elaborate, with a tendency to dwell on her distress and seek reassurance. She does not avoid discussing her fears but might overemphasize her symptoms to convey severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Occasional reluctance to fully describe previous health status outside the current symptoms; possibly withholding prior mild symptoms or less severe episodes to keep focus on current concerns. - Minimization behaviors: There is little evidence that she is downplaying her symptoms; rather, she emphasizes their severity, which suggests she might not be minimizing but rather amplifying her distress. - Amplification patterns: She consistently uses strong language (\"really sick,\" \"terrible,\" \"need urgent treatment\") and focuses on severe aspects, possibly over-interpreting her symptoms as worse than they are. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but she seems somewhat anxious and seeks reassurance, possibly indicating some discomfort or shame about her health being in question. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline is consistent (symptoms started three days ago, gradually worsening). - Family influence: Her reference to traveling to a high-malaria area and concern for her pregnancy suggests external influences heighten her worry, but no direct signs she is being coerced or heavily influenced during her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification bias, characterized by her overstatement of symptom severity and urgent concerns, likely stemming from her health worries related to pregnancy, HIV, and recent travel. - Severity: Moderate, since her focus on severe symptoms and excessive concern could distort the clinical picture, yet she generally provides coherent, relevant information. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and urgency; she tends to overstate how ill she feels, which might lead to overestimating the health threat. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014she provides detailed, emotionally charged information, mostly consistent, but her anxiety may lead to over-reporting symptoms' severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Less severe or mild symptoms that might suggest a milder course or alternative explanations; for example, she might underreport subtle or early signs of other illnesses due to her focus on urgent symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Potential underlying conditions that are asymptomatic or less distressing but important\u2014possibly early HIV-related symptoms or other infections she hasn't mentioned. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about malaria and her pregnancy being at risk, leading her to overstate severity and urgency. - True timeline: The gradual onset over three days aligns with typical early malaria or viral illness, but her perceived severity and concern may exaggerate the actual clinical progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient consistently uses \"just\" when describing symptoms, such as \"just the fever, chills, and body aches,\" indicating possible downplaying of symptom severity. - Amplifying language: She describes her experience as \"feeling really bad\" and refers to her symptoms as \"terrible\" and \"worst,\" which may reflect genuine distress or emotional amplification. She also describes her fatigue as \"so tired all the time,\" emphasizing exhaustion. - Vague language: Phrases like \"I don't know what\u2019s wrong\" and \"feels really bad\" are non-specific, suggesting possible uncertainty or reluctance to specify severity. - Emotional language: She shows concern and anxiety, e.g., \"I feel really worried,\" \"I don\u2019t want anything to happen,\" indicating genuine apprehension and caring about her pregnancy.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides detailed descriptions when describing her symptoms, but responses to questions about her eyes or other specifics are brief, possibly to avoid discussing symptoms she considers less relevant or to minimize concern. - Directness: She answers straightforwardly to direct questions but tends to respond minimally about topics she may be uncomfortable with (\"No, I haven't noticed anything strange with my eyes\"), suggesting reluctance or inability. - Information volunteering: She offers much information about her symptoms proactively, showing openness in that area, but is more reserved when asked about eye symptoms, possibly indicating hesitation or concern. - Consistency: Her descriptions are consistent regarding her symptoms' duration and nature, reinforcing the reliability of her account in general.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Minimal elaboration when asked about eye symptoms and hesitation to mention visual issues suggest possible withholding of visual or eye-related concerns. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the potential seriousness (\"just the fever, chills, and body aches\") despite describing severe discomfort, possibly to avoid alarming herself or others. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional phrases (\"terrible,\" \"worst\") amplify her distress, likely genuine, but could also be influenced by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; she seems open but anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No obvious confusion; responses about symptom timeline are coherent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence from responses but her expressed concern for her pregnancy could heighten her emotional state.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Predominantly emotional amplification, driven by anxiety about her health and pregnancy, combined with some minimization (downplaying severity of symptoms). - Severity level: Moderate; her anxiety amplifies her distress, but her descriptions are mostly consistent and detailed. - Areas most affected: Likely her perception of the severity of her symptoms, particularly in minimizing them but emotionally overemphasizing her worry. - Reliability: Overall, her self-reporting appears generally reliable, with some emotional amplification, but her openness about symptoms supports trustworthiness.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be underreporting subtle or less obvious symptoms such as visual disturbances or other systemic signs, perhaps due to fear or uncertainty. - Symptoms probably minimized: She downplays the severity of her physical discomfort, possibly not fully conveying how unwell she feels. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about her pregnancy and potential serious illness may lead to increased worry disproportionate to clinical findings. - True timeline: Her symptom timeline seems consistent, though her emotional state could influence her perception of duration and intensity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional descriptors (\"terrible,\" \"really bad\") to convey distress, while also applying minimizing words (\"just,\" \"only\"). She provides clear, detailed symptom descriptions but is somewhat reserved regarding eye or visual concerns. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming about her main symptoms, volunteering detailed information, but shows reluctance or hesitation when discussing specifics like eye or visual symptoms, indicating possible withholding or discomfort with certain topics. - Response style: She elaborates when describing her general symptoms, but responses tend to be concise and guarded regarding less prominent symptoms, reflecting cautiousness or concern about perceived seriousness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited elaboration or avoidance when asked about eye symptoms or visual disturbances suggests possible withholding of this information, perhaps fearing diagnosis or feeling unsure. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the potential severity of her symptoms, describing her discomfort as \"just\" and \"only,\" possibly to avoid escalating her anxiety or to prevent alarming herself. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions of her distress, like \"feeling really bad\" and \"terrible,\" indicate genuine anxiety or emotional amplification, which may influence the perception of her physical state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her hesitancy to elaborate on eye symptoms could reflect discomfort with possible visual problems she perceives as less acceptable or frightening. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of confusion; she gives coherent, consistent timelines. - Family influence: Her concern about her pregnancy suggests a protective instinct, possibly amplifying her worries, but no external influence is evident in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be emotional amplification driven by anxiety and concern, coupled with minimization of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate. The emotional distress could lead her to over- or under-report certain symptoms; her honesty in describing general symptoms is good, but some details may be underreported or downplayed. - Areas most affected: The perception of symptom severity and specific concerns like eye symptoms are most biased; emotional state influences her reporting. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy for main symptoms, but emotional bias could distort the perceived urgency or subtle symptom details.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Potential visual or eye symptoms that she perceives as less significant or is uncomfortable discussing might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: She minimizes initial descriptions of her discomfort by calling them \"just\" or \"only,\" which might mask more severe underlying issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about her pregnancy and potential serious illness may cause her to overestimate the danger or urgency, leading to heightened worry. - True timeline: Her reported timeline of symptoms appears consistent; emotional factors likely influence her perception of their severity and progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient, Amina, frequently uses minimizing language such as \"maybe\" and \"just\" when describing her eye symptoms, indicating possible downplaying of their significance. She mentions that her eyes get \"a bit red and sensitive to light\" and that it \"comes and goes,\" which suggests some awareness but also a tendency to acknowledge symptoms in a tentative way. Her responses to questions about her eye symptoms are brief, primarily confirming rather than elaborating, which may reflect discomfort or reluctance to discuss them fully. She responds directly but does not volunteered extensive details about her eye condition unless prompted, indicating controlled disclosure. Her tone shows concern but also a desire to minimize, perhaps fearing a worse diagnosis.  Her behavior\u2014fidgeting and rubbing her forehead\u2014matches her expressed discomfort. The way she hesitates when mentioning her eyes suggests possible embarrassment or concern about this symptom. The consistency across her answers about her eye issues shows some awareness but also indicates possible underreporting of severity or impact.  The primary bias appears to be minimization, especially regarding her eye symptoms, supported by her hesitant language and brief responses. The severity seems mild to moderate\u2014she doesn't deny symptoms but downplays their intensity and impact. This bias may affect reliability, as she might not fully communicate the extent of her symptoms due to worry or fear of alarming the clinician.  Clinically, this means the doctor should remain vigilant for signs of more serious eye pathology or systemic issues that she is not fully expressing. It's likely she is underreporting the severity of her eye symptoms, which may be more concerning than she admits. Her overall self-report might also underestimate her discomfort or the seriousness of her illness. Monitoring her eye symptoms closely and encouraging open dialogue can help uncover any hidden issues.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use vague, cautious language such as \"maybe\" and \"a bit\" which indicates minimization. Her descriptions are simple and understated, likely to avoid drawing excessive attention to her symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to disclose details unless actively asked, providing minimal initial information about her eye symptoms and only elaborating when prompted, indicating guarded disclosure. - Response style: Responses are often brief, confirming symptoms with few details unless specifically probed, displaying a tendency toward controlled sharing possibly due to concern.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her brief and hesitant response about her eyes, coupled with limited elaboration, suggests possible withholding or minimization of symptom severity. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her eye symptoms, labeling them as \"a bit red\" and \"comes and goes,\" which may obscure more serious underlying pathology. - Amplification patterns: Less evident here; she does not exaggerate but may understate symptoms, possibly out of fear of alarming herself or the clinician. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and avoidance of detailed description of her eye symptoms suggest some discomfort, though not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion; her timeline is consistent and recalled reliably. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but her concern about her health and her reactions could be influenced by her family environment, especially given her pregnancy.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as evidenced by her language choice and reluctance to fully state the extent of her eye symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, given her cautious language and limited disclosure; she likely perceives her symptoms as minor but might not be fully aware of their potential seriousness. - Areas most affected: Eye symptoms, which she underreports, and possibly her perception of overall health. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report is somewhat trustworthy but likely underestimates actual severity, so clinical assessment should assume possible underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be revealing the full extent or severity of her eye issues, which could be more significant than expressed. - Symptoms probably minimized: The eye redness and light sensitivity might be more serious, possibly indicating ocular involvement needing urgent investigation. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries regarding her overall health and pregnancy are genuine, but her underreporting could lead clinicians to underestimate her true condition. - True timeline: Actual progression of symptoms may be more rapid or severe; her brief responses suggest she is emphasizing that symptoms are mild, possibly to avoid worry, thus the real situation could be more serious."
