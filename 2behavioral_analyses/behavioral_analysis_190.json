    "analysis": "THINKING: I need to carefully analyze Maria's responses and behavior patterns to identify subtle biases or signs that may influence her clinical picture. Starting with her language, she uses words like \"really\" and \"more than usual\" to emphasize her symptoms, which might suggest amplification. Her concerns about her heart, kidneys, and the baby highlight significant worry, but she frames her symptoms as worsening over two weeks, which may be accurate but also could be magnified due to anxiety. She mentions her blood pressure high at home and fears serious complications, reflecting catastrophic thinking. Her detailed description of symptoms coupled with anxious language indicates elevated concern, but her tone appears cooperative and non-defensive, suggesting openness rather than withholding information. She doesn't minimize her symptoms explicitly, but her gentle tone and focus on worsening suggest she wants reassurance. Her question about hospitalization shows she's seeking confirmation\u2014possibly an amplification of her fear rather than outright exaggeration. Overall, her responses show signs of health anxiety with some symptom amplification, but little evidence of withholding info. The main bias seems to be amplification driven by anxiety about her health and pregnancy, which may overstate severity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria uses emotionally charged words like \"really swollen,\" \"pressure in my chest,\" \"worried,\" and \"something really bad,\" which indicate concern but also suggest potential amplification of symptoms. She employs vague descriptors such as \"like a heavy weight\" and \"kind of,\" which lack precise clinical detail. - Information flow: She provides a structured account of her two-week symptom progression, spontaneously volunteering multiple details about her symptoms and fears, demonstrating a willingness to share but also possibly fueled by anxiety seeking reassurance. - Response style: Her responses are moderately elaborative, with detailed descriptions that suggest she is anxious to fully convey her worries. She answers directly but emphasizes the severity, consistent with an anxious amplifier pattern.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she appears cooperative and open, though her language indicates heightened concern. - Minimization behaviors: None apparent; she does not understate her symptoms but rather emphasizes them. - Amplification patterns: Evident in her frequent use of words like \"really,\" \"more than usual,\" and her focus on worsening symptoms, all suggesting anxious exaggeration of how severe her condition might be. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not observed; she shares her symptoms frankly. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; her timeline is consistent and she describes symptom progression logically. - Family influence: Mention of her family history may heighten her fears but does not show active external influence on her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification driven by health anxiety; she seems to perceive and report symptoms as more severe due to worry. - Severity: Moderate; her detailed description and concern could lead her to overstate the true severity, though her presentation seems genuine. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and concern about complications; possibly overestimating the immediate danger. - Reliability: Moderate to high for symptom description; her anxiety may inflate perceived severity, so clinical interpretation should consider this bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully disclose any additional triggers or prior episodes, possibly downplaying reassuring signs or minimization of benign explanations. - Symptoms probably minimized: There's little evidence she minimizes; instead, she likely overstates her symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about serious complications and effects on her pregnancy are likely exaggerated compared to clinical reality, influenced by health anxiety. - True timeline: Her timeline appears logical, but her emotional state might be magnifying her perception of rapid worsening, so actual symptom progression might be steadier or less severe than reported.  In summary, Maria demonstrates a pattern of health anxiety with symptom amplification, primarily driven by worry about her pregnancy and pre-existing condition, which could impact the perceived severity and urgency of her presentation."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient uses phrases like \"kind of like a weight,\" which suggests some ambiguity and possible downplaying of severity. - Amplifying language: Terms such as \"so swollen, like they're gonna burst\" and \"this tight, heavy feeling\" indicate some exaggeration of physical sensations, possibly due to anxiety. - Vague language: \"Sort of\" and \"kind of\" are present, indicating some uncertainty or reluctance to be precise. - Emotional language: Words like \"scared,\" \"worried,\" and \"so tired and scared\" reveal strong emotional responses, possibly heightening concerns beyond immediate medical urgency.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides fairly detailed descriptions, especially when describing symptoms, suggesting a tendency to amplify concerns. - Directness: She answers most questions directly but often includes emotional content and personal worries, indicating openness but emotional distress. - Information volunteering: She freely volunteers her symptoms and concerns without prompting, which could reflect anxiety-driven over-inclusion rather than selective withholding. - Consistency: Her symptom descriptions are consistent, but her emotional tone heightens when discussing her fears, indicating emotional amplification.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; her responses are forthcoming. - Minimization behaviors: She describes swelling as \"so swollen, like they\u2019re gonna burst,\" indicating awareness but not overt minimization; however, her use of phrases like \"kind of like\" suggests some downplaying. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity (\"so swollen,\" \"heavy feeling,\" \"worst at the end of the day\") and expresses fears about severe outcomes (\"something really bad,\" \"maybe my heart or kidneys\"), demonstrating potential catastrophizing. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not clearly present; she appears openly anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion; her timeline (\"about two weeks\") is consistent. - Family influence: She mentions family history, which may influence her worry level, possibly amplifying her concerns.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification with possible symptom exaggeration and catastrophizing. - Severity level: Moderate; her emotional distress influences her articulation, but she provides detailed, coherent symptoms. - Areas most affected: The intensity of her swelling and chest pressure, as well as her fears about severe outcomes, are likely overestimated. - Reliability assessment: While her report is generally coherent, her emotional state may lead her to overstate symptoms' severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be minimizing or underreporting aspects of her symptoms' fluctuation or specific medical details\u2014such as the exact timing of symptom onset\u2014due to anxiety. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical aspects such as actual blood pressure readings might be higher than reported if she is anxious about measurements. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about organ failure or harm to her baby are likely exaggerated because she focuses heavily on worst-case scenarios. - True timeline: Symptoms are reported as gradually worsening over two weeks, which aligns with typical progression but her emotional tone may inflate perceived severity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged, somewhat vague descriptions (\"kind of like a weight,\" \"burst\") and emphasizes severity, which can amplify her perceived symptom intensity. - Information flow: She freely shares her symptoms and fears without much prompting, but her emotional tone suggests that her reporting is influenced by anxiety. - Response style: She provides elaborated, detailed descriptions, often emphasizing worst-case concerns, indicating a tendency toward hyperarousal and catastrophizing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; her responses are open. - Minimization behaviors: She appears to downplay her symptoms slightly through vague descriptions, but overall, she emphasizes severity rather than minimize. - Amplification patterns: She exaggerates her sensations (\"burst,\" \"heavy weight,\" \"so swollen,\" \"worst at the end of the day\") and expresses intense fears about serious health consequences. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited indications; she seems openly anxious and honest. - Confusion/memory issues: None observed. - Family influence: Her mention of family history may heighten her health anxiety, intensifying her concerns and fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification with some catastrophizing influences. - Severity: Moderate; her detailed symptom descriptions reflect genuine distress, but emotional factors may inflate her perception of danger. - Areas most affected: Perceived severity of swelling and chest pressure, her fears about organ failure and fetal impact. - Reliability: Generally reasonable but with an emotional overlay suggesting that her perceived urgency may be exaggerated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might underreport fluctuating symptom patterns or specific medical details, such as precise blood pressure readings during episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: Potentially, her objective data (like actual blood pressure levels) may be worse than her narrative suggests, given her anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about life-threatening organ failure and fetal harm appear overestimated; her focus on worst-case outcomes may distort reality. - True timeline: Symptoms have been gradually worsening over two weeks; her emotional emphasis may exaggerate perceived urgency, but the timeline seems accurate.  Thus, her communication reflects significant anxiety influencing her symptom reporting, which requires careful reassurance and validation balanced with thorough clinical assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient uses phrases like \"not that bad,\" \"just worry a little,\" implying she might be downplaying the severity. - Amplifying language: She describes her symptoms as \"really swollen,\" \"pressure in my chest, kind of like a heavy weight,\" and \"worried something might be really bad,\" indicating heightened concern and emotional distress. - Vague language: Terms like \"kind of like a weight\" and \"maybe I\u2019m going to have a serious problem\" suggest some uncertainty or non-specific fears. - Emotional language: Clearly displays fear (\"really worried,\" \"scared,\" \"exhausted but also really anxious\"), showing strong emotional involvement.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides detailed descriptions when describing physical sensations but may respond briefly when asked about emotional state, possibly to avoid emotional disclosure. - Directness: She answers questions directly but sometimes inserts emotional qualifiers, such as \"I just worry it's something really bad.\" When asked about her feelings, she emphasizes worry and fear. - Information volunteering: She volunteers her symptoms thoroughly but may avoid explicit mention of emotional distress unless prompted. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent in describing worsening physical symptoms and her worries, indicating reliability in symptom reporting but emotional concerns are expressed mainly after direct questioning.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient doesn't show explicit signs of withholding medical details but shifts focus to her fears, possibly avoiding deeper emotional discussion. - Minimization behaviors: Uses softening phrases (\"not that bad,\" \"just worry a little\") possibly to downplay her distress; this could mask the true severity of her emotional response. - Amplification patterns: She intensifies her concern with words like \"really swollen,\" \"kind of like a heavy weight,\" and \"worried it's really bad,\" implying her fears may be exaggerated or emotionally amplified. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Occasional pauses or speaking slowly when describing her worries suggest discomfort or shame about her emotional state. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion, her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: No clear evidence she is influenced by others in her responses; her concerns are personal.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be anxiety-driven amplification, as she responds with strong emotional descriptors and worry, possibly overestimating threat. - Severity level: Moderate, since her emotional expressions are prominent but her descriptions of physical symptoms stay consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perceived severity of symptoms and emotional state; she tends to view her symptoms as very serious, which may or may not match clinical reality. - Reliability: She provides detailed, coherent symptom descriptions, so her physical reporting seems reasonably reliable, but her emotional response may be magnified due to anxiety.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her emotional distress might be greater than expressed; she may be hesitant to fully disclose fears unless specifically asked. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical aspects may be accurately reported, but her internal distress and worst-case fears could be understated unless explored. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about severe outcomes (\"something really bad,\" \"could harm my baby\") is likely exaggerated by anxiety. - True timeline: The reported two-week worsening is plausible, but her emotional amplification may cause her to perceive the timeline as more urgent or severe than it clinically is.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient alternates between specific physical descriptions and emotionally charged, somewhat softening language, indicating a tendency to downplay her distress while expressing strong fears. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with symptom details but less open about her emotional state unless prompted, suggesting some emotional avoidance. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate when describing physical symptoms, but she shows signs of emotional discomfort through slower speech and pauses, balancing detailed information with emotional reserve.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal, but occasional hesitation or softer language about emotional impact indicates some reluctance to fully express her distress or vulnerability. - Minimization behaviors: She uses gentle qualifiers like \"not that bad\" and \"just worry a little\" to lessen perceived severity, possibly masking deeper anxiety. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity of physical symptoms (\"really swollen,\" \"heavy weight\") and her fears (\"really bad,\" \"something really bad\"), reflecting an emotional amplification driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight pauses and slow speech when discussing worries suggest discomfort in openly expressing vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident issues. - Family influence: Not directly indicated; her responses seem personally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven exaggeration and amplification bias; she overstates her fears and the severity of symptoms, likely due to baseline anxiety about her health and pregnancy. - Severity: Moderate. Her emotional distress and worry could influence her perception of symptom severity, but her factual descriptions are consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perceived urgency and severity of the clinical picture\u2014overestimating dangers. - Reliability: Symptom reporting appears accurate; emotional responses are likely over-worried, emphasizing the need to address her anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Underlying emotional vulnerability, level of fear, and possible denial of how severe her condition might truly be. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her emotional impact and fears may be understated by her softening language. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about harm to herself or her baby seem heightened, possibly beyond medically indicated levels. - True timeline: The physical symptom timeline appears accurate; her emotional amplification may amplify perceived urgency beyond clinical severity or actual risk."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Chain of Thought analysis begins with examining Maria\u2019s language for signs of amplification, minimization, or vagueness. She consistently uses emotional language like \"really bad,\" \"worried,\" and \"scared,\" indicating heightened concern and anxiety. She describes her symptoms as \"so swollen, like they\u2019re gonna burst,\" which could be an exaggeration, reflecting her distress. She states she hasn't experienced certain symptoms like blurry vision or nausea, but emphasizes feeling \"like my head is heavy\" and \"shortness of breath is really bad,\" possibly to magnify her discomfort. Her responses to questions are quite detailed but primarily focus on her fears, implying openness but influenced by her anxious feelings.  Her response patterns show a tendency to provide substantial detail when describing her sensations, but she also displays some vagueness about the severity and specifics of her symptoms, perhaps due to worry or lack of medical knowledge. She does not proactively volunteer information about vision changes or stomach pain, which could hint at hesitance to disclose all details unless directly asked.  Behaviorally, she touches and rubs her legs/feet when discussing swelling, which may be a reassuring or self-soothing gesture, but also signals discomfort. She occasionally leans on her hand near her abdomen and fidgets with her ring, which could suggest nervousness. Her pauses and slow speech indicate fatigue and anxiety. She appears forthcoming but her emotional overlay primes her bias towards overestimating danger.  In terms of bias severity, the primary bias seems to be amplification driven by anxiety, with some potential for minimization of more dangerous symptoms like vision changes or chest pain, possibly because she fears alarming the clinician or does not recognize subtle clues. This bias is moderate, as her detailed descriptions stem from genuine distress but are likely inflated by her emotional state.  Clinically, this suggests her self-report is highly influenced by anxiety, causing exaggeration of symptoms' severity and possibly skewing the timeline, making her feel worse than her physiological state might be. The real concern is the potential for overlooked symptoms that she minimizes or fails to mention, like visual disturbances or signs of preeclampsia.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She frequently uses emotional descriptors like \"really bad,\" \"so swollen,\" and \"heavy.\" There\u2019s a tendency to exaggerate discomfort, reflecting her anxiety. Factual descriptions are intermixed with emotional expressions, which may color her perception of severity. - Information flow: She provides detailed accounts mainly when describing symptoms but is somewhat selective, possibly emphasizing distress to seek reassurance. Her responses are organized around her worries but sometimes lack specifics about certain symptom characteristics. - Response style: She is elaborative and expressive, especially when discussing her fears, but occasionally veers into vagueness (e.g., \"sometimes,\" \"like a weight\"), possibly to avoid alarming herself further or due to difficulty articulating subtle symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she appears eager to share her experience, but she might omit or underplay symptoms she considers less serious, such as visual changes. - Minimization behaviors: She states she hasn't experienced some alarm-symptoms (blurry vision, nausea), but her focus is on the most distressing sensations, implying possible underreporting of other signs. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions (\"like they\u2019re gonna burst,\" \"really bad,\" \"like my head is heavy\") suggest she is amplifying her concerns, likely driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; she remains polite and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of confusion; responses are consistent and coherent. - Family influence: Her concern about her baby and family health is pronounced, but no direct evidence that family members influence her responses beyond her worries.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification, leading her to overemphasize the severity and immediacy of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional distress influences perception, but she still provides relevant details. - Areas most affected: Her description of chest pressure, swelling, and breathlessness; her perception of danger may be overestimated. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat biased by anxiety; clinical corroboration is necessary to determine actual severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport subtle but clinically significant symptoms like visual disturbances, or early signs of preeclampsia. - Symptoms probably minimized: She dismisses or is unaware of symptoms like vision changes or nausea that are pertinent. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about catastrophic outcomes\u2014e.g., \"something really dangerous\"\u2014are likely exaggerated. - True timeline: The gradual worsening suggests increasing risk, but her perception might inflate the urgency; objective data (BP, labs) will clarify actual progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Maria's language contains notably amplifying terms such as \"terrible headaches,\" \"really bad shortness of breath,\" and \"worried it\u2019s something really dangerous,\" indicating heightened emotional concern and possibly exaggeration of severity. She minimizes her visual symptoms, stating she hasn't \"really seen anything blurry or spots,\" using \"really\" to perhaps downplay or deny more subtle visual disturbances. She repeatedly uses \"just\" when describing symptoms (\"just feel like my head is heavy,\" \"just worried it's something really dangerous\"), which can serve to minimize the significance of her issues. Her mention of \"sometimes\" when describing headaches suggests uncertainty, which might be either genuine or a way to downplay the symptom's consistency.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Her responses are somewhat elaborative but tend to include excessive qualifiers (\"really\" in \"really bad\" and \"really dangerous\") that serve to heighten concern. She often answers directly but cushions her answers with emotional language, showing both cooperativeness and anxiety. She provides consistent details about her symptoms but seems eager to share, possibly in an attempt to seek reassurance, yet her responses are infused with worry, indicating that she might overstate concerns to get attention or reassurance.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of amplification are evident, as she emphasizes the \"terrible\" and \"bad\" nature of her headaches and shortness of breath. She downplays her visual symptoms, which could suggest a reluctance to admit to more serious or alarming features. The frequent use of \"just\" and \"only\" hints at minimization tendencies, possibly to avoid sounding overly dramatic or to manage her own anxiety. Her mention of \"hard to tell\" and \"can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s worse\" shows uncertainty, which could reflect genuine indecisiveness or an avoidance of detailed description.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Main bias appears to be amplification driven by anxiety\u2014she overstates the severity of certain symptoms due to fear of serious illness (e.g., \"terrible headaches,\" \"pressure in my chest\"), while minimizing or denying other possible signs such as visual disturbances. Severity of bias is moderate, as her emotional distress likely influences her perception significantly. Her most biased areas are the subjective symptom descriptions, especially perceived severity, but her factual responses about visual changes are relatively consistent. Her self-reporting should be interpreted with caution, understanding that anxiety may distort her symptom perception.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This pattern suggests she may be over-reporting symptoms due to anxiety, which can inflate perceived severity, and underreporting or minimizing specific signs (vision changes) that she fears might indicate worse conditions like preeclampsia. Important clinical signs such as visual disturbances or neurological deficits could be understated or unrecognized. Her concern about deterioration may heighten her anxiety, influencing her perception of symptom progression. The actual timeline of symptom progression might be more gradual or less severe than perceived.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use emotionally charged words like \"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" and \"dangerous,\" which heighten concern, but also employs minimizers like \"just\" and \"only\" to downplay certain aspects. Her responses are often sprinkled with qualifiers and uncertainty (\"hard to tell,\" \"can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s worse\"), indicating ambivalence and concern. - Information flow: She is quite forthcoming about her symptoms but selectively minimizes or downplays certain signs, especially related to visual symptoms. Her responses are organized but seem influenced by her emotional state, with repeated emphasis on fears rather than objective details. - Response style: She elaborates on her symptoms with emotional descriptors, often overstating their severity, indicating amplification driven by anxiety. Her responses are lengthier and include qualifiers, reflecting internal distress and attempts to seek reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She appears reluctant to acknowledge visual disturbances or neurological symptoms, possibly fearing they\u2019re less manageable or more serious. Her consistent denial of blurred vision, despite probing questions, may mask early preeclampsia signs. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays visual symptoms (\"haven\u2019t really seen anything\"), perhaps to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. The frequent use of \"just,\" \"only,\" and \"sometimes\" serve as minimizers. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions of headaches and shortness of breath as \"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" and \"so worried\" suggest she\u2019s magnifying her symptoms due to anxiety. She overemphasizes how serious she feels the symptoms are. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There\u2019s minimal evidence of shame, but her self-initiated reassurance (\"it\u2019s hard to tell,\" \"maybe it\u2019s just me overthinking\") indicates some internal discomfort about her symptoms' severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indications of memory or timeline problems; her symptom descriptions are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Her concern about pregnancy-related risks, compounded by her history and family health history, influences her worried responses but does not show signs of external influence beyond her own fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification and minimization bias, as her emotional concern inflates the perceived severity of some symptoms while leading her to understate or deny others. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her anxiety influences her perception significantly, but her factual descriptions about the absence of certain signs (e.g., vision changes) remain mostly consistent. Her overemphasis on certain symptoms impacts assessment accuracy but is not deeply distorted. - Areas most affected: Visual symptom reporting (probably underreported) and severity of headache and shortness of breath (probably overstated). - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her self-reporting is colored by anxiety; clinical correlation is essential to determine the true severity of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Visual disturbances such as blurriness or spots, which she downplays or denies, are crucial for preeclampsia assessment. She may also be underreporting neurological signs or other bodily symptoms that she fears are worse. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early preeclampsia signs like visual changes could be more subtle but are underreported; her perception of her headaches as \"terrible\" might be an exaggeration of actual severity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety-driven emphasis on how \"bad\" her symptoms are likely inflates her perceived risk to herself and her baby, possibly leading her to worry excessively. - True timeline: The progression might be more gradual and less severe than she perceives, as her heightened emotional state biases her reporting, especially regarding the intensity and impact of symptoms."
