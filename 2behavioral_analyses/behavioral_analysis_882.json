    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze Alex's responses and behaviors based on the provided framework.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Alex states, \"It doesn\u2019t hurt, but I do feel a little uncomfortable,\" which suggests he's downplaying the severity or pain associated with his condition. The use of \"a little\" minimizes discomfort, possibly to avoid alarming the doctor. - Amplifying language: There is no evidence of exaggeration or overstatement in his words. - Vague language: He describes sensations as \"funny\" and \"a little uncomfortable,\" which are non-specific descriptors common in children that serve to minimize anxiety or discomfort. - Emotional language: Slight nervousness is apparent, especially indicated by hesitations and nervous tone, but no overt emotional distress words are used.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Brief and straightforward, indicative of straightforward but somewhat guarded communication. - Directness: Alex generally answers directly when prompted but tends to keep explanations simple. He volunteers some details, like \"since I was a baby,\" but cautious about additional information. - Information volunteering: He voluntarily states the duration (\"since I was a baby\"), but hesitates or defers on complex explanations, possibly reflecting comfort levels. - Consistency: Responses are consistent\u2014he states he has had the extra thumb since birth and that it \"gets in the way sometimes.\"  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitations when discussing what \"polydactyly\" means and worries about \"fixing\" or surgery suggest some reluctance to disclose deeper fears or misunderstandings. - Minimization behaviors: He states \"it doesn\u2019t hurt\" despite discomfort, indicating he may be underplaying pain or concern. - Amplification patterns: There is no clear evidence of anxiety or over-worrying, but his nervousness and asking about \"normalcy\" could reflect underlying concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous fidgeting and slight shyness suggest some discomfort about discussing his hand but not extreme embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No overt confusion; responses are coherent and age-appropriate. - Family influence: The fact that he reports what his mom told him (\"it's a kind of deformity called polydactyly\") indicates parental influence, but his own questions show curiosity rather than compliance or avoidance.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization of symptoms, particularly pain and discomfort, possibly to make the situation seem less severe. - Severity: Moderate, as he avoids discussing potential concerns or fears deeply, which could influence clinical judgment. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and emotional impact are potentially understated; he may not fully express how much discomfort or worry he experiences. - Reliability: The child's self-report is somewhat reliable but likely understated in terms of pain and emotional distress.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper fears about surgery, misunderstanding of medical procedures, or potential emotional impact are probably not fully disclosed. - Symptoms probably minimized: The discomfort and potential psychological distress might be more significant than Alex admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Worries about \"fixing\" the thumb could be more intense, but he's downplaying these worries. - True timeline: The history seems accurate regarding the presence since birth; however, the extent of discomfort or concern may be understated.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Alex uses vague and minimization language, like \"a little uncomfortable,\" to downplay his symptoms. His tone and responses reflect a child attempting to keep things simple and non-threatening. - Information flow: He is somewhat forthcoming about basic facts but hesitant or reluctant to share deeper fears or misunderstandings, likely influenced by his shyness or desire not to worry. - Response style: Responses are brief and straightforward, with natural hesitations, typical of children who are anxious but cooperative.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitations and limited explanations about his feelings and concerns suggest he may be withholding or not fully expressing his true emotional state. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying discomfort (\"a little uncomfortable\") indicates possible minimization of pain or distress. - Amplification patterns: There is no strong evidence of over-worrying or exaggerating, though he does ask whether things are \"normal\" and expresses curiosity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous fidgeting and shyness point to some discomfort discussing his hand, but no overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are consistent; no evident confusion. - Family influence: Parental influence impacts his understanding\u2014he reports what his mother said but still maintains his own simple perspective.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, especially regarding pain and emotional impact. - Severity: Moderate, as it can obscure the child's actual discomfort and worries. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity, pain levels, and emotional states are likely understated due to children's tendency to avoid alarming adults or out of shyness. - Reliability: Moderate; self-reported symptoms and feelings are influenced by his desire to appear cooperative and avoid distress, so clinical observations should supplement verbal reports.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper fears, understanding of medical procedures, and emotional distress are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual pain levels and emotional concerns may be more significant than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Worries about surgery or fixing the thumb might be more intense but are masked by his simple responses. - True timeline: The duration appears accurate, but his emotional response might not match his verbal presentation, masking ongoing anxiety or discomfort."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully analyze the child's responses and behavior patterns, aligning with each step.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses words like \"kind of\" (\"kind of the same,\" \"kind of my hand\") and \"a little\" (\"a little uncomfortable\")\u2014these indicate vague descriptions and possible minimization. The phrase \"doesn\u2019t bother me too much\" suggests downplaying discomfort. There's no overt emotional language, but hesitation and nervous phrasing (\"Um,\" \"maybe,\" slight nervousness) imply discomfort or anxiety about the topic. The response avoids detailed descriptions of limitations, possibly indicating reluctance to fully disclose severity or concern.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Responses are brief and often include hedging (\"I guess,\" \"kinda,\" \"maybe\"). The child answers directly to some questions but uses vague, non-specific language when describing feelings. They volunteer minimal information about their feelings, mostly sticking to surface-level descriptions. The responses are consistent across questions, though tinged with hesitation, indicating a cautious, reserved response style likely driven by nervousness or uncertainty.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs include hesitancy (\"Um,\" \"I guess\"), fidgeting with hands, glancing away or at their hands, and slight nervous tone, indicating possible discomfort or reluctance. The minimal detail sharing, especially about emotional impact, suggests possible information withholding or an attempt to minimize symptoms. The child's assurance that \"it doesn\u2019t bother me too much\" may be an effort to downplay problem severity. No explicit signals of shame or embarrassment are evident, but nervousness about discussing limitations and medical issues are present.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The main bias appears to be minimization\u2014downplaying the impact of their symptoms and discomfort. The child's responses are carefully guarded, likely preventing full disclosure. Severity appears moderate; they are not denying problems altogether but are underreporting their emotional or functional impact. The areas most affected are subjective discomfort and anxiety about \"fixing\" it, rather than physical symptoms, which seem underrepresented.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The child's self-report likely underestimates the emotional and functional impact of their hand difference. They probably minimize or understate discomfort and limitations, which might be more significant than expressed. Their expressed concern about needing to \"fix\" it could be exaggerated by anxiety, but overall, they may be hiding deeper worries or frustrations. The real timeline of their adaptation suggests they have experienced ongoing feelings of concern, but they might be more distressed than they initially reveal.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The child uses vague and hedging language (\"kind of,\" \"a little\") that serve to minimize or downplay their symptoms. There is a tendency to respond vaguely when discussing feelings or concerns, avoiding specifics. Emotional language is minimal, indicating possible discomfort with revealing true feelings or a desire to appear more resilient. - Information flow: Responses are brief and guarded. The child is somewhat reluctant, volunteering minimal details unless prompted directly. Their responses are organized but limited, avoiding elaboration, which suggests hesitancy to fully disclose their emotional state. - Response style: They tend to answer directly but with hedging, indicating underlying discomfort or uncertainty. The pattern is consistent\u2014favoring minimal, non-committal responses over detailed sharing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The child's minimal elaboration on how their hand affects them suggests reluctance to disclose full emotional or functional difficulties. Their use of vague language points to possible withholding of true concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"not that bad,\" \"doesn\u2019t bother me too much,\" and \"kinda the same\" are classic signs of downplaying the severity of symptoms or emotional impact. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; the child does not appear to exaggerate their problems, instead seems inclined to minimize concerns. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There\u2019s limited evidence of shame; nervousness around medical topics suggests discomfort rather than embarrassment about the hand itself. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion or inconsistent timelines; the child's account of their history appears logically consistent. - Family influence: The child's responses are consistent with his own perspective but may be subtly influenced by a family narrative emphasizing normalcy and minimization, as suggested by the supportive but possibly reassuring context.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, evidenced by the child's guarded responses, vague descriptions, and downplaying of discomfort and limitations. - Severity: Moderate. While they acknowledge some discomfort, their responses likely understate the emotional and functional burden, affecting accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: Emotional impact and subjective discomfort. The child's reluctance to fully articulate fears or frustrations hampers complete understanding. - Reliability: Moderate; self-reporting is compromised by minimization. While factual physical descriptions are accurate, emotional and functional assessments may be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of emotional distress, anxiety about future outcomes, and perhaps social or self-esteem issues related to the hand difference. - Symptoms probably minimized: The child's discomfort, frustration, or impact on activities might be more significant than they report. They may be hiding ongoing struggles. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about \"fixing\" the hand or needing surgery could be exaggerated by nervousness, but underlying worries might be substantial. - True timeline: The child's account appears consistent but may understate emotional reactions over time. They might have experienced more distress initially that they now minimize, or ongoing anxiety that is not fully expressed."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient, Alex, consistently uses simple, non-specific language like \"kinda\" and \"sometimes,\" which suggests some emotional shielding or an attempt to downplay concerns. He reports that his hand \"doesn't hurt\" but \"feels funny\" and \"gets in the way,\" indicating mild discomfort but possibly underreported or minimized. His answers are brief and somewhat evasive when asked about his feelings, implying a tendency to avoid revealing deeper worries. The fact that he says he \"doesn't really think about it much\" but admits to occasionally wondering if \"others notice\" or if it's \"weird\" could reflect some internal conflict\u2014he may experience some shame or embarrassment but is hesitant to articulate this fully. His responses show a pattern of response that leans toward reassurance and minimization, perhaps influenced by a desire to appear normal or not to worry the doctor. Overall, these behaviors suggest a mild tendency towards shielding true feelings and minimally expressing concerns, possibly masking underlying anxieties or frustrations he doesn't fully understand or feels uncomfortable discussing.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Alex primarily uses simple, vague phrases like \"kinda,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"not that bad,\" which indicate he may be inclining toward minimization or avoiding detailed expression of discomfort. His brief responses show a tendency to downplay his feelings, possibly to appear brave or avoid drawing attention. - Information flow: His responses are brief and somewhat guarded. He volunteers basic information about his hand but is reluctant to elaborate on his emotional experience or worries without prompting. The pattern suggests hesitance and possible concealment of deeper concerns. - Response style: He tends to respond in a direct yet minimal manner, giving straightforward answers that avoid elaboration. The responses are organized but limited, likely to prevent revealing vulnerability or discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Alex's short, non-specific responses, especially when asked about feelings or fears (\"It doesn\u2019t bother me too much today,\" \"I guess I don\u2019t really think about it much\"), suggest some reluctance to fully disclose his emotional state. - Minimization behaviors: He downplays discomfort (\"It\u2019s kinda the same,\" \"It doesn\u2019t hurt,\" \"not that bad\"), which could be an effort to minimize the significance of his symptoms or feelings. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; he seems to understates concerns rather than overstate them. - Embarrassment/shame signals: His slight hesitations when discussing feelings, and mentioning worries about \"if other kids notice,\" imply some embarrassment or shame about the hand or about being different. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; his timeline appears consistent and straightforward. - Family influence: The fact that he reports discussing the hand mainly because his mom suggested it indicates family influence in his decision to seek assessment but doesn't show overt family suppression or coaching.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization and possible emotional shielding\u2014he intentionally or unintentionally downplays emotional distress and severity, perhaps to maintain a sense of normalcy or due to social embarrassment. - Severity: Mild, since his language and responses suggest he isn't experiencing severe distress but may be modestly hiding concerns. - Areas most affected: Emotional acknowledgment of worries about appearance and potential social implications, as indicated by hesitation when mentioning if others notice. - Reliability: Moderate; although he provides consistent basic information, his tendency to downplay feelings and use vague language means some emotional insights may be underreported.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper feelings of frustration, embarrassment, or concern about social reactions are probably underreported due to his minimization and shy responses. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual level of discomfort or emotional upset might be more significant than expressed\u2014he might be experiencing more inner worry or insecurity. - Concerns probably amplified: He may be overly anxious about social acceptance or about potential surgery, even if he reports only occasional worries. - True timeline: The reported timeline seems straightforward; his awareness from a young age aligns with consistent understanding, but emotional reactions to his condition could have developed differently over time and are not fully expressed."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully analyze Alex\u2019s responses through the lens of potential communication biases. Starting with language, he uses words like \"just,\" \"a little,\" and \"kind of\" which can serve to minimize or downplay his symptoms or feelings. His responses are brief and somewhat vague (\"I guess it doesn\u2019t bother me too much today,\" \"sometimes I get nervous\") indicating possible minimization or reluctance to share full extent of his feelings. The fact that he mentions feeling nervous \"but I don\u2019t really know why\" suggests a hint of embarrassment or shame, perhaps about his reaction to others noticing his hand or about his worries.  His pattern of responses shows he is willing to volunteer some information\u2014he expresses his thoughts about others looking at his hand and feeling nervous\u2014but does so in a way that prefixes it with uncertainty, such as \"I guess\" and \"sometimes,\" which could be a guarded way of sharing. His responses are consistent across questions but tend to avoid deep emotional disclosure, perhaps because he is hesitant or unsure how to articulate complex feelings.  Behaviorally, the signs of withholding are subtle. He offers a minimal elaboration when discussing his feelings around other kids, which could mean he\u2019s holding back more intense feelings like embarrassment or worry. His acknowledgment that he notices when others look at his hand and feels nervous but doesn't understand why could indicate internalized concern he fears might be judged or misunderstood. The nervousness about medical procedures is only briefly mentioned, but combined with his overall hesitancy, suggests some apprehension about potential treatment or diagnosis.  In terms of bias severity, Alex\u2019s communication seems mildly guarded. His language and behavior hint at mild minimization (downplaying how much his hand bothers him) and some emotional discomfort that he might be reluctant to express fully. The primary bias appears to be minimization combined with some possible shame or embarrassment. The severity is mild because he still communicates enough to give an overall picture but with guardedness typical of children feeling self-conscious.  Clinically, this suggests that the true emotional impact of his condition could be more significant than he reports. He might be experiencing more social anxiety or concern about his differences than he admits, which could influence his self-esteem or social interactions. Additionally, his reluctance to fully discuss feelings about others noticing him could mask deeper worries, and he might be underreporting how much the physical difference affects him emotionally. Overall, his self-reporting appears reasonably reliable but should be supplemented with sensitive, reassurance-focused dialogue to uncover hidden concerns.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Alex employs vague and minimizing language (\"just,\" \"sometimes,\" \"kind of\") that can obscure the full emotional impact of his experiences. He is straightforward but cautious, opting for simple sentences and prefacing disclosures with hesitations. He avoids intense emotional language, which is typical for children that feel vulnerable or unsure. - Information flow: He responds primarily when directly asked, and he volunteers some information about his feelings but tends to keep elaboration minimal. His responses are organized but guarded, suggesting a tendency to withhold deeper feelings. - Response style: The responses are concise, childlike, and sometimes hesitant, indicating a level of emotional guarding. His tendency to answer briefly and with qualifiers shows he\u2019s attempting to present himself positively while avoiding over-sharing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: His brief and cautious responses, as well as phrases like \"I guess,\" suggest he may be holding back some feelings or concerns about his hand and social experiences. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions such as \"doesn\u2019t bother me too much\" and \"it\u2019s kind of the same\" downplay the emotional or functional impact, indicating he might be minimizing his discomfort or worries. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration of concerns; responses tend toward minimization rather than amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervousness about why he feels nervous (\"but I don\u2019t really know why\") and reluctance to discuss feelings suggest underlying embarrassment or shame about his reactions or condition. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion about timeline or facts; responses are consistent. - Family influence: His family\u2019s involvement is evident from his mention of worries prompted by his mom, which may influence his responses to be more cautious or guarded to please or avoid concern from adults.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization and emotional guarding\u2014he downplays his distress and is cautious about revealing feelings that might seem embarrassing or upsetting. - Severity: Mild\u2014his disclosures are generally honest but guarded, typical in children with modest emotional concealment. - Areas most affected: Social and emotional impact of the physical difference, as he tries to hide or minimize the extent of his feelings of nervousness and self-consciousness. - Reliability: Fair; he provides coherent, consistent answers with typical hesitancy, indicating the core information is likely accurate but may not fully capture the depth of his emotional state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper social or emotional difficulties, such as feelings of shame, social withdrawal, or concerns about peer reactions, are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: His functional or emotional distress might be worse than he admits\u2014more significant social anxiety or emotional discomfort related to his appearance. - Concerns probably amplified: He might be over-worried about others judging him, but current responses suggest he\u2019s underreporting this worry, which could impact his social interactions more than he states. - True timeline: The physical presence has been stable since birth; his emotional reactions may fluctuate more than he reports, but he is mainly minimizing emotional discomfort.  Overall, Alex\u2019s communication is slightly guarded but generally honest. His responses tend to minimize emotional impact, and he exhibits subtle signs of embarrassment and social self-consciousness that may be underrepresented. It\u2019s important to create a safe environment to encourage more open expression of feelings for better assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze each step thoroughly:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient says, \"just sometimes it gets in the way when I do stuff,\" which downplays the frequency or severity of the inconvenience. Also, stating, \"I don\u2019t really think about it much,\" might minimize the ongoing relevance of the issue. - Amplifying language: The responses show little direct amplification, but the feelings of being \"nervous\" or \"weird\" suggest some emotional intensity, although expressed in a mild way. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of a weird feeling\" and \"don\u2019t really know why,\" suggest some uncertainty or reluctance to specify feelings, indicating possible discomfort or inability to articulate full emotions. - Emotional language: Use of \"nervous,\" \"worried,\" and \"feel kind of weird\" points to some underlying, though perhaps not intense, discomfort related to social situations and self-image.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are brief and somewhat vague, especially in emotional questions. The brevity when describing feelings (\"I don't know\" or \"kinda weird\") indicates possible reluctance to fully elaborate. - Directness: The responses tend toward deflection or vagueness, not directly confirming or denying feelings or fears, possibly to avoid trouble or shame. - Information volunteering: The patient tends to wait for prompts, only offering limited information (\"I notice if someone looks at my hand\"). This indicates possible withholding of deeper feelings. - Consistency: The responses are consistent across similar questions but are characterized by mild evasiveness, suggesting a pattern of cautious sharing.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to discuss feelings or open up about social reactions (\"don\u2019t really talk about it much,\" \"I don\u2019t know\"). - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying emotional responses, e.g., \"kinda weird,\" \"don't like it,\" possibly mitigating the intensity of his feelings. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggerated concerns; rather, the tone indicates he perceives his feelings as relatively mild. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance in discussing social reactions, such as staring or questions, indicating mild embarrassment or shame about attention to his hand. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indications; timeline aligns with his age, and responses are consistent. - Family influence: Responses are generated from his perspective, with no explicit evidence of family influence skewing his account.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The pattern suggests a tendency toward underreporting or minimizing emotional and social difficulties, possibly minimizing the impact of social reactions. - Severity: Moderate, as he does not express severe distress but hints at awareness of discomfort and mild embarrassment that he might not fully articulate. - Areas most affected: Social perceptions and emotional responses to peer attention are likely underreported or understated. - Reliability assessment: Responses seem fairly genuine but likely underreport the emotional impact, given his hesitations. His statements probably do not fully reflect the depth of social anxiety or embarrassment.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The child may be experiencing greater social discomfort or anxiety than expressed, possibly avoiding sharing feelings out of shame. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true emotional and social distress related to peer reactions and potential teasing may be worse than he admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Minor worries (\"kinda weird\") might understate the extent of peer avoidance or social impact. - True timeline: The physical anomaly has been constant since birth; emotional responses to social situations might have developed gradually and could be more intense in different contexts than he reports.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices show mild vagueness and minimization, with phrases like \"kinda weird\" or \"don't really think about it much,\" indicating hesitance to fully express feelings. - Information flow is reluctant; the patient tends to wait for prompts and offers limited details, suggesting discomfort with discussing social or emotional aspects openly. - Response style leans toward brief and cautious, avoiding elaboration and possibly masking more significant emotional reactions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Evidence of withholding information includes hesitance to discuss how he truly feels or the impact of peers' reactions and avoiding deep emotional sharing. - Minimization is demonstrated by downplaying discomfort (\"I don\u2019t really think about it much\"), possibly to reduce perceived worry or shame. - No clear amplification, but mild expressions of nervousness and embarrassment imply some emotional distress that might be more intense internally. - Signs of embarrassment are subtle but present in his avoidance of discussing social reactions openly. - No obvious memory or timeline inconsistencies, indicating reliable recall of physical features but possibly less about deeper emotional responses. - No explicit family influence outlined but his cautious disclosures suggest internalized social awareness.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - The primary bias appears to be underreporting or minimization of emotional distress related to social reactions, likely driven by embarrassment or shame. - Severity is moderate\u2014he is minimally expressive about the full social or emotional impact, which might obscure underlying distress. - Social/emotional responses are most affected, with responses aiming to avoid revealing the depth of his discomfort. - The self-reporting reliability is moderate; physical descriptions are accurate, but emotional responses are likely understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing includes the extent of social anxiety or avoidance behaviors. The child may be experiencing more significant emotional discomfort than expressed. - Symptoms probably minimized involve peer-related stress, feelings of embarrassment, or social withdrawal. - Concerns probably amplified are limited; he seems aware but downplays the emotional toll. - The true emotional impact and possible social isolation may be more severe than his responses indicate, and that should be explored further in assessment and support planning."
