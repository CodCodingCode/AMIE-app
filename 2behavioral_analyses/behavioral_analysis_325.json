    "analysis": "THINKING: To analyze Maria Lopez's responses, I need to systematically evaluate her language and responses for signs of withholding, minimization, exaggeration, and emotional cues. First, examining her language choices, I note that she reports symptoms focusing on pain, weakness, weight loss, bowel trouble, and itching\u2014these are concrete and specific complaints, suggesting she is willing to share key symptoms when prompted. However, her expressions of concern\u2014\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it\"\u2014may hint at uncertainty or reluctance to reveal more details. She describes feeling \"so tired all the time\" and \"feeling like this for a few weeks,\" which are vague but likely true.  In response pattern analysis, her response length appears sufficient and direct for core symptoms. She volunteers comprehensive information without immediate prompting, indicating open communication on these topics. Her responses are consistent across questions, pointing to reliability in her main symptom report.  Behavioral indicators show no strong signs of withholding, but her focus on more stigmatized or embarrassing symptoms\u2014like itching around the anus\u2014suggests possible hesitation or shame, perhaps leading her to minimize details or be less forthcoming when asked about personal or sensitive topics.  Assessing bias severity, the primary bias may be slight underreporting of the severity or extent of embarrassment, especially regarding the anal itching, but overall, her communication seems relatively honest. The main influence is likely her discomfort discussing sensitive issues directly.  Clinically, I infer that she likely minimizes or omits detailed accounts of personal hygiene habits or fears about the symptoms. She might understate the extent of her embarrassment or social stigma around the itching, potentially hiding the severity or duration. Conversely, she might over-focus on the pain and weakness, possibly amplifying her distress, which seems consistent with her anxious presentation.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria uses concrete descriptions for her physical symptoms, such as \"pain is really bad\" and \"feels uncomfortable,\" indicating she is somewhat forthcoming about physical sensations. Her language around the itching and weight loss is straightforward, although she employs emotional descriptors like \"worried\" and \"scared,\" reflecting her anxiety. She avoids overly technical language, keeping descriptions relatable but sometimes vague about specifics, particularly regarding her personal or emotional state. - Information flow: She provides organized, largely comprehensive responses, volunteering detailed symptom descriptions without prompting. Her responses show no significant scatter or tangential commentary, suggesting a generally open communication style, though her mentioning of \"not knowing\" about causes indicates some uncertainty. She exhibits slight hesitation when discussing personal or stigmatized symptoms (e.g., itching), hinting at embarrassment. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and consistent, with a tendency to express her fears directly, but she pauses or fidgets, indicating discomfort or tension.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The only subtle withholding is about the anal itching, which she mentions with some embarrassment. She might be hesitant to elaborate on personal hygiene or sexual behaviors related to her condition, although not explicitly stated. - Minimization behaviors: She reports symptoms clearly; however, she doesn't explicitly downplay the severity but may understate her emotional distress or the social impact of her symptoms. - Amplification patterns: She amplifies physical symptoms such as pain and weakness, emphasizing deterioration (\"it\u2019s gotten worse recently\") and distress (\"really bad sometimes\"), which are likely genuine but could also be heightened by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her cautious phrasing and discomfort when describing the anal itching indicate some embarrassment or shame, suggesting she might minimize or omit certain behaviors, especially related to her anal or hygiene experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion or inconsistent timelines are apparent; her descriptions are coherent and sequential. - Family influence: Limited evidence, but her mention that people say she looks thin may reflect external concerns influencing her perception, possibly adding to her anxiety.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight underreporting or minimization of personal or stigmatized symptoms (i.e., hygiene, anal itching), due to embarrassment or shame influencing her willingness to fully disclose. - Severity: Moderate. While she reports core symptoms and emotions clearly, her reluctance around sensitive topics can lead to incomplete information, especially regarding lifestyle behaviors that impact diagnosis. - Areas most affected: Particular bias likely around the anal itching and possibly hygiene habits, which are more stigmatized topics. - Reliability: Fairly reliable for physical symptoms, but some emotional or behavioral details\u2014such as hygiene practices\u2014may be underreported, necessitating sensitive probing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific behaviors related to hygiene, detailed descriptions of personal or social impacts, or emotional responses surrounding her symptoms may be underreported due to embarrassment. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may downplay the severity or duration of personal hygiene issues or social concerns, possibly underestimating the full extent of her distress or the psychological impact. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear and anxiety about serious illness are likely genuine and possibly slightly exaggerated by her cultural and language barriers, which might heighten her perceived risk. - True timeline: Symptoms' progression appears accurate, but her emotional and social responses may be amplified or less detailed, reflecting her anxious state rather than objective truth.  Thus, her communication is generally straightforward for physical symptoms with some mild bias introduced by embarrassment regarding personal hygiene and stigmatized areas, which could affect the completeness of the clinical assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"sometimes I forget or I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important,\" indicating she might downplay the significance of her hygiene habits. - Amplifying language: She describes discomfort as \"really bad\" when talking about abdominal pain and \"uncomfortable\" for anal itching, which is relatively mild but she presents it as distressing, possibly to emphasize her suffering. - Vague language: Phrases like \"maybe I do things differently,\" reflect uncertainty and non-specificity in her description. - Emotional language: She exhibits feelings of embarrassment when noting she \"doesn't check myself much,\" and hints at guilt or shame about hygiene, which can influence her willingness to fully disclose.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides limited detail initially, then elaborates when prompted about hygiene, suggesting hesitancy in sharing more sensitive information. - Directness: She avoids directly answering how often she checks herself or her hygiene routines, instead giving vague or conditional answers. - Information volunteering: She tends to withhold explicit details about her actual hygiene practices but offers more when asked indirectly about hygiene habits. - Consistency: Her responses are somewhat inconsistent\u2014initially minimal, with more detail only when prompted\u2014indicating possible reluctance or discomfort.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Signs of withholding: Her comment \u201csometimes I forget or I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important\u201d suggests she\u2019s reluctant to admit to possible poor hygiene routines. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the importance of checking after bathroom use, possibly minimizing hygiene-related risks. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her hesitation and admission of not \"checking herself much\" reveal discomfort discussing anal or hygiene issues. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about her habits indicates possible uncertainty about details, but not necessarily memory lapses. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses seem centered on her own perceptions.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Information withholding, especially regarding personal hygiene and possibly the severity of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she withholds potentially crucial details but eventually provides relevant information when prompted. - Affected areas: Hygiene practices and possibly the actual extent of her symptoms, including her awareness of risks associated with undercooked meat. - Reliability: Some skepticism is warranted; her reluctance and vague disclosures suggest she might understate her hygiene issues, which are central to her presumed diagnosis.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information: She might not fully disclose the extent of her hygiene neglect, possibly underestimating the infection risk. - Minimized symptoms: She may be downplaying the severity of her anal itching or her self-care routine's impact. - Amplified concerns: She appears genuinely worried, but her emotional discomfort could cause her to overemphasize her overall distress. - Timeline: She reports symptoms started weeks ago and worsened, which aligns with typical disease progression, but her hesitations might obscure actual onset or severity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and cautious language (\"sometimes I forget,\" \"maybe I do things differently\"), indicating discomfort about certain topics; she employs emotional descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"uncomfortable\") to emphasize her distress. - Information flow: She appears reluctant initially but becomes more descriptive when explicitly asked about hygiene, showing a pattern of guarded communication and selective disclosure. - Response style: Her responses are minimal and non-specific at first, then elaborative when prompted, suggesting discomfort and possible shame regarding her hygiene or behavioral habits.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her reluctance to openly discuss hygiene routines until asked directly; phrases like \"I don\u2019t really check myself much\" conceal potential neglect. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the importance of her hygiene routines, which could understate her actual level of neglect or the infection risk. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes discomfort (\"really bad,\" \"uncomfortable\") when describing symptoms, possibly to garner sympathy or express the severity she perceives. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitating, avoiding eye contact on sensitive topics, and vague explanations reveal embarrassment about discussing her personal hygiene or anal issues. - Confusion/memory issues: Some uncertainty about her habits (\"sometimes I forget\") but no clear evidence of memory lapses. - Family influence: No direct cues; responses are patient-centered without external influences evident.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate information withholding regarding hygiene practices and possibly symptom severity, driven by embarrassment and shame. - Severity: Moderate\u2014there is considerable reluctance to share key behaviors, but enough information is eventually provided to inform diagnosis. - Most affected areas: Hygiene habits and possibly underreported or understated severity of symptoms related to anal irritation. - Reliability: Caution is advised; her disclosures may underrepresent actual risks and behaviors, necessitating sensitive follow-up questions.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information: Likely underreporting hygiene neglect and perhaps the extent of her symptoms or their impact. - Symptoms likely minimized: Discomfort may be more severe, and hygiene issues more problematic than she admits. - Concerns likely amplified: She is internalizing her distress, but her discomfort causing her to avoid certain topics might hinder full disclosure. - True timeline: Symptoms probably started around the reported 3-week mark but her awareness or acknowledgment of severity might lag behind actual disease progression due to emotional barriers or incomplete disclosure."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"I just wash myself after going to the bathroom,\" which minimizes the level of hygiene care. - Vague language: Phrases like \"sometimes I feel like the itching is worse,\" and \"I don\u2019t really change how I do it\" lack specificity, hiding the severity or consistency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: She hesitates, uses fillers like \"um,\" and admits to \"not checking herself much,\" indicating discomfort discussing anal hygiene. - Emotional indicators: She mentions feeling \"bad\" and \"uncomfortable,\" but avoids detailed discussion of her hygiene practices, suggesting embarrassment or shame.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She gives brief, somewhat evasive responses (\"I just wash myself,\" \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important\"), showing reluctance. - Directness: Starts with avoidance (\"I don\u2019t really change how I do it\"), then responds vaguely to direct questions, indicating possible withholding. - Information volunteering: She appears to hold back detailed behaviors, only offering minimal information after prompting. - Consistency: Responses are consistent with her pattern of minimization and reluctance to share details.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Her vague description (\"sometimes I feel like the itching is worse,\" \"I don\u2019t really change how I do it\") suggests withholding detailed hygiene practices. - Minimization behaviors: She implies her hygiene routine is adequate (\"I just wash myself\"), despite reports of persistent symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitations, using \"um,\" avoiding eye contact when mentioning anal hygiene. - Emotional discomfort: Fidgeting and reluctance point to embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant disorientation, but limited elaboration indicates hesitance rather than forgetfulness. - Family influence: No clear evidence, but her responses may reflect cultural discomfort discussing sensitive topics.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Information withholding, specifically around personal hygiene and anal care due to embarrassment. - Severity level: Moderate, as she is holding back specific details necessary to fully assess her hygiene behaviors and infection risks. - Areas most affected: Hygiene practices related to anal care and skin symptoms; these are crucial for understanding potential reinfection or ongoing issues. - Reliability assessment: Moderate trust; her core symptoms (pain, weight loss, itching) are likely accurate, but details about hygiene behaviors are underreported.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise routines around anal hygiene, frequency, and thoroughness; details of her discomfort during cleaning. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of her hygiene shortcomings and the frequency of aggravating behaviors. - Concerns probably amplified: Her overall health fears, but she might underreport hygiene neglect, risking under-assessment of infection control. - True timeline: Actual hygiene practices may be less adequate than reported, possibly contributing to persistent infection or parasite reinfection.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague, minimal language (\"I just wash myself,\" \"sometimes I feel like the itching is worse\") to avoid sharing uncomfortable details, blending emotional discomfort with avoidance. - Information flow: Responses are reluctant, organized to withhold details about hygiene practices; she offers limited elaboration unless pushed. - Response style: Minimal and hesitant, with frequent fillers and visible discomfort suggesting embarrassment and wish to avoid shameful topics.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her nondisclosure of specific hygiene routines and infrequent mention of provocative symptoms indicate withholding vital information. - Minimization behaviors: She suggests her hygiene is adequate (\"I just wash myself\"), likely downplaying potential hygiene deficits. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration of symptoms; her core complaints appear honest. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitant speech, avoiding eye contact when discussing anal care, and filler words like \"um.\" - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; response pattern indicates hesitance rather than confusion. - Family influence: Not directly evident but cultural factors may influence her discomfort discussing personal hygiene.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate withholding bias, centered on hygiene routines and anal care due to embarrassment. - Severity: Moderate, as critical hygiene details are not fully disclosed, affecting accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: Hygiene behaviors, skin discomfort, and potential reinfection sources. - Reliability: Fair for her symptom report; less reliable regarding hygiene behaviors, which she minimizes.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Complete hygiene routines, frequency, thoroughness, and any recent changes. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity/frequency of poor hygiene practices and skin issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Overall health anxiety, but underreporting of hygiene neglect could underestimate ongoing infection risk. - True timeline: Biological progression likely aligns with symptom onset, but hygiene practices may have remained inadequate longer than she implies, potentially worsening prognosis."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will carefully evaluate the patient's responses.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"I just wash myself after going to the bathroom, but sometimes it still feels itchy and uncomfortable,\" indicating she may emphasize the routine rather than severity. - Amplifying language: She describes the feeling as \"itchy and uncomfortable, like it\u2019s sore or something,\" showing some discomfort but not extreme discomfort. - Vague language: The phrase \"sometimes it still feels itchy and uncomfortable\" is non-specific, and she mentions \"that feeling\" without detailed description. - Emotional language: She expresses discomfort and a mild sense of annoyance, with some concern but no overt fear or shame.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her responses are brief, possibly indicating discomfort discussing this area. - Directness: She answers directly but with hesitation and indicates uncertainty (\"I do wash after, but...\"), suggesting some reluctance. - Information volunteering: She mentions increased weight loss and tiredness unprompted, indicating recognition of systemic issues. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent with previous disclosures about symptoms, but she minimizes the severity of her hygiene practices.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She downplays the severity of her anal discomfort by saying \"it still feels itchy and uncomfortable, like it\u2019s sore or something,\" without mentioning skin changes or bleeding, possibly avoiding details. - Minimization behaviors: She states she hasn't seen blood or sores and suggests routine hygiene is adequate, possibly minimizing underlying issues. - Amplification patterns: She reports \"feeling more tired and losing weight,\" which could indicate more severe systemic effects than she is openly recognizing. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her hesitation and the use of vague descriptors (\"that feeling\") suggest discomfort talking about anal area issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indication, but brief responses might reflect discomfort or distraction. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, though she may feel judged or embarrassed, influencing her disclosures.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization and embarrassment, leading her to underreport the severity of anal and systemic symptoms. - Severity level: Moderate bias, because she openly discusses some symptoms but downplays others and avoids detailed description. - Areas most affected: The anal symptoms and possibly the severity of her weight loss and fatigue are biased, as she minimizes the discomfort around her anal area. - Reliability: Her self-reporting is somewhat trustworthy for general symptoms but likely underreports the full extent of certain issues, especially regarding hygiene discomfort and potential skin changes.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about possible skin lesions, bleeding, or more severe anal findings. She may be withholding the true extent of anal discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of anal irritation and systemic impacts like fatigue and weight loss may be worse than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: She might be over-worried about the general idea of hygiene but underestimates some severity due to embarrassment. - True timeline: Symptoms have likely been worsening gradually. Her emphasis on \"sometimes\" and brief responses suggest she is not fully conveying how persistent or severe these symptoms could be.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague, non-specific terms (\"that feeling,\" \"something sore\") and mild descriptors, showing discomfort but also hesitance to detail symptoms. - Information flow: Responses indicate reluctance to share detailed or potentially embarrassing information, with a tendency to keep descriptions brief and guarded. - Response style: Responses are minimal and somewhat cautious, possibly trying to avoid revealing more distress or severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids elaborating on skin changes or the full extent of discomfort, indicating possible discomfort or shame. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays symptoms\u2014no mention of blood, sores, or skin changes\u2014suggesting they could be more severe. - Amplification patterns: Systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss are mentioned outright, which might represent more serious underlying disease. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitant, vague language about the anal area and inconsistent detail suggest discomfort or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, but responses are brief, possibly indicating some discomfort. - Family influence: No explicit signs, but cultural factors may influence her reticence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization combined with embarrassment/shame, leading to underreporting critical details. - Severity: Moderate; she provides some accurate symptom reports but omits or downplays others, especially regarding the anal area. - Areas most affected: Anal symptoms and systemic effects (weight loss, fatigue), as her responses minimize or obscure these. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reports are useful but should be corroborated with physical examination and possibly additional testing due to likely underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Skin conditions, bleeding, or skin lesions around the anal area; the true severity of discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Anal irritation severity, presence of possible sores or lesions, and the extent of systemic health decline. - Concerns probably amplified: Overall seriousness of condition might be greater, so her concern about \"something serious\" is justified. - True timeline: Symptoms may have been progressing longer and more severely than she states, given her reluctance to fully disclose."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient's responses exhibit clear patterns of reluctance to disclose full details, especially regarding sensitive symptoms. Her choice of words, such as \"just,\" \"really,\" and \"kind of,\" suggests minimization. When asked about skin changes or progress, she reports only redness and itching, which she considers not severe, possibly downplaying the discomfort. Her responses tend to be brief and cautiously phrased, indicating discomfort or embarrassment. She does not volunteer additional details when not asked directly, showing guardedness especially about potentially shameful topics like anal issues. Her mentioning that she hasn't seen bleeding or sores but admits to redness and itching highlights her tendency to minimize the seriousness of her symptoms. She expresses concerns about worsening symptoms but stops short of emphasizing severity, possibly to avoid drawing attention to perceived personal failings, such as hygiene lapses.  Her language indicates emotional discomfort, but she seems to attempt to suppress it, perhaps feeling shame or embarrassment. She responds consistently when describing her hygiene routine and symptom progression but avoids elaborating on her discomfort levels or the full scope of her condition. The reluctance to fully describe skin changes or discomfort suggests that she may be withholding information about more severe or concerning signs like open sores or bleeding, which could indicate more advanced infection or secondary complications.  The primary bias appears to be **information withholding**, compounded by **minimization** of symptoms. Her hesitance to fully describe the severity of her anal symptoms, despite mentioning redness and itchiness, points to possible shame or cultural discomfort discussing such issues. The severity of this bias seems moderate\u2014she's providing some factual info but is holding back potentially critical details. Reliability of her self-reporting is compromised, especially regarding the full extent of skin or tissue damage and the progression of her symptoms. This could lead to underestimation of disease severity if not probed carefully.  Clinically, this means that the clinician should consider the possibility that her symptoms are more severe than she reports, particularly in areas she minimizes or avoids mentioning. She may be experiencing more intense discomfort, potential bleeding, or sores that she considers either too embarrassing or insignificant to report. Her worries about worsening symptoms are real but may be amplified by her anxiety or cultural factors influencing her communication style.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague, dismissive terms like \"just some redness and itching,\" downplaying the symptoms. Her responses tend to include emotional cues such as \"it\u2019s been like that for a while,\" but she avoids specific descriptions of severity. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to fully disclose details unless directly questioned; her answers are organized but guarded, indicating a hesitance to share sensitive information. - Response style: She responds briefly, with statements that suggest she is holding back, especially regarding possible skin or tissue damage. She avoids elaborating beyond what she perceives as necessary.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She explicitly states she hasn't seen blood or sores but admits to redness and itching, which suggests she may be concealing more serious signs like ulcers or bleeding. Her hesitation when describing the discomfort points to reluctance to fully disclose. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with phrases like \"it's been like that for a while\" and not emphasizing how much worse it might be. She avoids mentioning more severe signs like bleeding or open sores. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the discomfort being \"more uncomfortable sometimes,\" but overall minimizes the impact, possibly to avoid embarrassment. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her discomfort discussing anal symptoms and her cautious wording indicate shame or cultural taboos influencing communication. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of memory problems; her timeline descriptions are consistent. - Family influence: Not specifically indicated, but her hesitance suggests cultural or personal constraints affecting openness.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Information withholding**, driven by embarrassment and cultural factors, leading to underreporting of the severity and extent of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she provides partial information but omits critical details that could alter clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Skin and tissue symptoms around the anal region, especially concerning bleeding, sores, or ulcers, are most biased. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her reports are trustworthy for some symptoms but limited regarding more sensitive or severe findings; clinical suspicion should guide further probing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably concealing more serious signs such as bleeding, ulcers, or secondary infections due to embarrassment or shame. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of anal tissue damage and potential systemic impact are understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about worsened conditions may lead to over-reporting perceived discomfort, but the factual severity may still be underestimated. - True timeline: Symptoms may have evolved more progressively and severely than she admits; avoid relying solely on her description, and seek objective findings to confirm."
