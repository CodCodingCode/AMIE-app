    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient\u2019s response \u201cI don\u2019t really get close to anyone\u201d uses \u201creally\u201d and \u201cjust,\u201d suggesting downplaying the extent of their social withdrawal, possibly to avoid appearing more distressed. - Amplifying language: Not evident; the patient avoids emotional descriptors or exaggeration. - Vague language: Phrases like \u201ckinda scared,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d indicating fuzziness about their feelings, possibly to protect themselves from full disclosure. - Emotional language: The report \u201cfeel kind of scared,\u201d which signals underlying anxiety but is expressed in a cautious manner.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are short and minimal, aligning with guardedness or discomfort. - Directness: Responses are direct but minimal, avoiding elaboration, suggesting reluctance to share more. - Information volunteering: The patient volunteers only basic facts (\u201cstay by myself,\u201d \u201cfeel kind of scared\u201d), indicating hesitance to disclose details without prompting. - Consistency: Responses are consistent in indicating withdrawal and fear, but their vague wording shows an effort to minimize emotional expression.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Short, minimal responses, vague language, and avoidance of elaboration point to withholding deeper emotional states or experiences. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the extent of social withdrawal by using \u201cjust,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d suggests the patient may be minimizing their struggles. - Amplification patterns: Not evident in this snippet. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and avoidance of eye contact may indicate discomfort or shame about their feelings or behaviors. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; responses are straightforward. - Family influence: The mention of \u201cmy foster mom leaves\u201d shows awareness of caregiver separation, but no direct signs of external influence on response biases.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Defensive response pattern, with significant withholding due to fear of judgment or emotional exposure. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014patient reveals core fears but actively minimizes and avoids depth, likely leading to underestimation of attachment issues. - Areas most affected: Emotional states and relational behaviors, particularly feelings of fear when separated and difficulty trusting others. - Reliability assessment: Moderate reliability; responses suggest genuine feelings but are limited and guarded, which may mask the full severity of symptoms.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of their emotional distress, trauma memories, or internal coping strategies, as the patient avoids elaboration. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of their attachment difficulties and anxiety; their admission of \u201cjust stay by myself\u201d may understate their social withdrawal. - Concerns probably amplified: Not strongly indicated; the patient\u2019s responses do not appear overly exaggerated or distorted but rather guarded. - True timeline: The patient\u2019s emotional withdrawal seems longstanding, worsened by recent transitions, consistent with reactive attachment disorder progression, but their brief responses obscure the depth.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and minimizing language (\u201cjust stay by myself,\u201d \u201ckind of scared\u201d), likely to protect themselves from vulnerability or judgment. Their responses are sparse and guarded, with little emotional expression. - Information flow: Exhibits reluctance to provide detailed information; responses are minimal and only offered when prompted, indicating a tendency to withhold emotional truths. - Response style: Minimal, hesitant, and non-elaborative responses; they avoid eye contact and speak softly, reinforcing their guarded demeanor.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and vagueness of responses, combined with expressed fears and avoidance of elaboration, suggest active withholding of deeper feelings. - Minimization behaviors: Use of qualifiers like \u201cjust,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d indicates an effort to downplay their emotional state or experiences. - Amplification patterns: Not prominent; responses do not exaggerate but rather understate their difficulties. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and avoidance of eye contact imply discomfort with sharing personal or emotional information, potentially shame or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; responses are consistent and straightforward. - Family influence: Their mention of caregiver separation reflects awareness but does not show external influence over response honesty.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Defensive concealment\u2014an effort to hide vulnerability and avoid emotional exposure related to attachment fears. - Severity: Moderate\u2014the patient reveals core concerns but suppresses emotional detail, which could lead to underassessment of their true attachment and emotional needs. - Areas most affected: Emotional distress, trust, and attachment behaviors are most biased due to withholding. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are truthful at surface level but insufficient for full clinical understanding because of their defensive responses.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The depth of their emotional suffering, trauma-related memories, and genuine fears, all potentially concealed by their guarded responses. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of social withdrawal and emotional detachment likely exceeds what they verbally acknowledge. - Concerns probably amplified: Their expressed fears (\u201cscared,\u201d \u201ckind of\u201d) might be understated; underlying anxieties may be more intense. - True timeline: Emotional withdrawal appears longstanding and intensified by recent moves, but responses limit full insight into their developmental course."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me systematically analyze Liam's responses and communication pattern.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Phrases like \"kind of\" in \"kind of scared,\" and \"just stay quiet,\" suggest Liam is downplaying the intensity of his feelings and experiences. - Amplifying language: There's little evidence of exaggeration; responses are generally subdued and understated. - Vague language: Use of \"kind of\" and \"maybe\" (if present) indicates avoidance of specificity, implying discomfort or uncertainty about how to describe his feelings. - Emotional language: Words like \"scared\" signal presence of fear, but overall language is minimal and flat, indicating emotional detachment or numbness. He avoids emotional elaboration.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Very short, reserved answers, especially to open-ended questions. This indicates hesitance and possible withholding of details. - Directness: Responses are deflective; he answers only what is asked explicitly (\"I just stay quiet\") and does not volunteer additional info unless pressed. - Information volunteering: Very limited, mainly volunteering the core statement with minimal elaboration; this suggests reluctance to disclose. - Consistency: Responses are consistent, frequently repeating key phrases, demonstrating a pattern of guardedness.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Liam consistently avoids elaboration and offers minimally what is asked. Avoids talking about feelings in detail (e.g., \"don't say anything,\" \"stay quiet\"), indicating deliberate withholding. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying emotions like fear (\"kind of scared\"), suggesting he minimizes the severity or importance. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; responses appear subdued rather than exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance of eye contact, slouched body language, and minimal facial expressions signal discomfort or shame associated with discussing feelings. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident memory problems; responses are consistent, but responses are limited. - Family influence: The repeated emphasis on \"foster mom\" leaving and staying quiet could reflect past experiences of abandonment, influencing his caution, but no direct evidence of external manipulation.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response minimization and guarded communication, likely influenced by trauma-related distrust and emotional detachment. - Severity: Moderate\u2014Liam's reluctance to share detailed feelings and his minimal responses suggest significant withholding, but he's not entirely uncooperative. - Areas most affected: Emotional experiences related to separation, trust, and attachment are heavily biased; his fear and emotional state are likely underreported. - Reliability: Self-report appears limited and cautious; thus, their accuracy is compromised and should be supplemented with behavioral observations and caregiver reports.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of Liam's emotional impact, depth of fear and attachment issues, and internal distress are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Anxiety, fear of abandonment, and emotional suffering are probably worse than Liam admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Worry about trust and forming bonds might feel more intense internally, but Liam downplays these. - True timeline: The recent worsening of symptoms suggests more instability than Liam's brief responses reveal; emotional withdrawal likely developed gradually but is masked by his guarded responses.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam predominantly uses vague, minimal statements, often prefixed with \"kind of\" or \"just,\" indicating he\u2019s hesitant to fully disclose his feelings. His responses are emotionless and flat, reflecting emotional detachment. - Information flow: He is reluctant to volunteer information; responses are brief and reactive rather than elaborative. He tends to wait until asked, rather than proactively sharing. - Response style: His style is minimalistic, hesitant, and guarded, often repeating key phrases that reinforce his emotional distance and fear of revealing too much.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent brevity, avoidance of elaboration, and reluctance to discuss feelings suggest Liam withholds significant emotional and experiential information. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying fears (\"kind of scared\") and avoiding detailed descriptions imply he minimizes internal distress. - Amplification patterns: Not present; responses are subdued rather than exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance of eye contact, slouched posture, minimal facial expression, and crossing arms suggest discomfort and possibly shame associated with sharing feelings. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses indicate clear, although limited, internal experiences. - Family influence: Repeated references to \"foster mom\" leaving and feeling scared suggest past abandonment influences his guarded responses but lack explicit external manipulation indicators.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response minimization and emotional guardedness influenced by trauma, attachment issues, and fear. - Severity: Moderate\u2014Liam's responses are consistent but markedly limited; this obscures full understanding of his emotional state. - Areas most affected: Emotional experiences related to trust, fear of abandonment, and attachment distress are most biased; these areas are underreported. - Reliability: Self-report data is compromised; clinical observations and caregiver reports are necessary to obtain a fuller picture.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed emotional states, severity of separation anxiety, and internal distress are probably underrepresented. - Symptoms probably minimized: Anxiety, fear, and emotional withdrawal may be more intense than Liam admits. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about not trusting or belonging is real but underdisclosed; internal struggles are likely greater. - True timeline: Emotional withdrawal and symptom severity may have developed earlier and worsened recently, but Liam's guarded responses conceal this, requiring multi-informant data for accurate assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze Liam's responses and communication patterns step-by-step.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Liam uses words like \"kind of\" (\"kind of afraid\", \"kind of scared\") which suggest hedging and downplaying intensity. - Amplifying language: Less present; Liam describes feelings rather than exaggerated them. - Vague language: Frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" indicating non-specificity. Phrases like \"I guess I feel\" suggest uncertainty. - Emotional language: He expresses fear (\"afraid,\" \"scared\") and discomfort subtly, but not intensely; his tone is reserved.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Liam's responses are very brief and minimal, often one or two words or short phrases. - Directness: He tends to answer questions in a way that deflects elaboration, sticking to simple statements. - Information volunteering: He mostly waits for questions and doesn't volunteer additional details, indicating reluctance or discomfort sharing. - Consistency: Responses are consistent in being minimal and guarded across different questions; he repeats similar statements about his feelings when separated from caregiver.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Liam avoids elaborating on feelings (\"I just stay quiet,\" \"don\u2019t think about it much\"), which suggests withholding deeper emotional insight. - Minimization behaviors: He downplays how distressed he feels (\"kind of scared,\" \"not that bad,\" \"just stay quiet\"), implying that his distress might be more severe. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of overstatement; responses are understated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Evident discomfort when discussing feelings, indicated by quick, short answers and physical cues (fidgeting, avoiding eye contact). - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs but the vague language might reflect uncertainty or difficulty articulating feelings. - Family influence: Responses are influenced by trust issues; he sticks to neutral statements and appears reluctant to disclose deeper feelings or thoughts about abandonment.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: The main bias appears to be **underreporting or minimization bias**, as Liam intentionally downplays his emotional distress and avoids elaboration. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as his very short, guarded responses limit full understanding of his internal state. - Most affected areas: Emotional distress/attachment feelings, and internal experiences regarding separation. The minimal responses obscure true severity. - Reliability: Moderate; his responses are likely to underrepresent the actual emotional turmoil due to defensiveness and trust issues.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information missing: Likely, Liam is experiencing more intense fears and distress around separation and attachment than he admits. - Symptoms minimized: His emotional withdrawal and fear may be more severe. He probably feels more anxious and helpless than his brief responses suggest. - Concerns amplified: Worries about abandonment and trust issues may be exaggerated in his mind, but given his guarded responses, over-worrying might be accurate. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms may be more entrenched; he reports feeling distant since arrival, but the minimal responses suggest these feelings are possibly more intense and longstanding.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam\u2019s language is characterized by vagueness (\"kind of,\" \"I guess\") and minimal detail, indicating guardedness. He avoids emotional language and prefers neutral or vague descriptors. - Information flow: He is reluctant to share feelings openly, only responding when asked directly, and tends to withhold deeper insights, demonstrating guardedness and distrust. - Response style: Responses are minimal, monosyllabic, and repetitive, suggesting a defensive posture and discomfort with self-disclosure.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity, vagueness, and inability to articulate feelings suggest that Liam is withholding more intense or complex emotions. - Minimization behaviors: He downplays his fear and emotional distress, possibly to protect himself from vulnerability. - Amplification patterns: Little evidence; responses are understated, possibly underreporting true distress levels. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, and deflective answers indicate discomfort and shame about emotional experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; responses are consistent but vague, pointing to uncertainty or difficulty in naming feelings rather than confusion. - Family influence: His reluctance and guarded responses are likely influenced by past inconsistent caregiving, impacting his trust and willingness to share.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Underreporting/minimization bias dominates, as Liam minimizes his distress and avoids elaboration to prevent further discomfort. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his responses are consistently guarded and incomplete, necessitating cautious interpretation. - Areas most affected: Emotional distress, fears about abandonment, and attachment issues; responses limit understanding of true severity. - Reliability: Moderate trustworthiness; while Liam\u2019s responses are consistent, they probably understate the depth of his feelings and experiences.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deep feelings of fear, sadness, and attachment struggles are probably hidden behind his minimal responses. - Symptoms probably minimized: His withdrawal, emotional emptiness, and anxiety are likely more intense than conveyed. - Concerns probably amplified: Worries about abandonment may be exaggerated in Liam\u2019s internal experience, but his guarded responses suggest significant underlying fears. - True timeline: His emotional withdrawal has likely been longstanding, with current symptoms possibly worsening after recent changes, but his minimal communication masks the full extent of this progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient's responses exhibit consistent patterns aligning with known features of reactive attachment disorder. Analyzing their language reveals a tendency toward minimization and vagueness\u2014using words like \"kind of,\" \"don't know,\" and \"just\"\u2014which suggests reluctance to fully disclose distress or emotional experiences. Their responses are notably brief and hesitant, primarily providing minimal information unless directly asked, indicating withholding or discomfort. Non-verbal cues such as avoiding eye contact, slouched posture, and quiet speech reinforce their guardedness, typical of a child fearful of vulnerability. They tend to focus on physical sensations (\"tummy feels funny\") rather than emotional states, possibly as a strategy to mask internal distress. This indicates that they may be minimizing the severity of their emotional pain or the extent of their fears. Their tendency to repeat similar statements across questions suggests a structured but limited response pattern, likely influenced by discomfort or distrust. Overall, these patterns point to significant communication biases\u2014primarily minimization and emotional suppression\u2014that could impact accurate clinical assessment. The child's guarded responses and vagueness mean that their distress may be more profound than they openly admit, warranting careful interpretation of their disclosures.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The child uses vague and minimizing language, e.g., \"kind of afraid,\" \"not good inside,\" \"feel funny,\" which downplays the severity of internal distress. Communication is minimal and hesitant, with phrases like \"I don\u2019t know\" and \"I guess,\" indicating discomfort or reluctance. They focus on physical sensations rather than emotional complexity, perhaps to avoid vulnerability. - Information flow: The responses are primarily reactive\u2014they volunteer limited information (\"When she leaves, I just stay quiet\") and only expand slightly when asked directly (\"My tummy feels funny\"). The child tends to withhold detailed feelings unless prompted, showing guardedness. - Response style: Responses are short, minimal, and consistent across questions, with a pattern of avoiding elaboration and emotional disclosure, favoring silence and physical descriptions over emotional explanations.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague and minimal responses, avoidance of emotional content, and reliance on physical sensations suggest intentional or subconscious withholding of deeper feelings. - Minimization behaviors: The child downplays their emotional distress (\"don't really feel good inside,\" \"sit and wait\") and avoids expressing distress openly, possibly to shield themselves from perceived vulnerability or rejection. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggerating concerns; responses are subdued and guarded, consistent with avoidance rather than over-worrying. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance of eye contact, minimal facial expressions, and reluctance to elaborate on feelings indicate discomfort and possible shame about emotional vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: The responses are consistent and coherent, with no evident timeline or factual inconsistencies. - Family influence: The child's responses appear heavily influenced by past relational instability. Their guarded demeanor likely reflects ongoing mistrust due to inconsistent caregiving.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias is minimization and emotional suppression. The child strategically or subconsciously diminishes their internal suffering and reluctance to reveal full emotional states. - Severity: Moderate to severe\u2014responses suggest significant underreporting of emotional distress, which could hinder accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: Emotional pain and internal fears, such as the extent of separation anxiety and feelings of abandonment, are most likely underrepresented. - Reliability: Due to consistent guardedness and minimization, their self-reporting should be considered conservative; actual distress may be more severe than communicated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Genuine depth of fear, sadness, and attachment struggles is probably underreported. They might be experiencing more intense internal distress than indicated. - Symptoms probably minimized: The child's physical sensations and guarded responses hide heightened emotional suffering, including deeper anxiety or hopelessness. - Concerns probably amplified: They may have overestimated their vulnerability or hopelessness as a defense, but this is less evident. Their primary tendency is to underplay rather than overstate worry. - True timeline: Their reluctance and guarded responses suggest that their emotional withdrawal has been longstanding and possibly worsened by recent caregiver changes, but they may not fully acknowledge or recognize this, which distorts the reported progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I first examine Liam\u2019s language choices. He frequently uses vague and minimizing phrases such as \"kind of\" and \"maybe\" when describing his feelings (\"maybe sad or worried\")\u2014this suggests hesitance and potential reluctance to fully disclose his emotional state. His responses are notably short, which indicates a tendency to deflect or minimize engagement, especially for emotionally sensitive topics like his feelings during separation. When asked about physical sensations, he admits to feeling \"funny\" or \"kind of tight,\" but expresses uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t really know\"), reflecting possible difficulty in identifying or trusting his own emotional experiences. He offers minimal elaboration voluntarily and waits for prompts before sharing additional details, showing limited emotional openness and possibly guardedness to avoid vulnerability.  Next, looking at behavioral patterns, Liam often downplays the intensity of his feelings (\"not that bad,\" \"nothing special\"), and he mentions feeling \"empty inside\" but immediately hedges\u2014\"maybe sad or worried\"\u2014which suggests an attempt to minimize or avoid negative labels. His responses show signs of discomfort, such as avoiding eye contact and speaking softly, consistent with anxiety expression. The frequent use of \"I don\u2019t know\" when asked to elaborate indicates possible discomfort or uncertainty about his internal states or a lack of awareness, which can be common in FASD-like attachment issues.  From these observations, I identify that Liam exhibits signs of withholding information, especially about his internal feelings, likely driven by fear of judgment or shame, as there's evidence he is uncomfortable describing emotional pain overtly. His minimization of symptoms suggests he may be trying to hide the depth of his distress (\"not that bad,\" \"nothing special\"), which could mask more severe underlying emotional difficulties. The reluctance to elaborate or disclose full feelings indicates guardedness and possibly shame about vulnerability, typical in reactive attachment disorder.  Considering the bias severity, the primary communication bias appears to be **minimization** and **guarded response patterns**, likely exacerbated by emotional discomfort and mistrust due to his attachment history. The severity seems **moderate** because it affects the reliability of self-reported emotional symptoms but does not completely obscure key information. The areas most affected are his internal emotional states (\"scared,\" \"sad,\" \"empty\") and physical sensations, which he downplays or struggles to articulate.  Clinically, this suggests that Liam's self-report likely underestimates the true intensity of his emotional distress; he's probably experiencing more severe anxiety or attachment-related pain than he's willing to express openly. His responses are influenced by his guardedness and possible shame, meaning real distress might be masked behind minimal disclosures. His true timeline of emotional development might be more chronic and intensified after recent changes, but responses could be intentionally or unintentionally understated.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam\u2019s responses are vague and minimized (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"not that bad\") indicating hesitance to fully express distress. He uses short, hesitant answers and often hedges statements, reducing the specificity and emotional content in his disclosures. - Information flow: He is reluctant to volunteer detailed information, waiting for prompts and possibly avoiding emotionally charged topics. His responses are organized but limited, showing a tendency to withhold or suppress feelings. - Response style: Generally minimal and guarded, with responses that seem designed to prevent vulnerability. He avoids elaboration unless explicitly prompted and seems uncomfortable discussing his internal states.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Frequent use of vague language (\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d \u201cI just stay quiet\u201d), minimal elaboration, and immediate hedging suggest Liam may be intentionally or unconsciously withholding deeper feelings. - Minimization behaviors: He downplays the severity of his feelings (\u201cnot that bad,\u201d \u201cnothing special,\u201d \u201cnothing else\u201d), suggesting he may be minimizing or not fully acknowledging distress. - Amplification patterns: There is little indication of exaggeration; responses tend to minimize rather than amplify, consistent with guardedness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Discomfort in discussing emotional experiences and avoidance of eye contact suggest shame or fear about vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty in describing internal sensations indicates limited emotional awareness or difficulty in comprehending and conveying internal states. - Family influence: The consistent theme of mistrust and fear of abandonment points to effects of early neglect and caregiver inconsistency influencing responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization and guarded response bias, driven by fear of vulnerability, shame, and mistrust, compounded by attachment insecurity. - Severity: Moderate, because responses underrepresent the intensity of emotional distress and physical sensations, affecting clinical accuracy. - Areas most affected: Internal emotional states (fear, sadness, anxiety) and physical sensations (stomach, chest feelings), all of which are likely underreported. - Reliability: Self-report data should be interpreted cautiously; responses are influenced by Liam\u2019s guardedness, and actual distress may be more severe.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Liam\u2019s true emotional pain, severity of anxiety, and attachment distress are probably more intense than expressed. He may also conceal the extent of his feelings of emptiness or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: Anxiety, fear of abandonment, and emotional withdrawal are likely worse; his minimization responses mask these underlying issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Liam\u2019s worries about abandonment and not belonging are genuine, but his responses may downplay their severity, making his internal experience more distressing than indicated. - True timeline: Difficult to specify precisely, but his emotional withdrawal likely developed gradually and worsened with recent caregiver changes; self-reports tend to understate this progression."
