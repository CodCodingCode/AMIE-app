    "analysis": "THINKING: In analyzing the patient's responses, I notice carefully chosen language that minimizes the perceived severity of the symptoms, indicating potential minimization bias. Phrases like \"nothing too crazy\" and \"just some itching and a little discharge\" suggest an effort to downplay the problem, perhaps due to embarrassment or fear. The patient volunteers basic information initially but tends to provide more detail when explicitly asked, which indicates a possible reluctance to spontaneously share full details, perhaps to avoid fully confronting the issue. The overall tone is hesitant, with signs of embarrassment and modesty, but no overt signs of exaggeration. The timeline of symptoms starting three days ago and gradually worsening aligns with typical early infection progression but could be misrepresented if the patient is downplaying initial discomfort. The focus on the concern about serious consequences shows anxiety potentially amplified by health fears, but the responses lean more toward suppressing or minimizing the extent of symptoms rather than exaggerating them. Overall, these patterns suggest moderate minimization bias driven by embarrassment and health anxiety, affecting the subjective symptom reporting and possibly obscuring the true severity of the infection.\n\nANSWER: The communication patterns show that the patient uses vague and minimizing language, such as \"nothing too crazy\" and \"just some itching,\" which indicates an effort to downplay symptoms. Responses are somewhat organized but tend to be delayed or less detailed until explicitly prompted, revealing reluctance or discomfort. The patient\u2019s answers are consistent in suggesting mild symptoms but may actually be underestimating their severity due to embarrassment or fear. Signaling behaviors include fidgeting, avoiding eye contact initially, and modest verbalizations, especially when discussing sensitive topics like sexual activity. Evidence of information withholding includes hesitations when describing the full extent of symptoms and initial minimization of severity. The primary bias appears to be moderate minimization, possibly influenced by embarrassment and concern about judgment. This could lead to underestimation of the infection's severity, affecting clinical assessment reliability. Clinically, the provider should be alert to the possibility that symptoms might be more significant than reported, especially given the patient's sexual history and gradual symptom worsening. There might also be unacknowledged concerns about stigma or shame affecting openness."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses systematically. \n\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\nThe patient frequently uses minimizing language such as \"just some itching,\" \"nothing too crazy,\" and \"not really a lot.\" These phrases suggest an attempt to downplay the severity of symptoms. There is also vagueness with words like \"kind of\" or \"sort of,\" which serve to soften descriptions and potentially avoid alarming the provider. The patient reports feeling \"a little uncomfortable\" and \"more of the same,\" which could dilute the perceived seriousness. Emotional language is minimal but includes concern and nervousness, evidenced by phrases like \"worried\" and \"not sure,\" indicating underlying anxiety.\n\nSTEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS:\nResponses tend to be brief and guarded, providing only essential information unless prompted. The patient initially volunteers basic symptoms but seems reluctant to elaborate unless asked directly. When discussing timeline and symptom progression, answers are consistent but contain softening language, possibly to avoid emphasizing severity. There is some evidence of response organization, but responses are generally cautious, avoiding detailed descriptions unless specifically queried.\n\nSTEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION:\nSigns of information withholding include the patient\u2019s tendency to understate symptom severity (\"not really a lot,\" \"not that bad\") and focus on minimizing discomfort. Embarrassment signals are present, possibly evidenced by hesitation (\"Um,\" \"I guess\") and a preference for informal, vague language. There are no overt signs of exaggeration or amplification; instead, the responses lean toward underreporting. Fidgeting or shifting is implied in the context but not directly observed here, although the modest tone suggests discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose.\n\nSTEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nThe main bias appears to be minimization of symptoms, perhaps coupled with a modest or reserved communication style. The severity of this bias is moderate\u2014the patient avoids conveying the full extent of discomfort, risking underestimation of infection severity. The areas most affected are symptom severity and potential risk perception; the patient downplays discomfort but is aware of risks. The reliability of self-reporting is somewhat compromised due to these tendencies.\n\nSTEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nThis communication bias could lead to underrecognition of symptom severity and delayed assessment of complication risks. The patient's self-report likely underestimates the true pain and discomfort experience. They may also be underreporting associated symptoms such as soreness or signs of systemic illness. Concerns are likely amplified internally (worry about seriousness), but externally minimized. The timeline provided appears accurate but may not fully capture ongoing or worsening symptoms if they occur.\n\nANSWER: The patient's responses exhibit a clear pattern of minimizing symptoms through the use of vague, softening language and reluctance to fully describe the severity of discomfort. They tend to withhold detailed information about how intense symptoms are, likely to avoid embarrassment or alarm. The restricted response style and cautious responses suggest a moderate bias toward downplaying their condition, affecting the clinical assessment by potentially underestimating their distress or infection severity. The self-report should be interpreted with caution, and further probing into pain levels, systemic symptoms, and emotional state is advisable to obtain a more accurate clinical picture."

He exhibits embarrassment and hesitation, shown by his modest language, avoidance of direct eye contact initially, and self-deprecating manner. There is also a tendency toward minimization, where he downplays symptoms (\"nothing too crazy,\" \"a little discomfort\") and admits to ignoring minor signs initially. He displays some confusion or uncertainty about the progression and significance of his symptoms, indicated by vague descriptions and concerns about worsening. There is no evidence of storytelling or family pressure; his focus remains on his physical symptoms and worry about health outcomes.\n\nANSWER: The patient shows clear signs of anxiety and fear about his health, along with embarrassment and hesitation when discussing sensitive symptoms. He tends to minimize the severity of his discomfort while expressing worry about potential serious infections. To be most helpful, an empathetic approach should reassure him that his concerns are valid, normalize his feelings of embarrassment, and provide clear information to reduce his uncertainty. Offering reassurance without dismissing his worries will help him feel supported and understood."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought reasoning, I examine the patient's responses across multiple responses. Starting with language analysis, the patient uses words like \"just\" (\"It's just some itching...\"), \"a little\" (\"hurts a little,\" \"soreness a little\"), and \"kind of\" (\"kind of clearish discharge\"), which are minimization phrases suggesting an effort to downplay the severity. The use of vague terms like \"a little,\" \"kind of,\" and \"sort of\" indicates an attempt to minimize or generalize symptoms, possibly to avoid appearing overly concerned or to shield themselves from judgment. \n\nEmotionally, the patient shows signs of embarrassment and nervousness, such as hesitation (\"Um, yeah,\" \"I guess\") and possible discomfort when discussing symptoms, indicating shame or reluctance. \n\nIn response pattern analysis, the responses are generally brief and somewhat cautious, answering directly but with caveats or softening phrases, suggesting they might be withholding details or minimizing by not fully elaborating. They volunteer core symptoms (itching, discharge, soreness) early, showing some transparency but tend to omit details about sores or other signs unless specifically asked, which could reflect discomfort or an unwillingness to fully disclose.\n\nBehavioral indicators include hesitance, adjusting clothing, avoiding eye contact, and tense posture\u2014signs pointing to discomfort and possibly withholding some concerns. For example, the patient admits to unprotected sex but minimizes worry, possibly underestimating the risk. They express concern but also downplay symptoms, indicating a bias toward minimization, likely to manage feelings of shame or embarrassment.\n\nAssessing bias severity, the main bias seems to be minimization, possibly mixed with some denial or reluctance. It is moderate because they do share key symptoms but avoid details that could increase anxiety or shame. The most affected areas are the description of symptoms and sexual history, which could be underreported or downplayed. Trust in self-report is moderate; they provide basic info but may omit uncomfortable details.\n\nIn clinical implications, it\u2019s likely that they are not fully disclosing all symptoms\u2014possibly more severe or concerning signs like sores, fever, or more intense pain are being minimized or omitted. They probably worry about stigma, so they avoid discussing more alarming symptoms. Their timeline seems consistent, but their concern might be amplified, overestimating the worst scenario (\"what if it gets worse\"), which is common in anxious patients but may cause overestimation of severity.\n\nANSWER: The patient's responses show a tendency toward minimization and vagueness, with language like \"just some itching\" and \"a little\" discharge, indicating an effort to downplay symptoms. They volunteer basic symptoms but tend to avoid detailed descriptions of more concerning signs such as sores or lesions, possibly due to embarrassment or shame. Their brief, cautious responses and the use of qualifying language suggest some reluctance to fully disclose the extent of their symptoms, which could hide more severe issues. The responses reflect moderate bias\u2014mainly minimization\u2014especially regarding the perceived severity of their condition. Overall, their self-reporting is somewhat reliable but possibly underestimates the true severity of symptoms, necessitating careful clinical evaluation to verify completeness and accuracy."

    "analysis": "THINKING: I want to analyze the patient's responses to detect subtle signs of biases that may influence the clinical picture. First, regarding language analysis, the patient often uses minimization words such as \"just\" and \"a little\" when describing symptoms, which suggests an attempt to downplay their discomfort. Phrases like \"nothing too crazy\" and \"not that bad\" further indicate minimization of the severity. The description is also vague\u2014\"kind of,\" \"sort of\"\u2014which could imply uncertainty or a tendency to understate symptoms. There are signs of embarrassment and shame, evident in the hesitant tone, modest language, and the need to clarify that symptoms are not severe. \n\nNext, response pattern analysis shows responses are generally brief unless prompted, with the patient volunteering minimal information initially, then elaborating when asked directly, revealing a degree of reluctance or avoidance to share details upfront. Their responses are mostly consistent, but some responses (e.g., \"no obvious sores or blisters\") might mask more subtle findings they haven't detected or are unwilling to describe fully. The patient exhibits a tendency to respond cautiously, potentially withholding or minimizing information about more serious symptoms like sores or ulcers. \n\nBehavioral indicators include evidence of information withholding\u2014say, not mentioning skin lesions or discomfort beyond mild soreness\u2014possibly because of embarrassment. The patient appears to minimize symptoms (e.g., \"not really getting better,\" but no mention of worsening signs like ulcers or pain). There\u2019s little amplification of symptoms; rather, there\u2019s a cautious tone. Expressions of embarrassment and awkwardness reinforce shame signals when discussing sensitive areas. No distinct confusion or contradictions are present, and there's limited evidence of influence from others; responses seem mostly internally motivated.\n\nSeverity assessment shows the main bias is minimization, with moderate severity because the patient underreports symptoms which could be more severe or concerning. The bias most impacts descriptions of lesions or systemic symptoms, possibly leading the clinician to underestimate the seriousness of the infection. Trust in self-reporting should be moderate; the patient tends to understate severity but is clear about key symptoms like itching and discharge. \n\nClinically, this suggests missing information about skin lesions or systemic signs that could indicate a more advanced or complicated infection. Symptoms like ulcerations or pain might be underreported due to embarrassment or lack of awareness. There\u2019s a risk that the patient is minimizing symptoms related to more serious conditions like herpes or other STIs. Their true timeline for symptom worsening could be faster, especially if discomfort escalates beyond what they disclose. They may also be over-worried about the possibility of serious illness, but their downplaying limits accurate assessment.\n\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and minimizing language such as \"kind of,\" \"just some itching,\" \"not that bad.\" These choices suggest an effort to reduce perceived severity. The tone is cautious and somewhat self-deprecating, indicating discomfort or embarrassment discussing sensitive symptoms.\n- Information flow: Initially reluctant, with brief responses, but more detailed when asked directly. They tend to hold back information unless prompted, indicating hesitance or concern about how serious the symptoms are.\n- Response style: Responses are mostly concise, with some elaboration after probing. The pattern suggests a tendency to understate symptoms for comfort or embarrassment.\n\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient avoids mentioning skin lesions or ulcers, possibly due to discomfort, and minimizes discomfort levels. They also do not volunteer details about systemic symptoms, indicating possible reluctance to reveal full severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just some itching,\" \"not that bad,\" \"little discharge,\" indicates deliberate downplaying of symptoms, which could mask underlying severity.\n- Amplification patterns: There\u2019s little evidence of overstatement; the focus is on downplaying. No signs of over-worrying or exaggeration are noted.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitant tone, cautious language, and the need to specify \"not obvious\" sores reveal shame or discomfort discussing anal symptoms.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The patient's responses are consistent; no evidence of factual confusion or inconsistent timelines.\n- Family influence: Responses are internally motivated, with no indication of external influence affecting responses.\n\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main bias is minimization, driven by embarrassment and a desire to avoid alarm, leading to underreporting of more serious signs (e.g., ulcers or systemic symptoms).\n- Severity: Moderate; the patient\u2019s downplaying could obscure signs of more serious infections, impacting diagnosis accuracy.\n- Areas most affected: Physical signs like ulcers, systemic symptoms, or swelling are most biased, as the patient may not be fully aware or willing to disclose them.\n- Reliability: Moderate; the patient provides consistent information about certain symptoms but likely omits or underestimates key features that could indicate severity.\n\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient probably isn\u2019t revealing potential skin lesions, ulcers, or more severe pain, which are important for diagnosing conditions like herpes or complicated STIs.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs such as ulcers or significant pain could be worse than reported; the patient minimizes discomfort and appearance of lesions.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about serious infections might be overestimated, but minimal disclosure limits assessment of actual severity.\n- True timeline: The progression of symptoms might be faster or more severe than described, especially if symptoms worsen without acknowledgment.\n\n**In summary**, the patient's communication reflects moderate minimization bias influenced by embarrassment and a desire to appear nonchalant, which could hinder accurate clinical diagnosis."

Phrases such as \u201ckind of clearish,\u201d \u201ca little watery,\u201d and \u201cnot really bad\u201d suggest vagueness and softening of severity. There\u2019s evident discomfort, but the language downplays its impact. The use of \u201csort of,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d further indicates an attempt to minimize or avoid emotional engagement about symptoms. Words like \u201cworry,\u201d \u201cconcerned,\u201d and \u201cwondering\u201d reflect some anxiety but are mild, suggesting ambivalent feelings.\n\nSTEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS:\nResponses to direct questions about sores, bleeding, or systemic symptoms are brief and somewhat vague; the patient answers in the negative (\u201chaven\u2019t seen...anything like that\u201d) without elaborating details, possibly avoiding confirming more serious signs. When asked about the nature of discharge and sensations, responses are concise and focus on basic descriptions, likely to prevent overstatement. The patient volunteers information about timing and context but limits detail, suggesting a tendency to underreport or withhold more uncomfortable details unless prompted.\n\nSTEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION:\nSigns of withholding include the lack of mention of any small lesions or sensations that could suggest ulcerations or ulcers. The patient avoids detailed descriptions of symptoms that might be viewed as more serious or embarrassing. Slight tension in body language (fidgeting, shifting) and modest verbal responses indicate embarrassment or discomfort. No overt signs of amplification; symptoms are described in their mildest terms.\n\nSTEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nThe main bias appears to be Minimization, as the patient consistently downplays the severity of symptoms, emphasizing that nothing \u201creally bad\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d The severity level is moderate, given that actual symptoms (discharge, soreness) are real but likely more serious than described. Areas most affected include the description of the lesion severity and systemic symptoms, which are understated. The reliability of self-report is moderate; they tend to minimize but do report key symptoms honestly when asked directly.\n\nSTEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on this analysis, the patient is probably hiding or minimizing some clinical signs like small ulcers or more intense symptoms. The discharge and soreness, although downplayed, could suggest a more significant infection, possibly with ulceration or inflammation not readily apparent. The actual progression of symptoms may be worse than reported; systemic signs are unlikely to be present yet but should be monitored. The patient's focus appears on benign explanation (hemorrhoids, irritation) rather than more concerning pathology.\n\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: Uses vague, mild descriptors such as \u201ckind of clearish,\u201d \u201cnot really bad,\u201d indicating minimization; emotional language is subdued, reflecting discomfort but effort to downplay symptoms.\n- Information flow: Tends to be reserved, volunteering basic details but withholding specifics about lesions or systemic symptoms unless asked; responses are organized but limited in detail.\n- Response style: Responses are concise, somewhat minimal, and defensive, avoiding elaboration on more concerning findings, which could hinder full clinical assessment.\n\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No mention of ulcers, blisters, or lumps despite questions targeting these; avoidance suggests reluctance to reveal potentially more serious signs.\n- Minimization behaviors: Describes symptoms as \u201cjust some itching\u201d and \u201cnothing too crazy,\u201d minimizing their potential severity.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration exists; rather, the tendency is to understate or downplay.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation, modest language, and body language (fidgeting) suggest discomfort discussing sensitive areas.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Responses are consistent; no particular confusion detected.\n- Family influence: No evidence here.\n\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as the patient underplays the severity and extent of symptoms, possibly to avoid concern or embarrassment.\n- Severity: Moderate, because symptoms are real but symptoms or signs indicative of more serious pathology may be concealed.\n- Areas most affected: Lesion severity and systemic symptoms are most biased due to underreporting.\n- Reliability: Moderate; while core symptoms are acknowledged, potential signs of more serious pathology are likely underdisclosed.\n\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Subtle signs such as small ulcers, lesions, or more intense inflammation that the patient is not disclosing, possibly due to embarrassment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of infection, including possible ulcerations or systemic signs, could be worse.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient shows cautious worry but undercommunicates severity; actual risk might be higher.\n- True timeline: Progression could be more rapid or more severe than indicated; early symptoms might have escalated unnoticed.\n\nANSWER: The patient\u2019s communication reveals moderate minimization bias, with an underreporting of lesion severity and systemic symptoms. They exhibit subtle signs of embarrassment and reluctance to disclose detailed information about their symptoms\u2019 severity. This could lead to underestimating the clinical severity, emphasizing the need for careful examination and possibly more probing questions to uncover hidden signs. Their self-reporting should be interpreted cautiously, with an awareness of potential gaps in the information provided due to their biases."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient's responses reveal a pattern of embarrassment and hesitation, evidenced by modest language, avoiding detailed descriptions, and initially avoiding eye contact. There is also a tendency to minimize symptoms by labeling them as \"nothing too crazy\" and expressing concern about wasting the doctor's time, indicating some stoicism. The repeated focus on the timeline and general uncertainty about the signs suggests some confusion or hesitancy to fully articulate or understand their symptoms. There are no clear signs of increased anxiety or catastrophizing, nor evidence of family or caregiver stress, and the storytelling is minimal, focusing mainly on symptoms and recent sexual activity.\nANSWER: Embarrassment/hesitation, stoicism/minimization, confusion/uncertainty\nEMPLOYMENT OF EMPATHY: A compassionate approach would involve reassuring the patient that their feelings and concerns are normal, encouraging open communication without judgment, and acknowledging the courage it takes to seek care. Providing clear, nonjudgmental information can help reduce embarrassment and confusion, while validating their experience may ease their hesitation."

    "analysis": "THINKING: I need to analyze the patient's language and response patterns across multiple exchanges to identify possible biases or communication cues that might affect the accuracy of his self-report. First, I observe that Mark uses words like \"just\" in \"just some itching,\" which suggests minimization. The discharge described as \"kind of clear\" and \"not really thick\" indicates vague or non-specific descriptions, possibly downplaying severity. When asked about potential serious conditions, he responds with concern but qualifies it (\"I guess I\u2019m worried it might be something like an infection or something, but I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s serious or not\"), which may reflect uncertainty or an attempt to avoid alarming himself or the provider, hinting at possible minimization and some internal uncertainty.\n\nIn his responses, Mark tends to volunteer basic, surface-level details initially but avoids explicitly mentioning severe symptoms like visible sores or bleeding unless directly asked, indicating potential withholding of distressing details. His responses show some inconsistency in the level of concern; for example, he reports no fever or systemic symptoms but expresses ongoing worry aloud, which could suggest amplification of concern despite minimal physical signs. His language remains informal and modest, with hesitations (\"Um,\" \"I guess\") suggesting discomfort or modesty about discussing his symptoms, possibly to mask embarrassment or shame regarding sexual health topics.\n\nBehaviorally, Mark shifts from initial avoidance (avoiding eye contact, fidgeting) to more engaged when discussing symptoms, but overall stays somewhat reserved, reinforcing modesty. His reluctance to describe details like sores or more severe signs could be motivated by discomfort or fear of stigma, which might lead to underreporting.\n\nseverity, he shows signs of mild to moderate bias: minimization of symptoms and some withholding behavior concerning more severe signs, and possible amplification of worry about serious consequences. The biases most affect symptom descriptions related to physical findings (sores, bleeding) and systemic symptoms (fever), which are crucial for accurate diagnosis, thus reducing reliability. \n\nClinically, this suggests that he may be underreporting or minimizing significant signs of severity, potentially delaying diagnosis or misrepresenting symptom progression. His concern about infection might be real but amplified in terms of perceived seriousness, while actual internal signs could be understated. Therefore, I should be cautious about relying solely on his self-reported details and consider thorough physical examination and diagnostic testing to offset potential biases.\n\nANSWER: \nCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: Mark frequently uses vague descriptors like \"kind of\" and \"not really thick,\" which indicate non-specific, minimized descriptions. His emotional signals include worry but are expressed through qualifying language that inhibits directness.\n- Information flow: He tends to volunteer basic symptoms but is hesitant to disclose detailed or potentially more concerning signs unless prompted, showing some reluctance and guardedness.\n- Response style: His answers are somewhat terse, with hesitations and qualifiers, indicating discomfort or modesty. He often shifts from initial minimization to more detailed responses when pressed, but overall remains conservative in what he reveals.\n\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Mark avoids mentioning real signs like sores, bleeding, or systemic symptoms unless specifically asked, indicating possible reluctance to share full extent of symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: He downplays symptom severity (\"not really bad,\" \"just some itching,\" \"nothing too crazy\"), possibly to avoid overstating or appearing overly worried.\n- Amplification patterns: Despite minimal signs, he verbalizes concern about the seriousness, perhaps exaggerating perceived risk, which could reflect anxiety or fear.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: His modest language and hesitations around discussing sexual health topics suggest discomfort or shame, which may hinder full disclosure.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of memory problems; responses are fairly consistent but guarded.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence, but his reserved nature and concern about judgment could relate to internalized stigma rather than external influence.\n\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization combined with modesty/shame-related withholding, especially regarding physical findings and severity.\n- Severity: Moderate, as he underplays symptoms and avoids reporting potential concerning signs, which could obscure an accurate clinical picture.\n- Areas most affected: Physical signs such as sores or bleeding are most impacted, which are crucial for diagnosis and management.\n- Reliability: Moderate to low. While he reports symptoms honestly, his hesitations and avoidance of detailed negative findings imply that some severity or diagnostics might be underreported or not fully disclosed.\n\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Mark may be withholding or minimizing signs like sores, ulcers, or systemic symptoms, leading to underestimation of disease severity.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Physical indicators of advanced infection, such as sores or significant pain, are likely understated.\n- Concerns probably amplified: His overall fear of serious illness may cause him to overestimate the danger, influencing his emotional reporting.\n- True timeline: The progression may be faster or more severe than described, as his cautious language and guarding suggest he's not fully revealing the scope of his symptoms or concerns."
