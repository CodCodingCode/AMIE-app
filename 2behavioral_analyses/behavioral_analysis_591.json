    "analysis": "THINKING: Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient vividly describes severe symptoms without explicitly downplaying or minimizing, which suggests honesty rather than minimization. However, he does use some somewhat vague phrases like \"feeling like this for a few weeks now,\" which is non-specific about progression timelines. - Amplifying language: Words like \"really gotten a lot worse,\" \"feel like I might pass out,\" and \"so weak and shaky\" convey a sense of urgency and distress. There's an emotional tone indicating genuine concern. - Vague language: The description \"a few weeks now\" lacks precise timing, which could hide awareness of symptom onset or Fortschritt. - Emotional language: The patient exhibits fear (\"am I going to be okay?\"), frustration (\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening\"), and embarrassment, indicated by the need to seek help amid worsening health.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise but contain detailed descriptions of symptoms, indicating some willingness to share relevant information, but perhaps limited elaboration on daily impact or emotional state outside symptoms. - Directness: He answers directly to the physician's question but with urgency\u2014there's no evident avoidance. - Information volunteering: The patient volunteers core symptoms and progression, likely because he perceives them as significant. - Consistency: The description is consistent across statements, reinforcing perceived honesty.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence of withholding; he appears forthcoming about symptoms but may avoid discussing emotional impacts or social aspects. - Minimization behaviors: Little evidence here; he emphasizes severity, suggesting he perceives and reports symptoms accurately. - Amplification patterns: No overt overstatement; his description aligns with severe presentations. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; hesitancy appears mostly due to distress. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness in timeline (\"a few weeks,\" \"recently\"), but this likely reflects symptom development rather than memory impairment. - Family influence: Mentions family history but no indications that responses are heavily influenced or biased by others.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal evidence of bias; the patient seems honest and earnest, likely trying to convey severity accurately. - Severity level: Mild, as any vagueness is more about symptom progression timing than deliberate concealment. - Areas most affected: Timeline details might be slightly biased due to uncertainty, but overall, symptom severity seems well-reported. - Reliability: Fairly high; he appears motivated to seek help and is consistent in his reporting.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possibly precise onset dates and daily variations; emotional or social factors influencing his health perceptions may not be fully expressed. - Symptoms probably minimized: No signs suggest he is underreporting severity; description aligns with true severity. - Concerns probably amplified: He is genuinely worried and fearful, so his distress probably amplifies perceived urgency. - True timeline: Likely more gradual than he perceives; initial symptoms may have developed over weeks with worsening in recent days.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged and detailed descriptions, indicating honesty, but some vague timing indicates possible uncertainty. His language shows genuine distress, e.g., \"I feel really tired all the time\" and \"feeling like I might pass out.\" - Information flow: He appears forthcoming about key symptoms, volunteering detailed descriptions without much prompting. Organization is logical, following symptom development. - Response style: Responses are focused, concise, and directly relevant, demonstrating an earnest attempt to communicate severity without excessive tangential details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Little evident; the patient seems willing to share core issues. - Minimization behaviors: No clear evidence; severity descriptions are consistent and vivid. - Amplification patterns: The language suggests genuine concern but doesn't seem exaggerated beyond real symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal; no signs of reluctance to discuss health or social circumstances. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about timeline, likely due to symptom distress rather than cognitive impairment. - Family influence: No strong evidence of response bias from family; he references family history without overreliance.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Overall, honest, straightforward reporting with no evident bias. - Severity: Mild, as he's mostly accurate but uncertain in exact timelines. - Areas most affected: Timeline details may be somewhat biased by personal perception but overall, symptom description reflects true severity. - Reliability: Fairly reliable based on consistency, emotional sincerity, and detailed symptom reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise onset dates and daily symptom fluctuations. Emotional and social factors influencing his distress might not be fully articulated. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not apparent\u2014what he describes aligns with severe presentations. - Concerns probably amplified: His anxiety likely makes him perceive symptoms as worse; but his detailed reporting suggests genuine distress. - True timeline: Symptoms probably developed gradually over weeks with recent exacerbation, consistent with his account, though personal perception may exaggerate the immediacy."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes symptoms with emotive detail but avoids downplaying their severity; no clear minimization words like \"only\" or \"not that bad\" are present. - Amplifying language: He uses words like \"really,\" \"super,\" \"all the time,\" and \"like I might pass out,\" which could amplify perceived severity. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of,\" \"sort of,\" and \"maybe\" are absent, showing some attempt at clarity. - Emotional language: Heavy use of fear, anxiety, and frustration indicators\u2014\"really scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\" conveying high emotional distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Generally responsive but tends to answer directly when asked specific questions; more elaboration occurs when describing symptoms with emotional distress. - Directness: Answers straightforwardly but sometimes uses qualifiers or emotional terms that suggest discomfort. - Information volunteering: He tends to immediately volunteer details about vision and tingling after initial prompts, indicating a degree of openness. - Consistency: Responses about symptom timing and severity are consistent but heavily colored by emotional distress, which may cloud objective severity.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: None strongly evident; he provides rich details when prompted. - Minimization behaviors: No clear evidence; he openly describes quite severe symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Use of \"really,\" \"super,\" and \"like I might pass out\" could suggest some exaggeration of urgency, possibly to ensure his concerns are taken seriously. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; however, his initial anxiety and rapid speech might mask discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty in timing (\"sometimes,\" \"more during the day\"), but overall, timeline seems consistent. - Family influence: Mentions family history but provides personal feelings; limited evidence of family influence on responses.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight emotional amplification bias; the patient displays heightened concern and urgency, which could exaggerate perceived danger to ensure rapid attention. - Severity level: Moderate; emotional distress and possibly exaggerated urgency suggest some bias, but the core symptoms are real and serious. - Areas most affected: Subjective symptom severity and urgency perception are most biased; physical symptoms seem accurate. - Reliability: Some over-emphasis on the distress level, but their descriptions of symptoms are verifiable and consistent, suggesting reasonable overall reliability.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of duration or steadiness of symptoms; may not be fully expressing how long they've been worsening or if some symptoms fluctuate. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely; the patient is quite explicit about how severe symptoms feel emotionally. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s expression of fear (\"really scared\") and urgency may overstate the immediate danger, possibly motivated by anxiety. - True timeline: The patient reports worsening over 2-3 weeks with recent deterioration; this aligns with symptoms progressing, but emotional distress might make the progression seem faster than it actually is.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of specific symptoms (\"vision blurry,\" \"tingly hands,\" \"weak and shaky\") and emotional descriptors (\"really scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"nothing like this before\"). There's a tendency toward emotive language that emphasizes distress, which could inflate perceived urgency. - Information flow: He generally shares detailed symptom descriptions proactively, especially with emotional cues. His responses are organized around his distress, but he may additional details more to elicit concern rather than pure informational clarity. - Response style: The responses are elaborative when describing symptoms, with a hurried, anxious tone. He often repeats fears and feelings, indicating emotional engagement with the content.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; he appears forthcoming with symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; he emphasizes how bad he feels but might exaggerate the urgency. - Amplification patterns: The frequent use of adjectives (\"really,\" \"super,\" \"all the time\") and expressions like \"might pass out\" suggest emotional amplification of the symptoms\u2019 severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited signs; his openness about symptoms indicates less shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity in temporal details (\"more during the day,\" \"sometimes\"), but overall response consistency suggests decent recall. - Family influence: Mentions family history but no apparent influence on his responses beyond acknowledging awareness.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as he emphasizes the severity and emotional distress related to his symptoms, possibly to prompt urgent care. - Severity: Moderate; symptoms are indeed serious, but the heightened emotional tone indicates some overstatement. - Areas most affected: Perception of urgency and severity; physical symptoms are likely accurate, but emotional concern may amplify perceived danger. - Reliability: Fairly reliable overall; his descriptions align with typical presentation, though emotional bias may exaggerate his perceived threat.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific timeline details, variability of symptoms over longer periods, or any prior attempts to self-manage symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Unlikely; he tends to over-communicate severity rather than understate. - Concerns probably amplified: His sense of imminent danger and fear (\"really scared,\" \"I might pass out\") may overstate immediate risk. - True timeline: Progression seems consistent with the report\u2014worsening over weeks with recent acceleration\u2014but the emotional distress may make the progression appear more rapid than actual."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient utilizes specific descriptive phrases like \"feeling like this for a few weeks but worse lately,\" \"lost weight without trying,\" and \"sometimes I feel like I might pass out.\" These are relatively clear and specific. However, the patient also describes symptoms with words like \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" and \"I think,\" which suggest some degree of vagueness or uncertainty. Regarding emotional language, there are signs of fear and distress, shown by statements like \"I'm really scared\" and \"I don't really know why,\" indicating anxiety and concern. The language appears honest but somewhat hurried and anxious, possibly to convey urgency or distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: The responses are mostly concise and to the point, volunteering key information about worsening symptoms, weight loss, and near-fainting. The responses are direct when asked about timeline and symptoms, indicating a willingness to share relevant details. The patient appears to volunteer core information without much prompting, suggesting openness about primary concerns, though some queries about specifics may trigger brief, cautious elaborations.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of genuine distress are present, such as expressions of fear (\"I'm really scared\") and mentioning physical sensations (tingling, weakness). There is no overt minimization or exaggeration; responses seem aligned with actual symptom experience. Fidgeting or nervous behaviors aren\u2019t explicitly described but might occur given the tone. The consistency across responses indicates a credible account rather than withholding or exaggerating. No clues suggest family influence affecting responses here.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Main bias appears to be an honest reporting of symptoms without significant minimization or amplification, although the patient's anxious demeanor may introduce some emotional exaggeration of distress levels (\"really scared,\" \"feel like I might pass out\"). The severity of bias is likely mild; the patient is mostly straightforward, but their emotional state could lead to overemphasizing distress symptoms. The most affected topics are fear and urgency, which may color their perception of symptom severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Likely, the patient is accurately describing the progression of symptoms but perhaps overestimating how bad they personally feel (e.g., fear of passing out). There may be some emotional amplification of distress rather than factual exaggeration. True onset and progression seem consistent with the patient\u2019s reports, though their emotional state could make some symptoms seem more alarming. Less likely that significant information is being withheld; the patient seems motivated to seek help and is sharing key concerns.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices are mostly specific and descriptive, with some use of vagueness (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") possibly reflecting uncertainty. Emotional language such as \"really scared\" and \"I don't really know why\" indicates anxiety and distress. The tone suggests honesty but heightened concern. - Information flow is quite forthcoming; the patient volunteers detailed information about symptom chronology, severity, and emotional state, showing an organized and earnest attempt to communicate. - Response style is generally elaborate in emotionally charged topics but concise overall, likely driven by anxiety. The patient tends to answer directly when asked about symptoms but may be cautious when discussing fears or emotional responses.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs are minimal; the patient discloses most relevant details openly, suggestive of genuine distress. - Minimization behaviors appear absent; the patient describes symptoms as quite severe and worsening. - Amplification patterns are limited but present in emotional expressions like \"I'm really scared\" and \"It\u2019s really gotten a lot worse.\" These could reflect genuine concern rather than exaggeration. - Embarrassment or shame signals are not prominent; the patient openly discusses their symptoms and fears. - Confusion or memory issues are not evident; timeline and symptom descriptions are consistent. - Family influence isn't clearly affecting responses here; the patient focuses on personal symptoms and feelings.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type may be emotional amplification driven by anxiety; the patient is highly distressed, which could lead to overestimating symptoms' severity. - Severity seems mild to moderate; the patient\u2019s detailed and consistent history suggests credibility, though emotional state might heighten perceived seriousness. - Most biased areas involve emotional expression and perceived urgency, especially fears of passing out and the severity of symptoms. - Reliability is generally good, but clinicians should interpret expression of fear and distress within context, considering emotional influence.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing includes any coping attempts or previous symptom management, as the patient is primarily focused on current distress. - Symptoms probably minimized are unlikely; the patient presents symptoms as quite severe, though emotional distress might lead to some overestimation. - Concerns probably amplified are the emotional fears about passing out and health risks; these are prominent but may reflect emotional reactions rather than purely physical deterioration. - True timeline appears consistent across responses, with symptom worsening over weeks and acute deterioration in recent days."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes symptoms using moderate descriptors like \"a couple of weeks,\" \"way worse,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know why,\" which may suggest some degree of vagueness or reluctance to specify severity. Phrases like \"I don\u2019t really know why\" could indicate uncertainty or possible minimization of the complexity. - Amplifying language: There are no overtly exaggerative or dramatic phrases; the patient sticks to a genuine tone of distress without overstatement. - Vague language: The patient often uses non-specific terms such as \"a couple of weeks,\" \"way worse lately,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know why,\" which could mask uncertainty or hesitation to commit to concrete timelines. - Emotional language: The patient exhibits clear distress signs\u2014\"I keep feeling like I\u2019m gonna pass out,\" \"I don\u2019t really understand why,\" and \"it\u2019s gotten way worse,\" indicating anxiety and fear without overt emotive embellishment.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are brief and focused, especially when describing symptom progression (\"I don\u2019t really know why,\" \"I think it started maybe a few weeks ago\"). In structured questions, answers tend to be succinct, possibly indicating discomfort in elaborating. - Directness: The patient answers directly but with some hedging. For example, admits to worsening over weeks but avoids precise timelines or details, possibly to avoid admitting deeper concern or uncertainty. - Information volunteering: Limited; the patient reports only what is asked or vaguely alludes to past feelings (\"a few weeks ago\") and current worsening, showing some reluctance to disclose full extent voluntarily. - Consistency: Responses are generally consistent, aligning with the provided scenario, indicating honest reporting but with some cautiousness.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitation and non-specific timeframes suggest possible withholding of precise symptom details or severity levels. - Minimization behaviors: The language like \"a couple of weeks,\" \"I don\u2019t really know why,\" and avoiding elaboration may downplay the intensity or speed of symptom progression. - Amplification patterns: Not prominent; the patient appears genuinely distressed without clear exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort when discussing symptoms\u2014\"I don\u2019t really understand why,\" and hesitance hints at possible embarrassment or fear of judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; responses are coherent and logically ordered. - Family influence: No explicit signs; responses seem independently motivated.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate ambiguity bias. The patient shows some reluctance to specify things in detail, possibly to avoid alarm or due to uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate, as this marginally affects assessment accuracy but does not severely obscure critical information. - Areas most affected: Timeline and symptom severity, notably the precise onset and progression. - Reliability: Fairly reliable but with some caution needed, due to vagueness and hesitance in specifics.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details about how quickly symptoms have worsened, specific triggers, and precise timelines. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity or frequency of fainting episodes and dizziness may be underreported or understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety and fear might be overinterpreted, but given the context, the patient's distress seems genuine. - True timeline: Symptoms likely progressed more rapidly than described; the patient may be minimizing or hesitant to articulate the full severity or rate of deterioration.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague and cautious language, such as \"a couple of weeks,\" \"way worse,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know why,\" which reduces clarity and may obscure the true severity or timeline. The tone reflects genuine distress but with an effort to avoid alarming the clinician with overly dramatic language. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat hesitant and cautious, mostly reactive to direct questions, with little voluntary elaboration. The information appears organized but limited, and the patient seems reticent to share detailed chronologies freely. - Response style: Primarily brief, direct, and somewhat guarded, with occasional signs of discomfort or uncertainty when discussing symptoms, indicating possible reluctance to fully disclose or exaggerate.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The nondetailing of exact timelines and the hedging language suggest mild withholding or underreporting of symptom progression specifics. - Minimization behaviors: Using vague terms (\"a couple of weeks,\" \"way worse\") and avoiding specificity may inadvertently minimize the perceived severity or urgency of symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Not clearly evident; the patient appears authentic in reporting distress without overstatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signals of discomfort when discussing not understanding symptoms or their progression suggest some shame or fearfulness. - Confusion/memory issues: No overt signs; responses are coherent and internally consistent. - Family influence: No visible signs; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight ambiguity/misreporting bias, where the patient unconsciously minimizes detailed descriptions or avoids asserting the full severity due to anxiety or uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate, as it can impact precise assessment but does not significantly distort the overall picture. - Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy and symptom intensity details are most biased, which could obscure rapidity and urgency of progression. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; responses confirm symptoms but require probing to elucidate the full extent.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details about onset, progression speed, and frequency of fainting episodes are probably understated. The patient may be reluctant to fully admit the rapid worsening or severity of episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: episodes of dizziness and fainting and the severity of weight loss or fatigue may be underestimated. - Concerns probably amplified: the patient\u2019s expressed distress and fear are genuine; over-worrying about immediate danger is unlikely. - True timeline: Symptoms are probably more acute and worsening faster than the patient reports, given the hesitation and vagueness about specifics.  This analysis indicates the patient is generally providing truthful information but with some subtle minimizations and hedging, mainly about timeline details and severity, influenced by anxiety and fear of the unknown."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses systematically. The patient is reassuring in language but exhibits certain tendencies that may distort the clinical picture. They tend to use vague, non-specific terms (\"a little while ago,\" \"gotten worse,\" \"feel like I\u2019m gonna pass out\") which, combined with hurried responses, suggest a possibility of minimizing or downplaying symptom severity. Their repeated focus on feeling tired, shaky, and passing out indicates genuine distress, yet the responses are somewhat non-committal, hinting they may be avoiding detailed disclosure. They also express fear and confusion, which might amplify concerns. The pattern of brief, somewhat evasive answers combined with anxiety points to potential bias in self-reporting\u2014possibly minimized concerns about symptoms or reluctance to fully disclose. Given their age and emotional state, they might also be experiencing some shame or embarrassment, especially about the severity of symptoms like passing out or weight loss. Overall, these observations suggest moderate bias impacting accuracy of their report, likely leading to underestimation of severity in some symptoms.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and non-specific language (\"a little while ago,\" \"gotten worse,\" \"feel like I\u2019m gonna pass out\"), which might obscure true symptom severity or timing. They also seem emotionally overwhelmed but don't explicitly express shame or embarrassment, although some discomfort is evident. - Information flow: Responses are brief and somewhat evasive, often waiting for direct questions before answering, indicating reluctance or difficulty in elaborating. There is a pattern of providing minimal details unless prompted explicitly. - Response style: The patient responds in a hurried, somewhat scattered manner, with a tendency to answer broadly without detailed elaboration. Their responses are consistent in mentioning worsening symptoms but lack specifics about triggers or episodic variations.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient provides only general descriptions (\"a little while ago,\" \"gotten worse\") and avoids specifying exact times or circumstances, suggesting an unconscious attempt to withhold full information. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"a little while ago\" or \"not that bad\" (if implied) indicate possible downplaying of symptom severity, even if the distress is real. - Amplification patterns: The patient does emphasize feeling faint, shaky, and the urgency (\"feel like I\u2019m gonna pass out,\" \"especially when I stand up\"), which may reflect genuine worry or slight exaggeration driven by distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the hurried tone and reluctance to delve into detailed histories could reflect discomfort with symptoms or fear of judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies appear in the timeline (\"a couple of weeks ago,\" \"started a little while ago\"), but overall, they provide a plausible progression, with no major signs of disorientation. - Family influence: There is some slight comparison to family members' health (\"my mother has type 2 diabetes\"), but no indication that family has directly affected responses beyond awareness.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate underreporting/minimization bias, possibly combined with anxiety-driven response amplification. The patient aims to avoid overemphasizing or minimizing symptoms but may unconsciously do both due to distress. - Severity: Moderate. The responses are fairly consistent in symptom mention but lack detailed contextual information, leading to some underestimation of severity. - Areas most affected: Detailed timeline, episodic triggers, and exact symptom severity are most biased; the patient\u2019s selective disclosure could hide the true urgency of the situation. - Reliability: Moderate reliability\u2014patient\u2019s expressions reveal genuine concern, but responses are limited and possibly incomplete, so caution is needed when interpreting self-reported data.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about episodic severity, exact timing of symptom escalation, and detailed triggers are probably underreported or glossed over. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient's vague language and brief answers may conceal how severe and frequent episodes like passing out or vision loss actually are\u2014possibly worse than they admit. - Concerns probably amplified: Their emotional distress and Speeds response may lead to overemphasizing certain symptoms like faintness or shakiness, though this is balanced with minimization tendencies. - True timeline: Likely more rapid worsening of symptoms than the patient reports, as they tend to use vague descriptors and avoid detailed timing."
