    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully analyze Liam's mother's initial response. Her language is direct and emphasizes the severity of the seizure activity: \"My boy's body keeps shaking again, and it won't stop.\" She provides specifics about recent seizure duration and frequency, indicating a focus on the worsening condition. Her tone suggests genuine concern rather than minimization, though her brief statement might reflect emotional distress or fatigue. She does not use minimizing phrases, and her decisive description points to an attempt at clear communication regarding urgency. There\u2019s no evidence of withholding information or amplification beyond the actual clinical concern. Her response is organized, straightforward, and likely reliable, although her emotional state might slightly influence her perception of severity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The mother uses specific, straightforward language that emphasizes severity (\"keeps shaking,\" \"won't stop,\" \"gotten worse\"). She avoids vagueness and conveys a sense of urgency. - Information flow: She provides relevant details willingly, indicating openness. Her response is concise but covers the critical clinical points, suggesting she is forthcoming with important information, though perhaps limited in elaboration due to stress. - Response style: Her reply is direct and factual, with minimal embellishment. She tends to articulate her concerns clearly when describing her son's condition.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There are no clear signs of withholding; she provides pertinent recent seizure details and expresses concern openly. - Minimization behaviors: No evidence of downplaying symptoms; rather, she emphasizes worsening and severity. - Amplification patterns: Not apparent; her description seems proportionate to her concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; she is openly discussing her child's health crisis. - Confusion/memory issues: No indications; her timeline appears coherent. - Family influence: No evidence that external factors influence her responses; her statements seem self-driven and focused on her child's medical state.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Least biased, mostly accurate reporting with an emotional overlay. No evident significant biases affecting her communication. - Severity: Mild bias\u2014her intense concern might magnify perceived severity, but her details appear credible. - Areas most affected: The emotional distress likely influences her perception of worsening, but her description of seizure activity aligns with clinical urgency. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy; her detailed account reflects genuine concern, although emotional stress might amplify perceived severity slightly.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Some specific details about seizure frequency, duration, or prior response to treatment might not be fully elaborated but are probably understood clinically. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely, as she emphasizes worsening and severity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional distress may lead her to perceive and report the situation as more severe than it might objectively be. - True timeline: Her account appears consistent with recent progression; no clear evidence of retrospective distortion.  Overall, her communication pattern reflects a motivated, forthcoming caregiver who accurately reports worsening symptoms but may be emotionally biased toward perceiving severity as higher. Her responses suggest reliable information with some emotional amplification of severity."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient does not explicitly downplay symptoms; rather, the focus is on emotional expression and distress. - Amplifying language: Words like \"won't stop,\" \"terrible,\" \"worse,\" \"upset\" reflect high emotional load but do not necessarily exaggerate physical symptoms beyond honest distress. - Vague language: The response is quite specific and emotionally charged; minimal vagueness is present. - Emotional language: Clearly present: \"I don't like this,\" \"It hurts,\" \"I\u2019m so tired,\" which reflect anxiety, fear, and exhaustion.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Short, direct expressions of fear and exhaustion. The patient primarily uses brief phrases, likely due to age and non-verbal communication style. - Directness: Responses are direct and emotional; he states how he feels with minimal deflection. - Information volunteering: The responses are focused on subjective feelings; there is little elaboration unless prompted. - Consistency: The responses are consistent in expressing distress, fatigue, and concern; no major contradictions.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; the patient openly communicates his feelings. - Minimization behaviors: Little evidence of symptom minimization; expressions seem honest and emotionally expressive. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; his language directly reflects distress, which may realistically represent his experience. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of embarrassment; the patient freely expresses discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight confusion is implied but not explicitly evidenced; focus is on emotional state. - Family influence: The primary expression is from the patient's perspective, suggesting he's mainly communicating feelings rather than being heavily influenced by family responses here.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014overwhelmed patient expressing strong distress due to severity of symptoms. - Severity level: Moderate; his intense emotional language suggests significant distress, though the factual content (seizure description) appears accurate. - Areas most affected: Emotional reaction to seizures; possible underreporting of frequency or severity details due to focus on feelings. - Reliability assessment: Responses are reliable regarding emotional state but may lack detailed seizure information.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics on seizure duration, precise frequency, and triggers; patient is more focused on emotional distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical details of seizures, such as exact timing or pattern, might be understated because the focus is on emotional impact. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about pain and exhaustion, with potential overemphasis on distress rather than objective data. - True timeline: The patient\u2019s description aligns reasonably with the clinical timeline, though emotional distress could magnify perceived severity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged, direct phrases like \"won't stop,\" \"it hurts,\" and \"I\u2019m so tired,\" indicating a focus on how he feels rather than precise medical details. - Information flow: Responses are forthcoming regarding emotional state; however, details about the physical aspects of seizures are sparse, possibly due to age and communication limitations. - Response style: The style is minimal but emotionally expressive, with brief phrases conveying intense feelings.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None evident; he openly shares feelings. - Minimization behaviors: Little evidence present; his language seems consistent with his actual distress. - Amplification patterns: The emotional language overemphasizes frustration and exhaustion but appears authentic. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None; the patient freely communicates discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Not explicitly indicated; focus remains on emotional reaction. - Family influence: The responses seem internally motivated; no clear signs of external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, due to intense affective expression of distress. - Severity: Moderate; his expressed fear and fatigue are significant, but there is no indication of inaccuracy. - Areas most affected: Emotional state reporting; physical details of seizures may not be fully detailed. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy regarding emotional and subjective distress but may be less detailed on clinical specifics.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise data on seizure episodes, triggers, or medication responses. - Symptoms probably minimized: Quantitative aspects of seizure activity might be understated; focus on feelings could overshadow event details. - Concerns probably amplified: His fear of ongoing suffering and exhaustion are heightened, which could lead to an overemphasis on their severity. - True timeline: The emotional account aligns with his condition, but physical details might not be fully conveyed, making the actual seizure pattern potentially more complex than described."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze Liam\u2019s responses through a systematic chain of thought.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Liam describes his seizure behaviors mainly with terms like \"jerks and flails a lot\" and \"his face looks funny,\" which are somewhat vague. He admits, \"I think the seizures last a long time, more than I can count,\" suggesting difficulty estimating duration. - Amplifying language: He emphasizes the severity with words like \"really hard to tell\" and \"more than I can count,\" indicating distress but perhaps exaggeration due to fatigue and fear. - Vague language: His description lacks precise timing (no exact seizure lengths) and subjective impressions like \"his face looks funny\" and \"sometimes his eyes are closed,\" which are not specific clinical signs. - Emotional language: Phrases like \"really hard,\" \"so tired,\" and \"it\u2019s really hard to tell\" reflect emotional distress, fatigue, and anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Liam's replies are relatively brief, matching his communication style, typically sticking to core descriptive words. - Directness: He answers questions with generalized observations (\"jerks and flails,\" \"his face looks funny\") but avoids detailed specifics such as exact duration. - Information volunteering: He provides some details about what he observes but waits for specific prompts, showing a pattern of limited elaboration. - Consistency: His responses are fairly consistent across similar questions, maintaining general descriptions, indicating he is trying to be truthful but limited by communication capacity.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No clear signs of withholding, but his vague quantifications suggest discomfort or difficulty recalling specifics. - Minimization behaviors: He describes his seizures as \"more than I can count,\" which may be an honest estimate, but the phrase could also indicate emotional overwhelm reducing clarity. - Amplification patterns: He emphasizes how \"hard\" and \"long\" the episodes are, possibly overemphasizing the distress to seek reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but his brief, guarded responses might indicate discomfort with the topic. - Confusion/memory issues: His statement \"more than I can count\" suggests some difficulty in tracking durations, albeit expected at his age and condition. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but the response could be influenced by parental anxiety or his own distress, though he appears to be communicating mainly from his perspective.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main pattern seems to be an emotional amplification bias, where Liam emphasizes severity and difficulty to convey his distress, possibly influenced by parental concern. - Severity: Moderate, as his descriptors are vague but emotionally charged, possibly exaggerating or overemphasizing distress levels. - Areas most affected: Seizure description and perceived duration, as he struggles to provide specific details. - Reliability assessment: Due to his age, communication limitations, and emotional state, his self-report is somewhat unreliable for precise clinical details but useful for emotional understanding.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise seizure durations, exact frequencies, and subtle neurological signs. He may underreport or overstate certain aspects due to emotional distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: The physical and neurological signs are described broadly; actual seizure severity and impact might be more intense. - Concerns probably amplified: His emotional response may amplify perceived severity, especially his feelings of exhaustion and distress. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent with the reported recent worsening, but emotional factors could intensify his perception of severity and duration.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam uses simple, emotionally charged descriptions like \"really hard to tell\" and \"more than I can count,\" emphasizing distress but providing limited clinical detail. His responses are brief and rely heavily on visual and sensory impressions rather than specific clinical markers. - Information flow: He responds in a somewhat organized manner but tends to keep responses succinct, likely due to communication limitations. He waits for prompts and doesn\u2019t volunteer detailed information unless asked. - Response style: Liam\u2019s style is minimal and descriptive, with occasional emotional emphasis, reflecting his age, non-verbal communication reliance, and emotional state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding, but his vague estimates suggest discomfort with detailed description or difficulty recalling specifics. - Minimization behaviors: Slight indications that he downplays or cannot precisely quantify seizure durations. His description of \"more than I can count\" might be realistic but could also be a cautious way to avoid seeming overwhelmed. - Amplification patterns: He accentuates how \"hard\" and \"long\" the seizures are, likely aiming to underscore his distress for reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; brief responses may reflect discomfort with discussing seizures or fear of burdening caregiver or clinician. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight suggestibility of clinical confusion; difficulty with precise timing indicates some cognitive or memory fatigue. - Family influence: While no explicit cues, the narrative suggests parental anxiety might influence his state, but Liam\u2019s responses are consistent regardless of the potential influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias is prominent, with Liam emphasizing distress and severity to communicate his suffering. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 his responses show genuine distress but are limited by his communication skills and emotional state, affecting detail accuracy. - Areas most affected: Seizure characterization and duration are least precise, and emotional tone influences his descriptions. - Reliability: Moderate \u2014 his narratives are shaped by emotional and communication limitations; clinical interpretation requires corroboration with objective measures.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about seizure duration, specific neurological signs, and preictal behaviors. His descriptions may omit subtle but important clinical features. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs and seizure severity could be more intense than perceived, especially if he is overwhelmed or exhausted. - Concerns probably amplified: His emotional state heightens perceived severity, possibly overestimating how long or intense seizures feel. - True timeline: The progression aligns with worsening conditions described by caregivers, but emotional exaggeration may influence his perception of duration and impact."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - The patient\u2019s responses are primarily non-verbal or vague, which is expected given his non-verbal status, but he uses phrases like \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d and \u201csometimes,\u201d indicating some uncertainty or difficulty in fully articulating his experience. - The words \u201creally tired,\u201d \u201cvery tired,\u201d \u201ckind of weird,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t think right\u201d suggest distress and confusion, perhaps heightened by fatigue, but also potentially amplifying his symptoms. - His description of moving \u201ca lot\u201d and feeling \u201cweird\u201d could be genuine but may also reflect an attempt to express discomfort or to communicate distress when precise description is hard to convey.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - The responses tend to be brief and somewhat ambiguous (\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201ckind of weird\u201d), possibly reflecting discomfort or difficulty understanding the questions fully. - He tends to answer questions directly but adds qualifiers, possibly indicating uncertainty or an emotional overlay that influences his clarity. - He offers some elaboration when describing his sensations (\u201clike I can\u2019t think right,\u201d \u201cvery tired,\u201d \u201cblurry\u201d), but somewhat inconsistently, which can reflect confusion or difficulty with memory. - His responses are generally consistent concerning his experience of exhaustion and movement, yet lack specific detail about the seizure timeline or awareness, likely due to cognitive or communication challenges.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Evidence of information withholding: The use of \u201creally tired,\u201d \u201ckind of weird,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d may denote reluctance or inability to fully explain, possibly withholding details due to confusion, fatigue, or distress. - Minimization behaviors: There is little clear minimization; he describes his symptoms with some detail, though possibly downplaying the severity (\u201ckind of weird\u201d instead of \u201cdangerous\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d). - Amplification patterns: Not evident here, though expressions of \u201creally tired\u201d and \u201cvery tired\u201d could reflect how overwhelming he perceives his state, possibly exaggerating emotional discomfort. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, though his brief and sometimes uncertain answers might relate to discomfort in explaining his symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: His mention of feeling \u201ckind of weird,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think right,\u201d and blurred feelings indicate genuine confusion likely linked to seizure effects or fatigue. - Family influence: No clear evidence that responses are influenced directly by family presence; responses seem internally generated but are limited by his communication capacity.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The predominant bias appears to be **confusion and interpretative bias** driven by his cognitive state, possibly compounded by fatigue and seizure effects. - Severity: **Moderate to severe** \u2014 his responses are limited, uncertain, and somewhat incoherent, affecting the reliability of his report on internal experiences. - Areas most affected: His descriptions of awareness, movement, and post-episode feelings are most biased by his confusion and verbal limitations. - Reliability assessment: Trust in precise detail is limited; his account likely underrepresents the full severity, particularly regarding seizure duration and awareness.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of his awareness during seizures and the precise duration and severity of movement are probably underreported due to confusion or communication barriers. - Symptoms probably minimized: His descriptions of feelings post-episode may understate confusion or exhaustion if he is unable to articulate lingering effects fully. - Concerns probably amplified: His expressions of \u201creally tired\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d may reflect an attempt to communicate distress rather than exaggerate; however, emotional discomfort might be overemphasized, affecting perception of severity. - True timeline: Actual seizure duration and post-ictal state are probably more prolonged and complicated than reported, considering his cognitive and communication limitations.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, emotionally charged phrases like \u201creally tired,\u201d \u201ckind of weird,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d indicating limited ability to specify sensations and possibly emotionally overlaying his descriptions. - Information flow: Responses appear somewhat reluctant and uncertain, with scattered details; he offers some insights but tends to qualify or qualify his answers, which suggests difficulty in fully conveying his experience. - Response style: Responses are minimal and somewhat inconsistent, reflecting confusion, fatigue, and limited verbal capacity, leading to potential incomplete communication about his condition.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The frequent use of \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d and \u201csometimes\u201d suggests hesitance or inability to provide comprehensive details, possibly due to cognitive overload or fear of judgment. - Minimization behaviors: The descriptions tend to focus on fatigue and weird feelings without elaborating on severity or danger, indicating possible underreporting of the full scope of his symptoms. - Amplification patterns: The expressions of \u201creally tired\u201d and \u201cvery tired\u201d could be emotional exaggerations of fatigue, though could also be accurate reflections of his state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but brief answers and hesitations may imply discomfort in describing his symptoms thoroughly. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear signs, as he reports feeling \u201ckind of weird,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think right,\u201d and blurred post-seizure states, consistent with seizure effects. - Family influence: Not directly evident, responses seem personally generated, though his dependence on caregiver cues likely influences the limited detail he provides.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The most prominent bias is **confusion and communication limitation bias** due to cognitive effects of seizures and fatigue. - Severity: **Moderate to severe**, as the quality of data is compromised by his limited verbal capacity and mental state, reducing reliability. - Areas most affected: His description of awareness, movement, and post-episode feelings are heavily influenced by confusion; therefore, clinical data derived from his responses require corroboration. - Reliability: Moderate to low; his account is likely incomplete and skewed toward his emotional expression rather than factual detail.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The clinician may underestimate seizure duration and post-ictal confusion because the patient cannot articulate these aspects fully. - Symptoms probably minimized: More severe movements, longer durations, or deeper loss of awareness might be underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: Feelings of tiredness and confusion may be over-expressed as emotional reactions, but their actual severity and impact could be greater. - True timeline: Likely longer and more complex than described; his cognitive impairment and fatigue obscure an accurate assessment of seizure characteristics."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses largely non-specific, emotional language. Phrases like \"really scared and tired\" and \"want it to stop\" reflect distress but do not specify particular aspects of the seizures. The responses are brief, indicating limited explanatory detail, which is typical for a non-verbal or minimally verbal child. The patient mentions feeling \"kind of weird,\" \"I don\u2019t know,\" and \"not really aware,\" showing a vagueness that may mask actual consciousness or awareness during seizures. The repeated emphasis on fatigue and wanting it to end suggests emotional distress, but little concrete detail is provided about the seizure features.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Responses are short and somewhat vague, with little elaboration. The patient does not volunteer additional details unless directly asked, indicating possible reluctance or limited expressive capacity. When asked about awareness or movements, the reply is broad and non-specific (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"kind of weird\"), hinting at possible difficulty in accurately perceiving or communicating these features. The responses are consistent across questions, showing a pattern of minimal disclosure rather than contradiction.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Evidence of potential information withholding includes the vague acknowledgment of feeling \"kind of weird\" and \"not knowing.\" The repeated statement of \"I don\u2019t know\" and lack of detailed description about seizure specifics suggest limited insight or reluctance to provide precise information. No overt minimization (e.g., denying severity) is apparent; rather, the child seems overwhelmed, which may impair accurate reporting. Expressions of tiredness and confusion are consistent, but they may also reflect genuine post-ictal states rather than deliberate minimization. There\u2019s little indication of embarrassment or shame.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary bias type: Likely a combination of cognitive and emotional response bias\u2014specifically, a tendency toward emotional distress impacting communication. Severity appears moderate: the child's limited vocabulary and emotional state hinder detailed reporting, but responses are generally truthful given context. The areas most affected include detailed seizure phenomenology and awareness levels; the child provides minimal detail, possibly due to fatigue or difficulty articulating. Reliability of self-reporting is moderate; emotional distress and limited language may obscure actual seizure features.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Information that is likely missing involves precise seizure characteristics\u2014the extent of awareness, duration of movements, and specific features\u2014since the child reports \"not really knowing\" or \"kind of weird,\" which could mask more nuanced features. Symptoms might be understated regarding cognitive or awareness levels during seizures, as the child\u2019s vague responses could reflect limited self-awareness or inability to communicate. Concerns may be overemphasized; the child's anxiety and fatigue could amplify perceived severity. The actual progression may involve more frequent or severe seizures than reflected, but the child's responses minimize complexity, possibly due to distress or limited understanding.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The child uses vague, non-specific, emotional language (\"really scared,\" \"want it to stop,\" \"kind of weird\"), with minimal descriptive detail about seizure features. Responses are brief, indicating limited expressive capacity. - Information flow: Responses tend to be reluctant and minimal unless prompted with specific questions. The child's answers are organized around emotional states rather than factual descriptions, leading to scattered information that likely underrepresents the seizure phenomenology. - Response style: The child\u2019s responses are minimal, direct when asked specific questions, but overall limited and vague, consistent with distress and limited verbal skills.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The repeated \"I don\u2019t know\" and vague descriptions suggest a reluctance or inability to fully disclose seizure details, possibly due to confusion or emotional overwhelm. - Minimization behaviors: Not overt minimization, but the child\u2019s vague responses could downplay the severity or specifics of seizure experiences. - Amplification patterns: Signs that may amplify concern include expressions of extreme tiredness and \"kind of weird\" feelings, which could be emotionally exaggerated due to distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear evidence; responses indicate discomfort but not shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses of \"not really knowing\" and \"kind of weird,\" plus feelings of confusion after seizures, suggest possible post-ictal confusion and limited cognitive insight during episodes. - Family influence: The child's responses seem internally consistent, with no apparent external influence affecting responses, but caregiver reports may shape the child\u2019s understanding indirectly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional distress impact bias, as the child's high stress level influences response content and delivery. - Severity: Moderate; the child's limited vocabulary, emotional state, and possible post-seizure confusion hinder precise communication. - Areas most affected: Seizure details, awareness during episodes, and post-ictal state descriptions are most biased, with responses geared towards emotional expression rather than detailed fact-sharing. - Reliability: Moderate; likely to underreport or simplify seizure features, so clinical interpretation should be cautious.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact seizure phenomenology, awareness level, and duration, due to the child's vagueness and potential confusion. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of seizure movements and cognitive effects may be understated\u2014the child's responses do not fully detail the extent of involvement. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety and fatigue may heighten emotional responses, possibly amplifying perceived severity. - True timeline: Actual seizure frequency and severity could be higher than reported; the child's limited report suggests possible underestimation of ongoing risks."
