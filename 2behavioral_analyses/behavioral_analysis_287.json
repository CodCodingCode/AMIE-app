    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze Emily's response carefully. She uses words like \"just been feeling really tired\" and \"things have just gotten worse,\" indicating some tendency to downplay or minimize her symptoms, possibly trying to avoid alarming the physician. Her description of symptoms is somewhat vague, lacking detailed chronology or severity assessment. She mentions her symptoms \"like\" they started \"a few weeks ago,\" but seems uncertain about the timeline, which suggests possible confusion or difficulty recalling the exact progression. Additionally, her emotional tone implies anxiety and some emotional distress, but she's speaking openly, which suggests a willingness to share but perhaps with some guardedness. The response pattern shows she is providing general information preemptively, possibly to reassure herself or out of concern for being seen as overly worried. Overall, her language indicates some minimization, and her uncertain timeline hints at potential memory or cognitive biases affecting her reporting.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use vague and softening words like \"just\" and \"like,\" which may reduce perceived severity but also blur the clarity of her symptoms. Her tone is honest but somewhat tentative. - Information flow: She volunteers core symptoms but shows uncertain recall of the timeline, indicating a response that is somewhat organized but with gaps or ambiguity. - Response style: She provides an overview rather than detailed, specific accounts, favoring general descriptions that could obscure the precise course and severity of her symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she appears willing to share, though her vagueness may stem from genuine confusion or a subconscious tendency to understate. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" when describing symptoms (\"just been feeling really tired\") suggests an attempt to downplay how severe or persistent her symptoms are. - Amplification patterns: She doesn't seem to exaggerate; her language aligns more with mild underemphasis rather than overstatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; she seems comfortable speaking openly, although she may be subtly softening her descriptions. - Confusion/memory issues: Uncertain about the timeline (\"a few weeks ago\" vs \"last few weeks\"), indicating possible memory fuzziness or difficulty sequencing her symptoms. - Family influence: No explicit evidence present, but her acknowledgment of \"getting worse\" without precise details could imply awareness of concern from family or external pressures to present her situation as manageable.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization and timeline confusion are most prominent; she attempts to downplay symptom severity, possibly to avoid conveying distress. - Severity: Moderate; her vague descriptions and mild minimization could lead to underestimation of the true severity but do not entirely obscure critical information. - Areas most affected: Timing and severity of symptoms are most biased; she understates how persistent or severe her fatigue and bleeding might be. - Reliability: Moderate trust; her openness suggests reliable reporting of feelings but with some bias toward minimizing or memory gaps affecting precision.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of fatigue and bleeding severity, actual timeline of symptom progression, and detailed specifics on how symptoms interfere with her daily life. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity and impact of her fatigue and bleeding could be worse than described; she may not fully realize or wish to emphasize how serious her condition is. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be overly worried about the illness being manageable or may focus on being \"weak\" rather than on the seriousness, but her vague timeline indicates potential underinformed perspectives. - True timeline: Actual symptom progression might be more rapid or severe; she reports a general worsening but is uncertain about exact dates or sequences, suggesting memory or emotional factors influence her account.  Overall, Emily's responses reflect mild to moderate biases, especially in minimizing severity and uncertainty about timeline, which could impact accurate clinical assessment if not carefully probed."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient uses vague phrases like \"kind of jumbling together,\" which suggests some attempt to downplay the clarity or severity of her memory about symptom onset. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"really tired all the time,\" \"fevers keep coming back,\" and \"I don't understand what's going on\" indicate high emotional distress and concern, emphasizing her anxiety. - Vague language: The timeline (\"last week,\" \"maybe two weeks ago\") shows uncertainty, indicating possible difficulty in recalling exact events or an emotional distancing from the specifics. - Emotional language: Use of terms like \"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"worried,\" and \"tired\" reflect genuine emotional distress, but also potential discomfort discussing details, possibly leading to some withholding or filtering.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are brief and somewhat fragmented, triggered by uncertainty or emotional overload. The patient prefers to speak in generalities rather than precise details. - Directness: She answers roughly, mixing specific symptoms with vague references, indicating possible hesitancy or difficulty in providing structured details. - Information volunteering: She tends to bundle symptoms together, rather than systematically providing specific symptom timelines, suggesting limited or unstructured recall. - Consistency: Her responses are moderately inconsistent regarding timing (\"last week,\" \"maybe two weeks ago\"), which may reflect memory issues or emotional distancing.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to specify exact details about symptom onset durations; verbal ambiguity hints she might be avoiding precise disclosures or feels unable to recall. - Minimization behaviors: While she expresses her symptoms as \"really tired\" and \"fevers keep coming back,\" she does not explicitly downplay them; rather, she might be underestimating their severity, demonstrated by vagueness in timing. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes her fatigue and worry, possibly indicating high anxiety and concern, which could amplify her perception of the seriousness, or reflect genuine distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs of shame but some discomfort is evident when she admits she \"doesn't understand\" or appears overwhelmed; she may feel vulnerable. - Confusion/memory issues: Evident in her uncertain timeline (\"maybe last week,\" \"or maybe two weeks ago\"), probably reflecting genuine memory difficulty possibly associated with emotional state or cognitive overload. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence in these responses, but her concern about how serious it might be and her uncertainty can be heightened by family expectations or fears.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology/confusion bias is most prominent, with her uncertain timeline and mixed symptom recall. - Severity level: Moderate, because her responses suggest genuine confusion and emotional distress, but not outright withholding or conscious deception. - Areas most affected: Timeline and symptom sequence, especially regarding onset and progression. - Reliability assessment: Limited reliability in precise timeline details; her overall symptom descriptions are probably accurate but may lack exact timing precision due to emotional overwhelm.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details about symptom onset and progression, possibly minimal or incomplete due to memory confusion and emotional distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: Real severity, especially regarding the progression and the impact of fatigue, may be understated, as she appears to bundle symptoms and avoids precise timelines. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety and worry over severity, especially fears about cancer or serious illness, are likely exaggerated by emotional state rather than factual reality, though genuine concern cannot be dismissed. - True timeline: Actual symptom progression may be more linear and recent; her confusion suggests an emotional filtering and difficulty recalling exact sequence rather than intentional withholding.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague, emotional, and sometimes uncertain language, using phrases like \"kinda jumbling,\" \"maybe last week,\" which reflect emotional distress and possible difficulty in precise recall. - Information flow: Her responses are scattered and somewhat disorganized, often bundling multiple symptoms without clear chronology, indicating limited structured recall; she seems overwhelmed which hampers detailed sharing. - Response style: She provides brief, somewhat narrative-like answers, possibly to minimize her discomfort or due to cognitive overload; responses are more emotional and less systematically detailed, with some hedging.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She hesitates to specify exact timelines for symptom onset and uses uncertainty words, suggesting possible withholding or difficulty in memory retrieval. - Minimization behaviors: There\u2019s no explicit downplaying, but her vague phrasing and bundling of symptoms might serve to minimize the perceived severity or avoid confronting the full reality. - Amplification patterns: The language indicates heightened concern and anxiety, which may amplify her perceived risk, especially through her emphasis on feeling \"really sick\" and her worry about the implications. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Some signs of vulnerability\u2014she looks away and admits confusion\u2014may indicate discomfort in discussing certain details openly. - Confusion/memory issues: Evident in inconsistent and non-specific timelines, reflecting genuine difficulties either from emotional distress or cognitive overload. - Family influence: Not directly observable in these responses but her high anxiety might be influenced by family concerns or fears, leading her to focus on worst-case scenarios.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology/confusion bias dominates, with her uncertain timing and bundled symptom reports. - Severity: Moderate, as her emotional distress and memory confusion affect precise reporting, but her overall symptom acknowledgment appears genuine. - Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy and symptom sequence, with potential under- or overestimation. - Reliability: Moderate; her symptom descriptions are trustworthy in content but less precise regarding timing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timeline details of symptom onset; emotional overwhelm impairs accurate recall. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity of symptom progression and impact may be understated by her vagueness. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries and fears are probably heightened due to emotional distress, possibly exaggerating the perceived danger. - True timeline: Likely more recent and linear than reported; emotional factors cause her to jumble her memory and delay clarity."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: \"just been so tired\" suggests downplaying severity; \"a little\" or \"not sure\" are absent but implied through vague descriptions. - Amplifying language: \"so tired I can barely keep my eyes open,\" \"these fevers are really worrying me,\" \"feel worse than last week,\" indicating heightened concern. - Vague language: \"kind of jumbling together,\" \"maybe last week,\" showing uncertainty and lack of precise recall. - Emotional language: fear evident in \"really worrying me,\" \"I'm just so tired,\" \"I don't know what's wrong,\" and expressions of frustration or confusion.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are short and somewhat scattered, especially when recounting symptom timeline; increases when overwhelmed. - Directness: Answers are generally direct but show uncertainty, particularly about timing (\"maybe last week\" or \"or maybe two weeks ago\"). - Information volunteering: Limited; patient repeats core symptoms but avoids detailed timelines unless prompted, indicating possible reluctance or difficulty recalling. - Consistency: Responses are somewhat inconsistent about when symptoms started, possibly indicating confusion or memory issues.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Patient avoids precise timelines, perhaps hesitating to disclose full duration or severity. - Minimization behaviors: Describing tiredness as \"really tired\" without emphasizing how debilitating; downplaying severity of bleeding or bruising. - Amplification patterns: Expressing fears vividly, e.g., \"really worrying me,\" indicating amplified concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slightly avoids eye contact or looks down when mentioning fears about health, hinting at vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: The inconsistent mention of symptom onset (\"last week\" vs \"two weeks ago\") suggests difficulty with recall, a sign of cognitive load or emotional overwhelm. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but the content may reflect concern about family reactions, possibly leading to guarded disclosures.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Timeline confusion combined with emotional amplification; underestimation of symptom severity paired with heightened worry. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014patient is honest yet emotionally overwhelmed, leading to inconsistent detail sharing and potential underreporting of severity. - Most affected areas: Timeline of symptom onset and intensity, as well as the emotional impact of symptoms. - Reliability: Moderate \u2013 self-report may be affected by emotional distress and memory issues, risking underreporting or misrepresenting symptom severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact onset and progression details; may omit early symptoms or underestimate severity due to confusion or emotional distraction. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of tiredness, bleeding, and fever might be worse than described, given emotional distress and vague reporting. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's fear (\"really worrying me\") might be overestimates due to anxiety, possibly exaggerating perceived risks. - True timeline: Symptoms likely began earlier and progressed more insidiously; patient\u2019s memory or emotional state causes distortions or approximations.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague terms (\"maybe,\" \"kinda\") and emotionally charged phrases (\"really tired,\" \"worried me\"), mixing clinical descriptions with personal concern, which influences clarity. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat scattered, with inconsistent timelines and repetition of core symptoms. She is willing to describe symptoms but struggles with chronological order, indicating a disorganized recall rooted in emotional overload. - Response style: Tends toward elaboration when expressing fears but minimal detail regarding timeline specifics; responses are sometimes tangential, reflecting emotional distress and confusion.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation about precise symptom onset times suggests reluctance or difficulty recalling full details. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions focus on tiredness without emphasizing the severity or impact; bruising and bleeding are described as \"worrying me\" but without stating if they are severe or frequent. - Amplification patterns: Geriatric expressions like \"really worrying me\" indicate heightened emotional concern rather than objective assessment. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance of detailed emotional or health fears, looking away or shifting when discussing serious symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Inconsistent statements about the timing of symptom onset clearly reflect difficulty organizing her experience chronologically. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but emotional responses may be affected by family concerns or reactions, possibly leading to guarded disclosures.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology confusion coupled with emotional amplification; the patient is emotionally overwhelmed, affecting precise reporting and possibly over-entrenching fears. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 emotional distress impacts clarity and detail, risk of both under- and overestimating symptom severity. - Most affected: Timeline accuracy and subjective perception of symptom severity and urgency. - Reliability: Moderate; her responses are emotionally influenced and contain some memory confusions, so clinical interpretation should consider potential report biases.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact onset dates, progression details, and frequency or severity of bleeding and fevers; she may understate or be unable to specify. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her perceived tiredness and bleeding might be worse than reported, given her vague language and emotional distress. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of severe illness or cancer is likely exaggerated by anxiety, which inflates perceived risk. - True timeline: Likely earlier onset with ongoing, gradually worsening symptoms; the patient's confusion probably distorts the actual chronological progression."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will carefully evaluate Emily's responses across language, response patterns, and behavioral indicators.  STEP 1 \u2013 LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: She often uses vague terms such as \"really tired,\" \"kind of scared,\" and \"all over the place,\" which obscure precise details. - Amplifying language: She describes her fatigue as \"really tired\" and acknowledges fearing her symptoms are \"kind of scary,\" indicating emotional exaggeration of concern. - Vague language: Frequent use of \"maybe,\" \"like,\" \"a little,\" and \"sort of\" suggests uncertainty and lack of clarity. - Emotional language: Expressions of being \"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"nervous,\" and \"worried\" show emotional distress, possibly indicating heightened anxiety.  STEP 2 \u2013 RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are moderately brief but include extra details when prompted, indicating some reluctance to fully disclose or confusion. - Directness: She responds with vagueness and hedging, often unsure of exact timelines or severity. - Information volunteering: She tends to provide minimal answers initially, only sharing more detail when explicitly asked, showing possible withholding or discomfort. - Consistency: Her timeline responses (\"last week,\" \"maybe two weeks ago\") are inconsistent, revealing confusion about the sequence of events.  STEP 3 \u2013 BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Signs of withholding: She does not give precise timelines and avoids explicit statements about symptom onset or worsening patterns unless asked. - Minimization behaviors: By describing her fatigue and symptoms as \"really tired\" and \"kind of scared,\" she may underplay severity but still conveys concern; possibly downplaying actual pain or seriousness. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes her exhaustion (\"so exhausted all the time\") and fears (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") indicating worry but may be overestimating emotional impact. - Embarrassment/shame: She shows signs of discomfort when discussing \"bruising\" and \"bleeding gums,\" suggesting she might feel vulnerable or ashamed. - Confusion/memory issues: She struggles to recall exact timelines and sequences, indicating possible cognitive overload or anxiety-related memory issues. - Family influence: She makes no specific reference to family input but mentions \"I don\u2019t know why\" regarding symptoms, possibly implying internal uncertainty rather than external influence.  STEP 4 \u2013 BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be *confusion/memory distortion* regarding symptom chronology, compounded by *minimization* of precise details and *emotional exaggeration*. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 her confusion about timelines and vague descriptions hinder precise assessment; her emotional distress may lead to overinterpretation of symptoms. - Most affected areas: Timeline of symptom development and the severity of physical signs are most biased, with uncertainty about when and how symptoms evolved. - Reliability: Their self-report has moderate reliability; the confusion and emotional state suggest some distortion, but core concerns are valid.  STEP 5 \u2013 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information likely: Exact progression, timelines, and consistency of symptoms, which are crucial for staging and understanding severity. - Symptoms minimized: She may understate or be uncertain about how severe or persistent her symptoms are, potentially missing subtle worsening. - Concerns amplified: Her emotional distress and fear may be exaggerated relative to actual symptom severity, possibly overestimating danger. - True timeline: Likely more gradual or complex symptom progression than she perceives, with confusion around onset and changes.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague, emotionally charged language, with minimal clinical specificity, e.g., \"really tired,\" \"kind of scared,\" which complicates objective assessment. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant initially, providing limited details until prompted, showing possible withholding or discomfort, and her responses are scattered and inconsistent. - Response style: Her replies are modestly elaborated but often tangential, reflecting confusion and emotional distress impacting clarity and organization.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague timing (e.g., \"last week... or maybe two weeks ago\") indicates uncertainty and possible reluctance to commit to details. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying by describing fatigue as \"really tired\" rather than specifying severity or impact; underreporting urgency of symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Emphasizes her exhaustion and fear, possibly over-exaggerating the emotional impact rather than the physical severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Discomfort when discussing bruising and bleeding suggests shame or reluctance to share fully about physical signs. - Confusion/memory issues: Inconsistent timelines and uncertain onset dates show cognitive confusion likely due to anxiety and overload. - Family influence: Limited evidence; primary issue is internal uncertainty rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: *Confusion/memory distortion* with secondary *minimization* of symptom details and *emotional exaggeration*. - Severity: Moderate, as her unclear timelines and vague descriptions hinder precise clinical interpretation, but her primary concerns are genuine. - Most affected: Timeline accuracy and severity of physical symptoms are biased, reducing reliability of self-reporting. - Reliability: Moderate; while her concerns are valid, the confusion and emotional state necessitate corroboration through clinical observation and possibly collateral info.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information likely: Precise timing and progression of symptoms, which are necessary for accurate diagnosis and staging. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual intensity of fatigue, bleeding, or symptom worsening, possibly underreported due to confusion or shame. - Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress and fear could magnify perceived severity beyond actual physical findings. - True timeline: Likely a more gradual, overlapping development of symptoms with some recall bias and confusion, highlighting the need for detailed, systematic inquiry."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I start by examining Emily's language. She employs vague and uncertain phrases such as \"last week... or maybe two weeks ago,\" indicating difficulty recalling exact timelines, which is a sign of confusion or memory issues. She also uses vague terms like \"super tired,\" \"really high fevers,\" and \"making me kind of scared,\" suggesting emotional distress and possible exaggeration or amplification of symptoms. Her responses are brief and somewhat scattered, indicating possible anxiety or overwhelm, and she tends to provide information only when prompted without volunteering much detail, which could suggest withholding or reluctance. She shows signs of confusion about the timeline and the severity of her symptoms, struggling to recall whether certain symptoms worsened or started at specific times.  Behavioral indicators include hesitation, inconsistency in describing symptom onset, and uncertainty about details. The repeated uncertainty (\"maybe two weeks ago,\" \"I don\u2019t really know\") hints at possible cognitive overload or concealment of specific concerns. She also displays signs of emotional distress\u2014looking down, nervous touches, fidgeting\u2014that signal anxiety or shame about her symptoms.  Assessing bias severity, the main bias appears to be **confusion/memory issues**, compounded by emotional distress and possible minimization of symptoms. The severity might be moderate, because her responses suggest not just forgetfulness but also potential emotional shielding or difficulty articulating her experiences fully. The most biased areas are her timeline recall and perceived severity, which directly affect the accuracy of her self-report.  Clinically, this means her self-reporting likely understates or muddles the true progression of symptoms, and she may be hiding or minimizing the severity of certain signs, such as bruising or bleeding. She might also overemphasize or amplify her worry about worse outcomes, driven by anxiety. The true timeline might be earlier or more severe than she indicates, and some symptoms\u2014especially subtle ones like bruising or bleeding\u2014are probably worse than described. Her emotional distress could inflate concerns about prognosis, potentially skewing her perception and responses.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emily's language is vague and emotionally charged, with phrases like \"last week... or maybe two weeks ago\" and \"super tired,\" which imply difficulty in precise recall and a high level of distress. She combines specific symptoms with uncertain timelines, signaling confusion and emotional overwhelm. - Information flow: She tends to respond only when prompted, with scattered, sometimes inconsistent details, indicating reluctance or difficulty organizing her thoughts. She avoids volunteering extensive information, possibly due to anxiety or uncertainty. - Response style: Her responses are brief and somewhat tangential, often lacking specific details about symptom onset or progression, reflecting confusion or emotional distress affecting clarity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her scattered responses and uncertainty about timelines suggest she might be holding back or unsure about what details are relevant or important. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the severity of her symptoms using vague descriptions like \"a little bruises\" or \"not sure if it\u2019s worse,\" which could underestimate the true gravity. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of fear (\"making me kind of scared\") and emotional descriptors suggest she might be exaggerating her worry, though this could also reflect genuine anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitance and looking down when discussing symptoms may indicate discomfort or shame around bleeding or bruising. - Confusion/memory issues: Repeated uncertainty about symptom onset and progression confirms cognitive confusion, affecting accurate medical history reporting. - Family influence: There is no explicit evidence in the responses about family affecting her answers, but her emotional distress might be compounded by family concerns, although that is not directly observed here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is **confusion/memory impairment**, compounded by emotional distress, leading to inconsistent or vague reporting. - Severity: Moderate, as her inability to accurately recall timelines impacts the reliability of her history but does not completely obscure key symptoms. - Areas most affected: Timeline of symptom onset and progression (most biased), severity perception of symptoms. - Reliability: Her self-report should be interpreted with caution; corroboration with objective findings and caregiver input is essential due to potential memory confusion and emotional influence.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise onset and progression details of symptoms like bruising, swelling, or bleeding episodes may be underestimated or inaccurately recalled. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of symptoms such as bleeding or fatigue is likely worse than she reports, due to emotional distress and possible minimization. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety may cause her to overstate fears about prognosis or severity, influencing her perception. - True timeline: Likely earlier or more gradual progression than she indicates, with more persistent or severe symptoms she is unable to clearly articulate because of confusion or emotional overwhelm."
