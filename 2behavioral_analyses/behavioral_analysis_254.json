    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully analyze the patient's language and response patterns to identify potential biases or communication nuances.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"It hurts quite a bit,\" which could be somewhat subjective but does not seem minimized; no overt minimization terms like \"not that bad\" are used. - Amplifying language: \"Really full and tender,\" \"swollen and warm,\" \"hurts quite a bit,\" \"worried it might be something serious\" \u2014 these indicate genuine concern and discomfort but not exaggeration beyond typical alarm. - Vague language: The description is fairly specific, but phrases like \"a couple of days\" lack precise timing; though common, this could be slightly imprecise. - Emotional language: The worry about \"something serious\" and \"worried\" suggest underlying anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The statement is concise but informative, providing relevant details without excessive elaboration. - Directness: Answers are direct and focused on symptoms and timeline, consistent across statements. - Information volunteering: The patient shares details proactively about symptom onset and severity. - Consistency: The timeline (\"about two days after...\") aligns with the described symptoms; responses are consistent.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No evident signs; patient appears forthcoming. - Minimization behaviors: No specific signs of downplaying; however, slight vagueness in timing could suggest cautious elaboration. - Amplification patterns: No exaggeration; descriptions seem proportionate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No hesitations or evasive answers; appears comfortable discussing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; timeline and details are consistent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely minimal bias; the patient seems honest and straightforward, but some mild anxiety might influence concern levels. - Severity: Mild bias, as the communication appears genuine with no overt signs of withholding or distortion. - Areas most affected: The concern about \"something serious\" shows some anxiety-driven focus, which could amplify perceived severity but is understandable. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy; responses align coherently, though heightened worry might lead to slight overestimation of severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may be underreporting physical examination findings like temperature or swelling severity; no mention of other symptoms such as fever. - Symptoms probably minimized: No overt minimization is evident, but subtle underplaying of the duration or intensity is possible. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about \"something serious\" might lead to overemphasis on severity, possibly skewing clinical judgment. - True timeline: The progression seems plausible; two days after increased breastfeeding aligns with typical engorgement timing.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific and descriptive terms (\"full,\" \"tender,\" \"warm\"), showing openness but also some mild vagueness regarding timing (\"about two days\"), indicating cautious elaboration. - Information flow: They are forthcoming with symptoms, providing organized details about onset and impact, which suggests a cooperative style. - Response style: Responses are direct, slightly elaborated, and focused on relevant symptoms, with no signs of evasiveness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear reluctance; the patient appears willing to share pertinent details. - Minimization behaviors: The description is straightforward; no evident downplaying of symptoms occurs. - Amplification patterns: No overstatement observed; reported pain and concern match typical presentation. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None; comfortable discussing symptoms openly. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; timeline and symptom details are consistent. - Family influence: No evident external influence or societal pressure affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild anxiety influence, possibly leading to heightened concern about the severity of symptoms. - Severity: Mild, as the patient is honest and provides coherent information with no exaggerated or withheld data. - Areas most affected: Their concern about severity and rapid onset; emotional worry may slightly influence their description. - Reliability: Quite reliable overall, though some anxiety might slightly distort perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific objective findings such as temperature readings or signs of infection are not provided; physical exam nuances could be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: None apparent; the patient does not seem to downplay symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about serious infection might lead to overestimating the threat, though not overtly exaggerated. - True timeline: Plausible; back-to-back breastfeeding increase and onset match typical engorgement patterns, supporting accurate reporting.  Overall, the patient's communication appears credible and honest, with mild anxiety potentially enhancing concern levels but not significantly distorting the clinical picture."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses and behavior patterns step by step. Starting with language analysis, Mark's descriptions are specific (\"really full and tender,\" \"swollen and warm,\" \"painful like 7 or 8 out of 10\") suggesting he is providing detailed symptom descriptions, which indicates openness. There\u2019s some emotional language conveying concern (\"worried,\" \"can't stand the pain anymore\") that aligns with his anxious but honest personality trait.  In response pattern analysis, he volunteers his main symptoms immediately and provides consistent detail about their onset and severity. He answers questions directly without deflection, and repeats key concerns (\u201cworried it might be something serious\u201d), signaling genuine concern rather than minimization or exaggeration. His responses are organized, emphasizing the timeline and pain level, which shows he is engaged and likely truthful.  Looking at behavioral indicators, there\u2019s no clear evidence of withholding information; he discusses his symptoms openly. The description of symptoms does not seem minimized\u2014he mentions they are painful and uncomfortable. His reference to his worry about serious infection could be slightly amplified due to anxiety, but given his straightforward nature, this seems consistent with typical health anxiety in a new father.  In bias severity assessment, the main bias appears minimal\u2014the patient seems honest and forthcoming, with perhaps a slight tendency to amplify concern due to anxiety. Severity is mild, given his clear communication and lack of evasiveness. The most biased area is his worry about seriousness, which is expected but doesn't distort his overall report.  Clinically, this suggests his self-report is fairly reliable, but his anxiety may lead him to overestimate risks. His detailed descriptions support accurate assessment, though his concern about serious infection might be somewhat exaggerated, influenced by emotional distress.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Specific and emotionally tinged (\"really full and tender,\" \"swollen and warm,\" \"painful like 7 or 8 out of 10\"), indicating openness but also concern. No signs of minimization or vagueness. - Information flow: Promptly and fully volunteered, organized around key symptom features. He provides consistent details across responses, showing transparency. - Response style: Straightforward and elaborative, emphasizing severity and timing. Slight self-initiated worry indicates anxiety-driven amplification but not deception.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None observed; he answers questions openly and provides sufficient detail. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; he describes symptoms as painful and persistent. - amplification patterns: Some mild concern amplification, especially regarding infection risk, due to his anxious personality. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal; he appears comfortable describing symptoms, though some discomfort with discussing his chest is implied. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident timeline or factual inconsistencies. - Family influence: Not explicitly indicated; responses seem internally motivated without external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight concern amplification related to health anxiety, typical in new parents worried about their role and health. - Severity: Mild, because his details are consistent, and he\u2019s transparent, but some worry could lead to overestimating risk. - Areas most affected: Concerns about seriousness/infection, likely overemphasized due to anxiety. - Reliability: Generally reliable; his detailed, consistent responses support accurate self-reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He might be underestimating the normality of some discomfort and overemphasizing potential infections or complications, adding unnecessary worry. - Symptoms probably minimized: None clearly indicated, but he might not be fully acknowledging that some degree of engorgement is typical. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about infection or serious illness appear heightened, which may be influenced by his anxiety. - True timeline: Consistent with his report; symptoms began 2 days post onset of increased breastfeeding, aligning with typical engorgement timing.  Overall, Mark communicates effectively, with minor concern amplification typical for an anxious individual, but no significant signs of withholding or denial are evident."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes symptoms with moderate detail; does not explicitly minimize but uses words like \"kind of\" (\"they\u2019re kind of swollen and warm to the touch\"), indicating some vagueness. Also, phrases like \"it\u2019s hard to keep up\" suggest some downplaying of emotional impact. - Amplifying language: The patient states, \"it's pretty painful\u2014like a 7 or 8 out of 10,\" which is relatively specific, but the expression \"pretty anxious\" and \"overwhelmed\" could signify moderate emotional amplification. - Vague language: Use of \"kind of swollen\" and \"a little guilty\" suggests some hedging; not fully clinical but slightly hesitant. - Emotional language: Words like \"pretty anxious,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"kinda guilty\" show emotional distress, possibly to evoke empathy or indicate discomfort with emotional disclosure.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are fairly brief, particularly for emotional topics, perhaps indicating discomfort. - Directness: Answers directly to questions about symptoms but show some reluctance to elaborate on emotional impact. - Information volunteering: Re that section, the patient volunteers some emotional state, but doesn\u2019t elaborate extensively about feelings or daily impact. - Consistency: Consistent in describing symptoms and their progression; no contradictions observed.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance or hedging about emotional impact (\"kinda overwhelmed,\" \"feels kinda embarrassing\"), suggesting some withholding. - Minimization behaviors: The patient states \"it\u2019s making me pretty anxious,\" which might be an understatement of anxiety intensity; overall, symptoms seem more distressing than conveyed. - Amplification patterns: Concerns about seriousness (\"worried it could be something serious\") are genuine but may be exaggerated relative to typical breast engorgement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Humility or embarrassment displayed through self-description (\"kind of embarrassed talking about this\") and using vague language about feelings. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; timeline seems consistent. - Family influence: The mention of feeling guilty about discomfort hints at internal conflict but no external family biases.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight emotional amplification and possible mild minimization\u2014patient appears to understate emotional distress but overstates concern about seriousness. - Severity: Moderate\u2014there's some emotional hedging, which could lead to under- or over-estimating the true extent of distress. - Areas most affected: Emotional impact and severity of psychological distress, potentially underreported. - Reliability: Fairly reliable on physical symptoms; emotional reporting may be somewhat biased downward, possibly masking internal anxiety intensity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper emotional distress, internal feelings of vulnerability or guilt, or coping difficulties may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The perceived threat of seriousness may be overemphasized due to anxiety, though physical symptoms appear genuine. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about severity and harm to the baby could be exaggerated relative to actual risk. - True timeline: The physical progression seems consistent with typical engorgement, but emotional responses suggest possible underreporting of internal distress.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs mostly specific language about physical symptoms but uses vague and hedging language (\"kind of,\" \"pretty\") when describing emotional impact, suggesting discomfort with emotional expression. - Information flow: Tends to answer straightforwardly about symptoms but with some reluctance to fully elaborate on emotional state; responses are organized but occasionally hedging. - Response style: Responses are concise, with some elaboration on physical symptoms but limited detail on emotional or psychological impact.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hedging about emotional suffering (\"kinda overwhelmed,\" \"kinda guilty\") suggests potential undercommunication of internal distress. - Minimization behaviors: The patient downplays emotional impact, possibly to appear more stoic or to avoid shame, e.g., \"kind of embarrassed talking about this.\" - Amplification patterns: Concerns about seriousness (\"worried it could be something serious\") are genuine but could be amplified due to anxiety, especially since these symptoms are typical of benign engorgement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Evident through self-deprecating expressions and hedging about emotional feelings, indicating discomfort discussing emotional aspects. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant issues; timeline appears accurate. - Family influence: Slight internal guilt reflects personal feelings rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate emotional amplification coupled with a mild minimization of internal distress. - Severity: Moderate\u2014must consider that emotional expressions may be underreported, potentially masking distress levels. - Areas most affected: Emotional and psychological states; physical symptoms are likely accurately described. - Reliability: Physical symptom reporting is fairly reliable; emotional and psychological reporting should be interpreted cautiously, as internal distress might be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deep-seated anxiety or guilt about caregiving responsibilities may be underreported; emotional distress could be more severe than expressed. - Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional impact and internal suffering may be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about serious health consequences might be heightened due to fear but could detract from objective assessment. - True timeline: Physical symptoms align with typical course of engorgement; emotional responses are consistent with moderate distress, but internal feelings might be more intense than conveyed."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient reports feeling \"kind of overwhelmed\" and \"a little guilty,\" which suggests some degree of downplaying his emotional distress. - Amplifying language: He describes his pain as \"pretty anxious\" and says it makes him \"pretty anxious,\" possibly emphasizing distress but not exaggerating severity. - Vague language: The use of \"kind of\" and \"sort of\" indicates some hedging or uncertainty about his feelings, which may obscure the full extent of emotional struggles. - Emotional language: He admits to feeling \"overwhelmed\" and \"guilty,\" showing genuine emotional discomfort, but the phrasing suggests some degree of shame or reluctance to fully disclose distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: His responses are relatively brief but contain some elaboration (\"I worry maybe I\u2019m not doing enough or I\u2019m messing something up\"), possibly indicating discomfort in discussing emotional vulnerabilities. - Directness: He answers the direct question about emotional impact honestly but modestly, without overelaborating. - Information volunteering: He shares some internal feelings openly, suggesting a willingness to communicate his emotional state, but may hold back full extent of distress. - Consistency: His responses are consistent with his personality traits\u2014honest, straightforward, slightly anxious\u2014and don't show contradictions.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient might be concealing deeper feelings of guilt or inadequacy due to social stigma or personal embarrassment, inferred from cautious language (\"kind of overwhelmed,\" \"I worry maybe\"). - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying emotional impact, by saying \"I guess I do feel kind of overwhelmed sometimes,\" instead of more intense language, suggests some minimization of his emotional state. - Amplification patterns: Less evident; he does not exaggerate concerns but expresses genuine anxiety about his health and caregiving stress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance in discussing emotional struggles openly; possible shame about feeling overwhelmed as a new father. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; timeline and sequence appear consistent. - Family influence: No explicit evidence that his responses are heavily influenced by others, but his mentions of \"overwhelmed with the baby\" indicate caregiving stress.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional minimization coupled with potential underreporting of psychological distress. - Severity level: Moderate; the patient appears somewhat guarded about his emotional state, potentially underestimating how overwhelmed he feels. - Areas most affected: Emotional impact of caregiving and guilt; physical symptoms are described in detail, but emotional responses are somewhat understated. - Reliability assessment: Likely moderately reliable for physical symptoms but somewhat cautious about emotional disclosures; underreporting emotional distress is probable.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may be experiencing more intense feelings of anxiety, guilt, or\u75b2\u60eb than he admits, which could affect his overall well-being but isn't fully disclosed. - Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional difficulties, such as significant stress or fatigue, might be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: His physical discomfort regarding breast engorgement seems genuine, but his emotional stress may be more severe than expressed. - True timeline: The physical symptoms align with typical early postpartum engorgement, but emotional response may have developed gradually and is understated in his responses.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses somewhat cautious and hedging phrases (\"kind of overwhelmed,\" \"a little guilty\"), indicating some emotional restraint. His language remains straightforward but slightly guarded when discussing feelings. - Information flow: He volunteers emotional information when directly asked about emotional impact but tends to downplay feelings, suggesting controlled disclosure. Physical symptoms are detailed and organized. - Response style: Responses are concise with some elaboration on emotional states; he demonstrates honesty but with subtle self-protective language, indicative of discomfort discussing vulnerabilities.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of uncertain qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") when describing emotional distress hints at reluctance to fully disclose the depth of his feelings. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying emotional impact (\"kind of overwhelmed,\" \"I guess\") suggests he may not be fully acknowledging how overwhelmed or anxious he truly feels. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; concerns about physical symptoms appear genuine, but emotional concerns are likely understated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and cautious language in expressing emotional vulnerability point to possible shame or discomfort discussing his internal struggles. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident issues; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Not directly indicated, but his caregiving stress and guilt may be internally influenced by societal expectations of new fathers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate emotional minimization bias, with some underreporting of psychological distress due to social or personal discomfort. - Severity: Moderate, as the patient underplays emotional reactions, which could mask underlying stress. - Areas most affected: Emotional well-being related to fatherhood and stress levels; physical symptoms are accurately described. - Reliability: Moderately reliable for physical symptoms; emotional disclosures are somewhat subdued, so full extent of distress may be underrepresented.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true level of emotional distress, anxiety, or fatigue may be greater than reported, potentially affecting his mental health and coping capacity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional consequences of new parenthood and stress might be understated, leading to underestimating psychological needs. - Concerns probably amplified: Physical symptoms seem concretely expressed; emotional concerns are less so, which might cause underrecognition. - True timeline: Physical symptoms align with typical postpartum engorgement onset; emotional state likely developed concurrently but is underdisclosed, obscuring full understanding of his psychological adaptation."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses expressions like \"kinda embarrassed,\" \"a little,\" \"kind of,\" and \"not that bad,\" which suggest minimization of emotional experiences. Phrases such as \"I worry maybe I\u2019m not doing enough,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know how to handle it all\" indicate some uncertainty and potential reluctance to fully disclose subjective distress. The mention of feeling \"guilty,\" \"stressed,\" and \"anxious\" reflect genuine emotional concerns, but the language also hints at possible underreporting of the severity.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: The responses are somewhat elaborative, offering insight into emotional states, but tend to be cautious and guarded with phrases like \"I guess\" and \"I don\u2019t really talk about it much.\" When asked about feelings, the patient shares emotional difficulties more openly, but with a level of vagueness. The responses seem organized but show hesitation, indicating possible reluctance to fully express or explore deeper feelings.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of information withholding include the use of qualifying language that softens emotional disclosures (\"kinda embarrassed,\" \"I guess\"). Evidence of minimization appears in the downplaying of emotional impact (\"it\u2019s just a lot to deal with,\" \"I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal\"). Amplification of concerns is modest\u2014he admits to worries but does not exaggerate fears extensively. Indicators of embarrassment emerge in his acknowledgment of feelings he might consider personal or shameful, such as guilt or overwhelmed feelings. No clear signs of confusion or interference from other influences are evident.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary bias type: The dominant pattern is a tendency toward minimization and modest self-reporting of emotional distress. The patient seems to understate the severity of his emotional response and possibly underreports the extent of his anxiety or guilt. Severity level: Moderate\u2014he is open about feelings but modulates the intensity, suggesting some underreporting, which could lead to incomplete understanding of his emotional state. Most affected areas: Emotional distress and internal coping difficulties are most biased, with possible underestimation of how overwhelmed or anxious he truly feels, which could impact support strategies. Reliability: Moderate\u2014his factual reporting about physical symptoms is consistent, but emotional disclosures might be understated, requiring careful follow-up.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Information likely missing: He may be experiencing more intense emotional difficulties, guilt, or anxiety than freely admits, but he's reluctant to explicitly state this (\"I don\u2019t really talk about it much,\" \"I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m not coping\"). Symptoms probably minimized: His reports of feeling \"kinda stressed and guilty\" might underrepresent the depth of his emotional struggle, potentially concealing significant distress. Concerns probably amplified: He overstates physical discomfort relative to emotional difficulty, suggesting a focus on somatic symptoms which he perceives as urgent, possibly minimizing emotional needs. True timeline: The physical symptoms are clearly tied to recent postpartum period, but emotional responses might have been more intense or prolonged than recognized due to hesitations in disclosure.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses qualifying and mild language (\"kinda,\" \"a little,\" \"not that bad\") when discussing emotional feelings, indicating a tendency toward minimization and reluctance to fully express severity. His descriptions of emotions are somewhat vague and hedged, possibly aiming to appear more composed. Conversely, physical symptoms are described more straightforwardly and specifically, demonstrating comfort sharing tangible issues. - Information flow: The patient provides emotionally relevant information when prompted but tends to withhold or moderate disclosures unless directly asked, revealing some guardedness about emotional topics. Physical symptoms are reported promptly and with detail, showing openness in that area. - Response style: Responses are organized and elaborative but include hedging language that suggests either discomfort or uncertainty about his emotional state. His responses are more straightforward regarding symptoms but cautious about emotional realities.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The frequent use of qualifiers (\"kinda,\" \"I guess\") and reluctance to elaborate fully point to self-censorship regarding emotional distress. His admission of not talking about feelings much indicates a possible reluctance to disclose the full extent of his emotional impact. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying feelings of guilt and stress, describing emotional struggles with \"it\u2019s just a lot to deal with,\" suggests he might be underrating the severity of his emotional state. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggerated concerns related to emotional or physical symptoms; most worries are presented as moderate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation around discussing emotional feelings and the use of mitigated language suggest feelings of shame or discomfort in fully acknowledging emotional vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant signs. - Family influence: The responses hint that he might be influenced socially or culturally to downplay his emotional struggles; he states he \"doesn\u2019t really talk about it much,\" implying possible internal pressures or norms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Underreporting and minimization of emotional distress, possibly influenced by social desirability or personal discomfort. - Severity: Moderate\u2014he articulates some emotional difficulties but consistently softens or hedges his disclosures, likely leading to underestimation of his true distress. - Most biased areas: Emotional reaction to postpartum stress, guilt, and anxiety are least openly communicated, which could mask severity. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014physical symptoms are trustworthy, but emotional self-reporting should be interpreted cautiously, considering potential under disclosure.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: His genuine level of emotional distress, guilt, and anxiety, which are underplayed by subtle language cues and reluctance to elaborate. - Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional factors such as intense feelings of overwhelm or depression may be more significant than reported, since he's nervous or ashamed to fully disclose them. - Concerns probably amplified: He appears to focus and possibly overexpress physical discomfort as a way of seeking urgent relief, possibly diverting from emotional needs. - True timeline: Emotional distress may have begun earlier or been more persistent than he admits, but his guarded responses obscure this reality. Physical symptoms align well with postpartum engorgement timeline, but emotional responses are likely more profound than expressed."
