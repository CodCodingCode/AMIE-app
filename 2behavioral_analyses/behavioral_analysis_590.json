    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Examining James\u2019s words, he states: \"I just can't seem to drink enough water,\" which suggests a perception of excessive thirst but presented without hyperbole. He describes feeling \"more tired than usual,\" which is somewhat mild language, indicating awareness but possibly downplaying fatigue. His mention of blurry vision \"sometimes\" and \"especially when I look at my phone or TV\" reflects specific but inconsistent symptom descriptions. The tingling in the hands and feet is described as \"kind of numb or tingly,\" a somewhat vague but tangible description. Overall, his language is straightforward, using simple and honest descriptors without exaggerated adjectives, but in some cases, he uses terms like \"really thirsty\" to emphasize discomfort.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: He provides a detailed, chronological account, volunteering the initial symptoms (\"feeling more tired,\" \"started about two weeks ago\") and elaborates with specific examples (nocturnal urination, blurry vision, tingling). He responds directly to questions and seems willing to disclose information without evident deflections. His responses are organized and consistent, indicating clear mental engagement. However, some responses, like \"I really worry about what\u2019s going on,\" show emotional concern but are not overly emotional or anxious, indicating openness though mild worry.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of transparency: voluntary sharing of the timeline and family medical history suggest honesty. No clear evidence of withholding information or shame signals. Slight nervousness in describing symptoms (\"kind of numb or tingly,\" \"really worried\") indicates some anxiety. The detailed symptom chronology indicates good memory recall. No signs of minimizing or over-exaggerating symptoms are evident; his descriptions appear balanced.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The main communication pattern here appears to be genuine, consistent reporting without significant bias. There\u2019s no evidence of minimization, amplification, or withholding. Communication seems moderately accurate; his straightforwardness suggests reliability. The only concern might be mild anxiety influencing his perceived symptom severity, but this does not distort the actual report significantly.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Likely, he is accurately reporting most symptoms, though anxiety might slightly amplify perceived severity. No substantial information appears to be intentionally withheld. Symptoms such as fatigue and thirst are probably accurately described, but his expression of worry suggests he might be more anxious about the seriousness of the condition than about the actual symptoms. The timeline seems consistent, with no apparent gaps.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Use of simple, direct language with occasional emphasis (\"really thirsty,\" \"super tired\") reflects genuine concern but not exaggerated distress. Descriptions are specific when describing visual changes (\"blurry vision\") but somewhat vague with tingling (\"kind of numb\")\u2014appropriate for a teenager. - Information flow: Open and forthcoming; James volunteers detailed chronological information without prompting, indicating trust and comfort in communicating. - Response style: Elaboration on symptoms and timeline shows engagement; responses are organized and consistent, indicating clarity in thought.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None observed; James provides comprehensive details without hesitation. - Minimization behaviors: No evidence; he describes symptoms with appropriate concern rather than downplaying. - Amplification patterns: No clear signs; descriptions seem balanced and accurate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; he openly discusses symptoms, including sensitive topics like numbness. - Confusion/memory issues: None apparent; timeline and symptom details are coherent. - Family influence: He mentions family history openly, suggesting that family influences are acknowledged but not leading to withholding or bias.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely minimal bias; his responses appear honest and straightforward. - Severity: Mild; slight anxiety may influence perception but not distort reporting. - Areas most affected: Possibly the emotional impact or concern about seriousness, but overall, responses are credible. - Reliability: High; his transparency and consistency support trusting his self-report.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possibly, James might not fully communicate the extent of his worry or the impact on daily activities beyond what he states. - Symptoms probably minimized: No signs he\u2019s downplaying; descriptions are detailed and proportionate. - Concerns probably amplified: His expressed worry indicates some anxiety about severity, which could exaggerate perceived threat. - True timeline: Likely accurate; no conflicting details or indications of memory lapses suggest truthful chronological reporting."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me start by analyzing the language James uses. He describes his symptoms with straightforward, specific terms: \"vision kinda gets all blurry,\" \"hands and feet feel kinda numb or tingly,\" indicating he is providing concrete descriptions rather than vague or minimizing language. His use of \"kinda\" and \"like\" suggests some casual or less precise speech, but overall, the language reflects honest reporting.  In responses to questions about symptoms, James responds directly and volunteers key info\u2014such as the chronicity (\"about two weeks ago,\" \"started about two weeks ago\") and specifics of symptoms\u2014without obvious evasion. He also repeats symptoms in a consistent way, implying reliability, though he may be somewhat nervous, leading to slight hesitation or truncation.  Behaviorally, there are subtle signs of anxiety and some discomfort\u2014fidgeting, glancing at his hands when discussing tingling, possibly rubbing his eyes or stretching as signs of fatigue or nervousness. He maintains eye contact but sometimes looks away or down, indicating modest nervousness or concern. His tone and posture suggest he might be slightly worried but not overtly distressed, which fits his personality traits of being conscientious yet anxious about health.  There\u2019s minimal evidence of significant withholding\u2014he appears forthcoming about symptoms. No signs of minimization, as he describes symptoms as \"kind of unsettling\" rather than dismissing them. He doesn\u2019t seem to amplify concerns excessively; his worry about \"what\u2019s going on\" sounds genuine and proportional to his symptoms.  In terms of biases, he seems to communicate fairly transparently, though his anxiety might cause slight amplification of his discomfort level or concern. His responses appear carefully measured and honest, with no clear indication of deliberate withholding or minimization.  This suggests that his self-reporting is relatively reliable, though some anxious embellishment of worry might slightly skew perception of severity. The main bias might be a mild anxiety amplification, although this does not significantly distort his symptoms.  Clinically, I deduce he is probably underreporting some degree of severity, especially regarding the urgency of his symptoms, but overall, he is a credible narrator.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: James uses specific and concrete descriptions (\"kinda gets all blurry,\" \"pins and needles\") rather than vague or overly emotional language. His speech is honest but shows slight casualness and nervousness, with frequent use of filler words like \"kind of\" and \"like.\" - Information flow: He responds directly to questions and volunteers core symptoms independently, indicating an open communication style. His responses are organized and consistent, reflecting reliability. - Response style: His answers are elaborative but not excessive, balancing honesty with nervous uncertainty. He tends to clarify or repeat symptoms, demonstrating engagement but displaying signs of anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant evidence; he appears willing to disclose symptoms clearly. - Minimization behaviors: No, he doesn\u2019t downplay symptoms; he describes them as \"kinda unsettling\" which aligns with his genuine concern. - Amplification patterns: Slight potential for anxiety-driven concern. He emphasizes how \"weird\" and \"unsettling\" symptoms are, possibly amplifying his subjective discomfort, though this isn't overt exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None apparent; he shares symptoms openly without evident discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight hesitation with language (\"kinda,\" \"like\"), typical of nervousness rather than memory lapses. - Family influence: His responses seem independently driven, but he does mention family and their autoimmune history, which might heighten his concern but does not alter his communication pattern significantly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild anxiety amplification bias, possibly leading to slight overestimation of symptom severity or concern. - Severity: Moderate; anxiety may cause him to perceive symptoms as more alarming, but overall, his honesty and organization point to a trustworthy account. - Areas most affected: His perception of symptom severity and concern about seriousness may be slightly inflated, especially regarding how unsettling or \"weird\" symptoms feel. - Reliability: Fairly high; his detailed descriptions and response consistency suggest he provides an accurate self-report with some minor anxiety-related overemphasis.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: His emotional distress might obscure some context, such as underreporting subtle symptoms or concerns about diagnosis implications. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not obvious, but he may understate severity or urgency due to nervousness or fear, possibly making symptoms seem less pressing than they are. - Concerns probably amplified: His focus on how \"unsettling\" and \"weird\" symptoms feel can amplify perceived severity, perhaps overestimating danger. - True timeline: The reported timeline of symptoms starting two weeks ago and gradually worsening appears consistent and credible; no indication of inaccuracies.  In summary, James is an honest, straightforward reporter of his symptoms with slight anxiety-driven concerns that may modestly amplify his perception of severity. His communication style is organized, and response patterns suggest reliability, but clinicians should remain aware of potential anxiety influences when interpreting his concerns."

    "analysis": "THINKING: I will analyze the patient's language and response patterns carefully to identify subtle signs of bias or withholding. First, I observe that James uses straightforward, simple descriptions like \"blurry,\" \"tingly,\" and \"going to the bathroom all the time,\" which suggests openness but also a tendency to use vague descriptors that may conceal nuances. He says the symptoms started about two weeks ago, which seems consistent, but he emphasizes feeling \"really worried\" and describes symptoms as \"kind of unsettling,\" indicating some emotional distress. His responses are brief, likely due to being a teen and possibly anxious. He volunteers details about how the vision changes happen with looking at screens but does not mention any other symptoms, which could mean he's withholding or hasn't noticed some. Overall, he appears cooperative but somewhat guarded with specifics, perhaps minimizing severity or overemphasizing concern.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: Phrases like \"kind of blurry\" and \"kind of unsettling\" suggest non-specificity, possibly underplaying severity. - Amplifying language: \"Really worried\" and \"kind of freaks me out\" indicate emotional concern but not excessive panic. - Vague language: Use of \"kind of\" and \"a little\" shows some uncertainty or attempt to soften descriptions. - Emotional language: Expressions of being \"worried,\" \"freaked out,\" and \"unsettling\" suggest internal concern paired with anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are concise, consistent across questions, possibly indicating discomfort with detailed sharing. - Directness: He answers straightforwardly but tends to be brief, possibly deflecting by not expanding on symptoms. - Information volunteering: He shares key symptoms but with vague modifiers; he waits for questions to elaborate. - Consistency: Responses are consistent, but his emphasis on worry indicates emotional bias.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No overt signs, but brief responses and vagueness suggest possible withholding of detailed emotional or contextual info. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"kind of blurry\" and \"kind of unsettling\" may understate the true impact. - Amplification patterns: His concern about the symptoms (\"really worried,\" \"freaks me out\") might amplify perceived severity emotionally. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs, but he appears slightly anxious, avoiding elaborate details. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of timeline or factual inconsistencies. - Family influence: No direct signs, but he mentions his mother made him come, indicating some external influence on decision to seek care.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight tendency toward emotional amplification driven by worry, with some vagueness possibly masking true symptom severity. - Severity level: Moderate, as he expresses genuine concern and some anxiety, yet limits detail, which may obscure full symptom scope. - Areas most affected: Emotional expression and symptom description clarity are most biased, influencing perceived urgency. - Reliability assessment: Largely reliable overall but may underestimate some symptoms' severity due to cautious language.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detail about specific visual changes, frequency, and impact on daily activities; possibly underreporting severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might be downplaying how profound his blurry vision or tingling could be\u2014minimal explanations could hide more severe underlying issues. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry may be exaggerated by anxiety, influencing his reporting style. - True timeline: Slight uncertainty or cautious reporting; the timeline seems accurate but may be optimistic about the progression or impact.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague descriptors (\"kind of blurry,\" \"kind of unsettling,\" \"a little dizzy\") and emotional phrases (\"really worried,\" \"freaks me out\"), indicating a tendency toward emotional amplification with some minimization through vagueness. - Information flow: He tends to provide brief responses, sharing key symptoms but withholding detailed contextual or emotional information until prompted; responses are organized but sparse. - Response style: Responses are direct but somewhat limited; refrains from elaborating on symptoms unless specifically asked, which suggests guardedness or discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and vagueness of descriptions\u2014avoiding detailed explanations of vision or neurological symptoms\u2014could indicate an inclination to hide full extent of symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Use of non-specific phrases (\"kind of\") and downplaying the severity of symptoms imply possible minimization of how debilitating or serious his condition might be. - Amplification patterns: Expressions of worry (\"really worried,\" \"freaks me out\") indicate emotional distress, which may lead to over-worrying or exaggerating the importance of some symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but nervousness and briefness may reflect discomfort with sharing personal health details. - Confusion/memory issues: No clues of inconsistent or confusing timelines. - Family influence: External influence evident; his mother made him seek care, possibly affecting how he perceives or reports symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification driven by anxiety and concern, coupled with potential minimization through vague language. - Severity: Moderate, as his emotional distress influences reporting, but there is overall consistency; avoidance of detailed description limits full assessment. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and impact\u2014he may understate physical or neurological symptoms while overemphasizing worry. - Reliability: Their self-report is generally trustworthy for basic symptoms, but caution is needed; emotional bias may skew perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed descriptions of visual disturbances, neurological symptoms, and daily impact; possible underreporting of symptom severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of vision or neurological effects may be greater, as vague descriptors suggest they might be worse than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Patient\u2019s worry may lead to overestimating the urgency, but his anxiety also signals genuine concern that should be heeded. - True timeline: The timeline seems accurate but may be somewhat optimistic or simplified; symptoms may have developed more insidiously or severely than described.  Overall, this analysis suggests that while James is cooperative, his emotional state influences his communication, possibly leading to under- or overestimation of certain symptoms, which should be carefully considered in clinical judgment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses words like \"kind of\", \"sort of\", \"maybe\", which are vague and diminish the perceived severity of symptoms. Phrases such as \"just blurry\" and \"kinda feeling\" suggest minimization, possibly to avoid alarming either himself or the listener. The description \"feels kind of unsettling\" indicates discomfort but without strong emotional activation, possibly downplaying concern. The use of \"mostly\" and \"sometimes\" shows some degree of uncertainty or reluctance to specify, which might hide the true frequency or severity. The phrase \"not that bad\" carries a minimizing tone, potentially underreporting actual distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Responses are brief and somewhat non-specific, especially when describing the visual symptoms (\"It comes and goes\", \"not all the time\"). The patient volunteers initial information about tiredness but only provides details about vision and tingling when prompted directly, indicating somewhat selective disclosure. When questioned about symptom triggers, answers remain limited and somewhat guarded, suggesting self-censorship or uncertainty about what is relevant. Their responses are consistent across queries but tend to be cautious and measured, possibly to avoid sharing more alarming details.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of information withholding are minimal but evident in the vague descriptions (\"kind of\", \"not really feel anything else\"). The downplaying of symptoms (\"not that bad\", \"just blurry\") suggests minimization. The fact that they report symptoms as \"not constant\" and \"sometimes\" could conceal the true frequency or severity\u2014perhaps there are episodes more severe or more frequent than acknowledged. No clear embarrassment or shame signals are present, but the cautious tone hints at some discomfort in fully revealing their experience. No obvious signs of confusion or memory issues are detected.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary bias appears to be minimization, with the patient underreporting symptom severity and frequency. Severity level is moderate, as the language indicates mild downplaying but no overt deception or denial. The most affected areas are the description of visual symptoms and tingling, which are minimized, potentially obscuring their true impact. Reliability of self-report is moderate; responses seem somewhat guarded but not intentionally deceptive.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: There is a likely underestimation of symptom severity, especially concerning the visual disturbances and neurological symptoms, which could be more significant than described. The patient might also be hesitant to fully disclose emotional distress or fears about the diagnosis, influencing their response pattern. The actual progression of symptoms could be more rapid or severe yet underrepresented by their narrative. Being aware of these subtle biases is critical to avoid underestimating the urgency or severity of his condition.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices are vague and mitigated, using words like \"kind of\", \"sort of\", \"not that bad,\" which reduces clarity about symptom severity. - Information flow is somewhat controlled; the patient volunteers basic info but limits details unless prompted, indicating cautious disclosure. - Response style tends to be brief and guarded, avoiding elaboration possibly to prevent escalation of concern or due to uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Evidence of information withholding includes vague descriptors and reluctance to describe symptom episodes in detail. - Minimization behaviors are apparent through downplaying the symptoms (\"not that bad,\" \"just blurry\") and uncertain language. - There are no clear signs of amplification or exaggeration, but the guarded responses may hide more significant issues. - No overt embarrassment or shame signals are observed, but the tone suggests discomfort with discussing symptom severity. - Timeline and frequency might be underreported, as the patient uses words like \"sometimes\" and \"not constant,\" which may understate actual symptom burden. - Limited evidence of family influence, but the patient's cautious wording may reflect perceived expectations or fears about parental or clinical judgment.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - The primary bias is minimization, with moderate severity, since the patient employs cautious language and limited disclosure. - Areas most affected include the perceived severity and frequency of visual disturbances and neurological symptoms. - Reliability of self-report is moderate; responses are honest but purposely understated, impacting assessing true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing involves the true extent of neurological and visual symptoms, possibly worse than described. - Symptoms probably minimized include the neurological signs (tingling) and severity/duration of visual disturbances, which may be more impactful. - Concerns are potentially amplified regarding emotional response or anxiety, but the overall presentation mostly suggests underreporting of medical severity. - The actual progression might be more severe or rapid than reported, given the cautious language and possible underplaying of symptoms, thus requiring careful exploration and objective assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient uses words like \"kind of\" when describing blurry vision (\"the blurry vision is kind of happening\") and \"just\" when explaining tingling (\"just kind of comes and goes\"). These soften the severity, possibly downplaying the symptoms. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"really thirsty all the time,\" \"feels super tired,\" \"kind of freaks me out\" indicate heightened concern and emotional responses, possibly exaggerating worry. - Vague language: He frequently uses non-specific terms such as \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" \"a little,\" which may obscure the true intensity or frequency of symptoms. - Emotional language: He admits to feeling worried (\"a little freaked out\") and nervous (\"a little nervous, worried about what might be wrong\"), showcasing underlying anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are generally short but become more detailed when prompted about specific aspects (e.g., duration of visual symptoms). Short responses may indicate discomfort or a tendency to provide minimal info unless specifically asked. - Directness: He answers directly when questioned (e.g., about the duration of vision issues) but tends to minimize symptoms with qualifiers. - Information volunteering: He primarily responds to questions rather than volunteering additional details, suggesting some guardedness or uncertainty. - Consistency: He maintains a consistent narrative about the timeline and symptoms, but the tone shifts subtly from vague to slightly more elaborated when describing symptom patterns.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: When describing symptoms, he downplays severity, e.g., \"just kind of happens,\" implying possible reluctance to alarm or discomfort with sharing full extent. - Minimization behaviors: Use of softening words like \"kind of,\" \"just,\" \"a little\" suggests he's minimizing the perceived seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Emotional language like \"freaks me out\" indicates anxiety, but overall, he doesn't seem to overstate symptoms beyond concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of embarrassment, though slight nervousness and shifting eye contact may hint at discomfort discussing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant indication of confusion; responses are logical and sequential. - Family influence: His mention of family history indicates awareness but doesn't suggest family influence on responses beyond factual sharing.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be *minimization*, as evidenced by softening language and reluctance to assign full severity to symptoms. - Severity level: **Moderate**, since he does not outright deny symptoms but downplays them, which might lead to underestimating the seriousness. - Areas most affected: Visual disturbances and tingling are most affected, with possible underreporting of severity. - Reliability assessment: Moderate trustworthiness; responses are generally coherent but likely understate how bad symptoms are due to minimization and anxiety.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully conveying the severity of symptoms, especially if symptoms worsen or if he is reluctant to admit how distressing they are. - Symptoms probably minimized: The tingling and visual disturbances may be more severe or persistent than he reports, given emotional concern and softening language. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about the seriousness suggests anxiety may amplify perceived severity, but actual risk (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) remains high. - True timeline: The timeline seems accurate but may underrate symptom severity, and the actual progression could be more rapid or intense than described.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and softening language (\"kind of,\" \"just,\" \"a little\"), which suggests an attempt to downplay or minimize the seriousness of his symptoms. Emotional expressions like \"freaks me out\" add an anxiety component but are balanced by attempts to appear calm. - Information flow: Responses tend to be reactive\u2014they answer questions but do not volunteer detailed information unless explicitly prompted. This indicates some guardedness, possibly due to anxiety or uncertainty. - Response style: Generally straightforward but with signs of minimization and uncertainty. He answers directly but with qualifiers that dull the perceived severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of softening words and vague descriptions indicates a likely withholding of the full extent of symptoms' severity. - Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms as \"kind of\" happening or \"just\" coming and going suggests he is downplaying how disruptive or serious they might be. - Amplification patterns: Emotional descriptors like \"freaks me out\" show concern but are moderate and seem calibrated; not outright exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight nervousness and shifting gaze during responses suggest some discomfort, but no overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion; responses are sequential and consistent. - Family influence: Mention of family history may influence his awareness but doesn't appear to skew responses significantly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimizational bias appears dominant, likely driven by anxiety and a desire to not appear overly alarmed. - Severity: Moderate, as he provides incomplete or softened descriptions yet does not outright deny symptoms. - Most affected areas: Visual symptoms and tingling are most biased topics, possibly understated. - Reliability: Moderate trust; responses are well-structured but likely understated in severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity, frequency, and impact of visual disturbances and tingling may be understated, risking an underappreciation of the urgency. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient might be experiencing more persistent or intense visual disturbances and neurological symptoms than he admits. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about seriousness could cause him to overestimate some dangers, so emotional distress levels may be inflated. - True timeline: Symptoms likely developed over two weeks but may have escalated more rapidly or with greater severity than reported due to softening language and anxiety-driven perception."
