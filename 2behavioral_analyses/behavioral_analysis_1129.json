    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will systematically evaluate Emma's initial response for communication patterns that may impact her diagnosis. STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Emma's words are straightforward but lack detailed elaboration. She states she \"started feeling really thirsty,\" \"had to go pee all the time,\" and mentions her \"tummy hurts sometimes\" and \"doesn't want to eat my cereal anymore.\" There is an absence of extraneous or minimizing phrases like \"only\" or \"just,\" and there are no exaggerated descriptors. Her language is somewhat direct but limited to core symptoms, with some emotional indicators such as \"really thirsty\" and \"tummy hurts,\" suggesting discomfort and worry. She does not express embarrassment or shame, but her brevity may hint at reluctance to delve into more sensitive symptoms or details. STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Her response is concise, providing key symptoms without elaboration or additional context. She doesn't volunteer extra details but offers enough when asked. She responds directly to the question about her presenting issues, but her answer is minimal, possibly indicating either limited understanding or withholding of additional concerns. Her responses are consistent, with no signs of evasiveness or inconsistency at this point. STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: There are no overt signs of withholding information or minimization here, but the brevity and lack of detailed elaboration could suggest some withholding or discomfort. The emotional language (\"really thirsty\") and the description of discomfort may indicate genuine distress; alternatively, they may be amplified by parental influence or anxiety. No signs of embarrassment or shame are evident in this direct response. STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The primary bias appears to be subtle withholding of detailed symptoms; Emma may be reluctant to express all discomforts or concerns. The severity seems mild at this stage, given her straightforward but minimal report. The areas least affected are her core symptoms, but the lack of detail suggests potential underreporting of secondary symptoms or concerns. Her communication can be trusted to an extent but should be supplemented with observation and parental input for completeness. STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing includes emotional distress, fears, or additional physical symptoms not explicitly articulated (e.g., reluctance to discuss specific discomforts). - Symptoms probably minimized are severity or additional complaints Emma might have about her condition or fears of hospitalization. - Concerns probably amplified are her general distress; she may be feeling more overwhelmed or worried than she can articulate fully. - The true timeline might involve earlier or more variable symptom progression that Emma is not fully conveying, possibly due to fatigue or distress limiting her detailed communication.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emma's responses are concise and focus on primary symptoms, with mild emotional tone. She avoids elaborate descriptions or detailed elaboration, indicating limited expressive detail. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with core symptoms but reluctant to volunteer further details. Her response is organized and focused, but sparse, hinting at possible withholding of additional concerns or discomforts. - Response style: Her replies are minimal and direct, with no tangential or overly elaborate statements, likely reflecting limited understanding or mild discomfort in sharing more.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and lack of elaboration suggest Emma may be withholding or unable to articulate more complex or emotional symptoms, possibly due to age or emotional state. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident in this response; her reports align with her symptoms, but the lack of detail could obscure the full severity of her discomfort. - Amplification patterns: No signs of exaggeration; her language is consistent with her physical state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; her tone is straightforward, with no hesitation tied to sensitive issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence in this response. - Family influence: The limited detail might reflect parental influence or their framing of symptoms, but not overtly evident here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely a mild response bias with subtle withholding; Emma may not be fully comfortable or able to express all concerns, possibly due to age-related communication limitations or anxiety. - Severity: Mild, given the straightforward nature but minimal elaboration. - Areas most affected: Detailed emotional or less overt physical symptoms, which may be underreported due to limited expressive capacity. - Reliability: Treat her self-reporting as somewhat reliable for core symptoms but potentially incomplete regarding underlying emotional or additional physical concerns.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Underlying fears, emotional responses, or subtle symptoms Emma cannot articulate. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of discomfort, emotional distress, or additional physical symptoms not explicitly stated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her overall distress may be higher than expressed and might be exaggerated by caregiver anxiety or worry. - True timeline: The progression could be more rapid or variable; Emma's minimal communication may obscure the full scope of symptom evolution."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient avoids emotional or detailed descriptions, using phrases like \"just really thirsty\" and \"peeing a lot\" without elaboration, indicating a tendency to underplay her symptoms. - Amplifying language: She doesn't explicitly exaggerate her symptoms but does express worry (\"I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong\") and fear (\"worried because I don\u2019t feel like myself\"), which may reflect internal anxiety more than symptom severity. - Vague language: Terms like \"sometimes\" for tummy hurts and \"not sure\" about her feelings suggest some degree of vagueness, possibly avoiding admitting more serious discomfort. - Emotional language: She shows signs of distress (\"I feel really tired,\" \"I don\u2019t understand\"), indicating some emotional response but perhaps limited expression due to her age or discomfort.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her responses are brief and to the point, possibly minimizing details unless prompted, which may suggest reluctance or difficulty in articulating complex feelings. - Directness: Her answers are direct but sparse, answering questions concretely but withholding elaborate explanations. - Information volunteering: She mainly repeats key symptoms once asked but doesn\u2019t volunteer additional info unless specifically prompted, indicating guardedness. - Consistency: Her answers are consistent with her initial statement, revealing a straightforward but limited communication pattern.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and lack of elaboration suggest possible withholding of details, perhaps uncomfortable discussing certain feelings or symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her discomfort (\"really thirsty,\" \"peeing a lot\" without emphasizing severity)\u2014possibly to avoid alarming the clinician or due to age. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; she doesn't appear to exaggerate, but her emotional expressions indicate some internal concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited; her responses don't show overt embarrassment, though her vague descriptions could hint at discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent and coherent. - Family influence: Her mention of her feelings and the context, but no clear evidence of family affecting responses at this stage.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight minimization bias\u2014she may be downplaying the severity due to age, discomfort, or fear of medical procedures. - Severity: Mild\u2014responses are honest but limited; no strong indications of significant withholding or distortion. - Areas most affected: Detail about her discomfort level and emotional state might be understated. - Reliability: Fairly reliable for basic symptoms but may lack nuanced detail; her age limits expressive depth.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be less willing to express the full extent of her discomfort or emotional distress, especially regarding fears or pain, due to age or discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of her discomfort and emotional distress might be greater than she reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about \"not feeling like herself\" reflects genuine concern but could be magnified by her anxiety or the situation. - True timeline: Symptoms have been gradually worsening over 3 days; her responses align with this, but she may not fully grasp or communicate the urgency or timeline details.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses straightforward, non-emotional language (\"really thirsty,\" \"peeing a lot\") and avoids detailed descriptions, which suggests minimization and limited elaboration likely due to age and discomfort. - Information flow: She responds mainly when prompted, with responses being brief and lacking in detail unless specifically asked, indicating guardedness or limited expressive ability. - Response style: Her responses are concise, direct, but minimal, showing she may be withholding deeper feelings or fears.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and limited elaboration, especially on her emotional state, suggest she might be withholding deeper feelings of fear or pain. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the discomfort (\"really thirsty\" and \"peeing a lot\" without emphasizing severity) possibly to avoid drawing attention or out of age-related communication limits. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; her concern appears genuine but may be somewhat amplified by emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, although the vague descriptions and minimal responses could hint at discomfort with discussing certain symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence present. - Family influence: Slight influence evident in her simplified responses, potentially reflecting an effort to not alarm her parents or due to anxiety.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias\u2014focused on light downplaying of symptoms, potentially influenced by age or emotional state. - Severity: Mild\u2014her responses are honest but terse and possibly limited by discomfort and developmental stage. - Areas most affected: Emotional expressions and detailed symptom severity; these might be understated. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her self-reporting provides a basic picture but requires careful interpretation and possibly further probing to uncover full severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper emotional distress, pain severity, and overall impact on daily functioning might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of her discomfort and emotional crisis might be worse than she verbalizes. - Concerns probably amplified: Her concern about feelings of not being herself and general worry may be genuine but could be exaggerated by her distress. - True timeline: Symptoms' progression over three days fits her responses, but she may lack awareness of the severity, thus limiting accurate reporting."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought analysis to systematically evaluate the patient's responses.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes only feeling \"kind of sick\" and \"more tired than usual,\" which is vague and downplays symptoms. - Amplifying language: The patient mentions feeling \"pretty bad\" and \"worried,\" indicating emotional distress but not necessarily exaggeration. - Vague language: Uses terms like \"kind of sick,\" \"didn't really know how to say it,\" and \"more tired,\" which lack precision. - Emotional language: Expresses worry and fear indirectly (\"worried about what\u2019s going to happen,\" \"pretty bad\"), signaling emotional distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Provides brief, non-specific responses, often minimizing details. - Directness: Answers questions generally but avoids detailed descriptions, deflecting specific symptom severity. - Information volunteering: Offers minimal details without prompting; largely passive. - Consistency: Responses are consistent in downplaying severity, aligning with a tendency to underreport symptoms.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient hesitates to specify symptoms, choosing vague phrases rather than detailed descriptions, indicating reluctance to fully disclose. - Minimization behaviors: Describes feelings as \"kind of sick\" and \"more tired,\" downplaying the severity. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; responses do not exaggerate concerns. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort appears when avoiding specifics about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity (\"didn't really know how to say it\"), but no major inconsistencies. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses seem internally generated.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias\u2014patient downplays severity, avoiding detailed symptom reporting. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014patient\u2019s vague responses and reluctance indicate noteworthy underreporting. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and emotional distress\u2014likely underestimating the impact. - Reliability assessment: Moderate trust; responses suggest underreporting, so self-report is somewhat unreliable.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of fatigue, discomfort, and emotional distress; possible unarticulated fears or additional symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of fatigue, distress, and discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's worry appears genuine but may be exaggerated due to distress rather than factual severity. - True timeline: Symptoms are reported as \"more tired than usual\" and \"don't really know how to say it,\" suggests real but understated progression.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient favors vague, non-specific terms (\"kind of sick,\" \"more tired\"), avoiding detailed or clinical descriptions, which indicates minimization. - Information flow: Responses are concise, minimally elaborative, and tend toward underreporting, providing only broad information unless pressed. - Response style: Uses brief, non-elaborative answers, possibly to avoid discomfort or fear of revealing perceived severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient\u2019s reluctance to specify the nature or intensity of symptoms (e.g., \"didn't really know how to say it\") suggests withholding full details. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying fatigue and discomfort by using qualifiers like \"kind of\" or \"more tired,\" avoiding explicit severity. - Amplification patterns: Absent; responses do not show overstatement but rather understatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort when discussing feelings, evident in vague answers and hesitant speech. - Confusion/memory issues: Some uncertainty about how to describe symptoms, indicating internal difficulty articulating details. - Family influence: No explicit evidence; responses seem more internally processed than externally influenced.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, given the consistent tendency to understate symptoms and avoid specifics. - Severity: Moderate\u2014responses reflect genuine distress but underreport the true level of symptoms, impacting assessment accuracy. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and emotional state are most biased; the patient does not fully communicate the extent. - Reliability: Moderate, because responses are likely understated; clinical interpretation should account for possible underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full scope of fatigue, discomfort, and emotional distress; potential unspoken fears or additional symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity and impact of tiredness, discomfort, and distress. - Concerns probably amplified: The expressed worry may be genuine but possibly exaggerated by distress rather than actual severity. - True timeline: Symptoms may have progressed more rapidly or severely than described; patient\u2019s vague responses could mask worsening signs."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient says \"just\" and \"only\" in \"I just know I feel pretty bad,\" which downplays severity, and \"I don't understand everything myself,\" indicating reluctance to share full details. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"really tired,\" \"worried,\" \"scared,\" suggest heightened emotional distress. - Vague language: Responses such as \"kind of sick,\" \"more tired than usual,\" and \"it\u2019s hard to say\" reveal non-specific descriptions, possibly evading precise details. - Emotional language: The patient expresses feeling \"scared\" and \"worried,\" and states, \"I feel pretty bad,\" revealing underlying anxiety or fear.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Answers tend to be short or somewhat hesitant, especially when addressing broader questions. - Directness: The responses prioritize perceived essential symptoms but avoid elaboration; for instance, \"I don\u2019t really know how to say it,\" suggests avoidance of detailed disclosure. - Information volunteering: Occurs minimally; the patient mostly responds briefly, indicating possible withholding. - Consistency: Responses are fairly consistent\u2014emphasizing tiredness and discomfort\u2014but lack depth, hinting at potential concealment.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and vagueness (\"It\u2019s hard to say,\" \"I don\u2019t understand everything\") suggest reluctance to fully disclose feelings or related symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: The patient states \"I feel pretty bad\" without elaborating on severity or specifics, possibly downplaying symptom intensity. - Amplification patterns: Despite mild wording, emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"worried\") may exaggerate distress, but overall limited. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not evident\u2014responses seem more avoidant than shame-driven. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence, though vagueness could indicate difficulty articulating experiences. - Family influence: Not directly indicated, but the patient's responses may be influenced by family concern or desire not to worry.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be **information withholding and minimization**, likely due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014responses are somewhat guarded, limiting full understanding. - Areas most affected: Overall symptom reporting, especially details about energy levels, behavioral changes, and emotional state. - Reliability assessment: Limited; the patient\u2019s brief, vague responses suggest caution in trusting the completeness of self-report.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The child's full experience regarding energy fluctuations, mood changes, and possibly other behavioral symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of fatigue, emotional distress, or additional discomforts may be underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: The child\u2019s expression of \"scared\" and \"worried\" could be an echo of parental anxiety rather than pure internal distress, or a way to signal concern indirectly. - True timeline: Likely more gradual or variable than described; the child's reticence may obscure the full progression of symptoms.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The child uses vague and somewhat minimal language (\"kind of sick,\" \"more tired than usual,\" \"it\u2019s hard to say\"), avoiding detailed descriptions. Emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"worried\") are present but not elaborated upon with specifics. - Information flow: Responses tend to be limited and guarded; the child suggests reluctance or difficulty in fully sharing sensations or feelings, possibly influenced by discomfort or fear. - Response style: Brief, somewhat evasive answers that focus on core symptoms rather than nuanced experiences, showing a pattern of withholding information.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The child's vague responses (\"I don\u2019t really know how to say it\") and hesitations imply withholding of detailed symptoms or feelings. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity (\"I feel pretty bad\"), potentially underreporting the impact of fatigue or discomfort. - Amplification patterns: Emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"worried\") could suggest heightened internal distress but are not accompanied by detailed description, possibly serving as signals to caregivers and clinicians. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but the reticence may reflect discomfort in expressing vulnerable feelings. - Confusion/memory issues: Some vagueness suggests difficulty articulating or recalling certain details. - Family influence: Not overtly indicated, but parental concern may contribute to the child's guarded responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate **information withholding/minimization**, possibly driven by fear, discomfort, or a desire to appear less ill. - Severity: Moderate\u2014responses are somewhat superficial, limiting full assessment. - Areas most affected: Symptoms involving energy, emotional state, and overall functional impact. - Reliability: Cautious; responses are likely incomplete and thus require corroboration through observation and parental input.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of fatigue, emotional distress, and functional impairments. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of fatigue, mood changes, and additional discomforts. - Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress (\"scared,\" \"worried\") may be exaggerated signals of anxiety rather than full internal experience, or could reflect parental influence. - True timeline: The progression may be more insidious or fluctuating; reticence might obscure the actual clinical course, delaying recognition of severity.  This analysis suggests clinicians should probe carefully for underlying feelings or additional symptoms, possibly involving parental insights, to counteract the partial picture presented by the child's responses."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The responses show limited use of diminutive or dismissive phrases; the patient does not explicitly downplay symptoms. - Amplifying language: She does not exaggerate her symptoms but does express fears (e.g., \"I feel really tired and worried\"). Phrases like \"super tired\" could suggest some emotional amplification. - Vague language: The state of \"feeling kind of sick\" and \"more tired than usual,\" which are non-specific, imply vagueness. The patient avoids precise descriptions. - Emotional language: There's clear fear and worry (\"scared,\" \"worried\"), but no overt embarrassment or shame.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Length is minimal, especially as the questions become more specific, indicating hesitance or discomfort. - Directness: Responses tend to be somewhat indirect, with the patient avoiding specifics about how bad symptoms are. - Information volunteering: She offers some info (\"super tired,\" \"don\u2019t want to do stuff\") but refrains from elaborating on severity or daily fluctuations without prompting. - Consistency: Responses align but tend to understate the impact; she repeats tiredness and discomfort but downplays specifics.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Signs of information withholding: She avoids detailed descriptions, especially about her sleep, mood, or specific levels of pain or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: She emphasizes feeling \"super tired\" and \"worried,\" but avoids describing her limitations or distress as more severe\u2014possibly downplaying her actual fatigue or discomfort. - Amplification patterns: Slight emotional exaggeration exists, e.g., \"scared,\" but overall her tone remains cautious, not overly dramatized. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No particular signs. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident issues. - Family influence: The mention of her parents' anxiety isn't directly reflected, but her hesitation to elaborate might be influenced by parental concern or her own discomfort.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Clear underreporting and minimization of symptoms, likely linked to fear or limited vocabulary. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014she recognizes some symptoms but avoids detailed or severe descriptions, which may obscure true symptom severity. - Areas most affected: Fatigue, emotional state, and possibly the extent of physical discomfort (tummy pain vs. what she reports). - Reliability: Self-report is somewhat trustworthy for basic symptoms but likely underestimates severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of her fatigue, discomfort, and emotional distress; she is reticent to fully disclose how severe her symptoms truly are. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her fatigue and discomfort may be more profound than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be more frightened or anxious than reported but avoids expressing this overtly. - True timeline: Symptoms may have been worsening more rapidly or severely than she admits, due to her tendency to understate.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emma employs vague, non-specific terms (\u201ckind of sick,\u201d \u201cmore tired\u201d) and avoids detailed symptom descriptions. She utilizes emotional words like \"worried\" but doesn\u2019t specify the intensity or duration clearly. - Information flow: Her responses are somewhat reluctant and minimal, especially regarding physical discomfort and daily functioning, indicating hesitance or discomfort in sharing more detailed information. - Response style: She tends to give short answers, repeats certain themes (fatigue, worry) without elaboration, and avoids discussing her symptoms' severity or impact fully.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Emma avoids elaborating on her symptoms\u2014she states she's \"more tired\" but provides no specifics about her activity levels, sleep patterns, or emotional state beyond \"worried,\" suggesting reluctance to disclose the full picture. - Minimization behaviors: She emphasizes feeling \"super tired\" but downplays the seriousness, possibly to avoid additional distress or due to fear of treatment implications. - Amplification patterns: Slight emotional exaggeration with \"worried\" may signal anxiety, but there is no overt overstatement of physical symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent. - Family influence: The patient's response may be moderated by her awareness of her parents\u2019 worries; she may be underreporting to prevent causing them concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate underreporting/minimization bias, likely driven by fear or limited ability to articulate severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she discloses some symptoms but avoids the full extent, which could obscure the actual severity. - Areas most affected: Physical symptoms (fatigue, discomfort) and emotional distress. These are reported in a limited manner. - Reliability: Moderate, with the understanding that her self-report might understate the true severity of her condition due to hesitance or fear.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The actual severity of her fatigue and discomfort, her emotional state, and any additional symptoms like sleep disturbances or mood changes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of her exhaustion and physical discomfort, which may be more severe. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry and fear, although she refrains from expressing this fully, indicating more internal distress. - True timeline: Symptoms may have been worsening more rapidly or intensely than she admits, due to her tendency to hide or understate her discomfort."
