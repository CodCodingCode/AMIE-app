    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze this patient's response systematically. STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"I\u2019m worried because it\u2019s been happening for a while,\" which suggests some downplaying of the severity; she doesn\u2019t describe the symptoms as unbearable or severe. She also uses phrases like \u201cjust hearing whispers,\u201d which can minimize the reality of auditory hallucinations. - Amplifying language: She mentions being \"worried\" about the voices returning \"more strongly\" or \"losing control again,\" indicating concern, but not overt panic or exasperation. - Vague language: The description \"sometimes loud noises that aren\u2019t really there\" is somewhat vague. She also says \u201chappening for a while,\u201d without precise timing. - Emotional language: Words like \"worried\" and \"scared\" suggest underlying anxiety, though her tone seems calm. Her hesitations and cautious wording reflect anxiety about her symptoms.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise but contain enough detail. She offers additional context when prompted, showing some reluctance but willingness to share. - Directness: She answers directly but with some hedging\u2014e.g., \"not really there\" and \"sometimes loud noises,\" which could be an attempt to minimize or normalise experiences. - Information volunteering: She waits to be asked about the timeline, indicating a possibly cautious approach to sharing full information. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent, describing ongoing symptoms over several months without contradictions.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Her cautious tone and delay in timeline sharing suggest some withholding; she might be reluctant to fully disclose the severity or impact. - Minimization behaviors: Describing auditory hallucinations as \"whispers\" and \"not really there\" downplays hallucination severity; she may be minimizing their significance. - Amplification patterns: Her emphasis on worry about relapse and loss of control indicates some amplification of concern, likely more about potential than about current danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Moderate; she appears anxious discussing symptoms but doesn\u2019t show overt shame, just cautiousness. - Confusion/memory issues: No concrete evidence; her timeline is vague but consistent. - Family influence: Limited; she mentions a supportive family, but her responses are more self-focused.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely minimization of symptoms; she presents symptoms as manageable and not severely disruptive, perhaps to avoid concern or stigma. - Severity: Moderate; she\u2019s not denying symptoms but downplays their seriousness, which could obscure the true picture. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and impact are most biased\u2014she may not fully acknowledge how much the voices affect her daily functioning. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report is likely somewhat accurate but influenced by her desire to appear less impaired or anxious.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity and frequency of hallucinations and disorganized thoughts might be more intense; she\u2019s possibly downplaying how disruptive her symptoms are. - Symptoms probably minimized: She might be minimizing hallucinations and distress; her descriptions are mild, which could underestimate the clinical risk. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about losing control suggests genuine concern, but she might overestimate the current risk based on past fears. - True timeline: The progression may be more gradual or severe than reported; she states the symptoms \"have been happening for a while\" but does not specify worsening, possibly underestimating earlier signs.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and somewhat dismissive phrases such as \u201cnot really there\u201d and \u201chappening for a while,\u201d which can obscure the true extent of her symptoms. Her language is cautious, balanced between describing symptoms and minimizing their severity. - Information flow: She is somewhat reserved, waiting for prompts to elaborate, indicating reluctance to volunteer full details without encouragement. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded. - Response style: Responses are concise and appropriate but shows some hesitance and hesitation, reflecting anxiety and possible concern about judgment or stigma.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The delay in providing specific timeline details and cautious phrasing suggest reluctance to fully disclose symptom severity. - Minimization behaviors: Describing hallucinations as \"whispers\" and \"not really there\" downplays their impact; she might be underreporting severity to avoid worry or stigma. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated concern about relapse and losing control indicates her anxiety about potential worsening, possibly exaggerated internally but expressed rationally. - Embarrassment/shame signals: She seems somewhat anxious and cautious but not overtly ashamed, more motivated by concern than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: The vague timelines may reflect mild cognitive disorganization but are consistent enough to suggest genuine symptom features rather than confusion. - Family influence: Minimal explicit influence; her responses focus internally, although her mention of a supportive family might buffer some underreporting.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization\u2014she might be downplaying the severity of her hallucinations and disorganized thoughts to avoid concern or stigma. - Severity: Moderate, as she is truthful but filters her responses to appear more manageable, possibly missing the full extent of her symptoms. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and impact perception are most biased\u2014she likely underestimates how much her symptoms impair her functioning. - Reliability: Moderately reliable but influenced by her anxiety and desire to appear more stable; clinical judgment should consider this bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true intensity and frequency of hallucinations and disorganized thinking may be worse than reported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual experience of auditory hallucinations and disorganization might be more disruptive than her description suggests. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about relapse can be genuine but might lead her to overstate or catastrophize her vulnerability. - True timeline: Symptoms might have been insidious or worsening unnoticed; her brief mention of \"for a while\" may underestimate earlier issues or severity."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze Sarah's responses systematically. She describes her experiences with a calm and descriptive tone, using specific phrases like \"hear whispers,\" \"background noise,\" and \"my thoughts feel jumbled,\" which indicates some level of clarity but also potential subtle minimization or normalization of her symptoms. Her language appears direct but includes hesitations (\"like my brain is stuck,\" \"if that makes sense\"), which might suggest discomfort or modesty. She minimizes the severity by stating she hasn't noticed her eyes doing \"anything weird exactly,\" and suggests visual disturbances are minor (\"fuzzy or shaky\") without emphasizing urgency. Her overall pattern shows she is providing detailed information but may be underreporting or downplaying certain symptoms, especially physical or visual issues, possibly due to embarrassment or difficulty acknowledging subtle problems. Response to questions about her eyes seems more guarded or hesitant, potentially indicating reluctance to share full extent of visual disturbances, perhaps fearing they might seem unrelated or more serious. Her descriptions contain some emotional qualifiers (\"like my brain is stuck,\" \"off,\" \"feels off\"), which could point to underlying concern but are expressed in a controlled manner. Her communication seems organized but somewhat cautious, suggesting moderate bias in how she reports her symptoms.\nANSWER: Sarah exhibits a tendency to modestly minimize or euphemize her visual symptoms, possibly due to discomfort or uncertainty, while openly discussing auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization. Her responses are descriptive but include hesitations that suggest subtle self-monitoring or reluctance to fully disclose or emphasize certain problems."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Let me examine the specific words and phrases the patient uses. - Minimizing language: She describes her visual experiences as \"just kind of like flashes or shadows sometimes,\" indicating a tendency to downtune or downplay the severity, possibly wanting to avoid seeming overly worried. - Amplifying language: She says, \"it kind of worries me\" and \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal or if I should be worried,\" showing her concern but not high level panic. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" \"a few times a week\" reflect non-specific descriptions, possibly indicating uncertainty or reluctance to give precise details. - Emotional language: She expresses worry (\"it kind of worries me\") and a mild sense of embarrassment or shame about her perception of visual disturbances, which could influence her openness.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her answers are concise, suggesting she may be hesitant to elaborate fully but tries to answer directly. - Directness: She answers questions straightforwardly but inserts qualifying language (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") that could be a buffer to minimize perceived severity. - Information volunteering: She doesn\u2019t volunteer additional detail unless prompted, indicating a degree of guardedness or uncertainty. - Consistency: Responses seem consistent\u2014she reports visual issues occurring \"a few times a week\" and feeling worried, aligning with her initial statement.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Her cautious language and moderate detail hint she might be withholding or minimizing the degree of her visual disturbances. - Minimization behaviors: She says \"not really seeing anything clear\" and \"not all the time,\" possibly downplaying the frequency or severity. - Amplification patterns: Her concerns about \"worrying if it\u2019s normal\" show some anxiety but are expressed without overt alarm, suggesting she might be striving for reassurance rather than catastrophizing. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The tentative language (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") and the phrasing of her experiences could indicate discomfort discussing possibly abnormal perceptions. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence; her description appears consistent and organized. - Family influence: No overt indication that family impacts her responses; her narrative seems internally consistent.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization of visual symptoms; she appears to downplay the severity, likely to avoid concern or appearing overly distressed. - Severity level: Moderate, as she provides vague descriptions and seems to understate the frequency or impact. - Areas most affected: Visual experiences are likely understated; her emotional response might also be slightly suppressed. - Reliability assessment: Her self-report is somewhat cautious and guarded; while generally consistent, her tendency to minimize suggests some data may be less detailed than actual experience.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her true frequency or intensity of visual disturbances and perhaps more significant distress or functional impairment. She may also be experiencing more frequent or severe hallucinations or visual distortions than she admits. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her description of visual changes as \"fuzzy\" or \"shadowy\" may mask more troubling hallucinations or perceptual alterations. - Concerns probably amplified: She worries about \"normalcy\" and relapse, possibly overestimating the severity of her current experience but seeking reassurance rather than presenting a true crisis. - True timeline: The reported symptom progression appears steady and slow, but her cautious language suggests her actual symptoms might be more persistent or impactful, just not fully disclosed.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague, non-specific language (\"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" \"a few times a week\") that minimizes her symptoms. She also uses emotional qualifiers that indicate mild concern but avoid explicit alarm. Her wording reflects a tendency to downplay her visual experiences to avoid worry or stigma. - Information flow: She tends to be cautious and somewhat guarded, providing standard responses without elaborate detail unless specifically prompted. Her responses seem organized but are filtered through a lens of modesty or uncertainty. - Response style: She responds directly but with hedging, indicating possible discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose severity. Her style is characterized by tentative phrasing and moderate elaboration.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her use of non-specific language and qualifying phrases suggests she may be deliberately minimizing or withholding the true extent of visual disturbances. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity (\"not really seeing anything clear,\" \"not all the time\") points toward an effort to minimize her symptoms, possibly to avoid concern or judgment. - Amplification patterns: Her worry about whether her experiences are normal indicates some concern is exaggerated or at least expressed in a way that seeks reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Tentative language and reluctance to elaborate fully may reflect embarrassment or shame about her perceptual experiences or fears of stigma. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her description appears logically consistent. - Family influence: No explicit signs, responses seem independently generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias is evident, as she underreports the frequency or intensity of her visual disturbances and manages her disclosures cautiously. - Severity: Moderate, because her language indicates she is deliberately cautious but not overtly hiding critical information. - Areas most affected: Visual perception symptoms are most biased, with descriptions likely underestimating potential concerns. - Reliability: Her self-report should be interpreted with some caution; she appears motivated to reassure herself and the clinician, possibly glossing over more significant issues.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency, severity, or functional impact of her visual disturbances and the emotional distress associated with them. She may also be experiencing more intense or distressing perceptual phenomena that she is reluctant to disclose. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her description may understate the severity of visual distortions or hallucinations, as she focuses on occasional \"shadows\" rather than persistent or more vivid experiences. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about \"normalcy\" and potential relapse are genuine but may also reflect underlying anxiety that makes her overestimate the threat level. - True timeline: The slow, gradual onset and current recurrent pattern could suggest a more persistent or worsening symptom course than she admits, but her guarded language limits full accuracy.  Overall, her pattern suggests moderate underreporting due to cautiousness and a possible inclination to minimize her symptoms, which requires careful probing to ensure accurate clinical understanding."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: Let me examine the specific words and phrases the patient uses. - Minimizing language: The patient frequently uses \"kind of,\" \"just,\" \"like,\" \"a little,\" and \"not really\" when describing visual phenomena, e.g., \"like shadows or flashes,\" \"not really seeing clearly,\" suggesting a tendency to downplay or soften symptoms. - Amplifying language: Words like \"scared,\" \"worried,\" \"shaken up,\" and \"kind of\" suggest emotional distress but not exaggeration. No explicit hyperbole or alarmist phrases are present. - Vague language: The patient often employs non-specific descriptors such as \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"maybe,\" indicating a potential discomfort or uncertainty about the symptoms. - Emotional language: Feelings of worry (\"it kind of worries me,\" \"I'm scared\") and anxiety (\"scared,\" \"shaken up\") are evident, suggesting underlying emotional distress tied to symptom perception.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are relatively brief, especially when discussing triggers or details, which may indicate hesitance or avoidance in elaborating. - Directness: The patient responds directly but with qualifiers, e.g., \"I guess,\" \"maybe,\" which points to some uncertainty or reluctance. - Information volunteering: The patient provides limited detail unless prompted, often centering responses on what is happening rather than exploring contextual factors or concerns. - Consistency: The reports of visual phenomena are consistent throughout, describing flashes or shadows happening \"a few times a week\" and being \"worried\" but not escalating or diminishing significantly.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" and vague descriptors suggest an attempt to minimize or control the disclosure of symptoms, possibly due to discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the impact of visual issues (\"not really seeing clearly,\" \"not always the same or intense\") might mask the true severity, possibly to appear less concerned or to avoid attention. - Amplification patterns: The patient shows genuine worry (\"it kind of worries me,\" \"scared\"), but the degree of distress may be amplified by anxiety about relapse; however, this could also reflect heightened sensitivity rather than actual severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame or embarrassment are evident, but the hesitance and non-specific language may hint at discomfort discussing certain symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: The patient reports a clear timeline but uses qualifiers (\"sometimes,\" \"not always\") that could suggest some uncertainty but not necessarily memory impairment. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses seem internally driven, with no apparent social pressure noted.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely a combination of minimization and anxiety amplification biases. The patient appears to understate symptom severity (\"just kind of like flashes\"), possibly to avoid worry, while also expressing genuine concern (\"scared,\" \"worried\") which may inflate perceived threat. - Severity level: Moderate. The vagueness and downplaying could obscure the reality of symptoms, which might be more serious than reported, but the emotional distress indicates significant concern. - Areas most affected: Visual phenomena and emotional response are most biased; the patient minimizes their impact but demonstrates considerable anxiety. - Reliability assessment: Moderate reliability, given consistent reports but with signs of emotional bias and avoidance that could distort the actual clinical picture.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully disclosing the frequency or severity of visual phenomena, possibly minimizing their impact to reduce worry or embarrassment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Visual changes and their impact may be more significant than acknowledged, given the hesitance and qualitative language; psychological distress could be masking or amplifying perceptions. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about relapse likely influences her reporting, making her appear more distressed than the actual severity of symptoms. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but emotional and cognitive biases may distort the perceived permanence or severity, possibly underreporting actual changes or overemphasizing fears.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and cautious language, with frequent qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"a little\") and emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"worried\"). This indicates hesitance and a tendency to soften or minimize symptoms. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat guarded, providing basic descriptions but avoiding detailed elaboration unless specifically prompted. The responses are organized but limited, suggesting discomfort with full disclosure. - Response style: Elise responses tend to be brief and descriptive but contain qualifiers that suggest internal conflict or uncertainty. She responds acceptably directly but with emotional and linguistic hedging.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The repeated use of non-specific language and qualifiers suggests deliberate or subconscious minimization to avoid worry or shame, masked as modesty or uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity and impact of visual phenomena, describing them as \"kind of shadows or flashes\" and \"not always the same,\" possibly to avoid seeming overly concerned or to manage anxiety. - Amplification patterns: She is genuinely worried about relapse, evident in her words (\"scared,\" \"worried\"), which may lead her to overstate her concern in emotional terms but not necessarily exaggerate the actual severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs of shame, but discomfort in discussing symptoms hints at possible internalized stigma or shame about her experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: The responses reflect some uncertainty about triggers and symptoms, possibly due to distress, but no evidence of actual memory impairment. - Family influence: No explicit influence detected in responses; the responses seem internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be minimization of symptoms combined with anxiety-driven amplification. She underplays the physical and visual symptoms but is visibly anxious and worried about her condition. - Severity: Moderate, as relevant symptoms may be understated, and emotional distress is evident. - Areas most affected: Visual phenomena and emotional expression; these are most biased by her responses. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014 her statements are consistent but tempered by hesitance and emotional distress, which likely distort the accurate severity assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency and severity of visual abnormalities, as she minimizes or downplays them. - Symptoms probably minimized: Visual disturbances could be more persistent or impactful than reported; her hesitance may mask their true severity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about relapse may lead her to overstate her fears, which could influence her perception of symptoms. - True timeline: The progression seems relatively accurate but could be influenced by her emotional state, potentially making the symptoms seem more threatening or recent than they are."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient generally uses vague and softening language, such as \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"maybe,\" indicating a tendency to minimize or downplay how serious her experiences are. She mentions experiencing \"just\" flashes or shadows, which minimizes the frequency or severity. When describing her symptoms, she states \"kind of like\" or \"sometimes,\" showing uncertainty and possible reluctance to fully acknowledge the extent. Emotional language includes expressions of worry (\"it worries me\") and feeling \"shaken up,\" signaling some anxiety but not overwhelming fear. There are no overtly shameful or embarrassed expressions, but the hesitations and softening terms suggest interior discomfort or uncertainty.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: Her responses are generally concise and somewhat hesitant, especially when asked about triggers or details, indicating possible reluctance or discomfort revealing the full picture. She tends to answer directly but leaves room for ambiguity (\"not sure if that\u2019s always how it is\"). She volunteers relevant details but often qualifies or downplays them, revealing a pattern of minimal disclosure, perhaps driven by embarrassment or uncertainty. Responses are consistent in indicating that stress and tiredness seem to exacerbate symptoms, but she avoids emphasizing severity, likely to avoid alarm.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: Signs of information withholding are evident in her vague descriptions (\"maybe a few times a week,\" \"kind of like flashes\") and hesitations before specifics. She appears to minimize symptoms, emphasizing the mildness (\"not that bad,\" \"just mental fatigue sometimes\") despite expressing worry. Her emotional subtlety\u2014sharing that she's \"shaken up\"\u2014may be an indirect sign of distress she is reluctant to fully confront or disclose. Occasional eye contact being broken or averted, along with fidgeting, indicates inner discomfort or shame. Her mention of uncertainty about triggers and lack of physical disturbances might be an attempt to avoid admitting more distressing phenomena.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The primary bias appears to be minimization combined with some level of self-protective withholding of information. The severity is moderate\u2014she cautiously shares but downplays the frequency and severity, which could mask actual intensity of symptoms. Symptoms most affected are visual disturbances \u2013 she downplays their intrusiveness and frequency. Her self-report likely underestimates reality, necessitating corroboration.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Likely missing are more frequent or intense visual/auditory symptoms, as she minimizes their impact. The true severity of her hallucinations and disorganized thoughts may be worse than described. Her worry about relapse may be amplified, but she might also be overestimating her control, leading to underreporting of crises. Timeline might be more chronic and escalating than she admits, especially if she\u2019s trying to avoid concern or intervention.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She favors vague, softened language (\"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"maybe\") to attenuate the severity of her symptoms, and emotional qualifiers like \"it worries me,\" indicating internal discomfort. She balances clinical descriptions with non-threatening terms, suggesting an attempt to avoid alarming herself or others. - Information flow: She presents as somewhat organized but restrained, sharing relevant details without overwhelming or exaggerating, choosing to keep certain aspects understated. Her responses are direct but with hesitation, indicating partial reluctance. - Response style: Her elaboration tends to be cautious, often qualifying statements, and she avoids emphasizing severity, likely to minimize concern or shame.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitant language and downplaying symptoms (\"not that bad,\" \"kind of,\" \"maybe\") suggest she might be withholding or minimizing the true extent of her experiences. - Minimization behaviors: She consistently describes her symptoms as mild or infrequent, which could obscure their actual impact, and she emphasizes lack of physical discomfort to divert from more significant mental health concerns. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; she appears cautious rather than exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but hesitations and softening speech reflect possible internal discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity in timeline (\"maybe a few times a week\") could reflect uncertainty or difficulty recalling specifics; nothing suggests significant memory disturbance. - Family influence: Not explicit, but her guarded tone may be partially due to internalized stigma or worry about family perceptions.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias combined with cautious withholding of information, driven by anxiety or fear of stigma. - Severity: Moderate. She clearly underreports severity but provides enough clues to infer that her symptoms might be more distressing than she admits. - Areas most affected: The frequency, intensity, and triggers of visual/auditory symptoms are most biased, with her underplaying their impact. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reporting is affected by bias, and her true symptom burden may be underestimated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity, frequency, and impact of her hallucinations and disorganized thoughts. She may be experiencing more distress or functional impairment than she admits. - Symptoms probably minimized: The extent of her visual disturbances and the degree to which anxiety worsens her symptoms could be greater. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about relapse and losing control may be magnified due to anxiety, possibly leading her to overstate the severity of her fears. - True timeline: Her symptom progression might be more insidious and persistent than she states, potentially escalating without her fully recognizing or reporting it."
