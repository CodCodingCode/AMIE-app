    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses and behaviors in detail. Starting with language, the patient uses very limited, vague expressions such as \"No good,\" \"Help,\" \"body heavy,\" \"no sleep, no eat,\" and repeats the distress signals (\"too much, no good\") without specifying any particular intensity or detailed symptoms. This suggests an avoidance of specifics, possibly to prevent the need for explaining or due to difficulty articulating experiences. The emotional tone is clearly distressed and anxious, with trembling, fidgeting, and repetitive gestures indicating high emotional arousal and sensory overload.  In response patterns, the patient provides very brief, largely unelaborated responses, only volunteering minimal information when prompted indirectly (\"Worsen past week\"). There\u2019s resistance to providing detailed descriptions of symptoms beyond sensory overload and physical distress. Responses are almost entirely reactive, showing signs of emotional overwhelm and limited verbal capacity rather than organized sharing of information.  Behaviorally, the signs of withholding data are evident: reluctance to specify the severity, duration, or details of physical symptoms; reliance on simple phrases and gestures; and minimal elaboration. The repeated emphasis on distress (\"No good,\" \"Help... help...\") and avoidance of details could also suggest minimization or an inability to communicate nuanced symptoms. The intense distress, combined with covering ears and pacing, underscores high sensory overload but also indicates difficulty in communicating the full extent of their experience. There appears to be no explicit evidence of amplification or exaggerated concerns; instead, the patient seems overwhelmed and under-communicative, perhaps deliberately or unconsciously avoiding detailed disclosures.  In terms of bias severity, the primary issue appears to be a communication subset characterized by symptom minimization and emotional overwhelm\u2014possibly influenced by autism and sensory overload, which impair detailed expression and factual sharing. Given the patient's very limited verbal capacity and signs of distress, these biases are severe, affecting nearly all aspects of clinical data collection. Their self-reporting reliability is compromised, especially regarding specifics of symptoms, severity, and timeline.  Clinically, this suggests that the clinician should be cautious in interpreting the limited information. Likely, the patient's actual physical and emotional symptoms are worse than reported, with possible underestimation of severity and missing details on specific episodes. The patient\u2019s distress may be exaggerated internally but under-communicated, and their sensory overload is genuine but not fully captured in their responses. The true timeline of worsening might be more rapid or severe than they can articulate.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses very vague, emotionally loaded phrases like \"no good,\" \"help,\" \"body heavy,\" and repeats distress signals, avoiding specifics. They rely on gestures and simple sounds rather than detailed descriptions. - Information flow: Responses are minimal, reactive, and limited, primarily driven by distress rather than organized sharing. The responses are somewhat scattered and inconsistent, as they only provide what they can manage emotionally and physically. - Response style: Responses are minimal, emotional, and repetitive, with a tendency to focus on distress rather than detail, indicating a focus on internal states rather than factual sharing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence includes the patient's avoidance of specific symptom details, reluctance to elaborate beyond general distress, and reliance on gestures and minimal speech. - Minimization behaviors: There is little clear minimization; rather, the patient seems to emphasizing distress and sensory overload without downplaying symptoms, possibly due to overwhelmed state. They may be underreporting severity or specifics because of communication difficulties rather than intentional minimization. - Amplification patterns: No overt exaggeration is observed; distress appears genuine. However, their inability or unwillingness to specify could mask the true severity, which might be worse. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There\u2019s no explicit evidence of shame; the patient appears primarily overwhelmed and anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: The responses do not show clear evidence of memory or factual confusion; rather, the challenge is in expressing experience. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence beyond background knowledge; responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is a communication impairment bias, heavily influenced by sensory overload and emotional distress. This causes severe underreporting and emotional overwhelm, impairing the accuracy of self-reporting. - Severity: Severe, given the patient's minimal verbal abilities, high distress, and limited ability to convey details, which significantly hampers clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Subjective symptom description, severity grading, timeline of progression, and specific sensory triggers are most biased. - Reliability: Due to communication difficulty and emotional overload, their report is highly unreliable for nuanced symptom details; clinicians must rely more on behavioral cues and collateral information.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about intensity, duration, and triggers of symptoms are probably underreported or absent. The patient\u2019s internal experience may be much more severe than conveyed. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient may be minimizing the degree of physiological and emotional distress, as they focus on their inability to cope rather than precise symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Their expressed fear of worsening (\"No good\") and distress may be exaggerated internally, reflecting overwhelm rather than specific health crises. - True timeline: The reported gradual worsening over the past week may oversimplify the progression; the real situation could involve a more sudden or severe decline that they cannot describe.  (Note: This detailed analysis underscores that communication biases are severe, primarily driven by sensory overload and emotional distress inherent in autism spectrum presentations, affecting clinical understanding and assessment accuracy.)"

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me carefully evaluate the patient's responses and communication style to identify any subtle biases or patterns.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient does not explicitly minimize symptoms; instead, he emphasizes severity with phrases like \"No good,\" \"Help... help,\" and \"Too loud,\" which suggest he perceives his situation as quite serious. - Amplifying language: Words like \"worse,\" \"heavy,\" and \"no good\" imply distress, but they are relatively non-specific, emphasizing the subjective experience rather than explicit exaggeration. - Vague language: The patient relies heavily on non-specific descriptors such as \"no good,\" \"body heavy,\" \"no sleep,\" \"no eat,\" which lack detailed information. - Emotional language: Clear indicators of fear and distress appear with phrases like \"Help... help...\" and expressions of being overwhelmed, indicating high emotional arousal but limited verbal elaboration.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Very short responses, primarily monosyllabic or phrase-based, often repeating key concerns (\"no good,\" \"help\"). This suggests a pattern of limited elaboration, possibly due to communication impairments or intentional minimization. - Directness: Responses are direct in conveying distress but do not elaborate on specifics. The patient avoids answering detailed questions, focusing on basic sensory overload symptoms. - Information volunteering: The patient primarily volunteers feelings of distress and worsening over time, with no additional details unless prompted. He does not elaborate on potential causes or contextual factors. - Consistency: Responses are consistent across questions, all emphasizing sensory overload and distress, reinforcing the prominence of these issues.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient does not mention any specific triggers besides sensory overload but avoids describing underlying causes or medical symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: The pattern isn't overtly minimization; instead, the patient focuses on the intensity of distress without downplaying symptoms. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration beyond the expressed distress; responses seem aligned with his reported state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but the avoidance of social or detailed responses may imply discomfort discussing specifics. - Confusion/memory issues: Limited evidence; responses are consistent but sparse, likely due to communication limitations. - Family influence: No direct evidence, though his reliance on minimal speech aligns with long-standing ASD communication patterns.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Predominantly a communication limitation bias, with tendencies toward emotional expression that may amplify perceived distress. - Severity level: Severe, as responses are minimal and heavily emotionally influenced, limiting comprehensive assessment. - Areas most affected: Detail about the nature of symptoms, medical history, and possible underlying causes are most biased or underreported. - Reliability assessment: Self-report is limited; responses are highly subjective and constrained, so clinical interpretation should consider possible underreporting or unvoiced concerns.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific medical symptoms, underlying medical causes, or contextual triggers are probably unreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity or complexity of his sensory overload and condition might be understated, as he tends to simplify and generalize. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of danger or seriousness are genuine but may reflect heightened emotional distress rather than objective severity. - True timeline: The worsening over the past week is consistent, but the extent may be under-elaborated; his communication style masks possible additional issues.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient favors very simple, emotionally charged phrases (\"no good,\" \"help\") with minimal detail, reflecting expressive but non-specific language. - Information flow: The responses are reluctant and sparse, driven by distress; he offers only the most basic information and refrains from elaboration. - Response style: Highly minimal, repetitive, and emotionally driven responses dominate, indicating limited verbal output capacity and high distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient avoids discussing specific symptoms, underlying medical issues, or contextual details, possibly to avoid complexity or due to communication limitations. - Minimization behaviors: While not overtly minimizing, the simplistic and general responses may obscure the true severity or complexity of his condition. - Amplification patterns: There is no clear exaggeration; the responses mirror his emotional overwhelm, which may amplify perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The reluctance to elaborate or provide details could suggest discomfort or shame about the situation. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs, responses are consistent but minimal, likely due to communication constraints. - Family influence: No direct evidence; consistent with ASD communication style.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Communication impairment bias, compounded by emotional distress bias; responses are shaped by ASD-related language limitations and emotional overload. - Severity: Severe; responses are very limited, making clinical assessment challenging and increasing risk of under- or overestimating severity. - Areas most affected: Specific symptom details and underlying causes are most biased; emotional expressions overshadow nuanced understanding. - Reliability: Limited; reliance on this self-report alone is problematic. Responses are heavily influenced by communication style and emotional state, so external observation is crucial.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Underlying medical causes, specific symptom descriptions, or contextual factors are probably unreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The full extent of their sensory overload and distress may be larger than indicated. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of danger or health deterioration could be heightened due to emotional overload rather than objective status. - True timeline: Worsening over the past week is consistent, but the severity and impact could be underrepresented due to communication limitations."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient, George, displays consistent signs of minimization and emotional mitigation. His responses are very brief, repeated, and lack specific detail, indicating reluctance or difficulty in elaborating. He uses simple, blanket statements like \"No good,\" \"Help,\" and \"Too loud,\" avoiding specifics about severity or progression. His responses to questions about his symptoms are minimal, suggesting possible withholding of details or an inability to articulate more complex feelings. The frequent repetition of distress signals and avoidance of elaboration point toward a stoic, guarded communication style aimed at downplaying his suffering. This pattern could mask the true extent of his physical and sensory overload symptoms, leading to underestimation of his condition. The minimal but consistent expression of overload indicates a strong tendency toward symptom minimization, possibly out of a desire to avoid perceived trouble or out of difficulty expressing complex emotions due to communication impairment. Overall, his responses suggest significant underreporting and emotional suppression, which could hinder accurate clinical assessment and necessitate careful interpretation of his non-verbal cues and behaviors.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses very vague, minimal phrases (\"No good,\" \"Help,\" \"Too loud\") with no elaboration. Focuses on core distress signals rather than detailed symptom descriptions. - Information flow: Reluctant to provide details, sticks to short, repetitive responses. Appears to limit expression, possibly to avoid burdening or out of difficulty articulating. - Response style: Minimalist and repetitive, likely reflecting discomfort, emotional overload, or a tendency to downplay. Responses are consistent in their brevity across questions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Avoids detailing specific symptoms like pain intensity or exact sensory thresholds; responses are monosyllabic, possibly to conceal the severity or due to inability. - Minimization behaviors: Repeatedly states \"No good,\" \"help,\" and general distress without specifics, indicating an effort to downplay the magnitude of his experience. - Amplification patterns: No clear evidence; responses focus on distress signals rather than exaggeration. However, his tone suggests extreme discomfort, but he underreports the severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not overt, but his reluctance to elaborate or detail suggests possible discomfort discussing his symptoms fully. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs, but the brevity and repetition could reflect difficulty in structuring complex responses. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but reliance on minimal language may be partly due to lifelong communication patterns established early in life.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization and response suppression bias, as evidenced by his brief, non-elaborative answers aimed at downplaying his distress. - Severity: Severe\u2014these behaviors significantly impair the clinical assessment's accuracy, risking underestimation of his condition. - Areas most affected: The severity and nature of his sensory overload and physical symptoms are most biased. He appears to conceal or minimize how debilitating the overload feels. - Reliability: Low to moderate\u2014while signs of severe distress are present, the minimal responses limit the full understanding of his condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of his sensory overload, pain levels, and physiological impact may be far worse than indicated. His communication style obscures the severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: His reported distress may underestimate the actual pain/discomfort and the danger posed by his worsening symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: He may be over-worried or overly distressed about the situation, but the responses suggest a tendency to stay guarded rather than reflect his true feelings. - True timeline: Symptoms have likely been worsening more gradually, with a significant functional impact that he's hesitant to fully verbalize, possibly due to a habitual response pattern of downplaying or communication limitations.  In summary, George\u2019s communication reveals a high degree of symptom minimization and guarding, which complicates accurate clinical assessment. Careful interpretation of behavioral cues and possibly alternative assessment methods (e.g., sensory evaluation, non-verbal cues) are needed to understand his true state."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will evaluate the patient's language, response patterns, behavioral cues, and potential biases to understand how their communication may influence clinical assessment. STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient avoids specific details about pain or severity, instead repeating \"No good\" and \"Help,\" possibly downplaying their symptoms. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"No sleep,\" \"No eat,\" and \"body heavy\" suggest distress, but lack specificity, which may exaggerate sensory overload experiences. - Vague language: Descriptions such as \"Too loud,\" \"Too bright,\" \"Feel like body heavy,\" lack precise severity or duration, indicating limited capacity to articulate details. - Emotional language: Words like \"help,\" \"hard breathe,\" \"scared,\" and \"panic\" indicate emotional distress, but are expressed with limited elaboration, possibly due to communication impairment. STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are brief, showing a tendency to omit details, especially when asked about sensations or timeline. - Directness: The patient minimally answers questions, repeating distress signals rather than directly addressing specific inquiries. - Information volunteering: They proactively share distress when asked about overload, but avoid elaborating on specifics, indicating possibly withholding or difficulty articulating details. - Consistency: Responses are consistent across questions\u2014repeated phrases like \"No good,\" \"Too loud,\" \"Help\"\u2014suggesting a pattern of limited, stereotyped responses. STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Reluctance to specify pain intensity or exact discomfort details; instead, focuses on overall distress. - Minimization behaviors: The repetitive \"No good\" and vague descriptors may serve to downplay the severity or avoid entering into complex descriptions. - Amplification patterns: Expressions like \"body heavy, hard to breathe\" may exaggerate sensations for emphasis, or reflect actual severity miscommunicated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation or minimal elaboration could suggest discomfort with detailed disclosure, possibly shame about severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent and directly linked to sensory overload. - Family influence: No direct evidence, as responses seem internally driven; however, the consistent pattern may be influenced by communication limitations rather than external control. STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be **minimization and sensory overload amplification**\u2014they avoid detailed descriptions but communicate distress in a stereotyped manner. - Severity: **Severe**, because reliance on limited stereotyped phrases suggests significant difficulty in articulating actual symptom severity or specifics. - Areas most affected: The reporting of pain/discomfort, duration of overload, and contextual details are most biased; likely underestimating the complexity of their experience. - Reliability: Due to communication limitations, self-reporting is unreliable for precise assessment\u2014much of the true severity may be understated. STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about pain intensity, duration, and context are concealed or not articulated, so actual physical and psychological states are probably more severe. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient\u2019s concise responses may underrepresent the extent of sensory overload and distress. - Concerns probably amplified: The repeated pleas for help suggest significant emotional distress, though their descriptions are limited, indicating they might be more overwhelmed than conveyed. - True timeline: The course over the past week appears consistent, but the degree of worsening could be underestimated due to limited expressive capacity\u2014actual deterioration may be more rapid or severe.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient prefers very simple, stereotyped phrases (\"No good,\" \"Help,\" \"Too loud,\" \"Too bright\") which lack detail and reflect limited expressive capacity. They avoid elaboration, likely due to communication impairment or discomfort. - Information flow: The responses are minimal and repetitive, demonstrating a reluctance or inability to elaborate. They do not volunteer details beyond basic distress signals, especially when asked about time course or sensations. - Response style: Responses are brief, stereotyped, and consistent, indicating that they rely on habitual expressions rather than detailed self-reporting.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Repeatedly sidestepping specifics about pain, duration, and intensity, possibly to avoid revealing true severity or due to limited expressive skills. - Minimization behaviors: Heavy reliance on vague phrases (\"No good,\" \"Help\") suggests downplaying the complexity of their condition. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"body heavy, hard to breathe\" could exaggerate sensations but may also accurately reflect their overwhelming experience, complicating interpretation. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The minimal elaboration and brief responses imply possible discomfort with detailed discussion or shame about their inability to cope. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are straightforward and consistent; no evidence suggests confusion. - Family influence: No explicit signs indicate external influence; responses appear internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is **minimization coupled with sensory overload amplification**, as they avoid precise descriptions but communicate distress primarily through stereotyped phrases. - Severity: **Severe**, because the communication is limited and stereotyped, indicating significant expressive impairment and potential underreporting. - Areas most affected: The detailed assessment of symptoms like pain, duration, and severity is compromised; subjective reports likely underestimate actual condition. - Reliability: Low to moderate; the patient\u2019s limited language and stereotyped responses mean their self-reports should be supplemented with behavioral observations and collateral information if possible.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about the severity, duration, and context of symptoms are probably not fully disclosed; they rely on minimal, stereotyped cues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual pain, distress, and sensory overload may be worse than the patient indicates. - Concerns probably amplified: The urgent tone (\"Help\") and distress signals suggest intense suffering possibly underrepresented in their words. - True timeline: The progression over the week might be more rapid or severe than indicated, due to limited expressive ability hindering accurate reporting."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought reasoning, I'll analyze the patient's responses across several layers.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient\u2019s language is notably minimal and repetitive, with phrases like \"no good,\" \"too loud,\" \"too bright,\" and \"help... help...\". There\u2019s a tendency to use vague descriptors (\"feels worse,\" \"stay long time\") rather than specific details about the sensory experiences or duration. The consistent use of distress words like \"heavy\" and \"hard to breathe\" indicates emotional intensity but lacks precise quantification. The patient avoids detailed descriptions, possibly to minimize perceived severity or because of communication limitations. The language portrays a high level of distress but is non-specific, perhaps reflecting discomfort in elaborating or a tendency to stay within safe emotional bounds.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: The responses are uniformly short, limited, and repetitive, especially when asked about specifics\u2014e.g., \u201cNo, no good... always loud, bright. Sometimes noise, sometimes light, makes it worse.\u201d This suggests reluctance to elaborate, possibly to avoid drawing attention to worsening conditions or due to communication difficulty. The patient doesn't volunteer extra details unless prompted, sticking to core phrases. Responses are consistent in emotional tone but lack granularity, implying a possible underreporting of the severity or specific details.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: There are clear signs of information withholding\u2014minimal elaboration and repeated use of collective statements\u2014suggesting discomfort sharing detailed sensations. The downplaying of the worsening (\"no control,\" \"stays long time,\" \"doesn't go away\") could indicate minimization or an inability to express the true extent of suffering. There's no direct evidence of exaggeration; rather, the consistent brevity and vagueness point toward protective withholding. Signs of shame or embarrassment appear limited but could be subtle given the communication style. No evidence of confusion or inconsistency directly; responses align across questions.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The primary bias seems to be underreporting or minimization due to communication style, emotional discomfort, or both. The severity appears 'moderate'\u2014the patient expresses significant distress but limits details, possibly hiding the full extent of symptoms. Most biased areas involve detailed sensory and emotional impact assessments; the patient\u2019s tendency to keep descriptions vague lessens the reliability of their account. Due to communication barriers, self-reporting is likely not fully reliable.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Likely, the patient is experiencing more severe sensory overload and emotional distress than openly admits. The symptoms are probably worse than reported, especially in terms of intensity and duration. Some concern about worsening is genuine, but the patient may be underestimating or concealing the full degree of impairment to avoid appearing overwhelmed or to maintain a sense of control. The true timeline suggests a more rapid or severe progression than conveyed, given the minimal elaboration and persistent distress.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses primarily vague, minimal phrases (\"no good,\" \"always loud\") with few specifics. There's emotional weight but limited clinical detail. Responses are repetitive, indicating difficulty elaborating or a desire to limit emotional exposure. - Information flow: The flow is reluctant and minimal; the patient withholds details unless prompted, and responses are mostly short, directly conforming to the questions asked. - Response style: The responses are minimal, repetitive, and emotionally charged without elaboration. The patient avoids specifics, possibly to prevent further distress or due to communication limitations.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistently brief responses, avoiding specifics about timing or sensory details, suggest intentional or compulsive withholding. - Minimization behaviors: The patient downplays the severity (\"no good,\" \"stays long time\") despite clear distress signals, pointing to possible minimization or discomfort in expressing the full severity. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s little evidence of exaggeration; distress seems genuine but underreported. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited; the patient appears to prioritize concealment via brevity rather than overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs; responses are consistent but minimal. - Family influence: No direct evidence, though reliance on limited language may be influenced by pre-existing reliance on caregivers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be minimization compounded by expressive limitations, possibly combined with emotional discomfort or trauma-related suppression. - Severity: Moderate; this bias impacts the completeness and accuracy of self-reporting, although distress is evident. - Areas most affected: Sensory symptom details and severity, emotional state descriptions, duration of symptoms. - Reliability: Limited; responses are likely conservative and underrepresent actual severity due to communication style and possible emotional factors.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise sensory experiences, the true intensity and duration of overload, and full emotional impact are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient's self-report suggests less severe symptoms than they are experiencing\u2014particularly the impact of sensory overload and physical distress. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s expressed fear and distress are genuine; however, their reluctance may lead to underestimation of the urgency or severity of their condition. - True timeline: The progression may be more rapid or severe than reported, as the patient has difficulty elaborating on the course, possibly underestimating or concealing the escalation.  In summary, the patient's responses exhibit moderate minimization bias, heavily influenced by communication limitations and emotional distress, leading to underreporting of actual severity, particularly around sensory overload and physical distress."
