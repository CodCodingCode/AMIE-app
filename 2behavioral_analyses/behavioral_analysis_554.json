    "analysis": "THINKING: This patient describes severe chest and back pain with a sudden onset, using some emphasis on the severity (\"really bad,\" \"tearing, like a ripping feeling,\" \"can't breathe properly\"). His language is direct and specific regarding the pain characteristics, which suggests some level of clarity and honesty. However, given the context of a potentially life-threatening dissection, I should consider whether there's any minimization or exaggeration.  Analyzing his description, he reports an abrupt start and persistent pain, along with symptoms like weakness and shortness of breath. His responses appear straightforward,; he does not use vague or overly emotional language. Yet, his primarily stoic personality might influence how much emotion or distress he displays outwardly. The fact that he's focused on physical symptoms and their severity indicates a conscious effort to convey urgency.  Potential behavioral patterns to consider include whether he's withholding any relevant history or minimizing less obvious symptoms, or overly emphasizing certain aspects out of anxiety or concern. His brief, focused response suggests he is volunteering pertinent details readily, aligning with his straightforward personality, but I should note any signs of hesitancy or downplaying.  In terms of biases, there might be some tendency to minimize less dramatic symptoms or a hesitance to discuss related psychosocial factors, but given the immediate concern and his detailed response, his communication appears relatively transparent. Still, his stoicism could lead to understated emotional display or reluctance to share fears, which would need to be considered in assessment.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He uses specific and clinical descriptors (\"tearing, ripping feeling,\" \"suddenly,\" \"hasn't gone away\"), indicating a straightforward communication style. There is minimal emotional verbosity, consistent with his stoic personality. He emphasizes severity clearly, which is appropriate given the context. - Information flow: He presents his symptoms coherently and voluntarily, suggesting openness about his physical experience. However, he tends to focus only on his primary complaints and does not volunteer additional context unless prompted, indicating a preference for direct communication aligned with his personality. - Response style: His responses are concise and focused, with little elaboration beyond describing current symptoms. He answers directly and avoids tangential topics unless asked, reflecting a practical, no-nonsense approach.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is limited evidence of withholding information; he provides details about his symptom onset, nature, and associated weakness, though he may be less forthcoming about psychosocial factors or past health details. - Minimization behaviors: No clear signs of symptom minimization are evident; he emphasizes severity and urgency, which suggests honesty about how serious he perceives his condition. - Amplification patterns: He does not seem to be exaggerating\u2014his description aligns with typical symptoms of a serious vascular event. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None apparent; he discusses his symptoms straightforwardly. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of disorganized responses or inconsistencies. - Family influence: No indications that responses are affected by others; he appears to be describing his own perception.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely low; his detailed, direct descriptions suggest accurate self-reporting. If any bias exists, it may be slight underreporting of emotional distress due to stoicism. - Severity: Mild; his communication is largely reliable, though subtle personality traits might slightly limit emotional sharing. - Areas most affected: Emotional expression and psychosocial context (e.g., fears, concerns) might be understated, but physical symptom reporting appears robust. - Reliability: Generally high; his responses align with clinical expectations for this presentation, though confirmation with observational cues and collateral information is advisable.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of emotional anxiety or psychosocial stressors related to his health, and history of prior health issues beyond what he states. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident here; he describes symptoms as severe and urgent. - Concerns probably amplified: Not specifically indicated; his descriptions do not seem exaggerated, but his stoic personality could conceal some worry. - True timeline: The patient reports a sudden onset, which aligns with typical acute events; his description suggests an accurate perception of rapid symptom development.  Overall, his communication appears honest and direct, providing essential clinical information. Nonetheless, remaining attentive to subtle understatements of emotional distress or psychosocial factors is advisable."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient does not explicitly minimize symptoms; instead, he emphasizes severity with phrases like \"terrible pain\" and \"so intense.\" There are no keywords indicating downplaying. - Amplifying language: Strong descriptors such as \"terrible,\" \"so intense,\" and \"like a ripping, tearing feeling\" suggest he perceives the pain as severe. The use of \"the worst\" or \"excruciating\" would reinforce this, but he prefers vivid but slightly restrained descriptors. - Vague language: The patient mostly uses specific descriptions (\"sharp, stabbing pain,\" \"popping up out of nowhere\") but avoids overly technical language, maintaining straightforward, experiential descriptions. - Emotional language: There's evident fear and distress, especially with phrases like \"I feel pretty weak,\" \"like I might pass out,\" and \"I just want it to stop,\" indicating emotional tension.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise and directly aligned with questions. He provides enough detail but not verbose. - Directness: He answers questions straightforwardly, though he sometimes emphasizes the suddenness and severity, possibly to underscore urgency. - Information volunteering: He only offers additional details when prompted, signaling a response pattern of providing basic info unless extended by questions. - Consistency: His descriptions of pain are consistent across responses, emphasizing severity and sudden onset.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; he openly discusses key symptoms when asked. - Minimization behaviors: No apparent downplaying; he describes symptoms with intensity matching typical alarm signs. - Amplification patterns: He accentuates the severity with detailed vivid descriptions, possibly to ensure the seriousness is recognized. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; responses are factual and emotionally open regarding symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; the timeline and symptoms are consistent and clear. - Family influence: Slightly \"lives alone, no children nearby,\" but no signs that others influence responses or cause hesitation.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal bias; the patient seems honest but may be focused on emphasizing symptoms. - Severity level: Mild; no evidence of deceit or denial, but possibly a tendency to highlight symptoms sharply. - Areas most affected: No marked bias in symptom description; likely accurate portrayal. - Reliability: High; his straightforwardness suggests truthful self-reporting during this presentation.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Slightly, he does not mention prior episodes or other relevant details such as prior similar pain; might underreport past symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: He appears to acknowledge severity accurately, so unlikely underreporting. - Concerns probably amplified: He seems genuinely distressed but not over-worried; his emphasis on severity suggests a desire to be taken seriously rather than exaggerate. - True timeline: Reported onset (\"about an hour ago\") is probably accurate given the consistency; no signs of distortion.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific, vivid descriptions to convey severity, with emotional influence evident in words like \"terrible,\" \"so intense,\" and \"tear,\" \"ripping.\" - Information flow: He is generally forthcoming but tends to wait for direct questions before elaborating, indicating a straightforward, organized pattern. - Response style: Responses are concise and relevant, without tangential information, reflecting a practical communication style.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding; responses align with typical clinical descriptions. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; he accurately emphasizes severity rather than downplay. - Amplification patterns: Slightly more detailed descriptions of pain severity could serve to amplify perceived urgency, but this appears genuine. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None; he's open about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent; his timeline and descriptions are consistent. - Family influence: None evident; responses suggest independence in reporting.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: None strongly indicated; his responses appear factual and appropriately detailed. - Severity: Mild; no substantial distortion or bias, just a focus on emphasizing symptoms. - Areas most affected: Not applicable, as responses are consistent and believable. - Reliability: High; his straightforward approach supports trusting his self-reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possibly small details like prior episodes or related health concerns, but overall, his report seems complete regarding current symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Unlikely; he emphasizes pain severity convincingly. - Concerns probably amplified: Slightly, his focus on pain intensity suggests a desire to ensure his condition is taken seriously. - True timeline: Likely accurate; the consistency indicates the onset about an hour ago is reliable."

    "analysis": "THINKING: In analyzing the patient responses, I need to consider both their language and response behaviors to identify any signs of bias or withholding. They describe severe, life-threatening symptoms in straightforward terms, which suggests honesty rather than minimization. However, their brief responses and lack of elaboration might indicate emotional discomfort or a tendency toward stoicism. The fact that they answer directly to questions about their pain with clear descriptions indicates a willingness to share critical information, but they avoid discussing specifics about eye symptoms, which could signal discomfort or embarrassment. The consistency in narrative suggests no deception, but any hesitance might reflect emotional strain or protective bias. The overall tone suggests they are focused on their severe physical symptoms rather than psychological or peripheral details, but their direct disclosures imply a level of trust in the medical setting.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs specific and clinical descriptions for symptoms (e.g., \"tearing pain,\" \"sharp, stabbing\") indicating an attempt to communicate clearly about their physical state. They avoid vague or emotional language for their primary complaints, which suggests a straightforward, pragmatic communication style. When discussing eye symptoms, they downplay or omit detail, perhaps out of discomfort or embarrassment. Their responses are mostly concise and direct, avoiding tangential details.  - Information flow: The patient quickly volunteers critical symptoms related to pain and breathing, indicating a focus on life-threatening issues. They tend to withhold detailed explanations about less severe or non-critical symptoms (such as eye-related issues), possibly due to discomfort or perceiving these as less relevant. Their organization in responses shows a tendency to stick to essential points, especially about the pain onset and severity.  - Response style: Responses are predominantly brief but focused; they tend to be straightforward, providing essential details when asked. They do not elaborate much on background unless prompted, likely reflecting a practical rather than expressive style. Their answer about symptom onset is concise, aligning with their stoic trait, but under stressful circumstances, they do not demonstrate elaboration beyond what is necessary.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient does not volunteer details about eye symptoms unless specifically asked, which might reflect discomfort or embarrassment. They avoid mention of eye redness or swelling, possibly because these are less urgent or they feel self-conscious discussing them.  - Minimization behaviors: Not prominently evident; they describe their symptoms as severe and life-threatening, using strong language (\"torn, ripping pain,\" \"getting worse\"). Their descriptions do not indicate minimization.  - Amplification patterns: The patient doesn't appear to exaggerate; their descriptions are consistent with serious symptoms and match typical presentation. Their concern about the severity suggests honest communication, not amplification for attention.  - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance to discuss eye details could indicate embarrassment or discomfort with discussing non-pain symptoms, possibly feeling they are irrelevant or stigmatized.  - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; their timeline is clear (\"started about an hour ago,\" \"came out of nowhere\"). No inconsistencies are present.  - Family influence: No explicit signs of family influence affecting responses; their responses seem self-contained and consistent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be neutral, with minimal evidence of defensive withholding or minimization. The patient seems honest about critical symptoms but avoids certain topics possibly due to discomfort.  - Severity: Mild, since their core symptom descriptions are consistent and detailed enough for clinical evaluation. The subtle tendency to omit less relevant details indicates a minor bias.  - Areas most affected: The eye-related symptoms are most biased or understated\u2014likely due to discomfort or perceived irrelevance, which may hinder comprehensive assessment of all possible symptoms.  - Reliability: Overall, their report seems reasonably reliable regarding their severe symptoms; however, minor underreporting of less urgent issues suggests a need for careful probing to ensure completeness.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about eye symptoms or other minor symptoms might not be shared fully, possibly underplayed due to embarrassment or perceived insignificance.  - Symptoms probably minimized: They may be downplaying or omitting eye symptoms, which could be relevant for differential diagnoses involving ocular signs of systemic disease or hypertensive retinopathy.  - Concerns probably amplified: Their focus on severe physical pain is appropriate given their presentation; no over-worrying is apparent, but anxiety regarding their health may be understated.  - True timeline: Based on their response, the pain onset is sudden and recent, which aligns with their report. There is no indication of delayed reporting, and their narrative appears consistent and accurate.  **Overall,** the patient shows honest reporting of critical symptoms with minor hesitations possibly due to discomfort. Trusting their descriptions of pain and onset is reasonable, but careful inquiry into peripheral or less obvious symptoms should be maintained to avoid missing additional clinical clues."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states \"just this terrible pain\" and \"didn't last very long,\" suggesting an attempt to downplay the duration or severity of certain symptoms like eye discomfort. - Amplifying language: Phrases like \"terrible pain\" and \"really bad\" indicate the patient is emphasizing the pain to convey urgency and distress. - Vague language: Words such as \"kind of blurry,\" \"like a little weird,\" and \"maybe\" show some uncertainty or hesitance in describing eye symptoms, possibly indicating a lack of clarity or discomfort in detailing them. - Emotional language: Words like \"terrible\" and \"really bad\" reflect significant distress; awareness of some worry but the language remains mostly straightforward and practical.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise, typically one to two sentences, but include additional details when directly questioned, indicating a tendency to answer minimally unless prompted. - Directness: They tend to answer questions directly but are cautious, often qualifying responses with \"maybe\" or \"not sure,\" possibly to avoid overstatement. - Information volunteering: The patient waits for questions and offers minimal details unsolicited. They do not volunteer extra symptoms unless explicitly asked. - Consistency: Responses are generally consistent with their prior descriptions\u2014symptoms starting suddenly, severity, and timeline\u2014showing reliability in recalling the main events.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight vagueness about eye symptoms suggests possible hesitancy or uncertainty about the full scope of symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Describing eye symptoms as \"maybe\" and \"didn't last very long\" suggests an attempt to downplay or minimize these issues, perhaps because they seem less critical compared to chest pain. - Amplification patterns: The patient emphasizes the severity of chest pain (\"terrible,\" \"really bad\") possibly to alert urgency, but does not exaggerate beyond their discomfort. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal signs; the patient appears straightforward and pragmatic, with no evident discomfort about discussing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguities (\"kind of blurry,\" \"like a little weird\") could indicate mild uncertainty or difficulty in precise description, but overall recall seems intact. - Family influence: Limited evidence; responses seem individual and self-reliant, with no external influence apparent.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight minimization regarding eye symptoms and possible vagueness about their timing and nature. - Severity level: Mild; the patient remains mostly honest about the main symptoms and timeline but shows some hesitation and vagueness, especially about the eye issues. - Areas most affected: The description of eye symptoms and their impact is somewhat biased by uncertainty, which could obscure the true extent. - Reliability: Generally reliable for main symptoms like chest pain and onset timeline; however, details about eye symptoms may be underreported or seen as less important.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may be withholding or minimizing ocular or visual symptoms, potentially neglecting subtle or evolving visual issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Eye symptoms, as the patient describes them briefly and tentatively, might be more significant than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: The focus on chest pain and the active description of that pain suggests the patient\u2019s primary concern is urgent cardiovascular issues, which is appropriate; there\u2019s little evidence of over-worry about other symptoms. - True timeline: The reported onset appears consistent, but the vagueness about eye symptoms indicates the actual experience might involve more noticeable or persistent visual disturbances that the patient perceives as minor or unrelated.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs straightforward and somewhat emotional descriptors (\"terrible,\" \"really bad\") for the chest pain, signaling genuine distress. However, for eye symptoms, language becomes more vague (\"maybe,\" \"kind of blurry\"), indicating uncertainty or an attempt to downplay. - Information flow: Responses are mostly organized, but primarily reactive\u2014patient answers directly to questions but does not volunteer additional info unless prompted, especially about ocular issues. They seem to hold back details about eye symptoms, possibly due to uncertainty or minimizing their importance. - Response style: The responses tend to be concise, with an emphasis on key symptoms, but include qualifying phrases that suggest hesitance or mild ambiguity. The pattern indicates reliance on structured answering rather than spontaneous elaboration.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of \"maybe\" and uncertainty about eye symptoms suggests some reluctance to fully disclose the extent of ocular issues, possibly to avoid worry or because they are unsure of their significance. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions of eye symptoms as \"didn't last very long\" and \"maybe\" point to downplaying or underestimating potential relevance, which could mask ongoing or worsening visual problems. - Amplification patterns: The emphasis on chest pain (\"terrible,\" \"really bad\") confirms perceived urgency and distress; no signs of exaggeration beyond their subjective pain. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The patient appears open yet cautious, with no clear evidence of shame or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about timing (\"around the same time\") and nature of eye symptoms suggests mild uncertainty but overall adequate recall. - Family influence: No evident external influence; responses appear independent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias with slight vagueness about ocular symptoms, likely reflecting either uncertainty or downplaying non-cardiac features. - Severity: Mild; main concern over chest pain is clearly communicated, while eye symptoms are described tentatively. - Areas most affected: The ocular symptoms are the most biased topic, especially in description and perceived importance, potentially affecting clinical recognition. - Reliability: Generally high for primary symptoms like chest pain; less reliable regarding eye symptoms due to qualifier words and vagueness.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Additional details on visual disturbances, their progression, or associated symptoms may be understated or unreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Ocular symptoms might be more persistent or troubling than indicated; underreporting could delay recognition. - Concerns probably amplified: Patient seems primarily focused on the chest pain, which aligns with typical presentation; no evidence of disproportionate anxiety about the eye issues. - True timeline: The reported sequence appears consistent, but the vague description suggests there could be more ongoing ocular symptoms not fully communicated.  Overall, the patient is honest about severe, urgent symptoms but shows mild tendencies to minimize or qualify less critical symptoms, especially ocular. This may slightly obscure the full clinical picture if visual symptoms are indeed more significant or persistent than acknowledged."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes the eye symptom as \"not that bad,\" \"like a little weird,\" and \"didn\u2019t last very long,\" which suggests downplaying the severity or significance of the visual disturbance. - Amplifying language: Describes the chest pain as \"really intense, tearing\" and \"so severe I thought I was going to pass out,\" indicating emotional distress and potentially some exaggeration of how extreme the pain feels. - Vague language: Terms like \"kind of blurry or like a little weird\" and \"everything looked weird and shadowy\" are non-specific, showing some difficulty in precise description. - Emotional language: Phrases such as \"really bad,\" \"thought I was going to pass out,\" and \"kinda scared\" reveal underlying anxiety and distress.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are relatively concise when describing key symptoms but contain mild elaboration when describing emotional state; responses are likely triggered to be brief when deflecting complex explanations. - Directness: The patient answers direct questions, though response descriptions are softened or minimized, indicating some resistance to emphasizing severity. - Information volunteering: They mostly wait to be asked for details, only offering minimal additional info about their visual disturbance, suggesting possible reluctance to fully disclose or a tendency toward limited elaboration. - Consistency: Responses about eye symptoms are consistent: brief, vague, and downplaying severity, maintaining a pattern across questions.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient underreports the severity (e.g., \"not that bad,\" \"not much\"), possibly concealing that neurological symptoms may be more significant. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"not that bad\" and \"only lasted a little while\" minimizes the eye disturbance, potentially underplaying neurological concern. - Amplification patterns: Describes chest pain as \"really intense, tearing,\" aligning with typical dissection pain, thus not minimizing the severity here. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the brief and non-specific account of visual symptoms could suggest discomfort discussing neurological issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; responses are coherent and consistent regarding symptom timeline. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but estranged family situation may influence reluctance to elaborate or seek reassurance.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias dominates\u2014patient downplays neurological symptoms (\"not that bad,\" \"only lasted a little while\") despite being in a serious medical situation. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014this bias could lead to underassessment of neurological signs, risking incomplete evaluation of neurological compromise. - Areas most affected: Neurological symptoms and their significance are most biased, given the superficial description. - Reliability assessment: Moderate\u2014while the patient provides consistent responses, the downplaying behaviors suggest some details are likely understated, thus limiting full reliability.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient probably underreports the severity or extent of visual and neurological symptoms, possibly missing signs of more serious neurological compromise. - Symptoms probably minimized: Neurological deficits (weakness, numbness) may be more severe than acknowledged; the brief description suggests underestimation. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about the symptoms is evident, but their actual clinical significance might be understated; they may be over-worried about minor issues. - True timeline: The progression appears rapid and severe, consistent with a dissection, but patient descriptions tend to minimize the duration or intensity of neurological disturbances.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and minimizing language (\"not that bad,\" \"a little weird\") when describing neuro-visual symptoms, which suggests an attempt to soften or downplay potential severity; in contrast, pain descriptions are vivid and emotionally charged. - Information flow: Tends to answer questions directly but with minimal detail, often withholding fuller explanations about neurological symptoms. Responses are organized around symptom descriptions but avoid elaboration. - Response style: Generally succinct, with selective elaboration\u2014detailed regarding pain, superficial regarding neurological signs\u2014indicating possible discomfort with discussing neurological issues or an unconscious effort to minimize their importance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Downplaying visual disturbances (\"not that bad,\" \"not much\"), suggesting reluctance to fully disclose neurological concerns that could indicate serious issues. - Minimization behaviors: Minimizing the visual symptoms' seriousness, potentially hiding extent or severity of neurological involvement. - Amplification patterns: The pain description is exaggerated (\"really intense, tearing\"), consistent with typical aortic dissection pain\u2014likely accurate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but brief discussion of neurological symptoms might reflect discomfort or uncertainty about their importance. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant evidence; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Limited, but estranged from family might influence less external input or reassurance-seeking, possibly contributing to self-minimization.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, mainly regarding neurological/visual symptoms, to avoid alarming or due to discomfort. - Severity: Moderate, since underreporting of neurological signs could impair full clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: The neurological/visual symptom area, with responses indicating possible underestimation or concealment of severity. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014 while responses are coherent, the bias toward minimizing critical neurological information reduces trustworthiness of full self-report.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully disclosing the severity and duration of neurological or visual symptoms, risking unnoticed neurological deficits. - Symptoms probably minimized: The extent of neurological compromise could be more severe than conveyed, especially if they are reluctant to describe ongoing or worsening symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety levels appear high, but their perceptions may be skewed to minimize or avoid alarming the provider. - True timeline: The clinical progression is likely rapid and severe, consistent with dissection, but patient descriptions tend to understate the neurological impact and its progression."
