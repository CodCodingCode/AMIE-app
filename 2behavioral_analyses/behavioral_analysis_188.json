    "analysis": "THINKING: STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: The patient uses specific descriptive phrases such as \"discomfort,\" \"dull ache,\" and \"bothering me more lately,\" which suggests a degree of concern but not extreme distress. Her language is relatively measured but includes emotional words like \"worried\" and questions about \"could this be serious\" and \"will it affect my sight permanently,\" indicating anxiety about the seriousness of her symptoms. She minimizes the impact by describing her discomfort as a \"little worse\" and emphasizing the mildness of symptoms (\"not too bad yet\") but also shows some amplification with her worries about vision loss. STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: She provides a fairly structured response, offering a timeline (\"about a week ago\") and describing symptom characteristics (dull ache, slight blurriness, tiny specks). She volunteers details about her history and current symptoms without much prompting, indicating an open communication style but with underlying concern. Her responses are generally direct but include some emotional qualifiers that may reflect her anxieties. She does not overly elaborate beyond her main concerns, indicating some restraint. STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Signs of information withholding are minimal; she readily shares her history and current symptoms. - There\u2019s slight minimization of her symptoms (\"not too bad,\" \"little worse\") but not outright denial. - Evidence of amplification appears in her expressed worry about loss of vision and potential serious consequences, which may reflect heightening her concern beyond clinical risk. - Her nervous behaviors\u2014glancing around, slight squinting or rubbing\u2014show underlying anxiety. - No clear signs of shame/shyness or memory issues are evident. - Her mention of her family history might influence her perceptions and responses. STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type appears to be anxious amplifier, with her concern about seriousness possibly leading her to overestimate the potential severity (\"Could this be serious? Will it affect my sight permanently?\"). - Severity is moderate: she is truthful but her focus on worst-case scenarios and health anxiety amplify her concerns. - The most affected areas are her perception of symptom severity and potential outcomes, which may be exaggerated. - Reliability is reasonable but should be interpreted with caution; her reported fears might color her perception of symptom progression. STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Likely missing information: she might be underreporting the actual severity or duration of symptoms, particularly if she is anxious about worsening. She may also understate the duration or ignore some symptoms she dismisses as minor. - Symptoms probably minimized: she states symptoms are \"not too bad,\" but objective findings could be more severe, given her concern about vision loss. - Concerns probably amplified: her significant worry about permanent damage suggests an overestimation of risk, driven by her anxiety. - True timeline: her described progression seems plausible but her focus on deterioration may overemphasize the worsening trend or her perception of how quickly it has worsened.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices reveal a balance between descriptive clarity and emotional concern. She uses specific symptom descriptions, which helps communication but also shows underlying anxiety. Her response style is largely direct and organized, volunteering relevant details without excessive tangents. She employs emotional qualifiers and expresses worries clearly, indicating a blend of honesty and heightened concern. BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Evidence of information withholding is minimal, though her focus on worst-case scenarios suggests a tendency toward catastrophic thinking. Her minimization of symptoms (\"not too bad\") may mask more serious underlying issues. Her amplification of concern about vision loss and her fears about what the symptoms mean point to health anxiety. Nervous behaviors, such as glancing around and rubbing her eye, reinforce her anxious state. Her family history may also subtly influence her perception and responses. BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - The main communication bias is health anxiety with amplification tendencies, especially regarding potential severity and outcomes. Severity is moderate\u2014her honest responses are trustable but influenced by anxiety. The most affected areas are her perceptions of symptom seriousness and risk, which could lead her to overestimate danger. Her self-reporting is generally reliable but should be interpreted with awareness that her concerns may exaggerate actual clinical risk.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing includes the true severity of her ocular condition and comprehensive details about the timeline of symptoms. She may be underplaying the clinical seriousness while focusing excessively on potential loss of sight. Symptoms might be more severe than described, considering her high level of concern, and her perception of rapid worsening may be somewhat exaggerated. Her fears of permanent damage and urgent need for treatment are likely intensified by anxiety, possibly leading to overestimation of danger."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's language and response behaviors systematically. First, I recognize from her phrases like \"just kind of been there\" and \"not that bad yet,\" a tendency to minimize or downplay her symptoms, even though she reports concern. The phrase \"kind of on the inside of my eye\" suggests vague, non-specific descriptions, possibly indicating uncertainty or discomfort with precise reporting. She also states that it has \"gotten a little worse,\" but not significantly so, which may mask more serious symptom progression.  Her responses are relatively brief but include important details. The fact that she specifically mentions worsening \"especially when I look at bright lights or at my screen\" shows some insight but also a tendency to focus on manageable or less alarming sensations. There's a pattern of reporting symptoms without elaboration on other potentially relevant signs like visual loss severity or associated systemic issues\u2014indicating possible reluctance to fully disclose or perhaps a focus only on her main concern. Her mentioning of her prior eye surgery and family history of autoimmune issues suggests some awareness, but she doesn't seem to connect her current symptoms with these histories explicitly, possibly indicating a degree of emotional distancing or subconscious minimization.  She sounds anxious, evident in her worry about losing her vision, but avoids expressing overt fear or catastrophic thoughts directly\u2014though her concern about serious outcomes is clear. Her language does not suggest embarrassment or shame but instead seems driven by genuine worry, yet her tendency to phrase symptoms as \"kind of\" or \"a little\" may serve as a psychological buffer to the seriousness she perceives.  Overall, her communication shows signs of mild to moderate symptom minimization, with an undercurrent of anxiety-driven amplification. She appears cooperative but tends toward vagueness and understatement, possibly to reduce her emotional discomfort or to avoid alarming herself further. This could impact the accuracy and completeness of her self-report, thus requiring careful clinician probing to uncover underlying concerns.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague and minimizing language, such as \"just kind of been there,\" \"not too bad yet,\" and \"a little worse.\" This creates an impression of downplaying severity. Her descriptions of sensations are non-specific and non-clinical (\"kind of on the inside of my eye,\" \"tiny spots or floaters\"), which may mask actual severity. - Information flow: She offers initial information promptly but limits additional details unless directly asked. Her responses are concise, focusing on main symptoms without elaboration, indicating a reserved or guarded communication style. She appears organized but somewhat guarded, possibly to avoid further anxiety or underreport concerns. - Response style: Her responses are primarily direct but minimally elaborated, with occasional tangential comments about her past and family, maybe to contextualize her worries but without detailed symptom description.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not explicitly hide symptoms but limits elaboration unless prompted, which could be a subtle form of withholding deeper concerns or fears. - Minimization behaviors: She consistently downplays symptom severity, using words like \"not that bad\" and \"a little worse,\" possibly minimizing more serious underlying pathology. - Amplification patterns: Her main concern about vision loss and rapid worsening suggests some anxiety amplification; she appears to over-focus on potential catastrophic outcomes despite minimizing current symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There\u2019s little overt evidence of shame or embarrassment; her tone is cooperative, and she openly discusses her history and worries. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline is consistent, though she may be uncertain about the significance of floaters. - Family influence: She references family autoimmune history but does not seem influenced by others in her responses, maintaining personal perspective.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The primary bias appears to be symptom minimization, potentially combined with anxiety amplification. She minimizes her current findings but also exhibits heightened concern about potential severity, indicating conflicting biases. - Severity: Moderate. Her tendency to minimize may lead to underestimating symptom severity, but her expressed fears could lead to overinterpretation if not accurately probed. - Areas most affected: Underreporting of actual visual disturbance severity and possible under-communicating systemic or additional ocular symptoms due to minimization. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat reliable but must be supplemented with objective examination and careful probing, as her tendency to minimize or vague over important details could impair clinical accuracy.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about the extent of visual impairment or additional symptoms such as pain intensity or vision loss. She may not fully share the severity of her discomfort or functional impact. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual severity of her eye inflammation could be worse than described, especially if she perceives the discomfort as manageable or fears alarming the clinician. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about permanent vision loss and rapid worsening might be exaggerated relative to her objective state, driven by health anxiety. - True timeline: The progression may be more rapid or severe than reported, as her tendency to minimize might mask true progression; her focus on \"a week\" and incremental worsening suggests an awareness but possibly underestimates the clinical urgency.  In sum, her communication displays moderate symptom minimization influenced by anxiety, requiring careful follow-up and probing to accurately gauge her clinical status."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze these responses systematically. First, in language analysis, I notice the patient uses words like \"just,\" \"a little,\" and \"not that bad,\" which reflect minimization of symptoms. She describes her discomfort as a \"dull ache\" and \"kinda heavy,\" which are relatively non-specific and somewhat vague descriptors. Her worries about losing her sight are expressed emocionally with phrases like \"really worried\" and \"hard not to panic,\" indicating significant emotional distress and amplification of concerns. She also mentions feeling scared she might go blind, showing overt fear and anxiety.  In response pattern analysis, she tends to provide detailed narratives when describing her symptoms, revealing a willingness to share but also possibly seeking reassurance. Her responses are fairly elaborate and consistent across questions about the onset, sensations, and impact, but she avoids explicitly discussing any other systemic symptoms or detailed history unless asked, hinting at some information withholding.  Behaviorally, she exhibits signs of anxiety amplification: she reports her eye feels \"kinda heavy,\" \"worrisome,\" and her worry about worsening or losing vision is prominent. Her statements about \"panicking,\" \"hard not to,\" and fearing the worst suggest her anxiety may be magnified, perhaps overestimating the severity.  The severity of these biases seems moderate. Her focus on worst-case scenarios, along with vague symptom descriptions and emotional language, indicates she is perhaps over-emphasizing the seriousness relative to objective findings, but she is cooperative and forthcoming enough to suggest some reliability.  Clinically, I conclude that she may be downplaying some physical signs (e.g., no redness or discharge she reports) but is over-worrying about potential outcomes, which could distort her perception of the actual risk.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague descriptors like \"kinda,\" \"a little,\" and \"just,\" suggesting possible minimization of symptom severity. Emotional phrases such as \"hard not to panic\" and \"really worried\" indicate heightened concern. Her language blends clinical description with emotional expression, highlighting anxiety amplification. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer basic details but withholds specific medical history unless prompted, indicating mild reluctance or perhaps hesitance to share certain fears openly. Her responses are organized and elaborative, reflecting an attempt to clarify her worries, but she may still hold back elaboration on her fears. - Response style: She responds with detailed narratives when asked about her sensations and impact, but tends to avoid explicit mention of systemic issues or deeper history unless questioned, possibly to minimize perceived severity or embarrassment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not mention recent injury or trauma to this eye, which could be relevant; this may reflect reluctance to fully disclose or recall details, possibly due to worry or downplaying. - Minimization behaviors: Describing her symptoms as \"not that bad\" or \"kind of\" indicates she\u2019s downplaying the severity, despite expressing concern. - Amplification patterns: She repeatedly emphasizes her fears about losing her vision, \"hard not to panic,\" and \"really worried,\" showing an over-exaggeration of potential consequences. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs of shame, but her tendency to minimize symptoms and focus on worst-case scenarios may reflect discomfort with vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline from onset to current state is consistent. - Family influence: She mentions her family has autoimmune issues but doesn\u2019t express concern about familial influence on her responses; it\u2019s possible her worries are internally driven rather than externally influenced.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification, as evidenced by her over-worrying, emotionally charged language, and exaggeration of potential outcomes. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 she is somewhat exaggerating concerns but still provides relevant information and is cooperative. - Areas most affected: Her concern about permanent vision loss and disease severity are most biased, with statements like \"hard not to panic\" and \"worried about losing my sight,\" which may overstate her actual clinical risk. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat trustworthy but is heavily colored by anxiety, which may lead her to overestimate symptom severity or risk.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully disclosing specific details such as trauma history about this eye or other systemic symptoms, which could influence diagnosis and management. - Symptoms probably minimized: She downplays physical signs like redness or discharge that could suggest infection or inflammation severity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about permanent vision loss are likely overestimated, driven by emotional distress. - True timeline: The progression seems accurate given her description, but her perception of urgency and danger may be exaggerated, possibly overreacting to her symptoms."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's language and response patterns systematically. First, I note her use of minimizing language (\"just this dull ache,\" \"not that bad\"), which suggests she might be downplaying her symptoms. Second, she describes her discomfort as a \"dull, terrible ache\" and is very worried about losing her sight, indicating amplified concern or anxiety. Her responses are fairly detailed but show signs of emotional distress, with focus on potential severity (\"worst,\" \"terrible disease,\" \"might go blind\"). She appears responsive but her tone and emphasis hint at underlying anxiety amplification and possibly some information withholding\u2014likely avoiding acknowledging more severe or unknown symptoms she fears might be worse. The focus on worst-case scenarios and her reluctance to suggest sharp pain or injury despite her history is a sign she might be amplifying her worries. Her detailed narrative about her fears and vulnerability suggests her primary bias is anxiety amplification, possibly reinforced by her medical history and family background.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: \"just this dull ache,\" \"not that bad,\" which may hide the true severity. - Amplifying language: \"terrible ache,\" \"worried I might lose my sight forever,\" which escalates concern. - Vague language: \"kind of on the inside of my eye,\" \"a little worse,\" which deflects specifics. - Emotional language: expressing fear of blindness and worry about disease, indicating high anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She gives detailed answers when describing feelings, indicating openness, but her emphasis on worst fears suggests amplification. - Directness: She shifts from factual descriptions to expressing fears, indicating emotional magnification. - Volunteering info: She volunteers her fears and family background but minimizes physical sensations so as not to alarm. - Consistency: Consistent in emphasizing her worries about severity and progression.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She avoids mentioning sharp pain or foreign body sensation, possibly minimizing possible trauma. - Minimization behaviors: Describes discomfort as only \"this dull ache,\" downplaying possible severity. - Amplification patterns: Emphasizes fears about permanent vision loss and disease\u2014likely overestimating danger. - Embarrassment/shame: Not apparent. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence. - Family influence: Mentions autoimmune family history, possibly heightening her health anxiety.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification, as she focuses heavily on worst-case scenarios and fears. - Severity: Moderate to severe; her intense fear about blindness and overestimation of danger suggest significant distortion. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and potential outcomes. - Reliability: Self-report likely influenced by anxiety, so some symptoms may be exaggerated, although her actual physical sensations seem mild.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport specific signs of trauma or more severe symptoms she fears admitting, and might avoid mentioning worsenings or particular distressing details. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be downplaying signs of significant inflammation or trauma, like sharp pain or foreign body sensation. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about blindness and disease may be overexaggerated, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent with her report, but her focus on worst-case outcomes can distort her perception of urgency.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses understated descriptions (\"just a dull ache\") paired with intense emotional expressions (\"terrible,\" \"worried I might lose my sight\"), indicating emotional amplification with some minimization. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about fears and family history but downplays physical sensations, possibly to avoid alarming herself or others. - Response style: She provides detailed emotional context but may shift focus from physical symptoms to fears, suggesting a tendency to amplify concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Avoids discussing sharp pain or traumatic injury signs in detail, possibly to not confronting more acute issues. - Minimization behaviors: Describes symptoms as mild, even while emphasizing her fears, likely underplaying physical severity. - Amplification patterns: Over-emphasizes the worst potential outcomes, such as total vision loss, reflecting significant anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame: No clear signs. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: Noted family autoimmune history may contribute to health-related anxiety and worry.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification, with her focus on fears of blindness and severity influencing her perception. - Severity: Moderate to severe, since her fears strongly color her report and might distort the actual clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Her perceived threat level and symptom severity. - Reliability: Moderate; her reports of sensations are plausible but colored by emotional distress, necessitating careful clinical correlation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might avoid sharing or fully acknowledging severity signs like sharp pain, or be reluctant to admit worsening despite her fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs of inflammation or trauma may be underreported due to her focus on fears. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about blindness and disease is likely overestimated, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: The progression is plausible, but her heightened emotional state can distort perception of rate and severity of symptoms."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states \"it\u2019s just this dull ache,\" \"probably nothing,\" \"not that bad,\" which suggests an effort to downplay severity. - Amplifying language: She explicitly worries about \"losing my sight forever,\" \"something really bad,\" and \"serious or something that could make me lose my sight,\" indicating high anxiety and possible exaggeration of potential outcomes. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of on the inside,\" \"like a curtain might be trying to come down,\" and \"probably nothing\" reflect non-specific or uncertain descriptions, which may mask true symptom severity. - Emotional language: She expresses \"really worried,\" \"so scared,\" and \"distrusts\" her own perception, showing emotional distress linked to her health fears.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: She provides somewhat detailed answers when describing her symptoms but tends to minimize or downplay the severity, especially when discussing pain (\"just this dull ache\") or her concern (\"probably nothing\"). - Directness: She answers straightforwardly but filters her responses with reassurance that symptoms are likely benign, despite her expressed worries. - Information volunteering: She mainly shares what is asked but avoids mentioning any visual disturbances that could seem more threatening, perhaps due to discomfort or wish to downplay. - Consistency: Her responses about absence of flashes or shadows are consistent, but her language about \"curtain\" sensations indicates an ambiguous perception she may be anxious about.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: She does not mention recent trauma or specific causes for her symptoms beyond general activities, possibly withholding details about potential triggers. - Minimization behaviors: Calling her discomfort \"just a dull ache\" and \"probably nothing\" suggests she minimizes her symptoms, intentionally or unconsciously, to avoid alarm. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of \"worried about losing my sight forever\" and \"could be serious\" indicate she is amplifying her perceived risk, possibly to elicit care or due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her effort to reassure (\"probably nothing\") might reflect discomfort or denial about severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion, but her descriptions lack clarity about specific visual changes, possibly indicating uncertainty or anxiety-related fog. - Family influence: She mentions her family\u2019s autoimmune background, which could amplify her health concerns and anxiety.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification, as evidenced by her overemphasis on severe outcomes, particularly fears of blindness, despite reports of mild symptoms. - Severity level: Moderate to severe; her anxiety appears to distort her perception of risk, potentially influencing her symptom reporting. - Areas most affected: Her perception of the visual symptoms (curtain, dimming, floaters) and fear of permanent damage are most biased, likely magnifying her actual clinical risk. - Reliability assessment: Some degree of distortion exists; her self-reported fears are heightened relative to her actual described symptoms, indicating cautious interpretation needed.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might withhold or underreport actual visual changes or sudden flashes, possibly because she finds them distressing to mention or feels embarrassed. - Symptoms probably minimized: She downplays pain (\"dull ache\") and the urgency, yet she fears serious consequences; actual symptoms like flashes or shadowing could be more pronounced. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of total vision loss and blindness are likely exaggerating her actual risk, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but her intense worry may make her perceive symptoms as more severe or worsening than they truly are.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotional wording, such as \"kind of\" and \"probably nothing,\" which downplays her symptoms, while also expressing intense fears about vision loss. For example, \"it\u2019s just this dull ache\" suggests minimization, whereas \"worried about losing my sight forever\" indicates amplified concern. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming but filters her responses with reassurance, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. She provides specific symptom descriptions when asked, but avoids mentioning certain visual phenomena like flashes, which may be more distressing. - Response style: Her responses blend elaboration on her fears with a tendency to downplay physical sensations, reflecting internal conflict. She appears anxious but cooperative, sharing details that confirm her worries while also attempting to reassure herself and others.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She omits mentioning any flashes or sudden visual changes, which are clinically significant, possibly to avoid alarming herself or because she is reluctant to face more severe symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Calling her pain \"just this dull ache\" and affirming \"probably nothing\" demonstrate an effort to downplay the severity, perhaps to cope with her anxiety or to avoid escalation. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated fears of becoming blind \"forever\" and that her symptoms \"could be serious\" suggest she is magnifying potential dangers beyond what clinical evidence may support, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her efforts to reassure the clinician about symptom severity may indicate discomfort discussing her real fears or denying seriousness. - Confusion/memory issues: No notable issues, but her description of visual symptoms like \"curtain\" or \"dimness\" seems conflated with her emotional reaction. - Family influence: Her mention of autoimmune family history appears to heighten her health anxiety, contributing to her exaggerated concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification, as she holds an intense fear of blindness and dramatic visual loss, likely overstating her risk despite mild symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, because her fears significantly influence her communication, potentially skewing clinical interpretation. - Areas most affected: Her perceptions of visual disturbances (curtain, dimming) and fears of blindness are most biased and may not accurately reflect her clinical status. Her underreporting of specific symptoms like flashes might also bias the assessment. - Reliability: While her report contains genuine concern, her emotional bias suggests that her fears may be overestimated relative to her actual symptoms, requiring careful corroboration with clinical findings.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully reporting sudden flashes, shadows, or drops in vision, which are critical for diagnosing retinal detachment or other urgent issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her reassurance that symptoms are \"probably nothing\" could mask more severe phenomena like flashes or curtain effects she is reluctant to report. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of irreversible blindness is likely exaggerated by her anxiety, which may distort her perception of symptom severity. - True timeline: Her symptom onset appears consistent but emotionally charged, possibly making her perceive an insidious worsening that isn't clinically present; her real concern is the fear of catastrophic loss and the difficulty in managing her anxiety."
