    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought reasoning:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient uses strong descriptive terms like \"terrible\" and \"intense,\" which suggests genuine distress rather than minimization. There\u2019s no evident minimization language like \"not that bad\" or \"just a little.\" The description is vivid and aligns with serious symptoms. - Amplifying language: Words such as \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and \"almost unbearable\" indicate significant distress but seem appropriate given the severity described. No overt exaggeration beyond plausible expression. - Vague language: The patient mostly provides specific descriptions, such as \"sharp pain,\" \"tearing inside,\" and \"cold and numb\" leg, which suggests clarity rather than vagueness. - Emotional language: Expressions like \"really scared\" and \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong\" reveal significant anxiety and fear, consistent with their distress level.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are detailed and fairly lengthy, especially regarding symptom descriptions, indicating an effort to communicate thoroughly, possibly driven by anxiety. - Directness: The patient answers directly to the initial question, sharing symptoms and history voluntarily, pointing to openness. - Information volunteering: The patient volunteers key details such as symptom onset, nature, and prior aneurysm diagnosis without prompting, which shows willingness to share but also emphasizes concern. - Consistency: The responses are consistent across the response \u2014 the timeline and severity are coherently described, with no signs of fabrication or discrepancy.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; the patient shares relevant history and symptoms fully. - Minimization behaviors: Not observed; symptoms are depicted as severe and persistent. - Amplification patterns: While the language is emotionally loaded, it aligns with actual severity rather than overstatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt indications of shame; the patient appears honest and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; timeline and symptom progression are consistent. - Family influence: No evidence suggests external influences on responses; the patient frames their experiences in a straightforward manner.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal bias detected; patient appears to report symptoms accurately, motivated by genuine concern and fear. - Severity: Mild or none; responses are consistent and detailed, with no signs of distortion. - Areas most affected: Not significantly biased; subjective experience of pain and urgency are conveyed clearly. - Reliability: High; self-reporting seems reliable based on detailed and consistent descriptions.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possibly subtle baseline functional status or previous pain episodes; the focus is on acute intense symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not applicable; symptoms are portrayed as severe, and no evidence suggests underreporting. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s emotional state probably amplifies distress but aligns with actual symptom severity. - True timeline: The rapid onset and persistent pain correspond well with their account, so the timeline appears accurate.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs detailed and emotionally expressive language, emphasizing severity and fear, which appears genuine. They avoid vague or minimization language, providing specific descriptions of pain and symptoms. - Information flow: They are forthcoming, volunteering comprehensive details about symptom onset, nature, and medical history, which suggests a motivated but honest reporting style. - Response style: They respond directly and elaborately, with consistent information that reflects genuine concern rather than fabrication or withholding.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None observed; the patient openly reveals critical information about their symptoms and history. - Minimization behaviors: Absent; symptoms are described as severe and distressing. - Amplification patterns: Not overtly exaggerated; language used correlates with the reported severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; the patient appears willing to share distress openly. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; the timeline and symptom details are consistent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence; responses seem personally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal bias; communication appears accurate, driven by real concern, with no clear signs of distortion. - Severity: Mild or absent; responses are detailed, consistent, and truthful. - Areas most affected: Not significantly biased; subjective experience is credible. - Reliability: High; based on the coherence and detail, their self-report can be trusted.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible subtle past episodes or baseline functional capacity; no critical omissions evident. - Symptoms probably minimized: Unlikely; current descriptions are intense and match clinical needs. - Concerns probably amplified: The emotional distress may heighten perceived symptom severity, but it matches the description. - True timeline: The described sudden onset and persistent severity are consistent with actual acute events.  Overall, the patient's communication suggests honest and accurate reporting, with minimal bias, enabling reliable clinical assessment."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: There is little evidence of minimization; the patient emphasizes severity with words like \"terrible,\" \"intense,\" and \"unbearable,\" indicating he perceives the symptoms as very serious. - Amplifying language: Strong, emotionally charged descriptors such as \"terrible pain,\" \"very intense,\" \"like something's tearing inside,\" and \"almost unbearable\" suggest amplification of his distress. - Vague language: Phrases are mostly specific; no significant vagueness detected, which supports straightforward reporting. - Emotional language: The patient clearly expresses fear (\"I'm really scared\"), distress (\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong\"), and concern about severity (\"could this be something serious?\"), indicating emotional engagement and anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are clear, focused, and direct, providing detailed symptom descriptions when prompted. - Directness: The patient answers questions directly, especially about the timeline and nature of pain. - Information volunteering: He tends to volunteer specific details about symptom onset and nature early, showing a proactive attempt to inform. - Consistency: His responses are consistent regarding the onset, severity, and associated symptoms, suggesting reliability in reporting.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; he appears eager to communicate his concerns entirely. - Minimization behaviors: No signs he is downplaying symptoms; emphasis on severity suggests openness. - Amplification patterns: He overstates the pain and discomfort, possibly due to distress, though within reasonable limits given the acuity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of shame or embarrassment; responses are straightforward. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: No external influence observed; responses seem primarily driven by his internal experience.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: No clear bias in communication; the patient appears honest and transparent about symptoms. - Severity: Mild to moderate; his emotional distress and vivid descriptions could slightly exaggerate perceived severity, but overall, he reports symptoms in a detailed and consistent manner. - Areas most affected: Emotional expression and perceived severity may inflate his perceived threat level. - Reliability: Relatively high; he provides detailed, plausible, and coherent descriptions.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of chronic baseline symptoms or coping mechanisms; he might minimize subtle symptoms like mild numbness or lesser pain episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The report of dizziness and shortness of breath could be more severe, but he may not fully communicate the extent. - Concerns probably amplified: The fear of serious issues (dissection or aneurysm rupture) may cause him to overemphasize the severity. - True timeline: The report matches his description of sudden onset; unlikely to be significantly distorted, given consistency.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use emotionally charged, specific descriptions (\"terrible,\" \"intense,\" \"like something's tearing\") indicating he emphasizes severity vividly. There\u2019s minimal vagueness, and he communicates with earnestness. - Information flow: He is forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions about the onset and nature of his symptoms, especially when asked about timing and severity. Responses are organized and directly related to the questions. - Response style: The responses are elaborative and focused, with an inclination to ensure the physician understands the gravity of his symptoms. He avoids tangential information, staying on topic.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evidence; he shares relevant details openly. - Minimization behaviors: Not present; he emphasizes how severe and distressing his symptoms are. - Amplification patterns: The vivid, strong language used suggests some level of emotional amplification, although appropriate given the context; this may heighten perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; responses are straightforward without signs of discomfort disclosing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; his timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: None apparent; responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: No significant communication bias detected; the patient appears honest and detailed. - Severity: Mild; emotional distress and vivid description may slightly inflate perceived severity, but overall, responses are reliable. - Areas most affected: Emotional amplification could lead to overestimating how urgent or severe symptoms feel. - Reliability: Fairly high; the detailed, consistent reports allow reasonable confidence in his self-reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He might underreport subtle or less severe background symptoms or coping mechanisms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Mild symptoms like subtle numbness or earlier discomfort may not be fully disclosed if present. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear-related expressions suggest he may perceive the threat as more imminent or severe than it is. - True timeline: The sudden onset is consistent. Emotional distress might make him perceive symptoms as more severe or rapid than they actually are.  # Short Answer"

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses with attention to their linguistic choices, response patterns, and behaviors to identify underlying biases and communication tendencies.  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient avoids minimizing symptoms. Phrases like \"really bad,\" \"very intense\" show high self-reporting of severity, indicating no obvious minimization. - Amplifying language: Words such as \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" \"excruciating,\" \"almost unbearable\" suggest symptom exaggeration, emphasizing how severe the pain feels. - Vague language: Terms like \"sort of,\" \"kind of,\" or \"a little\" are absent; descriptions are quite specific. - Emotional language: Expressions like \"really scared\" and \"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong\" reflect emotional distress, concern, and anxiety.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise but include descriptors emphasizing severity; they respond directly to questions but with emotional overtones. - Directness: Generally direct, especially about the onset and intensity of symptoms; no clear evasions. - Information volunteering: They volunteer key details about pain and circulation changes, signaling openness. - Consistency: Their descriptions are consistent across answers without contradictions.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Limited evidence\u2014responses are forthcoming, though the focus is on symptom severity. - Minimization behaviors: No apparent downplaying; the patient emphasizes severity. - Amplification patterns: Use of \"terrible,\" \"almost unbearable\" suggests amplification of pain; possibly elevated concern. - Embarrassment/shame: No signs\u2014seems openly distressed and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; timelines are consistent. - Family influence: None evident.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The patient is exhibiting amplified concern, possibly leaning toward catastrophizing given the emphatic language and focus on severity. - Severity level: Moderate, as they tend to overemphasize symptoms but remain coherent and accurate in reporting timeline and characteristics. - Areas most affected: Perception of pain and circulation issues; they may overstate how severe or threatening these are. - Reliability assessment: Generally reliable; responses match clinical observations, but their emotional distress could color their perception of severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not fully acknowledge the stability or potential for gradual worsening, possibly overemphasizing the acuteness. - Symptoms probably minimized: No direct evidence of minimization; however, their focus on severity might overshadow subtle signs of progression or other symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Clearly, they are magnifying their pain and circulatory symptoms, fearing serious outcomes. - True timeline: The timeline seems accurate; no signs of denial or distortion here.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged, specific language emphasizing severity (\"almost unbearable,\" \"like something\u2019s tearing\"), which suggests an emotional response driven by distress. - Information flow: They are forthcoming and organized, volunteering detailed descriptions of onset and symptom changes without prompting, indicating openness. - Response style: Responses are direct but emotionally laden, with a tendency to stress how severe or concerning the symptoms are.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evidence\u2014the patient is transparent and provides details readily. - Minimization behaviors: Absent\u2014there\u2019s an overemphasis on severity rather than downplaying. - Amplification patterns: Strong\u2014use of intense descriptors and emotional language shows they may be amplifying their discomfort and worry. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed\u2014they appear cooperative and willing to share. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; their timeline is consistent. - Family influence: None indicated by current info.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Catastrophizing or amplification bias, given their exaggerated descriptors and emphasis on severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014while they appear genuinely distressed and their descriptions are intense, responses are coherent and consistent. - Areas most affected: Perception of pain intensity and circulatory symptoms; they might be overestimating the threat based on their emotional state. - Reliability: Fairly reliable in terms of factual details but with emotional bias likely inflating their perception of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: They might not recognize or report baseline variations in discomfort or subtle signs of progression\u2014they could overfixate on current severe symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident; they effectively depict their pain as severe. - Concerns probably amplified: They are overestimating the threat level, probably fearing catastrophic outcomes possibly more than the clinical picture warrants. - True timeline: The timeline appears accurate, but their emotional state could make them perceive progression as more rapid or severe.  Overall, this patient demonstrates a tendency toward emotional amplification concerning their symptoms, emphasizing severity and distress, which could influence urgency perception. Their communication is clear but strongly emotionally charged, demanding sensitive interpretation to differentiate genuine severity from heightened anxiety."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes the numbness and pale appearance as \"kinda pale, I think,\" indicating some uncertainty and possible downplaying of severity. - Amplifying language: Terms like \"really weird and kind of frightening\" suggest emotional distress but are relatively measured; no overt exaggeration of symptoms. - Vague language: Phrases like \"like I can\u2019t feel much,\" \"kinda pale,\" and \"maybe yesterday\" show some uncertainty or lack of precise recall. - Emotional language: Words such as \"frightening,\" \"worried,\" and \"scared\" highlight underlying anxiety, possibly overemphasizing their distress to seek reassurance.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise and to the point, especially regarding the change in symptoms, suggesting a tendency to stick to what they perceive as the core issue. - Directness: The patient answers questions directly but with some uncertainty (\"I think,\" \"maybe\"), possibly avoiding firm statements. - Information volunteering: The patient waits for prompts to describe changes but doesn't volunteer extra details unless asked, indicating a cautious communication style. - Consistency: Responses are consistent across questions about symptom change, emphasizing ongoing numbness and pale appearance without conflicting information.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence of withholding intentionally; the hesitations suggest uncertainty rather than concealment. - Minimization behaviors: The phrase \"kinda pale\" and \"I think\" suggest some minimization or lack of confidence in their descriptions, which may reflect attempt to understate or avoid alarm. - Amplification patterns: Expressions like \"really weird and kind of frightening\" show they are emotionally amplifying their distress, possibly to solicit reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No evident signs of shame or embarrassment about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: The patient appears to have some minor uncertainty about timing (\"maybe yesterday\") but no major disorientation. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence on responses.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: This individual exhibits mild to moderate cues of anxiety-driven bias, particularly in emotional amplification and tentative language which may lead to understated reporting. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014hesitations and uncertainty suggest some bias but not significant withholding or distortion. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of physical appearance (pale, numbness) and timeline are slightly biased by uncertainty, possibly reducing clarity. - Reliability assessment: Moderate trust; responses are relatively honest but influenced by anxiety and uncertainty, so some details should be verified objectively.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might not be fully conveying the severity or progression, possibly underestimating the acuity or extent of vascular compromise. - Symptoms probably minimized: Their description suggests they may be downplaying the extent of numbness or the visual appearance (e.g., \"kinda pale\") and not fully communicating weakness or color changes. - Concerns probably amplified: The emotional distress (\"frightening\") indicates high anxiety, which could make them perceive their situation as more dire than it objectively is or vice versa, depending on emotional dysregulation. - True timeline: The timeline seems consistent but may be imprecise (\"maybe yesterday\"), potentially obscuring rapid deterioration that needs urgent intervention.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and hesitant language (\"kinda pale,\" \"I think,\" \"maybe yesterday\"), indicating some uncertainty and possible minimization. Emotional descriptors like \"frightening\" reveal underlying distress but are somewhat calibrated. - Information flow: Responses are cautious and somewhat guarded, waiting for direct questions, with limited elaboration unless prompted. The responses are organized and focused but do not offer much beyond the core questions. - Response style: Generally direct but with frequent qualifiers, suggesting discomfort or uncertainty about details, especially regarding the visual appearance and timeline.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding, but hesitations and semi-uncertain phrasing suggest participant is cautious, possibly withholding some confidence or full details. - Minimization behaviors: The description of pallor as \"kinda pale\" and the mention of \"maybe yesterday\" could reflect mild minimization or uncertainty about risk severity. - Amplification patterns: The emotional descriptors\u2014\"really weird and kind of frightening\"\u2014indicate amplification of emotional distress, which may be a response to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs. - Confusion/memory issues: Minor uncertainty about timing (\"maybe yesterday\") hints at some memory or perception fuzziness but no confusion about symptoms. - Family influence: No direct evidence but could be influenced by personal concern and fear.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven bias with tendencies toward emotional amplification and hesitance, possibly leading to underreporting of some physical signs while overreporting distress. - Severity: Moderate; responses are generally honest but contain qualifiers and emotional language that may skew clinical interpretation. - Areas most affected: Description of physical signs (paleness, numbness) and timing, which are tinged with uncertainty. - Reliability: Moderate; conversations indicate honesty but reflect anxiety that may distort perception, necessitating corroboration with objective findings.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not fully articulate the extent of neurological or ischemic compromise, possibly underreporting weakness or color changes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The numbness and pallor could be more severe than described; the patient\u2019s cautious language may mask further deterioration. - Concerns probably amplified: Their emotional distress (\"frightening\") and anxious tone may lead them to perceive the situation as worse, but possibly they are over-responding due to anxiety. - True timeline: The timeline is approximate but likely reflects rapid symptom progression; actual deterioration could be faster than perceived, highlighting urgency."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient states, \"I haven\u2019t noticed any weakness,\" potentially downplaying actual functional impairment. - Amplifying language: Words like \"really frightened,\" \"terrible pain,\" and \"almost unbearable\" suggest heightened distress and possible emotional exaggeration of pain severity. - Vague language: Phrases like \"maybe yesterday\" and \"kind of pale\" show some uncertainty or lack of precise recall. - Emotional language: The patient expresses fear (\"scared,\" \"really frightened\") and concern, indicating high emotional arousal tied to symptoms.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Answers are brief and to the point, especially when describing symptoms, likely to avoid overcomplicating their report. - Directness: They answer questions directly but tend to qualify responses with vague descriptors. - Information volunteering: The patient provides only necessary information unless prompted, indicating possible hesitance or habit of withholding details. - Consistency: Responses remain consistent regarding the persistence of numbness and pale appearance, but there\u2019s an undercurrent of uncertainty suggesting some ambivalence or denial.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: The patient avoids describing movement difficulty or worsening, possibly hiding the extent of impairment. - Minimization behaviors: Emphasis on \"still\" and \"since yesterday,\" possibly understated in concern, minimizing the severity. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"really frightened\" and \"almost unbearable\" suggest heightened perception of threat; possibly to elicit urgency or because of genuine distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; the patient appears willing to discuss symptoms despite distress. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about timing (\"maybe yesterday\") indicates some memory slippage or cautiousness. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses seem internally motivated.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014patient appears to magnify distress and severity to emphasize the urgency. - Severity level: Moderate\u2014distress and emotional language color responses, but factual details about physical symptoms remain fairly consistent. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of pain intensity and leg coloration; responses about progression and sensation are somewhat uncertain, possibly over-exaggerated or under-represented. - Reliability: Moderate trustworthiness\u2014patient is open but shows signs of emotional influence and cautious reporting.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of mobility difficulty or worsening symptoms due to fear or denial. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient may be hiding how much weakness or functional loss has developed. - Concerns probably amplified: The fear and distress may cause the patient to overstate threat level or pain severity. - True timeline: Actual symptom progression might involve slower change than perceived; however, emotional response may distort the timeline's clarity.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged words (\"really frightened,\" \"almost unbearable\") which suggest high distress, mixed with vague descriptors (\"maybe yesterday,\" \"kind of pale\"), indicating some uncertainty or an attempt to downplay severity. - Information flow: Responses tend to be concise and cautious, providing essential information but avoiding elaboration unless prompted, displaying guardedness. - Response style: Answers are straightforward but with cautious qualifiers, indicating discomfort when discussing symptoms; responses are more minimal than elaborative.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient avoids discussing potential weakness or movement issues, possibly to minimize perceived severity. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptom worsening (\"it\u2019s been like that since yesterday\"), possibly reducing perceived urgency. - Amplification patterns: Use of words like \"really frightened\" and \"almost unbearable\" could be intended to emphasize the seriousness, perhaps to ensure the doctor recognizes the urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs but hesitance about symptom progression and vague language about color changes suggest some internal discomfort about the symptoms' severity. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about timing (\"maybe yesterday\") may indicate mild memory or recall impairment, or cautious reporting. - Family influence: No evident influence detected, responses appear internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as the patient emphasizes fear and severity to communicate urgency. - Severity: Moderate, because emotional language influences the perception of symptoms, but core details remain consistent. - Areas most affected: Perception of pain severity and leg appearance; responses may overstate emotional distress and perception of worsening. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; responses are generally accurate but influenced by emotional tone and cautious qualifiers.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Potential underreporting of functional impairment or worsening mobility due to fear or denial. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual weakness or progressive loss of function may be more severe than described. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's fear and distress likely overstate the immediacy of danger or severity. - True timeline: Actual symptom progression could be more gradual; perceived rapid worsening may be enhanced by emotional distress.  Thus, carefully consider emotional influence and possible under- or over-reporting when integrating this self-report into clinical assessment."
