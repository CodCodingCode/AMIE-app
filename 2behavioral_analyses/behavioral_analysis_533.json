    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: There is no explicit minimization such as \"just\" or \"only\" in the patient\u2019s statement; however, phrases like \"a few weeks\" could imply a tendency to understate duration. - Amplifying language: The patient emphasizes the changes (\"really changed recently,\" \"really hard,\" \"bleeds sometimes,\" \"painful\") that highlight the severity, possibly amplifying concern about the lesion. - Vague language: The patient uses precise descriptors (\"a bump,\" \"hard,\" \"firm,\" \"dome,\") but also phrases like \"a few weeks,\" which are somewhat non-specific. - Emotional language: The patient expresses concern (\"worried it might be something serious,\" \"am I in danger?\"), indicating anxiety and fear, but maintains a straightforward tone.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: The responses are concise but include detailed descriptions when describing the lesion, suggesting a focus on key details. - Directness: The patient provides direct, relevant information; he does not seem to deflect or omit information when asked specific questions. - Information volunteering: He volunteers initial details about the lesion readily, indicating openness, but does not elaborate on emotional concerns until prompted. - Consistency: His description remains consistent, emphasizing the recent change and associated symptoms, reflecting a coherent narrative.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; the patient appears to share pertinent details openly. - Minimization behaviors: Slight underemphasis on duration (\"a few weeks,\" rather than precise timeline), possibly an attempt to minimize the problem's duration or severity. - Amplification patterns: The use of words like \"really changed,\" \"hard,\" \"bleeds sometimes,\" and \"painful\" suggest some exaggeration to stress importance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There is no obvious embarrassment; the patient seems comfortable describing physical symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; the timeline and symptom description seem consistent. - Family influence: Not explicitly indicated here, but prior context suggests some concern about family history may influence perception.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely a mix of amplification (overly emphasizing symptoms to ensure attention) and mild minimization (possibly underplaying how long the lesion has been present). - Severity level: Moderate; the patient seems motivated yet potentially overstates symptoms to elicit concern or reassurance. - Areas most affected: Duration reporting (a few weeks only), perhaps leading to underestimation of total symptom timeline; emotional expression is balanced. - Reliability assessment: Generally reliable but possibly influenced by anxiety-driven amplification; self-report is valuable but should be corroborated with examination.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may be minimizing the emotional impact or personal distress associated with the lesion, possibly downplaying hesitations or fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Chronicity of the lesion prior to the recent change; he may have noticed the bump earlier but did not seek care, hinting at possible denial or minimization. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of cancer or serious disease; his emphasis on the lesion's change and bleeding indicates heightened anxiety. - True timeline: The lesion likely developed earlier than \"a few weeks,\" but the patient only became concerned with recent changes; emotional overlay may influence the perception of symptom progression.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific descriptors (\"hard,\" \"firm,\" \"dome,\" \"bleeds\") to accurately depict physical findings but may simultaneously downplay emotional responses and timeline details. He emphasizes change and severity, possibly to ensure his concerns are taken seriously. - Information flow: He is relatively forthcoming but primarily sticks to physical symptoms, volunteering details about the lesion\u2019s appearance and timeline without elaborating on emotional distress. He responds directly but may omit nuanced feelings. - Response style: The answers are straightforward and concise, with a focus on observable changes. He appears more detail-oriented about physical descriptors than emotional or contextual factors.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Little evidence here, but his brief mention of a \"few weeks\" could reflect subtle minimization in timeline duration. - Minimization behaviors: He may be minimizing the duration of the lesion's presence, perhaps to avoid acknowledging earlier unnoticed symptoms or concerns. - Amplification patterns: He emphasizes recent changes (\"really changed,\" \"bleeds sometimes,\" \"painful\") to highlight urgency, which might be slightly exaggerated to convey the problem\u2019s seriousness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None apparent; he openly discusses physical features and concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion or recall issues; the timeline and symptoms are consistent. - Family influence: Not explicit here, but given his family history, his focus on seriousness could be influenced by genetic risk awareness.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate amplification care-seeking bias, with some mild minimization of initial lesion duration. - Severity: Moderate, because he is motivated to have the issue addressed but may overstate the recent change to prompt concern. - Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy (possible underreporting of earlier presence), emotional expression (not detailed), and perception of urgency. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy but slightly biased by anxiety and desire for reassurance; corroborate with physical examination and possibly history from others if available.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He probably has been aware of the lesion longer than reported but avoided consulting earlier, possibly due to minimization or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: Chronic presence and previous less noticeable symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: The risk of melanoma metastasis due to recent rapid change and bleeding. - True timeline: Lesion's development likely predates the patient\u2019s report; recent concern reflects actual change but may not capture initial onset or psychological factors influencing perception."

    "analysis": "THINKING: To analyze this patient's responses, I first consider the language used. The patient explains the timeline as \"maybe about three weeks ago\" which indicates some uncertainty or vagueness, possibly downplaying precise details. Phrases like \"small then, just kind of there\" suggest minimization or reluctance to emphasize severity early on. The description of symptoms as \"harder,\" \"bleeding sometimes,\" and \"sometimes it bleeds\" shows mild to moderate concern but with a tendency to accept variability without strong language. The repeated emphasis on the bump's growth and change indicates awareness of worsening but possibly an attempt to avoid sounding overly alarmed or to manage emotional discomfort.  In terms of response pattern, the patient offers a clear, chronological account without prompting, indicating some willingness to share factual information. However, specific hedging (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\") suggests hesitance or an unconscious withholding of certainty, perhaps to avoid sounding overly anxious or to present themselves as controlled. The short, matter-of-fact replies about the timeline without elaboration may reflect discomfort or an attempt to minimize perceived drama.  From behavioral indicators, there's evidence of minimization: the use of \"just,\" \"kind of,\" and \"maybe\" dilutes perceived severity. The tentative language may also serve to mask anxiety levels. The description doesn't show overt embarrassment or shame but does show slight hesitation, suggesting some internal discomfort discussing the lesion. No clear signs of amplification or exaggeration are evident; responses seem measured.  Regarding biases, the primary concern appears to be minimization bias, with the patient downplaying initial symptom severity but recognizing progression. The severity is moderate\u2014there's acknowledgment of change and pain but no overt exaggeration. The areas most affected include early perception of the lesion being insignificant, possibly leading to underreporting of early symptoms.  In terms of clinical implications, these communication patterns suggest that the self-reported timeline and severity may underrepresent the actual progression. The patient might not be fully aware of or willing to disclose the initial growth's true extent, and their emotional discomfort could suppress full disclosure. Consequently, critical details about early lesion characteristics could be underreported, and the patient's anxiety might influence their perception of severity or timeline.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and hedging language like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" and \"just\" which indicates a tendency to downplay the initial severity of the lesion. Descriptions such as \"harder,\" \"bleeding sometimes,\" and \"slightly painful\" are somewhat cautious, possibly minimizing the extent of symptoms. - Information flow: The patient volunteers essential details about the timeline and changes but does so with hesitations, indicating some reluctance or discomfort. Responses are organized and chronological but lack depth, suggesting an attempt to convey the necessary information without elaborating on fears or concerns. - Response style: The responses are predominantly straightforward and concise, with some hesitation or qualifiers. The patient avoids overly emotional language, possibly to manage internal discomfort or to maintain control over their narrative.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The use of hedging (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\") and vague descriptors suggest possible withholding of more detailed or alarming information, perhaps to avoid worry or embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just kind of there\" and \"it was small then\" serve to downplay early severity, possibly to reduce perceived stigma or personal embarrassment. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; the patient appears to be cautious rather than alarmist. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs are visible; hesitation is minimal but might be a mild indicator of discomfort in discussing personal health details. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant signs\u2014timeline is consistent, and details are coherent. - Family influence: The family history is mentioned but not emphasized or elaborated upon, indicating potential awareness but limited impact on current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is minimization, with the patient consciously or unconsciously downplaying early symptoms and severity, possibly to avoid anxiety or shame. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014there's acknowledgment of changes and concern but also evident hedging and minimization that could obscure true severity. - Areas most affected: Early symptom perception and timeline details are most biased; underreporting of initial lesion characteristics could delay urgent assessment. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014while the patient provides consistent chronological information, the language suggests some underestimation of severity, so self-report should be supplemented with clinical findings.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might not be fully revealing how quickly the lesion grew or the extent of initial symptoms, potentially underestimating urgency. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early lesion size, initial appearance, or distress level might be understated, masking the true progression. - Concerns probably amplified: The current concern (\"really changed lately\") likely reflects genuine worry, but prior symptoms might have been more severe or extensive than reported. - True timeline: The lesion may have evolved more rapidly or earlier than the patient admits; hesitations suggest underreporting of initial severity and feeling of uncertainty about exact timing.  # Short Answer"

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient consistently uses vague, minimizing language such as \"just a small bump\" and \"not that bad,\" indicating a tendency to downplay the severity of his symptoms. His responses tend to be concise and somewhat guarded, suggesting he is reluctant to fully disclose or possibly embarrassed about the lesion. The fact that he mentions being \"worried\" but hesitates or provides minimal details about his emotional state points to an underlying hesitancy. The responses are steady across questions, showing a pattern of selective disclosure. His body language cues\u2014looking down, pressing or rubbing the area\u2014imply discomfort and nervousness, reinforcing the suspicion of information withholding or minimization to avoid seeming overly anxious or to conceal embarrassment. The timeframe he provides appears consistent, but the emphasis on current concern and physical sensations could be exaggerated by his anxiety. Overall, these patterns suggest a bias towards underreporting certain aspects perhaps due to embarrassment or fear, impacting the clarity of his self-report.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and minimizing language such as \"just a small bump,\" \"not that bad,\" and \"kind of there,\" which downplays the symptoms. There is also emotional language indicating concern (\"really changed,\" \"worried\") but balanced with hesitation, indicating some reluctance to fully articulate fears. - Information flow: He is somewhat reluctant to volunteer detailed information and tends to respond briefly unless prompted. His initial description covers the basics, but he offers limited emotional insight or contextual detail without direct questioning. - Response style: Responses are concise and to the point, with a tendency to avoid elaborating on feelings or fears unless specifically asked. He seems to control the narrative, possibly to avoid admitting the full extent of his worry or embarrassment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence includes minimal elaboration on emotional impact and a brief, guarded description of the lesion's history, suggesting he might withhold concerns or details. - Minimization behaviors: The use of \"just a small bump\" and \"not that bad\" indicates an effort to lessen perceived severity, possibly to avoid appearing panicked or overreacting. - Amplification patterns: While he expresses worry, the inconsistent detail and restrained emotional language suggest his actual level of concern might be higher than implied. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Pressing or rubbing the area and the hesitant manner of describing the lesion imply discomfort, possibly embarrassment about the lesion or its implications. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; his timeline appears consistent, but his guarded communication may mask underlying uncertainty. - Family influence: Mentioning family history indicates awareness of risk but doesn't seem to affect his reticence during the conversation.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization, as evidenced by language downplaying the lesion's seriousness and brief responses. There may also be some underreporting of emotional distress. - Severity: Moderate. The patient\u2019s understatement of symptoms could lead to underestimating the urgency or severity, impacting clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Significant bias is present around symptoms' severity, emotional impact, and the true risk of malignancy. His hesitation and minimization hinder a full understanding. - Reliability: The patient's self-reporting is somewhat limited and biased towards underplaying his symptoms, so clinical judgment should consider this and seek additional objective data.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the lesion's emotional and functional impact, detailed timeline of changes, and depth of concern are probably understated. Also, potential fears or embarrassment related to the lesion may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of the lesion's appearance, pain, bleeding, and potential urgency could be worse than described. He may be hiding or downplaying the true extent of discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: The expressed worry indicates high anxiety, which may be over-expressed relative to his actual emotional distress, or it could be an accurate reflection of a deep fear he cannot openly express. - True timeline: The lesion might have developed or changed more rapidly; his brief description may not fully capture the progression or severity, as he tends to minimize or omit details when describing his symptoms."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient does not explicitly use minimizing phrases like \"just\" or \"only,\" but indicates some degree of downplaying when describing the bump as \"small\" initially and emphasizing \"it's really bothering me now\" to suggest some minimization early on. - Amplifying language: The patient describes the lesion as \"really hard,\" \"bleeds sometimes,\" \"quite painful,\" and \"really bothering me,\" which exaggerate discomfort and concern. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of there,\" \"kind of a dome,\" and \"a little ulcerated\" reflect vagueness. Such words indicate uncertainty or an attempt to soften the description. - Emotional language: The patient shows signs of fear (\"really worried,\" \"scared\"), concern (\"it's bothering me\"), and some embarrassment, evidenced by qualifying descriptors to perhaps avoid alarming the doctor.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses tend to be concise but increase in detail when prompted about appearance and symptoms, suggesting initial reluctance that eases with specific questions. - Directness: The patient is mostly direct but shows hesitation and uses hedging (\"kind of a dome,\" \"looks a little ulcerated\"). - Information volunteering: He mainly shares essential info but adds more detail when asked about appearance and feeling, indicating some degree of withholding or discomfort. - Consistency: The timeline and description of symptoms (size, pain, bleeding) are consistent, but he hedges descriptions with vague words, reflecting uncertainty.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to fully describe features like ulceration initially; may be avoiding overemphasis. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying early lesion size (\"just a small bump\") and describing symptoms as \"really bothering me now\" instead of emphasizing severity from the start. - Amplification patterns: When describing pain (\"pretty painful\") and bleeding, language suggests concern but also an attempt to emphasize his discomfort, possibly to prompt urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not overt, but hedging language and passive tone may indicate some discomfort discussing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence. - Family influence: Indirectly present\u2014mention of family history of melanoma may increase concern but also influence responses by heightening worry.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight tendency towards minimization early on, with possible amplification of symptoms to emphasize concern. - Severity: Moderate. The patient initially minimizes the lesion's severity but then amplifies symptoms when describing them, reflecting internal tension. - Areas most affected: Early lesion size and timeline are slightly minimized; pain and bleeding are somewhat exaggerated. - Reliability assessment: Self-report is somewhat biased through minimization and amplification, so caution is needed when interpreting details like lesion appearance and timeline.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully truthful or precise about the lesion's initial size, appearance, or timeline, perhaps due to discomfort or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: The initial description of the lesion as \"small\" and \"just there\" may understate the actual growth. - Concerns probably amplified: The expression of \"really bothering me\" and \"worried\" suggests heightened concern that may be partly driven by anxiety rather than objective severity. - True timeline: The lesion likely developed over a few weeks but might have been more discreet initially, indicating some degree of early minimization.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and somewhat emotional language, e.g., \"kind of a dome,\" \"really bothering me,\" suggesting discomfort and uncertainty. Descriptions become more specific when prompted, showing some initial reluctance. - Information flow: He is somewhat reluctant initially, providing basic info but with hedging, then offers more details when queried specifically about appearance and symptoms, indicating partial withholding. - Response style: Responses tend to be concise, with the patient hedging descriptions, possibly to avoid exaggeration or due to discomfort discussing symptoms openly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation in early descriptions, use of vague terms (\"kind of a dome,\" \"a little ulcerated\") suggests some reluctance to fully disclose details. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the initial size (\"just a small bump\") and early severity; likely hiding concerns that he thought were less urgent. - Amplification patterns: When expressing pain and concern, language is more forceful (\"really bothering me,\" \"quite painful\"), possibly to stress the seriousness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild; hedging and passive tone may reflect discomfort discussing symptoms perceived as serious or personal. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: Mentioning family history of melanoma likely increases concern internally, potentially influencing his portrayal of symptoms, but no direct evidence of external influence during responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is an initial minimization of lesion severity, followed by some amplification of symptoms\u2014common in anxious patients trying to balance fear with hesitance. - Severity: Moderate; early underestimation could delay assessment, and subsequent exaggeration may reflect heightened anxiety. - Areas most affected: Lesion\u2019s initial size and timeline are underreported, while symptom severity (pain, bleeding) is possibly overemphasized to elicit concern. - Reliability: Moderate; self-reports are biased by emotions and anxiety, so some details may be inaccurate or incomplete.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The early lesion's appearance and exact timeline, as the patient minimized initial size. Also, potential early warning signs like color change or ulceration might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial size and perhaps the early stage of lesion development. - Concerns probably amplified: The severity and urgency of current symptoms, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: Likely more gradual than fully acknowledged; the lesion probably grew over weeks but may have been less noticeable initially, indicating some early minimization to cope with worry."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:  STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: The patient describes his initial bump as \"just a small bump\" and \"kind of a little dome,\" which suggests downplaying the severity early on. - Amplifying language: He admits that now it \"really\" got bigger, harder, and bleeds, indicating increased concern but still cautious. - Vague language: Phrases like \"kind of a little darker,\" \"didn't look like anything special,\" reflect non-specific descriptions, which might obscure details. - Emotional language: Expressions such as \"really worried it might be something bad\" reveal underlying anxiety, but it's somewhat restrained, perhaps to avoid sounding overly alarmed.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Responses are concise, especially when describing initial appearance, possibly indicating reluctance to elaborate or discomfort discussing details. - Directness: The patient answers questions but with some hedging (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\"), and tends to generalize rather than specify. - Information volunteering: Tends to give only minimal information unless prompted, such as the description of the lesion's evolution. - Consistency: Responses are relatively consistent in stating that the lesion has changed over time, though details are vague on the initial appearance.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to specify detailed features like exact color or surface characteristics initially suggests some withholding. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying initial presentation (\"not anything special\") indicates possible minimization. - Amplification patterns: The patient expresses significant concern now (\"really bothering me\") and describes it as \"bigger\" and \"more painful,\" which might reflect emotional amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The reluctance to elaborate fully on early characteristics or personal feelings hints at a mild discomfort or shame about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about whether changes have been sudden or gradual suggests some uncertainty or difficulty recalling specific details. - Family influence: Explicit mention of family history of melanoma may increase concern but no evidence of external influence affecting responses directly.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be *minimization* of initial symptom severity, with some *response shading* to avoid overemphasizing early findings. - Severity level: Moderate; initial underestimation can delay recognition of urgency, with some amplification during current concern. - Areas most affected: Early presentation details and the lesion's initial appearance are biased; current concern is expressed more openly. - Reliability: Moderate; the patient\u2019s self-report is somewhat restrained, so actual lesion severity might be more advanced than described.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the lesion's initial appearance (exact color, border, surface), early symptoms, and functional impact are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity may be worse\u2014faster growth, more irregularity, or ulceration\u2014since he is cautious about revealing full details initially. - Concerns probably amplified: Current worry is genuine but possibly heightened by anxiety; his concern about \"something serious\" aligns with progression, but may overstate the severity until confirmed. - True timeline: The lesion may have been changing more rapidly or earlier than the patient perceives, with initial signs less noticeable or underestimated.\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends toward vague and non-specific descriptions initially, shifting to more direct and concerned language as the lesion progresses. Early comments like \"not anything special\" mask potential overminimization. - Information flow: He is somewhat reluctant to share detailed initial characteristics, responding primarily when prompted, indicating guardedness. The progression responses are more forthcoming but still muted. - Response style: Responses are generally concise, with some hesitancy and occasional hedging, reflecting discomfort or uncertainty about describing the lesion fully.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Initial reluctance to specify exact color or surface features suggests deliberate underreporting. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the initial lesion as \"not anything special\" indicates possible minimization of early severity. - Amplification patterns: Current concern is expressed strongly (\"really bothering me\"), showing emotional amplification possibly driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitance to describe details comprehensively, particularly early on, points to mild embarrassment or discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about the change timeline (\"did it get worse suddenly or slowly\") indicates some uncertainty. - Family influence: Mention of family history influences heightened worry, but external influences on response style are limited.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is *minimization* of early lesion features, with some *response amplification* during current concern. - Severity: Moderate; this bias might lead to underestimation of lesion severity during initial assessment, risking delayed diagnosis. - Areas most affected: The early lesion description and perceived progression are most biased; current emotional responses are less biased but still amplified. - Reliability: Moderate; self-reporting is somewhat cautious and influenced by emotional state, suggesting that some lesion details and timeline may not be fully accurate.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise early lesion features\u2014a detailed description of the color, borders, surface, and any surface changes\u2014are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual aggressiveness or ulceration of the lesion could be more advanced than described, given the initial minimization and current concern. - Concerns probably amplified: His current worry aligns with actual risk, but emotional amplification could exaggerate perceived severity. - True timeline: Lesion progression might be more rapid or occurred earlier than patient perceives, with initial signs less noticeable or underestimated due to response bias."
