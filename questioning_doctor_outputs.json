    "input": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s symptoms include rapid heart rate (tachycardia), shortness of breath, dizziness or \u201cfuzziness,\u201d which occur suddenly and frequently. These symptoms provoke anxiety, including fear of serious cardiac issues like a heart attack, and they impair daily functioning. The main differential is between panic attacks (a psychological cause) and cardiac causes of paroxysmal tachycardia such as arrhythmias.\n\nSupporting panic attacks is the presence of sudden onset episodes with multiple associated symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness, accompanied by anxiety and fear that worsen the perception of symptoms. Panic attacks typically present with episodic tachycardia, dyspnea, dizziness/lightheadedness, and intense fear or a sense of impending doom, without evidence of structural heart disease. The patient\u2019s fear of serious cardiac disease and impact on social/work functioning due to anxiety also supports an anxiety disorder.\n\nCardiac causes (like supraventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmias) can cause sudden rapid heart rate and dizziness from transient poor cardiac output. However, these may not be accompanied by anxiety as a primary driving feature; rather, anxiety might secondarily develop due to symptoms. Additionally, no mention of chest pain, palpitations triggered by exertion, or syncope is made, which might point to more serious arrhythmias. Absence of abnormal vital signs or ECG findings also makes primary cardiac etiology less likely.\n\nLess likely diagnoses include:\n- Structural heart disease causing arrhythmia (would usually have more findings or risk factors)\n- Pulmonary embolism (usually with hypoxia, pleuritic chest pain)\n- Hypoglycemia (can cause dizziness but less likely to cause tachycardia and anxiety simultaneously as primary features)\n- Hyperthyroidism (would have more sustained symptoms and other systemic signs)\n\nGiven the constellation of symptoms, sudden onset, episodic nature, anxiety about health, functional impairment due to fear, and lack of objective cardiac findings so far, panic disorder with panic attacks is the most likely diagnosis. Further evaluation with ECG and labs to exclude other causes is needed but based on this presentation, panic attacks stand out.\n\nANSWER: Panic disorder with panic attacks",

    "input": "THINKING: The patient's episodes of rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and feeling fuzzy, predominantly occurring at rest and without exertion or clear stressors, raise the possibility of paroxysmal arrhythmias, panic attacks, or other autonomic disturbances. The absence of clear syncope but presence of dizziness and near-syncope-like symptoms suggests transient cerebral hypoperfusion or autonomic instability.\n\nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is a strong consideration given sudden rapid heart rate at rest; it often causes palpitations, dizziness, and lightheadedness. The \"feeling fuzzy\" may correspond to reduced cerebral perfusion during tachycardia episodes. The shortness of breath can be secondary to tachycardia as well.\n\nPanic attacks can produce similar symptoms\u2014palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, and cognitive symptoms\u2014but are typically associated with emotional stressors or anxiety, which the patient denies as triggers.\n\nOther arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation usually occur in older patients or with underlying heart disease; the episodes being sudden and paroxysmal argue more for PSVT-type arrhythmia.\n\nOrthostatic hypotension or vasovagal syncope would rely on positional factors or prodromal symptoms, which are not reported here. The episodes occur at rest and are not related to standing or position changes.\n\nMetabolic causes or electrolyte abnormalities can cause such symptoms but usually have additional systemic manifestations.\n\nGiven the clarification and clinical picture, PSVT emerges as the most likely diagnosis.\n\nANSWER: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)",

    "input": "THINKING: The patient presents with sudden episodes of rapid heart rate (palpitations), shortness of breath, and dizziness without syncope. The episodes begin and end abruptly, even at rest. These characteristics suggest a paroxysmal event rather than a continuous or progressive condition.\n\nThe main possibilities to consider include:\n\n1. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT): Classically characterized by sudden onset and termination of rapid heart rate, often with palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Episodes can occur at rest and are brief to moderate in duration. This fits well with the patient's presentation.\n\n2. Panic attacks: Can cause palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness; episodes can be abrupt in onset and offset. However, panic attacks usually have associated psychological symptoms (fear, anxiety) and may last longer. The vignette does not mention anxiety or fear.\n\n3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): Also causes rapid heartbeat and symptoms. Usually associated with underlying heart disease and may cause syncope. VT episodes may not have sudden offset but usually require intervention to terminate. Less likely given no loss of consciousness or mentioned heart disease.\n\n4. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Usually has irregular rhythm, often longer episodes, and less likely to start and stop abruptly on their own. Unlikely given description.\n\n5. Orthostatic hypotension or other causes of dizziness: Less likely to cause palpitations or abrupt episodes at rest.\n\nTherefore, PSVT is the most consistent diagnosis given the episodic, abrupt nature of palpitations and associated symptoms at rest.\n\nANSWER: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)",

    "input": "THINKING: The patient reports sudden episodes of rapid heart rate with associated shortness of breath and dizziness, without syncope. The newly reported symptoms of chest tightness and a pounding sensation in the neck or throat during episodes are very suggestive of an arrhythmia. The rapid heart rate with palpitations and pounding sensation in the neck likely corresponds with atrial contraction against a closed or partially closed AV valve, which is classically seen in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), particularly AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).\n\nThe shortness of breath and dizziness can be explained by reduced cardiac output during these episodes. The absence of syncope argues against more malignant arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or high-grade heart block causing pauses. Chest tightness may be due to transient ischemia from tachycardia but does not strongly suggest acute coronary syndrome given the episodic nature and lack of persistent symptoms.\n\nOther differential diagnoses include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia. However, AF and flutter usually produce irregular rhythm and may not cause the pounding neck sensation. Ventricular tachycardia tends to cause more severe symptoms, often syncope or hemodynamic instability.\n\nLess likely are non-cardiac causes such as anxiety or panic attacks because the pounding sensation in the neck is an objective sign of arrhythmia. Thyrotoxicosis can cause tachycardia but would be more persistent.\n\nGiven the symptoms fit best with an arrhythmia causing sudden onset episodes of rapid HR, typical PSVT or AVNRT fits best. Further confirmation would come from ECG during episodes.\n\nANSWER: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)",

Without an update, I must rely on the prior data already discussed over the course of the prior turns.

    "input": "THINKING: The patient describes episodic rapid heart rate episodes characterized by sudden onset and offset, occurring at rest, with symptoms including palpitations, chest tightness, throat pounding, and dizziness, but notably no syncope. There is no family history of sudden cardiac events, and prior cardiac imaging was normal, which makes structural heart disease less likely.\n\nThe abrupt onset and termination of rapid heart rate episodes strongly suggest paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), specifically atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). These arrhythmias often cause palpitations described as rapid and regular, with symptoms of chest discomfort and dizziness from transient decreased cardiac output during tachycardia.\n\nThe absence of syncope points away from more malignant arrhythmias or sustained ventricular tachycardia. The lack of structural heart disease or family history reduces the probability of inherited arrhythmias like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or channelopathies (e.g., long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), although they can sometimes be silent on imaging.\n\nThe chest tightness and throat pounding are common subjective symptoms due to the rapid heart rate.\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) typically presents with irregularly irregular palpitations rather than sudden onset and cessation of a regular tachycardia. The vignette implies episodes start and stop abruptly, more consistent with a reentrant SVT than AF.\n\nSinus tachycardia, even paroxysmal, rarely starts and stops suddenly without an inciting factor such as exercise or stress and is less likely at rest.\n\nAdditional workup may involve ambulatory ECG monitoring to capture the episodes and electrophysiology study if diagnosis remains unclear or if catheter ablation is considered.\n\nGiven the above, the most probable diagnosis is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, most likely AVNRT.\n\nANSWER: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (AVNRT)",

    "input": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of recurrent episodes of sudden-onset and sudden-offset rapid heart rate strongly suggests a paroxysmal arrhythmia. The symptoms of chest tightness, pounding in the chest and throat, and dizziness are consistent with a tachyarrhythmia that transiently impairs cardiac output and causes symptomatic palpitations. The episodes occur both at rest and during work without obvious triggers, which makes exertional or stress-induced arrhythmias less likely to be the only cause.\n\nKey features to consider:\n\n- Sudden onset and offset: This characteristic points to a reentrant tachycardia rather than sinus tachycardia or gradual-onset arrhythmias.\n\n- Rapid heart rate with palpitations and chest symptoms: Suggests a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) such as AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT).\n\n- Dizziness without syncope: Suggests transient drop in cardiac output but no complete cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\n- No known family history of sudden cardiac death: Lowers suspicion for inherited channelopathies or structural cardiomyopathies causing arrhythmias.\n\n- No vagal maneuvers attempted: Vagal maneuvers are the first-line non-pharmacologic intervention for AVNRT or AVRT, which supports the consideration of these arrhythmias.\n\nLess likely diagnoses:\n\n- Atrial fibrillation or flutter: These tend to have irregular or more sustained onsets rather than sudden offset. Also commonly less sudden in onset and offset; symptoms might be different.\n\n- Ventricular tachycardia: Usually associated with structural heart disease and more serious symptoms. No mention of structural abnormalities or risk factors.\n\n- Sinus tachycardia: Usually gradual onset related to triggers like anxiety, fever, or exertion, not sudden onset/offset.\n\n- Other rare arrhythmias (e.g., atrial tachycardia): Possible but less common and often less sudden offset.\n\nGiven the clinical picture, the most likely diagnosis is AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which is the most common paroxysmal SVT. This arrhythmia typically presents with sudden onset and offset palpitations accompanied by chest discomfort and lightheadedness. Non-pharmacologic interventions such as vagal maneuvers are quite effective in terminating these episodes.\n\nANSWER: AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)",
