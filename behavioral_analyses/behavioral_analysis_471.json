The descri\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs emotionally charged words like \"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" \"sharp,\" and \"something's torn,\" which suggest amplification of their symptoms. They use detailed descriptions but focus heavily on negative implications, indicating distress. Their descriptions are somewhat elaborate and intense, showing a tendency to emphasize severity.\n- Information flow: They provide abundant detail proactively, expressing fears and concerns without prompting, illustrating an open but emotionally biased narrative. They tend to elaborate on worst-case scenarios, seeking reassurance or validation.\n- Response style: The elaboration is emotional and somewhat dramatic, with a tendency to exaggerate symptom severity. Responses are direct in describing symptoms but filtered through emotional interpretation, which may skew objectivity.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding information; they seem eager to share their fears and symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: The patient does not minimize symptoms; instead, they exaggerate, suggesting they are not downplaying their condition.\n- Amplification patterns: Clear signs include words like \"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" and imagery of torn inside, indicating symptom amplification. Expressions of fear about serious injury also point to catastrophic thinking.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs of embarrassment or shame are present; they seem relatively comfortable discussing their fears.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion or inconsistency in their narrative; their timeline appears coherent.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence affecting responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main communication bias is anxious amplification, as they significantly overstate their symptoms' severity driven by fear and health anxiety.\n- Severity: Moderate, because while they show heightened emotional response, their reports remain internally consistent and detailed, not grossly deceptive.\n- Areas most affected: Symptom severity perception and concern about serious injury are most biased, due to their catastrophizing language.\n- Reliability: Slightly compromised; their emotional distress and anxiety skew their perception, so clinical assessment should consider potential overestimation of symptoms.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: They may not fully acknowledge coping mechanisms or mild symptoms, focusing instead on their fears. They might underreport less severe or improving symptoms due to the focus on worst-case outcomes.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The actual physical pathology might be less severe than described; pain and dysfunction may be overstated due to anxiety amplification.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their fear of a tear or serious injury is likely exaggerated; their focus on catastrophic possibilities inflates perceived severity.\n- True timeline: The onset seems gradual and consistent, but their emotional interpretation may distort causality or progression, making actual symptoms appear worse than they are."

This mix indicates an emotional overlay that influences their description.\n- Information flow: The responses seem forthcoming when asked about specific symptoms but are infused with emotional concerns, potentially leading to overemphasis on negative possibilities. Their explanations are organized around their worries, which may bias response content.\n- Response style: They tend to elaborate when discussing fears but might understate milder symptoms or past history, leading to a skewed perception of severity.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Possible reluctance to disclose previous minor or non-serious episodes, possibly to maintain focus on their current crisis or due to anxiety.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying initial symptoms (\"small ache,\" \"not that bad\") to appear more resilient or to avoid seeming overly worried.\n- Amplification patterns: Repeated emphasis on symptom worsening and fears of tearing or serious damage, likely to seek reassurance or validate their health anxiety.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit evidence, but reticence to detail past minor symptoms might suggest discomfort discussing previous health issues.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No obvious signs; responses are consistent but self-focused on emotional worries.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence, though their heightened concern hints at possible external influence of anxiety or family fears.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be anxious amplification\u2014overestimating severity due to health anxiety.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014while responses are elaborative and emotionally charged, they do not appear to intentionally deceive but are influenced by anxiety.\n- Areas most affected: Perceived severity and progression of symptoms, with emotional concerns amplifying perceived threat.\n- Reliability: Moderately compromised; responses are heavily colored by anxiety, suggesting caution in relying solely on their self-reports without objective findings.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully disclosing previous minor or non-serious issues that could contextualize current symptoms.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Mild or intermittent symptoms might be underreported, especially if they seem insignificant in comparison to their current concerns.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Severity and danger of the injury are likely exaggerated, driven by anxiety rather than clinical evidence.\n- True timeline: Actual symptom progression may be more gradual and less severe than perceived, as their emotional response may distort the timeline.\nThis analysis indicates the patient has moderate anxiety-driven bias likely to exaggerate seriousness, which should be managed with reassurance and careful evaluation to avoid unnecessary alarm or interventions."

They rely heavily on emotional descriptors rather than clinical details.\n- Information flow: Responses are organized but tend to focus on emotional impact rather than specific details about activities or functional limitations. They are forthcoming but emotionally charged, emphasizing worsening and concern.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborative, with emotional overtones meant to garner sympathy or reassurance; they tend to repeat concerns and focus on perceived severity rather than objective facts.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No explicit withholding, but use of vagueness and minimization indicates internal filtering or reluctance to fully specify details.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying initial pain with \"just a little sore,\" possibly to avoid seeming overly dramatic or to minimize initial concern.\n- Amplification patterns: Repeated emphasis on \"so sharp,\" \"worse,\" and \"really worried\" suggest emotional amplification driven possibly by anxiety rather than purely objective changes.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the anxious tone might reflect discomfort with severity or fear of diagnosis.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; responses are coherent and consistent regarding timeline and symptoms.\n- Family influence: Not directly indicated; responses seem primarily internally driven.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, as detailed by exaggerated concern about severity and constant focus on worsening, likely intensifying perceived severity.\n- Severity: Moderate; emotional overlay influences perceived symptoms but responses remain relatively coherent.\n- Areas most affected: Severity assessment and timeline perception, due to emotional overemphasis.\n- Reliability: Moderately trustworthy; emotional distress influences reporting, though consistent details suggest some accuracy.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient may not fully disclose how functional limitations have affected daily life or overdo their perceived severity, possibly missing subtler signs of progression.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Actual baseline discomfort or early symptoms might be understated because of initial language minimizing minor issues.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their fear of serious injury like tears or ruptures exceeds typical clinical probability, amplified by emotional distress.\n- True timeline: Likely the symptoms have progressed gradually without sudden escalation; their focus on worsening might be an emotional overstatement."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze these responses carefully. The patient repeatedly uses words like \"just\" (\"just started slowly\"), \"kind of\" (\"maybe three weeks ago\"), and describes symptoms in vague or non-specific te\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs both vague and emotional language, such as \"kind of started,\" \"really bad,\" and \"worried it\u2019s something serious,\" mixing non-specific descriptors with visibly heightened concern. This pattern indicates emotional amplification of their symptoms, potentially to seek reassurance or express anxiety.\n- Information flow: They tend to answer questions directly but with emotional qualifiers, providing only the information they think is relevant while emphasizing concern. They don't appear intentionally reluctant to share but focus heavily on their fears, which may overshadow factual accuracy.\n- Response style: The responses are elaborative in emotional content but somewhat narrative, emphasizing the progression and their fears, which suggests a response style that is driven by anxiety and emotional expression rather than clinical detail.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: There\u2019s limited evidence of withholding specific details; responses seem open but emotionally charged, perhaps suggesting they are not deliberately hiding information but are overwhelmed by worry.\n- Minimization behaviors: Not prominent; they acknowledge worsening symptoms and specific signs like nighttime pain and difficulty moving, which counters minimization.\n- Amplification patterns: Clearly present; the patient accentuates the severity (\"really bad,\" \"worried it's serious,\" \"get worse,\" \"tear or something terrible\"), likely driven by anxiety rather than objective severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, though emotional distress indicates vulnerability.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight indications of possible cognitive distortion about timelines (\"maybe three weeks ago,\" \"kind of started\") but nothing severe.\n- Family influence: No evidence of external influence or pressure affecting responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification (anxious_amplifier); responses are influenced by health-related fears leading to exaggerated perceived severity.\n- Severity: Moderate; emotional concern shapes their perception significantly, possibly leading to overestimation of danger but factual symptom description remains fairly consistent.\n- Areas most affected: The perception of worsening and severity, especially fears of tears or fractures, which may not be objectively justified at this point.\n- Reliability: Moderate; they provide consistent symptom descriptions but are heavily influenced by emotional bias, which can distort their perception of severity.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: They may not acknowledge some functional limitations or the true impact on daily activities if they are overwhelmed by worry. Also, they might under-report reassurance needs or focus overly on worst-case scenarios.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Physical findings are quite specific, so actual severity isn't likely understated; but their emotional overlay may exaggerate the perceived danger.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their fears of serious injury like tears and fractures are overemphasized, likely driven by anxiety rather than clinical signs at this stage.\n- True timeline: The patient's perceived progression aligns with an actual gradual onset, but their emotional reaction magnifies the concern. The timeline proposed is plausible but framed through fear, which influences their reporting.\nOverall, these responses reflect a moderate level of anxiety-driven amplification. The patient is quite emotional about their symptoms, which skews perception but does not fundamentally prevent sharing key information."

Their responses are detailed and organized but colored with concern.\n- Response style: They elaborate when discussing symptoms and fears, often adding emotional commentary, which might reflect anxious overthinking rather than purely objective reporting.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; they share fears openly, but they may minimize present symptoms at times (e.g., \"not that bad\"), which could mask ongoing issues.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just a little sore\" and \"not that bad\" suggests an attempt to downplay baseline discomfort, possibly to avoid appearing overly worried or to prevent overreacting.\n- Amplification patterns: Descriptive phrases like \"really bad\" and \"terrible\" in context of worsening pain suggest exaggeration driven by anxiety, which could lead to overestimations of injury severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: None explicit, but fluctuating tone hints at internal discomfort and possibly shame about overreacting or fears about injury.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No apparent inconsistencies; the timeline of symptom development seems consistent.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence from responses, but their preoccupation with worst-case scenarios could be influenced by concern (real or perceived) from others.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: **Anxious amplification**, characterized by overemphasis on severe injury fears and emotional distress influencing symptom description.\n- Severity: **Moderate**, as emotional overlay is significant but not overwhelming, with some effort to report symptoms honestly.\n- Areas most affected: The perceived severity of pain, nighttime worsening, and injury seriousness are distorted by worry.\n- Reliability: Self-reports are somewhat trustworthy for the basic timeline but likely overstate the severity and implications of symptoms due to anxiety.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient might not be accurately reporting minimal or baseline pain levels or functional status during everyday activities when anxiety is less active.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Actual functional limitations or pain intensity outside of peak worry moments may be understated.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Fear of major tears or catastrophic injury is heightened, possibly making clinical decisions based on exaggerated concerns.\n- True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but emotional factors could cause perception to be more severe than reality, warranting objective verification."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will systematically dissect the patient's responses to uncover subtle communication biases such as amplification, minimization, or withholding of information that co\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged descriptors like \"terrible\" and \"unbreakable,\" which amplify their experience of pain. There is a tendency to exaggerate discomfort, likely driven by anxiety. The response is detailed, indicating a desire to be fully understood, but emotionally influenced descriptions dominate.\n- Information flow: They are forthcoming with descriptive details about pain characteristics, activities that worsen symptoms, and emotional concerns. Their explanations are organized, with a logical focus on pain severity and fears.\n- Response style: The patient elaborates extensively, providing emotional context alongside symptom descriptions, emphasizing their distress. They avoid minimizing or deflecting, but their language hints at amplified concern.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; responses are comprehensive.\n- Minimization behaviors: Mild, as \"it just hurts all the time\" might suggest downplaying intermittent or less severe symptoms but overall they express considerable distress.\n- Amplification patterns: Strong\u2014use of terms like \"terrible,\" \"unbreakable,\" \"worst,\" which suggest they are over-emphasizing symptoms out of anxiety or fear.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; they are open about symptoms and fears.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Absent; responses are consistent.\n- Family influence: Not explicitly evident but their high distress level might be influenced by personal or external fears about severity.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant bias is 'anxious amplifier,' with emotional distress influencing symptom severity perception and communication.\n- Severity: Moderate, as emotional exaggeration is present but responses remain largely consistent and specific.\n- Areas most affected: The perception of pain severity, fear of serious injury, and overall distress are most biased.\n- Reliability: Self-reporting should be considered with caution; while detailed, emotional bias suggests they may overstate the urgency or severity of symptoms.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Subtle functional limitations or episodic symptoms may be understated if the patient focuses on worst-case fears.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Less dramatic signs, such as minor stiffness or asymptomatic periods, may be underreported due to focus on distress.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Fears of tears or severe damage are likely exaggerated; entry of emotional distress influences their perception disproportionately.\n- True timeline: Progression appears consistent with impingement syndrome, probably accurately reported; no substantive discrepancy detected.\nThis analysis suggests that while the patient's reports are detailed and emotionally charged, they are influenced by anxiety amplification, which may lead to overestimation of symptom severity and associated fears."

    "analysis": "THINKING: The patient's responses, characterized by consistent anxiety amplification, reveal certain patterns. They tend to use emotionally charged language (\"terrible,\" \"unbreakable,\" \"scared\") that heightens \nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: They favor emotional and dramatic language (\"terrible pain,\" \"unbreakable,\" \"scary\"), emphasizing the severity, which indicates amplification rather than minimization. They provide specific descriptions of pain qualities and weakness, showing willingness to share details but through an emotionally charged lens.\n- Information flow: Their responses are detailed and organized, directly answering questions, which suggests a tendency to fully disclose information. They seem motivated to emphasize how serious their symptoms feel, influencing how much they reveal.\n- Response style: Their answers are elaborate and emotionally expressive, often emphasizing fear and frustration, which may reinforce the perception of heightened concern.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; responses are thorough and consistent.\n- Minimization behaviors: Absent; they do not downplay symptoms but instead accentuate them.\n- Amplification patterns: Clear, as seen in their use of words like \"terrible,\" \"unbreakable,\" \"really scary,\" and \"just can't do it properly,\" indicating overestimation of severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Not apparent; responses are open and expressive without signs of discomfort.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident signs; responses are coherent and consistent.\n- Family influence: Not directly indicated but their focus on worst-case scenarios might reflect internal anxiety or external concerns.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Amplification bias, as indicated by their tendency to exaggerate symptoms and emotional impact.\n- Severity: Moderate to severe, given their emotionally charged language and expression of fear, which can distort the accurate assessment.\n- Areas most affected: Perceived severity of pain, weakness, and potential for serious injury. They may overestimate functional impairment.\n- Reliability: Moderate; while they clearly describe actual symptoms, their emotional overlay suggests their perception is skewed toward hyperbole, warranting cautious interpretation.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of less severe symptoms or functional limitations, as focus remains on worst-case scenarios. They may also avoid mention of minor improvements.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Not many, but they might understate baseline function when not anxious, though their responses suggest high concern overall.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their fears about serious damage, inability to play sports, and potential for worse injury appear exaggerated, likely driven by anxiety.\n- True timeline: The gradual onset over three weeks aligns with typical impingement progress, but their perception of severity may inflate the true functional impact. The emotional response may distort the assessment of current state versus actual impairment."

They also incorporate vague phrases (\"sort of,\" \"like\") indicating some uncertainty or emotional magnification. Responses are detailed but colored by anxiety, making it challenging to discern purely physical versus emotional concern.\n- Information flow: The patient is forthcoming and elaborative, providing detailed narratives about their fears and physical sensations. Their responses are organized around specific questions but heavily flavored by emotional reaction. They do not seem reluctant to share, but their responses are likely influenced by their anxiety.\n- Response style: They give elaborate, emotionally laden explanations that tend to emphasize the severity and instability. This pattern suggests an over-interpretation of symptoms driven by fear rather than intentional concealment.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; they appear willing to share details openly. However, emotional exaggerations could mask actual clinical facts.\n- Minimization behaviors: Not evident; instead, they tend to overstate symptoms and fears.\n- Amplification patterns: Strong evidence\u2014the repeated use of words like \"worst,\" \"scary,\" \"collapse,\" and \"might drop things\" indicates exaggeration of severity, likely driven by anxiety.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No evident signs of discomfort about discussing symptoms; their tone suggests openness but emotional reactivity.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No signs; responses are coherent and consistent across questions.\n- Family influence: Not directly indicated, but emotional tone could be influenced by concerns about family or close others, typical in anxious patients.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Emotional amplifying bias\u2014over-exaggeration of symptom severity due to anxiety and fear.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014while responses are detailed and emotionally intense, actual physical signs may be less severe. Emotional distortion may lead to overestimating urgency or danger.\n- Areas most affected: Perceived stability and weakness of shoulder\u2014patients describe it as unstable or prone to \"collapse,\" which may reflect their emotional state more than objective instability.\n- Reliability: Their self-report should be interpreted cautiously; emotional bias likely inflates perceived severity but does reflect genuine distress that merits attention.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Nuanced or objective assessments of actual weakness and instability; the patient's emotional response may be coloring their perception, hiding less alarming physical aspects.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The physical deficits may be less severe than portrayed; their emotional state could be exaggerating functional risk.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their fears about shoulder \"collapse\" and \"giving out\" likely overstate actual mechanical instability.\n- True timeline: The progression seems consistent but may be emotionally overdramatized, making the symptoms seem worse or more threatening than they are."

Their language also contains vagueness (\"sort of,\" \"like\") which softens certainty but may mask true somatic sensations.\n- Information flow: They are forthcoming with fears and concerns but tend to frame their symptoms in worst-case scenarios, possibly overstating severity. Their responses are organized around their emotional response rather than factual description, showing a pattern of amplifying fears.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborate, driven by emotional content rather than objective descriptors. They seem to exaggerate symptoms and potential outcomes, with a pattern of escalating descriptions when discussing instability or weakness.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear withholding noted; instead, they openly express fears, but the intensity suggests possible cognitive bias rather than deliberate withholding.\n- Minimization behaviors: None observed; instead, the patient overly emphasizes symptoms and fears, so minimization is unlikely.\n- Amplification patterns: Strong, consistent exaggeration of risk (\"shoulder might just totally collapse,\" \"pop out or give way\"), indicating an amplification bias influenced by anxiety.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Not evident; responses focus on fear and anxiety rather than shame.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion or memory issues; responses are consistent and align with reported symptoms.\n- Family influence: Not explicitly indicated, but their emotional tone suggests internalization of concern, possibly influenced by external anxieties or prior experiences.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Anxious amplifier bias, as the patient overstates fears of catastrophic failure and responds with heightened emotional concern.\n- Severity: Moderate to severe, given the intensity of emotional language and the exaggeration of risks that could distort clinical assessment.\n- Areas most affected: Perception of instability and dislocation risk are most biased, potentially leading to overestimating threat severity.\n- Reliability: Self-report is somewhat compromised due to heightened emotional bias, so interpretations of their fears should be tempered with objective clinical findings.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Objective signs of actual instability or dislocation, as their focus is on worst-case fears rather than slight or manageable symptoms.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Their concern about actual structural damage might be accurate, but the emotional response could lead to overestimating severity.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Fear of shoulder collapse or dislocation is exaggerated; clinical signs may be less severe than perceived.\n- True timeline: The actual window of symptom progression appears consistent with gradual worsening, but their perception of imminent disaster likely overstates the real risk."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:\n\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\nThe patient employs emotionally charged and amplifying language, such as \"scary\" and \"really nervous,\" indicating heightened anxiety. Phrase\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged, amplification language such as \"scary,\" \"really nervous,\" \"gonna pop out,\" indicating high anxiety levels. Vague descriptors like \"sort of,\" \"kind of,\" show uncertainty.\n- Information flow: Responses are fairly elaborative but focused heavily on fears; they tend to emphasize worst-case scenarios rather than straightforward symptom descriptions, providing mixed signals about objectivity.\n- Response style: They tend to elaborate and seek reassurance actively, which may influence the perception of symptoms by highlighting fears over factual details.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient may be withholding non-threatening information due to fear, emphasizing their instability fears.\n- Minimization behaviors: They acknowledge moments without pain but immediately overlay that with fears of worse injury, suggesting downplaying clinical severity in favor of emotional distress.\n- Amplification patterns: Frequent descriptors of instability as \"gonna pop out\" or \"give way\" with emotional language indicates exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs.\n- Family influence: No evidence.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be amplification, driven by anxiety about joint stability and injury.\n- Severity: Moderate to severe, as emotional distress significantly shapes their perception of physical symptoms.\n- Areas most affected: Perceived joint instability/shifting and fears of dislocation are most biased.\n- Reliability: Their self-report should be interpreted cautiously; emotional overlays may overstate true mechanical instability.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient's fear-driven exaggeration suggests they may be underreporting objective stability or misjudging their actual mechanical status.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: They may be minimizing the physical severity if they are overly focused on worst-case fears.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about dislocation and collapse appears overblown relative to clinical findings.\n- True timeline: The progression seems consistent with impingement, but their emotional responses could have created an inflated perception of severity and instability."
