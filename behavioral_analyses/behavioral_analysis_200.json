    "analysis": "THINKING: Using Chain of Thought analysis, I will systematically evaluate the patient's communication patterns.\n\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:  \n- Minimizing language: The patient uses words like \"just\" (\"looking\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient prefers narrative storytelling, using specific details about the incident but avoids direct, clinically precise descriptions of symptoms. They use straightforward and somewhat neutral language, which facilitates understanding but may obscure symptom severity.\n- Information flow: Responses are elaborated and somewhat scattered, with a tendency to include tangential details (\"looking for something,\" \"found this spray in garage\"). This indicates comfort with storytelling but may hinder clarity about critical symptoms.\n- Response style: The patient tends to elaborate with detailed storytelling rather than concise symptom reporting, which suggests a tendency to frame their experience within a narrative context rather than straightforward clinical terms.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The narrative-centered responses may mask the true extent of emotional or physiological distress, indicating possible reluctance to share full severity or emotional impact directly.\n- Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms as feeling \"all weird\" and focusing on the incident rather than symptoms' impact suggests they are downplaying how serious their experience is.\n- Amplification patterns: The concern about \"not feeling like myself\" signals worry but isn't exaggerated; there's no evidence of over-worry or catastrophic thinking here.\n- Embarrassment/shame: No evident signs; the patient appears willing to discuss the incident openly, though their focus on storytelling might be a way to buffer emotional exposure.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The consistency of confusion and forgetfulness suggests these symptoms are genuine; no indication of fabricating or minimizing these.\n- Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Narrative or storytelling bias to contextualize symptoms and incident, possibly leading to underreporting or minimization of the severity of symptoms.\n- Severity: Moderate, as responses are detailed but may obscure the true severity or emotional impact; some underestimation likely.\n- Areas most affected: Symptom impact and emotional response are likely understated; the focus on story suggests these may be less severe than reported.\n- Reliability: Moderate; while the patient provides coherent information, the narrative style suggests some degree of emotional buffering or minimization, affecting accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise descriptions of emotional distress, the specific severity and duration of cognitive and psychomotor symptoms, and their impact on daily functioning.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of delirium and emotional disturbance may be greater than the narrative indicates.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about \"not feeling like myself\" is genuine but may not fully match the clinical severity; they might worry more than the symptoms warrant or vice versa.\n- True timeline: The onset was sudden after inhalation, but the patient\u2019s storytelling may mask the true progression or persistence of symptoms, potentially leading to underestimation of ongoing issues.\nIn summary, the patient demonstrates a storytelling communication style, likely leading to moderate underreporting of symptom severity, primarily in emotional and functional domains. Their focus on the incident suggests a tendency to frame their experience in a particular light, necessitating careful probing to uncover the full clinical picture."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Let me analyze the patient's responses carefully, focusing on language, response patterns, and potential biases. The patient presents as a tangential storyteller, providing extensive details about his\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and non-specific language (\"kinda,\" \"all weird,\" \"like\"), which reduces clarity. There's a tendency to downplay symptoms (\"kinda the same\") and avoid emphasizing severity. Emotional cues are minimal, indicating possible discomfort or reluctance to express distress openly.\n- Information flow: Responses are somewhat scattered, primarily focusing on incident details rather than current symptom impact. The detailed storytelling about the event suggests a focus on external facts over internal feelings.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborative when recounting the incident but brief and somewhat vague regarding ongoing symptoms. The storytelling approach indicates a tendency toward tangential responses, possibly to deflect from admitting ongoing distress.\nBEHAVIORAL INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Evidence of reluctance to acknowledge ongoing or worsening symptoms; the phrase \"kinda the same\" minimizes activity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptom severity and impact through vague language, which could mask true ongoing issues.\n- Amplification patterns: None evident; responses do not show overt exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Not explicit, but the vagueness and avoidance could indicate some discomfort with acknowledging the full extent of symptoms.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Repetition of the notion that symptoms are unchanged suggests limited perception of progress; little indication of confusion about factual timeline.\n- Family influence: Mention of wife\u2019s observation hints at external validation, but no significant evidence that this influences responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Likely minimization bias, as the patient appears to underreport or downplay persistent symptoms.\n- Severity: Moderate, since the patient provides some details but minimizes symptom severity and progression.\n- Areas most affected: The ongoing severity, impact, and progression of symptoms are most biased, potentially obscuring true clinical status.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses should be interpreted with caution, considering possible underreporting.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Full extent of ongoing symptoms, emotional impact, and functional impairment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Current symptom intensity and activity limitations.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Not evident; the patient appears relatively resigned or indifferent, possibly hiding concerns.\n- True timeline: Symptoms may be fluctuating or more severe than conveyed; patient\u2019s minimization limits an accurate picture.\nOverall, I should probe further with more specific, direct questions about functional impairment and symptom impact, while being mindful of the patient's tendency to minimize or avoid uncomfortable disclosures."

The emotional language, such as \"worried\" and \"feeling all weird,\" conveys distress but may obscure precise symptom details.\n- Information flow: Responses are somewhat reluctant and scattershot; the patient responds with minimal elaboration unless prompted, indicating hesitance or uncertainty. The answers are organized primarily around their subjective feelings but lack specific clinical details.\n- Response style: They tend to be elaborative in a storytelling manner but remain non-specific and somewhat circumstantial, with repetitions. The narrative includes emotional cues but avoids precise symptom quantification.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient's use of vague terms and reluctance to specify severity or timeline details point to withholding or minimizing certain aspects.\n- Minimization behaviors: The frequent use of diminutive language (\u201ckinda,\u201d \u201cjust,\u201d \u201csort of\u201d) suggests an automatic tendency to downplay symptoms or discomfort.\n- Amplification patterns: Expressions of worry and statements like \"it\u2019s not going to go away\" might be exaggerated to express distress beyond objectivity, possibly inflating concern levels.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but their discomfort with providing specifics might imply some embarrassment about their condition or confusion.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Admitted difficulty recalling the exact experience timeline and details, consistent with cognitive impairment, but their phrases might also conceal uncertainty or lack of insight.\n- Family influence: External comments from the spouse are noted but do not appear to distort self-reporting significantly.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main communication bias is a combination of minimization and vague reporting, likely compounded by emotional amplification.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014these biases hinder accurate symptom quantification and timeline reconstruction, compromising the reliability of self-report.\n- Most affected areas: Details regarding symptom intensity, progression, and specific cognitive or psychomotor features are most biased; the patient\u2019s reluctance to elaborate hampers clinical interpretation.\n- Reliability: Moderate\u2014responses provide useful but incomplete and potentially understated data, requiring corroboration from objective findings and collateral information.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise severity of cognitive and psychomotor symptoms, exact timing of symptom fluctuations, and full extent of distress.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of cognitive fog, agitation, or discomfort may be worse than reported.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The expressed worry about duration might be heightened to solicit reassurance, not purely rational concern.\n- True timeline: The actual course may involve more persistent or fluctuating symptoms, but the patient\u2019s vague language obscures this, underscoring the need for objective assessment."

This pattern suggests difficulty organizing thoughts or an attempt to create a narrative that minimizes clarity.\n- Response style: They favor narrative elaboration, sometimes over-explaining or introducing unrelated memories, rather than providing concise, direct answers to specific questions. Their style reflects possible discomfort or cognitive disorganization.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient avoids precise temporal details (\"it's hard to say exactly,\" \"probably started\"), indicating protective withholding possibly to avoid admitting severity or specific concerns.\n- Minimization behaviors: Repeated vague responses suggest an effort to downplay the clarity or intensity of symptoms, perhaps to manage social discomfort with their distress (\"it's all jumbled,\" \"kind of the same\").\n- Amplification patterns: Their emotional language (\"worried,\" \"scattered\") may serve to magnify concern, possibly seeking reassurance, but can also reflect genuine distress.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt shame but some reluctance to specify details hints at discomfort with admitting cognitive or behavioral difficulties.\n- Confusion/memory issues: They express difficulty recalling exact timelines, consistent with cognitive impairment, but responses might also reflect emotional overload.\n- Family influence: The mention of their wife\u2019s observations suggests someone's influence on their self-assessment, which might shape their narrative or response tone.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization and narrative distortion, with some emotional amplification.\n- Severity: Moderate, as the responses are noticeably vague and tangential, affecting the accuracy of symptom assessment.\n- Areas most affected: Timeline and severity of symptoms are notably biased, making it difficult to determine precise progression.\n- Reliability: Self-reporting should be considered with caution; responses are likely influenced by emotional state, response style, and possible cognitive disorganization.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact onset times, precise symptom severity, and progression details are probably underreported or vague.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The patient's effort to be non-specific may conceal more severe or persistent cognitive and behavioral disturbances.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Expressions of worry and scattered responses may overstate their distress or anxiety levels.\n- True timeline: Actual symptom onset may have been earlier or more severe, but their narrative suggests delayed or incomplete disclosure.\nIn summary, the patient exhibits response patterns characterized by vagueness, emotional expression, and narrative tangentiality, indicating moderate biases\u2014primarily minimization and emotional amplification\u2014that impact the reliability of self-report. These biases suggest the need for corroborative assessment and careful interpretation of their symptom history."

    "analysis": "THINKING: Use Chain of Thought Analysis:\n\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\nExamining patient responses, the language is characterized by vagueness and some emotional expression. Phrases like \"I don\u2019t know,\" \"kind of\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient relies heavily on vague, non-specific terms like \"kind of,\" \"a bit,\" \"all jumbled up,\" and \"hard to say.\" There is some emotional language, with phrases expressing distress (\"losing my mind,\" \"worried it\u2019s not gonna go away\"), indicating emotional involvement but limited clinical detail.\n- Information flow: Responses are somewhat scattered, with signs of difficulty recalling exact details. They tend to provide broad strokes rather than precise timelines, possibly reflecting internal confusion or discomfort. The responses are organized in a thematic manner but lack specificity.\n- Response style: The answers are generally brief and somewhat rambling, with a tendency toward tangential storytelling, especially when mentioning reactions or related thoughts (e.g., recalling a relative). There is no indication of deliberate deception but rather possible cognitive overload or emotional distress interfering with clarity.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient\u2019s reluctance to specify exact times or describe symptom progression precisely suggests some withholding, likely due to uncertainty or discomfort in recalling details.\n- Minimization behaviors: There\u2019s minimal evidence of symptom minimization; rather, the patient appears to be emphasizing their distress more than downplaying symptoms.\n- Amplification patterns: The emotional expressions like \"losing my mind\" and \"kinda scattered\" could be seen as exaggerations of distress, possibly amplifying perceived severity but rooted in genuine discomfort.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs indicate shame or embarrassment; responses seem to reflect distress rather than secrecy.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Clear evidence of cognitive impairment affecting recall; the patient admits difficulty in pinpointing start dates and progression (\"hard to say exactly\"). The vague timeline suggests real cognitive distraction.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence within responses of family affecting responses, though references to emotional distress might be related to personal history or internalized feelings.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Emotional amplification and response vagueness due to distress and cognitive impairment. The patient\u2019s emotional state influences their perception and reporting of symptoms.\n- Severity: Moderate bias, as distress distorts precise recall but does not appear to be consciously manipulative.\n- Areas most affected: Timeline and symptom severity, given vagueness and emotional distress, affecting the accuracy of exact onset and progression.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses are plausible but clouded by emotional distress and cognitive scatter, so their self-report should be interpreted with caution.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise timing, severity, and progression of symptoms are underreported or vague, possibly due to cognitive confusion.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The patient may understate how severe or persistent the symptoms are, as they focus on feelings of being \"scattered\" and \"losing their mind,\" which might be more intense or prolonged.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress may lead to over-worrying about lasting effects (\"it\u2019s not gonna go away\"), potentially inflating perceived helplessness.\n- True timeline: The reported timeline appears compressed and possibly inaccurate; symptoms could have developed more rapidly or been more severe than described, but emotional distress obscures this."

    "analysis": "THINKING: To analyze these patient responses, I will systematically evaluate the language they use, response patterns, and possible biases that may influence their disclosures. The responses are characterized b\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient tends to use vague, non-specific language with phrases like \"kind of,\" \"sort of,\" \"I think,\" and \"maybe,\" which diminish the clarity of symptom severity and timeline. This indicates possible discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose or analyze their symptoms.\n- Information flow: The responses are scattered, elaborating on tangential topics such as family activities or unrelated memories, rather than directly answering questions. This suggests a tendency to deflect or avoid committing to precise details.\n- Response style: They provide lengthy, somewhat rambling responses with frequent tangents, demonstrating a tendency to distract from core symptoms and possibly manage emotional discomfort.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient's vagueness and tangential storytelling suggest an inclination to withhold or minimize specific symptom details, especially regarding severity and progression.\n- Minimization behaviors: The repeated emphasis on how symptoms are \"the same\" or that they \"feel a bit tired\" may downplay the severity of delirium. Their framing might imply they see the symptoms as less serious than they are.\n- Amplification patterns: There is limited evidence of over-worried exaggeration; responses focus more on underplaying or avoiding severity acknowledgment.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs emerge, but the reluctance to be precise may reflect discomfort with their mental state or feelings of shame about vulnerability.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The use of vague timelines and uncertain recollections highlight actual cognitive impact, compounded by reliance on uncertain memory.\n- Family influence: Mentioning the grandson and outside activities could suggest external factors lightly influence responses, but no direct evidence of family prompting.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization and vagueness, possibly as a defensive response to cognitive and emotional discomfort.\n- Severity: Moderate, given the likelihood of underreporting symptom severity rather than outright fabrication. Response patterns suggest difficulty accurately conveying the full picture.\n- Areas most affected: Precise symptom severity, progression over time, and physical effects are most influenced by bias, leading to possible underappreciation of delirium severity.\n- Reliability: Their self-reporting should be interpreted cautiously; responses are likely somewhat biased toward downplaying symptoms and emotional discomfort.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient probably underreports the true severity of cognitive impairment and physical symptoms, perhaps avoiding details that could be discomforting or concerning.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Delirium effects, especially concerning potential worsening or physical disorientation, may be more severe than expressed.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their concern about feeling \"weird\" might be exaggerated or focused on specific aspects to conceal others, but overall, they might be underestimating overall risk.\n- True timeline: The timeline appears reasonably consistent\u2014symptoms began around the inhalation\u2014but their uncertainty and vagueness suggest actual symptom progression might be more rapid or severe than acknowledged.\nCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and non-specific language (\"kind of,\" \"sort of,\" \"I think\"), minimizing the clarity of their symptoms. Examples include admitting to feeling \"a little\" dizzy but not emphasizing its severity.\n- Information flow: Responses are scattered and tangential, often diverging into unrelated personal stories or memories, indicating difficulty concentrating or discomfort with direct reporting.\n- Response style: They tend to elaborate extensively on unrelated topics, providing long, unfocused answers rather than concise, targeted information.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The vagueness and tangential responses suggest an unconscious tendency to withhold full disclosure, perhaps to avoid confronting the seriousness of their condition.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity (\"symptoms are the same,\" \"I feel a bit tired\") indicates possible minimization to reduce perceived threat or stigma.\n- Amplification patterns: Limited evidence; they seem more inclined to understate rather than exaggerate symptoms.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Reluctance to give precise details may reflect discomfort or shame surrounding their mental state.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The use of uncertain timelines and loosely recalled events reveal genuine cognitive impairment, possibly compounded by response biases.\n- Family influence: Mentioning family and personal activities may serve as distraction, but there's no explicit evidence of family prompting bias.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization and vagueness, aimed at managing emotional discomfort or avoiding anxiety about severity.\n- Severity: Moderate, as response patterns suggest some level of underreporting yet not outright denial.\n- Most affected areas: Symptom severity and timeline accuracy are most biased, impairing reliable assessment.\n- Reliability: Somewhat compromised due to tendency to minimize and avoid precise details; clinical judgment should incorporate this bias.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient probably understates the extent of cognitive and physical symptoms, especially physical disorientation and severity.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Serous delirium effects may be more pronounced than described, potentially escalating unnoticed.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Not directly over-embellished, but their focus on feeling \"weird\" could reflect heightened internal anxiety rather than outward exaggeration.\n- True timeline: The onset is likely accurate around the reported time, but the progression could be more rapid or severe than their indirect responses suggest."

    "analysis": "THINKING: In evaluating the patient's responses, I notice that they frequently use vague language such as \"kind of,\" \"like,\" and \"maybe,\" which suggests a tendency to downplay or soften their descriptions of sy\nANSWER: COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient consistently employs vague and non-specific language (\"kind of,\" \"like,\" \"sort of\") when describing physical symptoms, indicating possible minimization or discomfort discussing complete severity. Their descriptions blend factual reporting with storytelling, which may serve to obscure or soften critical details.\n- Information flow: Responses tend to be scattered and tangential, with the patient drifting into unrelated topics (e.g., family or activities), reflecting response scatter and possibly difficulty focusing. They are somewhat reluctant to directly affirm the severity of their symptoms, often offering additional context to dilute the core concern.\n- Response style: The patient provides elaborated, narrative responses that include extraneous details, suggesting a tendency to embellish or divert, which could hinder precise clinical interpretation.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient omits detailed descriptions of the intensity or impact of physical symptoms, such as dizziness or disorientation, instead qualifying them with vague descriptors. This indicates possible reluctance to fully disclose or over-moderating symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Their frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"just,\" and minimizing language indicates an effort to downplay the symptoms, potentially to avoid appearing overly ill or to reduce concern.\n- Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; rather, the responses lean toward minimization. However, their emphasis on feeling \"all jumpy\" and \"wired\" despite tiredness may reflect an attempt to over-endorse hyperactivity or distress, but it appears contained within overall minimization.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Reluctance to directly describe symptoms' severity may imply discomfort or shame related to health concerns.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The scattered, tangential responses and narrative digressions suggest some cognitive disorganization or difficulty maintaining focus, consistent with delirium or cognitive impairment.\n- Family influence: References to grandchildren and yard work seem to serve as contextual distractions, possibly indicating social influences swaying their reporting.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization, as evidenced by vague, non-specific language and responses that downplay symptom severity. Response scattering and digressions further support response scatter bias.\n- Severity: Moderate bias, since symptoms are acknowledged but not described with full clarity or detail, risking underestimation of actual severity.\n- Areas most affected: Detailed symptom intensity and timeline are most biased, with potential underreporting of worse severity and earlier onset.\n- Reliability: Self-reports should be interpreted with caution because of these communication biases, and corroborative information (e.g., caregiver reports) is advisable.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise descriptions of symptom severity, duration, and impact may be understated. The patient might not be fully comfortable revealing the full extent due to minimization tendencies.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Ongoing confusion or hyperactivity could be more severe than described; the understated language suggests the real experience might be worse.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s frequent references to feeling \"not like myself\" and being \"worried\" could be exaggerated as a way to seek reassurance or due to anxiety about health, but this overcompensation makes interpretation complex.\n- True timeline: The patient's responses indicate some awareness of a sudden onset but the scattered nature and minimization could skew the actual timeline, potentially making earlier or more persistent symptoms less acknowledged.\n- Language choices: The patient's use of vague, hedging language suggests a tendency to minimize or soften their report of symptoms, possibly to avoid alarm or due to discomfort discussing severity.\n- Information flow: Responses are scattered, tangential, and include extraneous details, indicating response scatter and potential difficulty focusing\u2014traits common in cognitive impairment or delirium.\n- Response style: Preferences for narrative elaboration and inclusion of unrelated details point toward a response style that diffuses focus and may obscure clinical clarity.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Evidence of withholding: The vagueness and underemphasis of symptom severity\u2014e.g., \"kind of dizzy\" rather than \"severe dizziness\"\u2014suggest withholding of full extent.\n- Minimization: The frequent qualifiers \"kind of,\" \"just,\" and \"a little\" serve to lessen perceived seriousness, possibly as an internal defense mechanism.\n- Amplification: Minimal evidence here; responses are primarily understatements, but descriptors like \"all jumpy\" might be exaggerated emotional descriptors rather than literal severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame: The reluctance to directly confront or detail symptoms suggests possible embarrassment or shame about health decline.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The scattered, tangential storytelling reflects cognitive disorganization consistent with delirium, indicating genuine confusion.\n- Family influence: References to children and grandchildren seem to serve as contextual distractors and may influence response framing.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias: Minimization bias, driven by vague language and response scatter designed to underreport severity.\n- Severity: Moderate, because while they acknowledge symptoms, their descriptions limit full understanding of actual severity.\n- Most biased areas: Symptom intensity and timeline, which are likely understated.\n- Reliability: Limited reliance on self-reporting alone; clinical assessment and collateral contacts are necessary to ascertain true symptom severity.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Missing info: The full severity and impact of symptoms, especially emotional distress and cognitive impairment, may be underreported.\n- Minimized symptoms: Cognitive disorientation and hyperactivity may be more profound than expressed.\n- Exaggerated concerns: Anxiety about not feeling oneself is evident but might be amplified due to distress rather than actual severity.\n- Timeline concerns: The true progression might involve earlier or more persistent symptoms that the patient minimizes, complicating accurate timeline reconstruction."
