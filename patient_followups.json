    "input": "1. A 28-year-old woman presents to the clinic with frequent episodes of sudden intense fear accompanied by heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness that last about 10 minutes each. She reports feeling an overwhelming sense of doom and worries that she might be having a heart attack during these attacks. These episodes have occurred unpredictably, sometimes when she is alone and other times in crowded places, causing her to avoid social situations. She describes an ongoing fear of future attacks, leading to persistent anxiety and occasional nausea. Her medical history is unremarkable, with no substance use or recent trauma. Physical examination and cardiac workup, including ECG and blood tests, are normal. She expresses frustration as the panic attacks have started to interfere with her work performance and daily activities. Based on her presentation, a diagnosis of panic disorder is considered and further psychiatric evaluation is planned.Do your episodes usually happen during rest, physical activity, or stressful situations, and do you ever lose consciousness or feel like you might faint during these episodes?",
    "output": "Hmm, they mostly seem to happen out of nowhere, like even when I\u2019m just sitting or working. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually fainted, but sometimes I do feel really dizzy and like I might pass out."
