    "output": "THINKING: The patient has presented with eye symptoms following playing soccer, including redness, swelling, and tearing. The initial diagnosis was traumatic ocular injury, likely conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, but the gold standard diagnosis provided is herpes simplex meningitis, which is unrelated to ocular trauma. Since the final diagnosis is herpes simplex meningitis, the eye symptoms may be secondary or coincidental findings. Because herpes simplex meningitis is a serious neurological condition requiring prompt treatment, the ocular symptoms need to be handled concurrently.  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given the connection to herpes simplex meningitis, but ocular symptoms suggest underlying or secondary ocular involvement. - Severity classification: Likely moderate, especially if there is significant eye redness, swelling, and tearing, indicating possible conjunctivitis or stromal involvement; neurological symptoms of herpes simplex meningitis necessitate prompt attention. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed for the meningitis; ocular symptoms should be evaluated promptly to rule out other complications. - Differential considerations: Herpetic keratitis, conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or other ocular infections.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment: Initiate IV antiviral therapy (acyclovir) promptly for herpes simplex meningitis. - Supporting evidence: High-dose acyclovir reduces morbidity and mortality in herpes simplex encephalitis and meningitis. - Patient-specific considerations: Monitor renal function due to the nephrotoxic potential of acyclovir; ocular symptoms may require ophthalmologic evaluation. - Contraindications/cautions: Ensure adequate hydration; adjust dose if renal impairment develops.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Acyclovir IV, 10-15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14-21 days. - Rationale: Proven efficacy in herpes simplex viral infections of the CNS; IV route preferred initially. - Expected timeline for improvement: Neurological symptoms often improve within days; ocular symptom resolution may take days to weeks, depending on severity. - Key side effects: Renal impairment, neurotoxicity, hypersensitivity; monitor renal function and adjust dose accordingly. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Foscarnet or vidarabine, used in resistant cases.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary interventions: Rest, hydration, ocular lubrication (artificial tears), and ophthalmologic consultation for ocular involvement. - Patient education: Importance of adherence to antiviral therapy, hydration, and follow-up assessments. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid eye rubbing; maintain good hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Stress importance of monitoring symptoms; discuss potential vision changes.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Neurology and ophthalmology consultation within 24-48 hours; repeated assessments every few days during treatment. - Monitoring parameters: Neurological status, ocular condition, renal function, and signs of medication adverse effects. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening neurological deficits, vision loss, increased ICP signs, or new ocular pain or vision changes prompting immediate hospital re-evaluation. - Treatment response: Improvement in neurological symptoms and reduction of ocular redness/swelling.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation of diagnosis, treatment importance, and potential side effects. - Addressing concerns: Reassure about the seriousness but effectiveness of treatment, and importance of adherence. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, involve family if appropriate, and arrange regular follow-up. - Family involvement: Encourage family support and observation, especially for neurological and ocular symptoms.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology urgently; ophthalmology within 24-48 hours for ocular assessment. - Healthcare team: Infectious disease specialist, ophthalmologist, primary care provider. - Community resources: Patient education materials on herpes simplex infections, support groups for viral meningitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure coverage for IV antivirals and hospital stays; discuss financial aspects with patient.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpes simplex meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt antiviral therapy with supportive ocular management and close monitoring. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose IV acyclovir, intravenous hydration, and ocular consultation for any eye involvement. Careful neurological and ophthalmologic follow-up will be essential to assess response and prevent complications. The plan emphasizes patient education on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and avoiding behaviors that could worsen ocular or neurological symptoms, with coordination among neurology and ophthalmology specialists. Early and sustained intervention aims to optimize neurological outcomes, preserve vision, and minimize risks associated with herpes simplex infections.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Admit to hospital, start IV acyclovir, arrange ophthalmology and neurology consultations, hydrate the patient, and educate about symptoms to watch for. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical stability, monitor for adverse drug reactions, and assess ocular and neurological improvement during hospitalization. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antiviral course, monitor for recurrence, ensure visual and neurological function, and provide preventative counseling. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of completing antiviral therapy, attending follow-up appointments, recognizing worsening symptoms, and maintaining hydration and eye hygiene.",
