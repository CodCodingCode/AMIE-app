    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in its early stage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based pharmacotherapy with supportive lifestyle and behavioral interventions tailored to the patient's needs. Initiate donepezil 5 mg daily, with plans to titrate as tolerated, alongside education on disease progression, safety, and the importance of routine. Incorporate cognitive stimulation activities, encourage physical activity, and promote sleep hygiene and stress management. Schedule follow-up in 4-6 weeks to assess cognitive status, medication tolerance, and emotional well-being. Engage family members or caregivers early to support adherence and safety. Coordinate with neurology or geriatrics specialists, involve social services and occupational therapy, and connect the patient with community resources. This integrated plan aims to slow cognitive decline, optimize quality of life, and support emotional and functional stability while monitoring for side effects and disease progression.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate medication (donepezil), provide patient and caregiver education, and schedule follow-up visit.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for medication adherence and side effects, address anxieties, and ensure safety measures.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Evaluate cognitive stabilization or progression, adjust medications as needed, and reinforce non-pharmacological strategies.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain disease, treatment plan, safety tips, importance of routine, and support resources for ongoing management.",
