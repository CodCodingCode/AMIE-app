    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: The diagnosis of optic neuritis, as indica\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of optic neuritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes administering high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gram daily for 3 days) followed by an oral steroid taper, which is supported by clinical guidelines to accelerate visual recovery. Close neuro-ophthalmology or neurology follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor response and detect any progression. Educating the patient about symptom importance, adherence, and warning signs will optimize engagement and outcomes. Lifestyle modifications and supportive visual strategies will assist in recovery, while a multidisciplinary approach ensures holistic care. This approach aims to improve visual function, prevent complications, and address underlying or associated conditions, with careful monitoring for side effects and timely adjustments to therapy.",
