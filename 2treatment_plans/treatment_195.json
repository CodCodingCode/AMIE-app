The key interventions include initial fluid and electrolyte resuscitation to correct dehydration and imbalances, diagnostic imaging (such as abdominal X-ray) to confirm the atresia, and prompt surgical consultation for duodenoplasty or duodenal bypass. Supportive care before surgery involves Nasogastric tube decompression to reduce gastric distension and prevent aspiration, along with close clinical monitoring for signs of worsening obstruction or dehydration. Long-term management will include postoperative nutritional support and monitoring for complications such as anastomotic leak or failure to thrive. This plan aims to stabilize the patient rapidly, minimize perioperative risks, and ensure optimal surgical outcomes. Additionally, parental education about the condition, expected interventions, and signs of complications is integral to ongoing care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Insert a nasogastric tube for decompression, initiate isotonic IV fluids to correct dehydration, and order abdominal imaging to confirm diagnosis.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair, monitor for postoperative complications, and begin gradual nutritional rehabilitation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure normal growth and feeding, monitor for gastrointestinal function, and provide developmental support as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Inform caregivers that the infant requires surgical correction for duodenal atresia, emphasize the importance of hydration and monitoring for feeding issues, and outline signs of complications requiring urgent medical attention.",
