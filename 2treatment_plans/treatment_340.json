The treatment plan includes initiating oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily, emphasizing dietary modifications to increase iron intake and vitamin C consumption, and providing thorough patient education about adherence and side effects. Immediate actions involve laboratory evaluation of hemoglobin and iron status, with follow-up scheduled in 2-4 weeks to assess response. Long-term management focuses on maintaining adequate iron levels through continued supplementation, diet, and monitoring fetal well-being. This approach aims to improve maternal symptoms, ensure fetal development, and prevent complications such as preterm birth or low birth weight, while minimizing side effects and fostering adherence through clear communication and support.",
