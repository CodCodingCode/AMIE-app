The initial focus is on stabilizing the patient through platelet transfusions to control active bleeding, alongside urgent hematology consultation to initiate leukemia-directed therapy. Supportive care includes infection prevention, bleeding precautions, and symptom monitoring. This approach aims to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage, address the underlying leukemia promptly, and optimize long-term outcomes. Follow-up involves frequent clinical assessments, laboratory monitoring, and ongoing communication to adapt the treatment plan as needed, while engaging the patient and family to ensure understanding and adherence. This strategy balances urgent stabilization with comprehensive disease management, aligning with current guidelines and evidence-based practices to improve prognosis and quality of life.",
