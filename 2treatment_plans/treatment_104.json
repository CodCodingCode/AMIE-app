    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating acetazolamide to lower intracranial pressure, alongside lifestyle modifications such as head elevation and weight management if indicated. Close neurological and ophthalmologic follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor symptom progression, visual function, and medication tolerance. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs like rapid vision loss or worsening headache, and adherence to therapy. This approach aims to alleviate symptoms, preserve vision, and prevent complications, while minimizing side effects through careful monitoring. Immediate actions involve arranging urgent specialist consultations and baseline assessments, with short-term goals set for early symptom stabilization. Long-term management involves ongoing monitoring and potential medication adjustments based on response and tolerability.",
