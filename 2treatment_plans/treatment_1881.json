    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Late-Onset Congenital Myopathy (such as a mild form of muscular dystrophy or congenital myopathy presenting in adulthood)\nJustification: The progressive proximal muscle weakness primarily affecting shoulders and hips over a year, along with muscle stiffness, fatigue, and sensations of numbness or weirdness, suggests a primary myopathic process. The lack of sensory deficits, normal bowel and bladder function, and no signs of central nervous system involvement point toward a neuromuscular etiology rather than neurological or systemic causes. The gradual progression and the pattern of affected muscle groups are characteristic of a congenital or hereditary myopathy manifesting later in life. The absence of cranial nerve or other systemic symptoms reduces the likelihood of other neuromuscular diseases like multiple sclerosis, ALS, or inflammatory myopathies with systemic features.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nLate-Onset Congenital Myopathy (e.g., congenital myopathy presenting in adulthood)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Late-Onset Congenital Myopathy, the primary goals are to optimize muscle function, prevent complications, and improve quality of life. Since these myopathies are characterized by gradual muscle weakness primarily affecting proximal muscle groups without significant systemic involvement, management should focus on supportive measures. Physical therapy can help maintain muscle strength and joint mobility, prevent contractures, and reduce fatigue. Occupational therapy may assist in adapting daily activities and providing assistive devices to enhance independence. Regular monitoring for respiratory and cardiac involvement\u2014common in some congenital myopathies\u2014is essential, even if initial presentation is limited; early intervention can prevent serious complications. Pharmacological options are limited for congenital myopathies, but exploring supportive medications like vitamin D or supplements may be considered under specialist guidance. Education on energy conservation, activity modification, and safe exercise routines are important components of management. In selected cases, consultation with neuromuscular specialists may be appropriate per disease progression.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a multidisciplinary approach emphasizing non-pharmacological interventions, including tailored physical and occupational therapy aimed at maintaining muscle strength and joint flexibility, along with patient education on activity modification and energy conservation. Regular follow-up to monitor for respiratory and cardiac function should be established, with pulmonary and cardiology consultations as needed. If signs of respiratory compromise develop, interventions such as respiratory therapy or non-invasive ventilation may be indicated. Although specific pharmacological treatments are limited, a trial of supportive supplements like vitamin D could be considered under specialist oversight. Continual reassessment and coordination with neuromuscular specialists will guide any further specialized management necessary."
