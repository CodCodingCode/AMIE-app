    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Primar\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based psychological therapy with pharmacologic management, tailored to the patient's presentation and preferences. The treatment plan includes initiating Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy with Exposure and Response Prevention, paired with starting an SSRI such as sertraline. The goals are symptom reduction, improved functioning, and supporting the patient through education and lifestyle modifications. Initial management focuses on building trust, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and close monitoring for side effects and response, with follow-up scheduled in 4-6 weeks. Key patient education points emphasize understanding OCD, treatment expectations, and coping strategies. This approach aims to effectively reduce distress and improve quality of life while attentively addressing patient-specific factors like guarded disclosure and potential stigma.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule CBT referral; discuss medication initiation and obtain baseline assessments.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin SSRIs at low dose; start initial CBT sessions; monitor medication tolerance and adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve significant symptom reduction; reassess need for medication adjustments; reinforce coping strategies.\n- Patient handout summary: Educate about OCD, explain treatment options, importance of adherence, and support resources.",
