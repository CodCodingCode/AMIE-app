    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; systemic autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome affecting ocular function is consistent with symptoms, but confirmation via ophthalmology assessment and lab testing is needed. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate based on intermittent visual fogginess and systemic symptoms, but severity could escalate if inflammatory activity worsens. - Urgency level: Routine to urgent; ocular symptoms warrant prompt evaluation to prevent progression, but immediate emergency intervention is not indicated unless visual acuity drops significantly or new alarming symptoms emerge. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other autoimmune conditions (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis), infectious causes, medication effects, or paraneoplastic syndromes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Systemic anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy tailored to specific autoimmune etiology; in initial management, low-dose corticosteroids can be considered. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are first-line for autoimmune ocular inflammation to rapidly reduce inflammation; long-term immunomodulators can be added if chronic inflammation persists. - Patient-specific considerations: Underlying systemic autoimmune process likely related to neoplasm, so coordinate oncologic management; monitor for side effects. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid blanket immunosuppression without definitive diagnosis; corticosteroids can exacerbate underlying infections or systemic illness.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Prednisone 20-40 mg daily, tapering based on response; ocular inflammation often responds to corticosteroids. - Rationale for selection: Rapid anti-inflammatory effect; dosing adjusted for symptom severity. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within days to weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood glucose, blood pressure, mood, signs of infection, and osteoporosis risk. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Immunomodulators such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine, after consultation with ophthalmology and immunology specialists.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Use of protective eyewear, adequate rest, and avoidance of bright lights or near work when symptomatic. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, recognizing side effects, and timely follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Manage systemic illness through nutrition, stress reduction, and adequate sleep. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques; possibly refer to a behavioral health professional if needed.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks after initiating therapy; longer-term every 4-6 weeks as appropriate. - Monitoring parameters: Visual symptoms, ocular examination findings, systemic symptom progression, side effects of medications; laboratory tests (CBC, liver/kidney function, inflammatory markers). - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, new flashes or floaters, worsening systemic symptoms, signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution, improved ocular examination, decrease in inflammation markers.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain the inflammatory process affecting the eyes and systemic illness in simple terms, emphasizing the importance of adherence. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss fears of medication side effects, possible cancer progression, and importance of ongoing monitoring. - Adherence strategies: Use teach-back method, provide written materials, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Engage family members in understanding the condition and supporting treatment adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology for comprehensive eye evaluation and management; possibly immunology or rheumatology for systemic autoimmune work-up; oncology to coordinate systemic diagnosis/treatment. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care physician, oncologist, mental health provider if needed. - Community resources: Autoimmune support groups, patient education materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs, access to specialists, and possible financial assistance programs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of a systemic autoimmune or inflammatory syndrome impacting ocular function, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating low-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 20-40 mg daily, with gradual tapering) to rapidly control ocular inflammation, alongside close ophthalmologic and systemic evaluation. Supportive measures include protecting the eyes from bright light, ensuring adequate rest, and patient education on medication adherence and symptom recognition. Long-term management may involve immunomodulatory agents if inflammation persists or recurs. Monitoring will include regular ocular examinations, systemic symptom assessment, and lab tests to gauge response and detect side effects. Prompt referrals to ophthalmology, rheumatology, and oncology are essential for comprehensive care. Follow-up appointments are scheduled within 1-2 weeks for initial assessment, with ongoing adjustments based on clinical response. The goal is to reduce inflammation, preserve vision, manage systemic illness, and improve overall quality of life while minimizing treatment risks.",
