    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Milroy disease (congenital hereditary lymphedema)  \nJustification: The patient's presentation aligns most closely with Milroy disease, a congenital form of hereditary lymphedema. The key features include bilateral or unilateral painless swelling of the lower limb that develops gradually over years, with skin changes such as thickening, roughness, dimpling, and a dull appearance. The familial pattern, with a maternal history of similar swelling, supports a genetic etiology typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The absence of recent trauma, infection, or other secondary causes, along with the chronicity, indicates a primary congenital or hereditary lymphatic disorder rather than secondary lymphedema. The associated symptoms\u2014heaviness, tingling, and tightness\u2014are consistent with lymphatic obstruction or malformation.\n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:  \nMilroy disease END",
    "output": "THINKING: Milroy disease is a hereditary, congenital form of primary lymphedema characterized by persistent and often progressive swelling, primarily affecting the lower limbs. Since it is a genetic or developmental lymphatic disorder, there is no curative pharmacological treatment currently available. Management focuses on symptomatic relief, reducing swelling, preventing infections, and improving quality of life. Non-pharmacological measures such as limb elevation, compression therapy, gentle skin care, and physical therapy are foundational in controlling edema and preventing complications. While pharmacological options are limited, diuretics are generally not effective for lymphedema and are not recommended. Patient education about skin care and early detection of infections such as cellulitis is essential due to the increased risk associated with chronic lymphedema.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should prioritize conservative, non-pharmacological approaches including daily limb elevation to reduce swelling, and consistent use of compression garments to improve lymphatic drainage. Encouraging regular, gentle physical therapy or lymphatic drainage massage can further aid in managing limb volume. Meticulous skin care to prevent skin breakdown and early intervention with antibiotics if signs of cellulitis appear are critical components. It is also advisable to educate the patient and family about the hereditary nature of Milroy disease, lifestyle modifications to minimize limb trauma, and the importance of ongoing monitoring. Referral to a specialist in lymphedema management or a physical therapist experienced in lymphatic disorders may be beneficial for comprehensive care. Pharmacologic treatments are generally not indicated; however, if significant infection or related complications arise, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be administered."
