The treatment plan includes initiating IV ceftriaxone to promptly control infection, transitioning to oral antibiotics once clinically improved, and emphasizing hydration and rest. Careful monitoring of symptoms and laboratory parameters will guide ongoing management. Patient education will focus on treatment adherence, recognizing warning signs, and maintaining communication. Follow-up within 48-72 hours is essential to assess response and avoid complications. This approach aims to safely resolve the infection, preserve maternal and fetal health, and establish a foundation for long-term management of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IV ceftriaxone; obtain baseline labs and educate patient.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution; confirm treatment effectiveness; monitor for recurrence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrent infections; ensure ongoing pregnancy safety.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication usage, importance of hydration, symptoms to watch for, and follow-up plan.",
