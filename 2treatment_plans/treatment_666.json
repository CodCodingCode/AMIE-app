    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, as disseminated cutaneous herpes simplex infection complicating skin diseases aligns with extensive skin lesions, blistering, ulceration, ocular symptoms, and temporal progression. - Severity classification: Severe, given extensive skin involvement with widespread blistering, open sores, and ocular symptoms affecting vision and comfort. - Urgency level: Immediate, as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome / Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis are life-threatening, requiring prompt intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial superinfection, other blistering diseases like pemphigus, or drug reactions, but current features support the herpes simplex-associated process.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiation of antiviral therapy (e.g., high-dose acyclovir) and supportive care including hospitalization, wound management, and ocular protection. - Supporting evidence: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) dissemination warrants aggressive antiviral therapy; supportive care improves skin and mucous membrane healing. - Patient-specific considerations: The extent of skin and ocular involvement indicates need for inpatient care and multidisciplinary approach. - Contraindications or cautions: Renal function must be considered when administering acyclovir; monitor labs accordingly.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14-21 days, adjusted by renal function. - Rationale for selection: High bioavailability and potent activity against HSV; IV route ensures adequate absorption in severe cases. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some clinical improvement within 3-7 days; complete healing over 2-3 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Renal function, signs of neurotoxicity, and infusion-related reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Foscarnet or famciclovir for less severe cases or if resistance occurs.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Wound care with sterile dressings, eye protection, meticulous hygiene. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing signs of deterioration, importance of medication adherence, eye care. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, nutritional support, avoiding irritants. - Behavioral interventions: Pain management techniques, psychological support for distress.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Daily during hospitalization, then outpatient follow-up in 1 week, and as needed. - Monitoring parameters: Skin lesion progress, ocular status, renal function, and signs of secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening pain, spreading skin lesions, decreased urine output, visual changes, or systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in skin and ocular symptoms, re-epithelialization, pain control.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (chronology_confused), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Simplify explanations, use visual aids or written summaries, repeat key points. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about treatment efficacy, explain necessity of daily care, address fears about eye involvement. - Adherence strategies: Involve family or caregivers, establish clear routines, set reminders. - Family involvement: Engage family members in care plans to support adherence and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology urgent evaluation and follow-up; dermatologist for skin wound management; infectious disease specialist. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for wound and medication care, social work for support. - Community resources: Support groups for herpes or skin conditions, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm coverage for hospitalization, antiviral medications, and specialists.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous herpes simplex infection complicated by Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolyis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines aggressive antiviral therapy with supportive skin and ocular care. This includes initiating high-dose IV acyclovir, hospitalizing the patient for close monitoring, and providing wound management. Supportive measures encompass hydration, nutritional support, pain control, and ocular protection with prompt ophthalmology consultation. The plan emphasizes regular assessment of skin and eye healing, renal function monitoring, and early identification of complications. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognizing warning signs, and maintaining hygiene. Coordination with dermatology and ophthalmology specialists is essential, alongside multidisciplinary team involvement. Follow-up will occur daily during hospitalization and outpatient visits once stabilized, with emphasis on early detection of deterioration or secondary infections. This approach aims to control viral replication, promote healing, prevent complications, and support the patient's overall recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Admit the patient to hospital, start IV acyclovir, ensure ocular protection, and initiate supportive wound and eye care. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antiviral course, monitor for healing, prevent secondary infections, and maintain ocular health. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete skin and ocular recovery, prevent recurrence, and implement strategies to reduce triggers. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize adherence to antiviral therapy, importance of eye and skin care, signs of complication, and follow-up schedule.",
