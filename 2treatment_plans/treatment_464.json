The treatment plan includes initiating consistent compression therapy combined with dedicated wound care, optimizing skin hygiene, and encouraging limb elevation and activity modification. Pharmacologic pain management may be utilized to alleviate discomfort, particularly nighttime cramps. Emphasis on patient education regarding adherence, wound monitoring, and lifestyle modifications is crucial to promote healing and prevent recurrence. Regular follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks will facilitate wound assessment, compression adjustments, and early detection of complications, with close monitoring of wound size, signs of infection, and edema reduction. Involving wound care specialists and, if indicated, vascular surgeons will help address complex or non-healing ulcers. This approach aims to expedite ulcer healing, improve limb function, and minimize potential complications while supporting patient engagement and adherence throughout the process.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on leg elevation, skin hygiene, and compression use; ensure proper fitting of compression garments; initiate wound assessment and dressing regimen.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve wound bed cleanliness, reduce edema, and monitor for infection; reinforce adherence and address barriers.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete ulcer healing, restore limb comfort and function, and implement preventive measures to reduce recurrence.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of compression therapy, daily wound care, activity modification, and follow-up schedule for optimal healing and prevention.",
