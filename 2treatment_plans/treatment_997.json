    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the presentation of redness, swelling, tearing, and recent onset following outdoor activity, consistent with viral conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are recent, self-limited, but affecting comfort and vision slightly. - Urgency level: Routine care; no vision-threatening or systemic signs. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis (less likely without purulent discharge), allergic conjunctivitis, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis if symptoms worsen.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive management with artificial tears, cold compresses, and patient education. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; symptomatic relief enhances comfort and prevents secondary bacterial infection. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient\u2019s age, recent activity, and behavioral history suggest no immunosuppression or complicating factors. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection suspected; prevent touching eyes to reduce autoinoculation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical antiviral is not indicated unless herpetic keratoconjunctivitis is suspected. Since the diagnosis is viral conjunctivitis of typical form, no antiviral required. - Rationale for selection: Symptomatic treatment is sufficient; antiviral agents are reserved for herpetic ocular infections. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 7-14 days. - Key side effects to monitor: No medications required, but advise monitoring for worsening symptoms. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider topical corticosteroids only if significant inflammation persists under specialist supervision.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Maintain eye hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing eyes, wash hands frequently. - Patient education priorities: Emphasize contagious nature, hygiene measures, and when to seek care. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid swimming or sharing towels; minimize eye contact with others. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce hand hygiene, reduce eyelid rubbing.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-7 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Severity of redness, discharge, visual changes, pain. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, intense pain, photophobia, or signs of corneal involvement warrant immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement within 1 week; no worsening signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Provide clear, simple, and reassuring explanations; use visual aids if helpful. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss the expected duration, contagiousness, and signs of complications. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize importance of hygiene; schedule follow-up to reinforce understanding. - Family involvement: Encourage family members to practice similar hygiene; involve them in education if appropriate.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology only if complications arise or no improvement in 2 weeks. - Other healthcare team members: None initially. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye hygiene and contagious diseases. - Insurance/cost considerations:  Recommend over-the-counter artificial tears; avoid unnecessary prescriptions.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive care with patient education. The key interventions include maintaining eye hygiene, using artificial tears to alleviate irritation, and avoiding eye rubbing or sharing personal items. Symptomatic relief is expected within 7-14 days, with no antibiotics indicated unless secondary bacterial infection develops. I will advise the patient to monitor symptoms closely, follow up in 3-7 days if symptoms persist or worsen, and seek immediate care if experiencing vision changes, significant pain, or photophobia. Clear communication with simple language is essential, given the patient's information_withholder style, emphasizing hygiene measures and warning signs. No specialist referral is needed unless complications arise, and educational resources will be provided to support understanding and adherence. This plan aims to promote comfort, prevent spread, and ensure safe recovery.",
