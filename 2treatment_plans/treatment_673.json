    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach. STEP 1 involves confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity; since Ebola virus disease is the primary diagnosis, it suggests a severe, potentially life-threatening illness requiring urgent intervention. The severity is likely severe given hematemesis and systemic symptoms, and urgency is immediate. Differential considerations should include other viral hemorrhagic fevers or coagulopathies but focus remains on Ebola due to containment and management protocols. STEP 2 involves evidence-based treatment: supportive care is the mainstay, with no specific antiviral proven effective for Ebola in routine settings; thus, supportive care is crucial. Consideration of experimental treatments or investigational therapies should be cautious and based on current guidelines and hospital capacity. STEP 3 involves pharmacological support mainly for symptom management and stabilization. STEP 4 recommends supportive measures, including hydration, nutritional support, and infection control. STEP 5 includes careful monitoring of vital signs, labs (CBC, coagulation profile), organ function, and early detection of worsening symptoms. STEP 6 emphasizes clear, simple communication suited to the patient's confused chronology, with reassurance and straightforward instructions. STEP 7 involves coordination with infectious disease specialists, intensive care teams, and public health authorities for outbreak containment and reporting.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, specifically Ebola virus disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive medical management with careful monitoring and patient-centered communication. The key interventions include immediate initiation of supportive care such as intravenous fluids for hydration, correction of coagulopathies, symptom management for fever and pain, and infection control measures to prevent transmission. Given the severity, early transfer to an intensive care setting with specialized infectious disease support is critical. Regular lab assessments\u2014including complete blood counts, coagulation profiles, and organ function tests\u2014should be conducted to guide ongoing management. Supportive care should be tailored to maintain hemodynamic stability, monitor organ function, and prevent secondary infections. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs requiring urgent care, infection prevention practices, and reassurance, simplifying explanations considering the patient's confused chronology. Coordination with infectious disease experts, public health authorities for containment, and hospital resources is essential to ensure safety and optimal outcomes. This integrated approach aims to stabilize the patient, address life-threatening symptoms promptly, and plan for ongoing care and recovery while minimizing transmission risk.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Transfer patient to ICU or specialized infectious disease care unit, initiate IV fluids, start strict infection control isolation protocols, obtain baseline labs. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize vital signs, correct coagulopathy, prevent secondary infections, monitor for organ failure, and provide supportive nutrition. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no sequelae, monitor for post-infection complications, ensure mental health support, and coordinate with public health for follow-up and containment. - Patient handout summary: Explain the disease process in simple terms, emphasize importance of supportive care, infection prevention, symptom monitoring, and when to seek immediate care. Address emotional and behavioral support needs as part of holistic care.",
