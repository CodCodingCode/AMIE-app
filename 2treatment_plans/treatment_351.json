    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of obstructive cholestatic jaundice likely due to pancreatic malignancy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent biliary decompression with supportive symptom management and coordinated long-term care planning. Initial management involves arranging ERCP with biliary stenting to relieve obstruction, supported by appropriate analgesics and antibiotics if infection is suspected. Symptom control includes hydration, nutritional support, and patient education on disease status and follow-up. Close monitoring of liver function, clinical symptoms, and potential complications is essential. Follow-up occurs within 1-2 weeks post-intervention to assess response, with ongoing evaluation by a multidisciplinary team\u2014including gastroenterology, oncology, and surgical specialists\u2014to guide further care such as staging, further oncologic treatments, or palliative measures. Communication emphasizes empathy, clarity, and involving the patient in decision-making, addressing concerns proactively to improve adherence and outcomes.",
