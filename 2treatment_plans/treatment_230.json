    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma with anal involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based oncologic management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt referral for multidisciplinary evaluation, initiation of chemoradiotherapy per current guidelines, and consideration of definitive surgical options if indicated. Initial management focuses on stabilizing systemic symptoms, optimizing nutritional status, and addressing supportive care needs, while long-term management involves regular surveillance and adaptation of therapy based on response. Follow-up care will include scheduled clinical assessments, imaging, and laboratory monitoring, with patient education emphasizing treatment adherence, side effect management, and warning signs requiring immediate attention. This approach aims to maximize curative potential, preserve function when possible, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks associated with therapy.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent oncology consultation, perform baseline labs (CBC, renal, liver), and obtain staging imaging (CT/PET).\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate chemoradiotherapy, monitor for side effects, manage symptoms, and provide supportive care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve tumor response, evaluate need for surgical intervention, and establish surveillance protocols.\n- Patient handout summary: Clear explanation of diagnosis, treatment plan, importance of follow-up, recognizing side effects, and maintaining nutrition and hygiene.",
