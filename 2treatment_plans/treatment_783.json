    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation, contact lens use, risk factors, and likely corneal ulcer. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, because the patient reports rapidly worsening, intense pain, visual blurring, and signs suggestive of corneal ulceration, which warrants urgent attention. - Urgency level: Immediate ophthalmologic assessment needed due to risk of perforation, vision loss, or dissemination. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Endophthalmitis, herpetic keratitis, or other infectious/inflammatory causes, but bacterial keratitis is most likely.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Empiric broad-spectrum topical antibiotics effective against common bacterial pathogens. - Supporting evidence: Topical antibiotics are proven to reduce bacterial load and prevent progression of corneal destruction. - Patient-specific considerations: Contact lens wearer, potential for Pseudomonas infection, and recent hygiene lapses. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid corticosteroids initially until infection controlled, unless specifically advised.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Fluoroquinolone eye drops (e.g., moxifloxacin 0.5%) every hour initially, then tapered. - Rationale for selection: Broad-spectrum coverage, including Pseudomonas, with good ocular penetration and safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms may begin to improve within 48-72 hours if responsive. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions, epithelial toxicity, or emergence of resistant organisms. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Cefazolin 5% with aminoglycoside (e.g., tobramycin) if resistance develops or intolerance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Discontinue contact lens wear immediately; avoid rubbing or touching the eye. - Patient education priorities: Proper lens hygiene, importance of medication adherence, recognizing worsening symptoms. - Lifestyle modifications: Use of proper contact lens cleaning routines, hand hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce hand hygiene, safe contact lens practices, consider consultation with optometrist for lens management.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment within 24-48 hours, then daily until resolution. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, slit-lamp findings of infiltrate size and depth, presence of hypopyon. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, decrease in vision, corneal perforation signs, worsening redness, or systemic symptoms like fever. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in pain, improved clarity, and decrease in infiltrate size.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language with visual aids if possible; summarize key points succinctly. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about prompt treatment, explain tasks step-by-step. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, reassure about efficacy, set expectations for follow-up. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family for support and adherence reinforcement.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Immediate ophthalmology consultation for diagnosis confirmation and management. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse for education, possibly a contact lens specialist. - Community resources: Educational materials on contact lens safety, support groups if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medication affordability, discuss potential costs for follow-up.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial keratitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt initiation of empiric broad-spectrum topical antibiotics, such as moxifloxacin 0.5% every hour initially, with close ophthalmologic follow-up within 24-48 hours. Discontinuation of contact lens wear and strict hygiene practices are essential. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, infiltrate size, and potential complications will be necessary, with escalation or modification of therapy if no improvement occurs within 48-72 hours. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, contact lens hygiene, and recognizing worsening symptoms. Coordination with an ophthalmologist for urgent assessment and possible inpatient management if there's progression or perforation risk is critical. This approach aims to preserve vision, prevent complications, and promote healing while addressing patient concerns through clear, simple communication.",
