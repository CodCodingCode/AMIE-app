    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of venous stasis dermatitis with ulceration, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes implementing compression therapy with appropriately fitted stockings or bandages, meticulous local wound care using suitable dressings, and analgesics for pain control. Ensuring limb elevation, skin protection, and lifestyle modifications such as weight management and smoking cessation are also crucial. Pharmacologically, topical dressings and antibiotics if infection develops will be used judiciously. Immediate actions involve initiating compression and wound care today, educating the patient on skin hygiene and compression techniques, and arranging follow-up in 1-2 weeks to assess healing progress. Long-term, consistent care aiming for ulcer healing, edema reduction, and prevention of recurrence will be the goal. Monitoring will focus on wound size, signs of infection, and limb swelling. The plan emphasizes clear communication to improve adherence and involves referrals to vascular surgery and wound specialists for comprehensive management. This approach aims to promote healing, prevent complications, and restore limb function while considering patient preferences and resource access.",
