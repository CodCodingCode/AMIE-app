    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; the presenting symptoms of chest pressure, rest angina, dyspnea, and diaphoresis are characteristic of unstable angina, especially with associated systemic symptoms. However, confirmation with diagnostic testing such as ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and possibly stress testing is needed. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe based on recurrent episodes, rest angina, and systemic symptoms, indicating a high risk for myocardial infarction. - Urgency level: Urgent, as unstable angina warrants immediate evaluation and stabilization to prevent progression to MI. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Infectious causes (e.g., myocarditis), other causes of chest pain (e.g., musculoskeletal, GI), and possible systemic illness given systemic symptoms.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Immediate hospitalization for cardiology assessment, initiation of anti-ischemic therapy, and risk stratification. - Supporting evidence: Prompt management reduces mortality and prevents progression to MI. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, systemic symptoms, possible comorbidities, and minimal communication suggest need for cautious but aggressive management. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid medications that may exacerbate her systemic illness or cause hypotension or bradycardia; cautious use of antiplatelet agents if bleeding risk exists.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Nitroglycerin sublingually for symptom relief; aspirin loading dose (e.g., 160-325 mg) immediately upon presentation unless contraindicated; consider IV beta-blockers if no contraindications. - Rationale for selection: Reduces myocardial oxygen demand, alleviates ischemia, and prevents thrombus formation. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief within minutes to hours; ongoing monitoring for infarction signs. - Key side effects to monitor: Hypotension, headache (nitroglycerin); bleeding (aspirin); bradycardia or heart block (beta-blockers). - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Morphine for pain; she may need other antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel; maybe anticoagulation with heparin.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Oxygen therapy if hypoxic; bed rest initially, then gradual mobilization. - Patient education priorities: Explain the nature of unstable angina, importance of urgent care, symptom monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Smoking cessation, dietary improvements, weight management, exercise once stabilized. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques, reassurance, possibly counseling for anxiety related to illness.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Cardiology consultation within 24-48 hours; reassessment in 1-2 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Repeat ECGs, cardiac enzymes, vital signs, symptom progression. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening chest pain, new ECG changes, syncope, signs of heart failure, or systemic illness worsening. - Treatment response assessment: Resolution or reduction of angina episodes, stabilization of vital signs, and normalization of cardiac markers.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Given her information_withholder style, provide clear, concise, and reassuring explanations; repeat key points and check understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize the seriousness of her symptoms, the importance of urgent evaluation, and reassurance about the care plan. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, provide written summaries, involve family if appropriate to support adherence. - Family involvement: With her condition, involving a trusted family member may aid understanding and compliance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiologist for definitive management, possible early invasive testing (angiography). - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators, case managers, possibly mental health support if anxiety is significant. - Community resources: Cardiac rehabilitation programs, support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure timely access to diagnostic and pharmacological treatments, discuss affordability, and provide resources for financial assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of unstable angina, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent hospitalization, initiation of anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and nitroglycerin, and close monitoring for signs of worsening ischemia or infarction. Immediate stabilization focuses on symptom relief, risk stratification, and preparation for further cardiology evaluation, including possible invasive procedures. Long-term management involves lifestyle modifications, patient education tailored to her communication style, and scheduled follow-up with cardiology. This approach aims to stabilize her condition, prevent progression to myocardial infarction, and improve her overall cardiovascular health while respecting her need for clear, supportive communication. Implementation will include early actions today, short-term monitoring, and long-term coordination with specialists to optimize her outcomes and safety.",
