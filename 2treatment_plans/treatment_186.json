    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on reported tonic-clonic features, post-ictal confusion, and seizure pattern. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, given frequent episodes, post-ictal symptoms, and the impact on safety and quality of life. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed initially to initiate therapy and evaluate safety. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other epileptic syndromes, non-epileptic events, or comorbid neurodevelopmental conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiation of an antiseizure medication (ASM), such as valproate or levetiracetam. - Supporting evidence: These agents are recommended for generalized tonic-clonic seizures due to efficacy and tolerability. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, potential side effects, comorbid behaviors, and contraindications. - Contraindications or cautions: Liver function for valproate, behavioral effects for levetiracetam, and allergy history.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, titrated up as needed. - Rationale for selection: Good efficacy for generalized seizures, favorable side effect profile, minimal drug interactions. - Expected timeline for improvement: Noticeable seizure reduction within 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Mood/behavior changes, somnolence, or hypersensitivity reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Adequate sleep hygiene, stress management, avoiding seizure triggers. - Patient education priorities: Seizure recognition, safety measures, medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep schedule, avoiding alcohol, managing emotional stress. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy if anxiety or emotional disturbances are present.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 2-4 weeks after medication initiation. - Monitoring parameters: Seizure frequency, medication side effects, adherence, mood or behavioral changes. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening seizures, new neurological deficits, severe side effects, or suicidal ideation. - Treatment response assessment: Seizure diary, clinical interview, possible repeat EEG if indicated.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanations emphasizing safety and shared decision-making. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about medication safety, side effects, and the importance of adherence. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimen, involve caregiver if applicable, provide written instructions. - Family involvement: Involve family members in education and safety planning.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology consultation within 2-4 weeks or sooner if emergencies occur. - Other healthcare team members: Pediatric nurse educators, mental health providers if behavioral issues arise. - Community resources: Support groups, epilepsy foundations, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify medication coverage, explore assistance programs if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of generalized epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an antiseizure medication such as levetiracetam at 500 mg twice daily, with doses titrated based on response and tolerability. I will advise lifestyle modifications like maintaining regular sleep, stress reduction, and seizure avoidance strategies. Close follow-up is planned in 2-4 weeks to assess seizure control, side effects, and adherence. Patient education will focus on seizure safety, medication importance, and recognizing warning signs. Coordination with neurology for ongoing management, along with family education and community support resources, will be integral. This plan aims to reduce seizure frequency and improve quality of life while minimizing side effects and supporting long-term stability.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Begin patient education, provide medication prescription, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Titrate medication as needed, ensure medication adherence, and monitor for side effects. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained seizure control, minimize side effects, and reassess the need for ongoing therapy. - Patient handout summary: Include key points on medication use, safety precautions, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up schedule.",
