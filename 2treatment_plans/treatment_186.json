    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nThe diagnosis of delirium secondary to medication toxicity or postoperative factors is highly certain given the acute onset, patient's recent m\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of delirium secondary to medication toxicity or postoperative factors, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes promptly discontinuing or adjusting any offending medications, providing a safe and supportive environment with reorientation and hydration, and monitoring her mental status closely. If agitation or distress persists, low-dose quetiapine can be used temporarily with careful monitoring. Educating the patient and family about delirium, its causes, and expected course is essential for adherence and reassurance. Follow-up within 24-48 hours is crucial to assess progress, and coordination with surgical and primary care teams will ensure ongoing management. The ultimate goal is to resolve the delirium, ensure patient safety, and address underlying contributing factors to prevent recurrence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Discontinue any unnecessary medications suspected of causing toxicity, perform a thorough assessment including metabolic panel, hydration status, and infection screening.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve resolution of confusion, optimize medication management, and ensure safety and orientation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent future episodes through medication review, careful postoperative monitoring, and possibly involving geriatrics or psychiatry for ongoing cognitive health.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize delirium signs, medication caution, importance of hydration and safety, and when to seek urgent care.",
