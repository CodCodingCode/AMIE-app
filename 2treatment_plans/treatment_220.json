    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; characteristic signs of conjunctivitis with recent onset, ocular redness, tearing, mild discomfort, systemic symptoms suggest viral etiology. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are present but no significant vision loss or intense pain. The duration of about one week suggests a typical course. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no immediate threat to vision or systemic instability. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis (less likely without purulent discharge), allergic conjunctivitis, other ocular surface inflammations, or early signs of more serious conditions like keratitis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care; artificial tears, cold compresses, and patient education about hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limiting; evidence supports symptomatic relief and infection control measures. - Patient-specific considerations: Environmental exposure and systemic symptoms may indicate a broader viral illness; patient education on hygiene to prevent spread is crucial. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed; steroids are not routinely indicated in viral conjunctivitis due to potential side effects.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (e.g., preservative-free artificial tears, instilled frequently), and possibly topical antihistamines if allergic component suspected. - Rationale for selection: To reduce discomfort, dilute viral particles, and maintain ocular surface integrity. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within one to two weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: None significant with artificial tears; ensure no preservatives causing irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: For secondary bacterial infection risk, consider topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin ointment), but only if bacterial etiology is confirmed.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Emphasize hand hygiene, avoiding touching or rubbing eyes, using clean tissues, and avoiding environmental irritants. - Patient education priorities: Importance of hygiene to prevent spread, avoiding contact with others, and recognizing worsening symptoms. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit outdoor activities if environmental exposure persists; use protective eyewear if beneficial. - Behavioral interventions: Educate about proper eye hygiene and hygiene practices to reduce reinfection.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Recheck in 5-7 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, new or worsening pain, visual changes, and signs of secondary bacterial infection. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision loss, photophobia, or eyelid swelling; immediate evaluation needed. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or improvement, absence of secondary complications.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language with visual aids or written instructions; relate the plan to her daily routine. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that viral conjunctivitis is common and self-limiting; discuss contagiousness and prevention. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize hygiene practices, set reminders for eye drops or ice packs, and provide written summary. - Family involvement: Encourage family members to practice good hygiene to prevent transmission.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen or if visual symptoms develop. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care nurse for education reinforcement. - Community resources: Educational leaflets on viral conjunctivitis, local support groups if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Cost-effective symptomatic treatments; discuss free or low-cost hygiene products.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive symptomatic care, strict hygiene practices, and patient education. Initial management includes the use of preservative-free artificial tears to alleviate discomfort, cold compresses for swelling, and emphasizing hand hygiene and prevention to reduce spread. Given the mild to moderate severity and absence of urgent signs, routine follow-up in 5-7 days is appropriate to monitor progression or resolution. The patient should be educated on recognizing warning signs such as severe pain or vision changes that warrant immediate evaluation. This plan aims to promote natural resolution while minimizing transmission, with long-term strategies involving reinforcement of eye hygiene and careful monitoring of symptoms. Collaboration with ophthalmology is advised if symptoms worsen or complications arise.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about hygiene measures, provide artificial tears, advise on environmental modifications and symptom monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, prevent transmission, monitor for secondary infections. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery, reinforce hygiene habits, and prevent recurrence. - Patient handout summary: \"Use artificial tears regularly, wash hands frequently, avoid touching eyes, and see us if you experience increasing pain, vision changes, or if symptoms persist beyond two weeks.\"",
