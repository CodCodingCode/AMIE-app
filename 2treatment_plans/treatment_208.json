The initial focus is on prompt antibiotic therapy tailored to cover common skin pathogens, along with patient education on limb elevation, hygiene, and adherence. Close follow-up within 48-72 hours is essential to monitor response, with ongoing care directed at preventing recurrence and managing chronic lymphatic issues. This plan aims to resolve acute infection, prevent complications, and optimize long-term limb function, while ensuring patient understanding and engagement in their care.",
