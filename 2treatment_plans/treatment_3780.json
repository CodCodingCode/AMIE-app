    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Pituitary macroadenoma (likely prolactinoma or another hormone-secreting tumor) with mass effect causing secondary symptoms.\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of severe headaches, morning nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances (blurry, double vision, visual distortion) suggest increased intracranial pressure and optic chiasm compression, commonly seen with a sellar mass such as a pituitary tumor. The dizziness and wobbliness when walking point toward possible involvement of adjacent brain structures or increased intracranial pressure. The fatigue and feeling cold might reflect hormonal alterations affecting metabolic regulation or secondary hypopituitarism. The progressive nature and pattern of symptoms are characteristic of a mass effect from a larger pituitary tumor.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nPituitary macroadenoma with mass effect causing visual disturbances and neurological symptoms. END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation suggests a pituitary macroadenoma exerting mass effect, leading to visual disturbances, headaches, nausea, and systemic symptoms potentially due to hormonal dysregulation. Given the likely diagnosis of a prolactinoma or another hormone-secreting tumor, the primary approach involves medical management to reduce tumor size and hormone hypersecretion before considering surgical intervention. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, are first-line treatments for prolactin-secreting tumors and have demonstrated efficacy in decreasing tumor volume and prolactin levels. These medications are generally well-tolerated and can also alleviate mass effect symptoms. In addition, the patient should undergo urgent neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, including visual field testing, and neuroimaging with MRI to assess tumor size, extent, and effect on adjacent structures. Symptomatic management of headache with analgesics can be provided, and hormonal deficiencies should be evaluated with baseline pituitary function tests to identify secondary hypopituitarism. If hormonal excess or deficit is confirmed, appropriate hormone replacement should be initiated as needed. Close follow-up with endocrinology and neurology is essential for monitoring treatment response and adjusting therapy accordingly. Surgical intervention via transsphenoidal resection may become necessary if the tumor progresses despite medical therapy or if visual impairment worsens.\n\nANSWER: Initiate treatment with a dopamine agonist such as cabergoline (preferably) or bromocriptine to suppress prolactin secretion and reduce tumor size. Advise the patient to have urgent neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, including visual field testing, and arrange for a prompt pituitary MRI to confirm tumor extent and involvement. Manage headache with over-the-counter analgesics as needed. Conduct baseline assessments of pituitary hormone levels to identify and treat any hormonal deficiencies with appropriate replacements. Coordinate closely with endocrinology and neurology specialists for ongoing monitoring of tumor response, visual symptoms, and hormonal function. Reserve surgical intervention for cases with worsening visual impairment or lack of response to medical therapy."
