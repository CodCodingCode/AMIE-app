    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Inflammatory breast carcinoma\nJustification: The patient exhibits rapid progression of breast symptoms including significant redness, skin thickening, texture changes, nipple inversion, and a rapid onset of symptoms over a short period\u2014features highly suggestive of inflammatory breast carcinoma. The absence of signs of infection (no pus, fever, chills) and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue further support a malignant inflammatory process rather than an infectious etiology. The quick progression, skin changes, and nipple inversion, especially in a woman of this age, strongly point toward a locally advanced breast malignancy rather than benign conditions like mastitis or abscess, which are typically associated with signs of infection.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nInflammatory breast carcinoma END",
    "output": "THINKING: Inflammatory breast carcinoma is an aggressive and advanced form of breast cancer that requires prompt and coordinated management. Given the diagnosis, the primary goals are to confirm the diagnosis histologically, initiate appropriate staging to determine extent of disease, and begin neoadjuvant therapy to control local disease and facilitate definitive surgical management. Immediate assessment of the patient's overall health status and comorbidities is essential. Non-pharmacological interventions such as referral to a multidisciplinary team\u2014including surgical, oncology, and radiation specialists\u2014are vital. Pharmacologically, starting systemic chemotherapy tailored to breast cancer protocols is crucial due to the aggressive nature of inflammatory breast cancer. Supporting the patient with symptomatic management (e.g., analgesia, skin care) is also important. Educating the patient about the urgency and the need for prompt treatment is essential, as delays can worsen prognosis.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with urgent referral to a multidisciplinary oncology team for confirmation of diagnosis via core needle biopsy and comprehensive staging (including mammography, ultrasound, and possibly PET/CT). Initiate systemic chemotherapy as soon as possible, following breast cancer protocols (e.g., anthracycline and taxane-based regimens), to reduce tumor burden. Concurrently, provide supportive skin care measures and manage symptoms to improve comfort. Once the tumor size is reduced and systemic therapy is underway, evaluate for surgical intervention\u2014typically modified radical mastectomy\u2014and consider post-operative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes. Throughout treatment, monitor the patient closely for treatment response, side effects, and complications."
