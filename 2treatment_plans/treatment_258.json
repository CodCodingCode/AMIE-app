Treatment of DVT with PE usually involves anti\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis with Pulmonary Embolism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating anticoagulation therapy immediately with low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), followed by a transition to an oral agent such as warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) like apixaban, depending on patient factors and contraindications. This approach effectively prevents clot extension and recurrence, supported by current guidelines. Given her underlying protein deficiency, further hematologic evaluation is warranted to identify potential thrombophilia and tailor ongoing management. Non-pharmacological interventions include encouraging early mobilization, leg elevation, and hydration. Patient education focuses on medication adherence, recognizing signs of bleeding, recurrent DVT, or PE, and understanding the importance of follow-up. Monitoring will involve regular assessment of symptoms, INR levels if on warfarin, and imaging as needed. Colleague consultations with hematology and vascular medicine should be arranged within the next week. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled in 1-2 weeks to assess treatment response and adjust therapy accordingly. This plan aims to optimize recovery, reduce thrombotic risks, and address her specific clinical context effectively.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with Doppler ultrasound and chest imaging; start LMWH therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Titrate and stabilize anticoagulation, educate patient, and evaluate for underlying thrombophilia.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete anticoagulation course if indicated, prevent new thrombotic events, and address underlying protein deficiency.\n- Patient handout summary: Include instructions on medication adherence, recognizing adverse effects, activity modifications, and follow-up schedules.",
