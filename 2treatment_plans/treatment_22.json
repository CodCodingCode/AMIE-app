    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hypothalamic Amenorrhea\nJustification: The patient is experiencing amenorrhea (absence of periods) despite no recent menstrual changes, which suggests a functional suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis rather than primary ovarian failure. The history of increased exercise and dietary monitoring, coupled with stress and emotional concerns, points toward hypothalamic suppression of GnRH secretion. The associated symptoms of decreased libido, low energy, anxiety, and feelings of depression align with the hormonal alterations seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. There are no indications of polycystic ovary syndrome or other ovarian pathology, and the absence of abnormal bleeding or ovarian symptoms further supports this diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHypothalamic Amenorrhea END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's hypothalamic amenorrhea appears to be driven by functional suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, likely related to stress, excessive exercise, and possible nutritional disturbances. Addressing these underlying factors is essential, as they contribute to hormonal imbalance and symptoms like decreased libido, low energy, anxiety, and depression. Non-pharmacological approaches should be prioritized initially, focusing on restoring a healthy balance of physical activity and nutrition, reducing stress, and ensuring adequate caloric intake. As hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives, are generally not first-line and may not address underlying causes, they should be considered only if lifestyle modifications prove insufficient or if symptoms severely impact quality of life. Close monitoring and patient education about the nature of hypothalamic amenorrhea and its reversibility are crucial components of management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with counseling on reducing excessive exercise and ensuring adequate caloric and nutritional intake to support hormonal recovery. Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness, behavioral therapy, or counseling, may be beneficial to address emotional contributors. Encouraging a balanced lifestyle with appropriate rest and avoiding strenuous physical activity without medical guidance can facilitate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis normalization. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor for the return of menstruation, mood improvements, and overall well-being. If after several months lifestyle modifications do not lead to menarche or if symptoms persist or worsen, consider referral to an endocrinologist for further evaluation and discuss the potential judicious use of hormonal therapy, such as low-dose combined oral contraceptives, mainly as a short-term measure if indicated to manage symptoms while underlying causes are addressed."
