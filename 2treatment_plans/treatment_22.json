    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of peptic ulcer bleeding, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate hemodynamic stabilization with IV fluids and high-dose IV proton pump inhibitor therapy, followed by urgent endoscopic evaluation for definitive hemostasis. Given the patient's hepatic fibrosis, careful assessment for variceal bleeding is essential; thus, collaboration with hepatology is recommended. Pharmacologically, IV pantoprazole at 80 mg bolus then infusion is the first-line therapy, with close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and signs of rebleeding. Non-pharmacological interventions include NPO status initially, patient education on symptoms, lifestyle modifications to avoid NSAIDs, alcohol, and smoking, and stress management techniques. Follow-up involves re-evaluation within 24-48 hours, outpatient endoscopy within 3 days, and regular monitoring of symptoms and labs.\nImmediate actions today involve initiating IV access, administering high-dose IV PPI, and preparing for urgent endoscopy. Short-term goals (1-4 weeks) include stabilizing the bleed, confirming the source, and preventing rebleeding. Long-term objectives (3-6 months) focus on managing underlying factors such as liver health, preventing recurrence, and counseling on lifestyle changes. A patient handout emphasizing the importance of adherence, warning signs, and follow-up plans will support compliance and understanding.",
