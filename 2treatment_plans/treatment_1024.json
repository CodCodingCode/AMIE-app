    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan.  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on eye symptoms post-trauma or irritant exposure and presentation consistent with conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate, given onset 2 days ago, redness, swelling, tearing, without mention of vision changes or intense pain. - Urgency level: Routine care with prompt follow-up, as symptoms are recent but not severe. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal injury, uveitis, or other ocular trauma complications.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care with lubricating eye drops and topical antihistamines if allergic component suspected. - Supporting evidence: Conservative management is effective for viral conjunctivitis and irritant-related conjunctivitis; antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial superinfection suspected. - Patient-specific considerations: Recent trauma or irritant exposure suggests avoiding topical corticosteroids initially unless indicated by ophthalmology. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid eye rubbing, monitor for worsening symptoms, do not use unnecessary topical medications.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (e.g., preservative-free lubricating drops) 1-2 drops every 2-4 hours as needed. - Rationale for selection: Provides symptomatic relief, promotes ocular surface healing, safe in viral/irritant conjunctivitis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief typically within 2-3 days; full resolution expected within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Rare irritation or allergy to drops, ensure no preservatives if used frequently. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines or vasoconstrictors if allergy or significant redness persists.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid eye rubbing, maintain ocular hygiene, wash hands frequently. - Patient education priorities: Importance of hygiene, avoiding contact with others to prevent spread, not sharing towels or pillows. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid strenuous activities that might worsen symptoms. - Behavioral interventions: Educate on proper eyelid hygiene and measure to reduce irritants.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Revisit in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, vision changes, increased redness, pain, or discharge. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, photophobia, or the development of a corneal ulcer. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, reduction in redness, tearing, and swelling.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, simple explanations emphasizing supportive care and symptom resolution timeline, given the patient's information_withholder style. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the benign nature of viral/conjunctivitis, importance of hygiene, and when to seek urgent care. - Adherence strategies: Use written instructions or visual aids for eye care routines to enhance compliance. - Family involvement: Encourage family members to assist with hygiene and prevent spread, if applicable.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen or do not improve in a week, or if there are signs of corneal involvement. - Other healthcare team members: None immediately indicated unless complications arise. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye hygiene and viral conjunctivitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss affordability of lubricating drops or alternative over-the-counter options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis secondary to recent ocular trauma or irritant exposure, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating preservative-free artificial tears for symptomatic relief, emphasizing ocular hygiene and avoidance of eye rubbing, and educating the patient about the natural course of viral or irritant conjunctivitis. Immediate actions involve instructing the patient on proper eye care and hygiene, with follow-up in 3-5 days to monitor symptom progression. Long-term management focuses on preventing recurrence and minimizing risk of infection spread. Follow-up care will include assessing symptom resolution and watching for signs of complication, such as vision changes or increasing pain, which would warrant urgent ophthalmology referral. This approach aims to promote rapid symptom relief, prevent complications, and ensure the patient's understanding and cooperation for optimal outcomes.",
