    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of dehydration secondary to hyperemesis gravidarum, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt rehydration with IV isotonic saline to rapidly correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, along with supportive measures such as small, frequent intake of fluids and patient education on symptom monitoring. Initial management should focus on reestablishing hydration status urgently to prevent complications, while establishing ongoing outpatient follow-up within 24-48 hours. Monitoring will include vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and fetal health assessments. The plan emphasizes clear communication tailored to the patient's baseline communication style, ensuring understanding and adherence, with involvement of family members when appropriate. Coordination with maternal-fetal specialists and other support services will optimize both maternal and fetal outcomes. This integrated approach aims to resolve dehydration, improve symptoms, and prevent recurrence or complications of hyperemesis gravidarum.",
