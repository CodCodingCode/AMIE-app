The treatment plan includes initiating systemic chemotherapy (e.g., FOLFOX regimen) to control tumor progression and palliate symptoms, along with nutritional and symptomatic support to address weight loss, bleeding, and fatigue. Close monitoring of hematologic parameters, functional status, and symptom progression is essential, with regular follow-up every 2-4 weeks. Symptom management and quality of life should be prioritized, including pain control and addressing anemia. Communication with the patient should be clear and reassuring, emphasizing goals of care, symptom relief, and involvement of appropriate specialists such as oncology and palliative care. Coordination with the healthcare team will ensure comprehensive support, with timely adjustments based on treatment response and evolving clinical status.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with available imaging and labs, stabilize bleeding if severe, initiate discussions with oncology.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Start systemic chemotherapy, manage anemia and nutritional needs, monitor for treatment tolerability.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Aim to control tumor burden, maintain quality of life, and reassess for possible further interventions.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of treatment adherence, symptom reporting, scheduled follow-up visits, and available supportive resources.",
