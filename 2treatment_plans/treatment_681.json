    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan based on the confirmed diagnosis of aortic dissection. Since this is a life-threatening event, the immediate concern is stabilization, definitive diagnosis confirmation, and then long-term management, all while considering the patient\u2019s hypertension and known aneurysm. Emphasize urgent interventions to prevent catastrophic rupture or extension, followed by detailed follow-up and risk reduction strategies. The plan should be patient-centered, practical, and aligned with evidence-based guidelines.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of aortic dissection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate stabilization with blood pressure control, urgent diagnostic confirmation, and long-term surveillance, with careful attention to patient-specific factors such as hypertension and known aneurysm. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient and preventing dissection progression, while establishing a definitive management plan. Follow-up care will include close monitoring of blood pressure, repeat imaging, and lifestyle modifications, with clear instructions for the patient regarding recognition of symptoms warranting urgent care. This approach is designed to stabilize the patient, prevent further vascular damage, and improve long-term outcomes while minimizing risks such as ischemia or rupture.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer IV antihypertensives (e.g., esmolol or labetalol) to reduce systolic blood pressure to <120 mm Hg; ensure patient is on continuous cardiac and blood pressure monitoring; prepare for urgent imaging (CT angiography) for diagnostic confirmation. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve and maintain target blood pressure; confirm dissection extent and location via imaging; consult cardiothoracic and vascular surgery teams; initiate patient education about symptom recognition. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Implement strict blood pressure control with oral antihypertensives; schedule regular imaging for surveillance of aortic dimensions; develop a personalized risk reduction plan focusing on smoking cessation if applicable, diet, weight management, and stress reduction. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of blood pressure management, medication adherence, recognizing warning signs (sudden chest/back pain, dizziness, syncope), and attending scheduled follow-up appointments.",
