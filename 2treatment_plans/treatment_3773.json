    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive, asymmetric neurological symptoms over four months, including spasticity and stiffness in the legs, sensory disturbances such as burning, tingling, and numbness below the chest, increased reflexes, and worsening with activity and heat strongly suggests a demyelinating process affecting the central nervous system. The pattern of symptoms\u2014optic nerve involvement absent, corticospinal signs (hyperreflexia, spasticity), and sensory disturbances\u2014fits well with MS. The exacerbation with heat (Uhthoff's phenomenon) and activity aligns with MS characteristics. The progression over months and multiple neurological features support a diagnosis of MS rather than other diagnoses such as peripheral neuropathy, spinal stenosis, or other demyelinating conditions.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) indicates a chronic demyelinating disease requiring both symptom management and disease-modifying strategies to slow progression and reduce relapses. Since the patient exhibits neurological deficits consistent with MS and no contraindications are noted, initiating pharmacologic disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is essential to alter disease course. Non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable to address symptom control, improve function, and promote quality of life. These can include physical therapy targeting spasticity and mobility, energy conservation techniques, and education about heat sensitivity and activity modification. Additionally, symptomatic treatments such as muscle relaxants or neuropathic pain agents can be used if symptoms are bothersome. Overall, a comprehensive approach that combines pharmacological DMTs with supportive therapies is optimal for managing MS in a primary care or psychiatric setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should involve initiating a disease-modifying therapy (such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, or another FDA-approved agent depending on availability and patient-specific factors) to reduce the frequency and severity of future relapses. Concurrently, refer the patient to a neurologist for specialized management and assessment of appropriate DMTs. Implement non-pharmacological interventions, including physical therapy focused on spasticity, balance, and mobility, and provide education on heat sensitivity and activity regulation. Symptom management may include prescribing muscle relaxants (like baclofen) for spasticity or neuropathic pain medications if sensory disturbances are impairing function. Encourage regular follow-up to monitor disease progression, treatment efficacy, and side effects, and support the patient with psychosocial resources as needed."
