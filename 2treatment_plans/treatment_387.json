    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with suspected endometrial pathology and potential malignancy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent diagnostic evaluation with symptom management and coordinated specialist care. The initial step involves performing an endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and assess tumor invasion or spread. While awaiting definitive diagnosis, short-term medical management with tranexamic acid can help control bleeding if necessary. Patient education will focus on recognizing signs of worsening bleeding and understanding the diagnostic process.\nThis approach incorporates prompt investigations aimed at confirming malignancy, symptom control, and preparing for possible surgical intervention if indicated. Follow-up will include close monitoring of bleeding, pain, and new symptoms, with a plan to involve gynecologic oncology for appropriate management. Communication will be clear and empathetic, emphasizing the importance of timely diagnosis and coordinated care to improve outcomes while addressing the patient's baseline behavioral tendencies.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent outpatient endometrial biopsy, pelvic ultrasound, and blood work (CBC, coagulation profile).\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Obtain diagnostic results, control bleeding symptoms, and plan definitive treatment such as hysterectomy or oncology referral.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Manage confirmed malignancy appropriately, monitor for recurrence or complications, and support patient\u2019s overall health.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of diagnostics, report any increase in bleeding or new symptoms immediately, and outline upcoming steps for treatment.",
