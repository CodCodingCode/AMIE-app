    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) upon confirmation via sleep study, along with lifestyle modifications such as weight management, sleep positioning, and sleep hygiene education. Given the patient's anxiety, thorough reassurance and involvement in decision-making are essential. Short-term, ensure adherence to CPAP, monitor symptoms and device use, and address any side effects. Long-term, ongoing follow-up with sleep specialists and possible behavioral or psychological support should be established to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to reduce nocturnal events, improve sleep quality, and mitigate cardiovascular risks, while respecting the patient's behavioral needs and potential anxieties.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange expedited sleep study, provide patient education about sleep apnea and CPAP benefits.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve initial sleep study; assist patient with CPAP fitting and comfort; reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm symptom improvement; monitor adherence; reassess need for alternative therapies if necessary.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of CPAP therapy, adherence, lifestyle changes, and follow-up schedule.",
