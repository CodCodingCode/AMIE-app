The final diagnosis is leprosy reaction, which indicates an immune-media\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis associated with leprosy reaction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroids to control inflammation, supplemented by close neurological evaluation and supportive therapies, with attention to preventing nerve damage and systemic complications. Initial management focuses on controlling active inflammation and symptom relief, while establishing long-term immunomodulatory strategies. Follow-up care will include periodic assessment of inflammatory markers, nerve function, and skin lesions, along with patient education about recognizing warning signs and adherence. This approach aims to reduce inflammation, prevent progression, and improve quality of life while carefully monitoring for side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Begin corticosteroid therapy (e.g., Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) after confirming no contraindications; arrange neurological examination; provide patient education about medication side effects and warning signs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in skin and joint inflammation; assess nerve pain progression; ensure patient adherence; monitor for corticosteroid side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Taper corticosteroids appropriately; evaluate for additional immunosuppressants if inflammation persists; maintain nerve function and prevent disability; provide ongoing support.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain vasculitis and leprosy reactions; importance of medication adherence; warning signs that require immediate medical attention; schedule for follow-up assessments.\nSTOP HERE.",
