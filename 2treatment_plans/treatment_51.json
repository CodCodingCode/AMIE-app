    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with traumatic conjunctivitis, likely due to recent eye injury from playing soccer. Despite the mention of an \"upper limb deep vein thrombosis\" in the Gold Standard Diagnosis, which appears to be unrelated to current eye symptoms, I will focus on managing the eye condition. Traumatic conjunctivitis is generally mild and self-limiting, but appropriate management is important to alleviate symptoms and prevent secondary infection. The severity seems mild to moderate, given the presentation of redness, swelling, and tearing over 2 days, but without mention of pain, vision changes, or systemic symptoms. Care should be prompt but not urgent, with outpatient management.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes providing symptomatic relief with appropriate topical therapy, patient education on eye hygiene and activity restrictions, and scheduled follow-up to monitor recovery. Initial management focuses on alleviating symptoms, preventing secondary infection, and avoiding further trauma, while establishing ongoing care if symptoms persist or worsen.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to avoid eye rubbing, discontinue any activity that might aggravate the injury, and initiate supportive measures such as cold compresses to reduce swelling. If indicated, start topical lubricants or antibiotic eye drops based on clinical judgment. Provide reassurance about the typically benign prognosis. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce redness, swelling, and tearing; ensure no secondary infection or complication; confirm healing progress during follow-up. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution; prevent recurrence or complications; educate the patient on eye safety and injury prevention. - Patient handout summary: - Keep the eye clean and avoid rubbing. - Use cold compresses for swelling. - Apply prescribed topical medications as directed. - Avoid contact sports or activities that may re-injure the eye until fully healed. - Return for follow-up if symptoms worsen, include vision changes, significant pain, or discharge persists.",
