    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is confirmed by biopsy, which should have been performed. The lesion\u2019s description suggests a potentially invasive cancer, possibly moderate to severe depending on depth and extent, but without staging details, I will assume a localized lesion at this point. Urgency is high given ulceration, bleeding, and the risk of progression. Differential considerations include benign vulvar lesions or other malignancies but biopsy confirms SCC.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment is surgical excision with clear margins, which is standard for localized vulvar SCC. Additional treatments include lymph node assessment if lesion is invasive, and adjuvant radiotherapy in selected cases. Conservative management may be considered if less invasive or in patients unfit for extensive surgery, but generally surgery is primary. This approach aligns with NCCN guidelines.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Medications are not primary for initial treatment; instead, surgical removal is key. Postoperative pain management and wound care are essential. If necessary, topical or systemic analgesics can be used; antibiotics if infection develops; and possibly HPV vaccination if indicated.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Patient education on vulvar health, wound care, sexual health, and importance of follow-up. Smoking cessation if applicable, as smoking influences HPV-related carcinogenesis. Stress management and emotional support are critical, considering emotional distress.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up at 2-4 weeks post-surgery to assess wound healing and detect recurrence. Long-term surveillance every 3-6 months for the first 2 years, then annually. Monitor for local recurrence, lymphadenopathy, or new lesions. Provide instructions for immediate care if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given her worried and family-involved personality, communicate clearly, empathetically, and involve her family in education and support. Explain diagnosis, treatment options, expected outcomes, and importance of follow-up. Address worries about cancer progression, side effects, and emotional impact. Provide reassurance and educate on prognosis and support resources.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Refer to gynecologic oncology for surgical planning and staging. Consider social work or counseling for emotional support. Ensure coordination with pathology, nursing, and possibly physical therapy for wound management. Provide educational resources and support groups. Check insurance coverage and discuss costs early.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient-centered education and follow-up strategies. The initial step is to perform a surgical excision with clear margins, followed by appropriate staging, including sentinel lymph node biopsy if invasion is confirmed. Postoperative wound care and pain management are essential, alongside close surveillance for recurrence. Patient education will focus on wound care, signs of recurrence, and emotional support, involving her family as appropriate. Follow-up visits should occur every 2-4 weeks initially, then routinely every 3-6 months for at least 2 years. Referral to gynecologic oncology is necessary for surgical planning and staging, and additional support services should be leveraged to address emotional well-being. This plan aims to ensure effective treatment, monitor for early recurrence, and support the patient\u2019s psychological health while minimizing treatment risks.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange biopsy report review, schedule surgical consultation, and provide wound care instructions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision, ensure wound healing, and perform staging procedures. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain surveillance, address any recurrence promptly, and support emotional recovery. - Patient handout summary: Explain diagnosis and treatment plan, wound care instructions, importance of follow-up, and available support resources.",
