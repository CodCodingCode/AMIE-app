    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Ovarian Failure\nJustification: The patient presents with primary amenorrhea or absent menstrual cycles and a high FSH level, which strongly suggests diminished ovarian reserve or ovarian failure. In women under age 40, elevated FSH levels indicating inadequate ovarian function point to premature ovarian insufficiency. The absence of menstrual periods, lack of other symptoms, and recent blood work showing high FSH support this diagnosis. Given that she feels normal otherwise and has no reported previous ovarian surgeries or treatments, the most probable cause is premature ovarian insufficiency as a primary explanation for her infertility.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nPremature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Ovarian Failure END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) and the patient's presentation with primary amenorrhea, elevated FSH levels, and otherwise normal health, the primary focus should be on addressing the hormonal imbalance, managing symptoms related to estrogen deficiency, and offering fertility counseling if desired. Since POI often results in decreased estrogen levels, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be beneficial to prevent estrogen deficiency-related sequelae such as osteoporosis and vasomotor symptoms, even if currently asymptomatic. Fertility options are limited but may include assisted reproductive technologies; however, these are typically coordinated with a specialist. Lifestyle modifications and routine screenings are also important to monitor bone density and cardiovascular health. Pharmacological intervention primarily involves estrogen-progestin therapy unless contraindicated, and non-pharmacological support includes education about the condition and psychological support if needed.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this patient should include initiating a hormone replacement therapy regimen, such as combined estrogen and progestin therapy, to address estrogen deficiency and prevent osteoporosis, with dose tailored to the patient's age and health status. It is important to counsel the patient about the impact of POI on fertility, and referral to a reproductive endocrinologist should be considered if fertility preservation or assisted reproductive options are desired. Routine bone density screening should be arranged, and lifestyle modifications promoting calcium and vitamin D intake, weight-bearing exercise, and smoking cessation should be emphasized. Additionally, provide patient education regarding the natural history of POI, potential health risks, and the importance of ongoing monitoring of cardiovascular health and bone density. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to assess therapy efficacy and tolerability."
