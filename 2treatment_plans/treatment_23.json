    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating combined oral contraceptive therapy to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgenic symptoms, along with intensive lifestyle modifications emphasizing weight management, diet, and exercise. The plan is tailored to her young age and desire for symptom improvement, while carefully monitoring for side effects and underlying metabolic issues. Initial management focuses on establishing regular cycles and reducing hyperandrogenism within the first 3 months, with ongoing assessment of symptom resolution and metabolic health for long-term control. Follow-up will include regular clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, and patient education to promote adherence and address concerns. This integrated approach aims to improve symptoms, prevent complications, and support overall well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate patient about PCOS, discuss treatment options, and initiate lifestyle advice.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Start COC therapy, monitor for side effects, and reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve regular menses, reduce hyperandrogenic symptoms, and improve metabolic parameters.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on hormone therapy, lifestyle importance, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.",
