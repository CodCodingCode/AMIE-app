    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the ECG confirmation of high-grade second-degree AV block. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe due to frequent dizziness and symptoms impacting daily function; the absence of syncope is reassuring but the symptoms suggest significant arrhythmia. - Urgency level: Urgent; symptoms warrant prompt evaluation to prevent progression to complete heart block or syncope. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Vasovagal or autonomic dysregulation episodes, other conduction system disease, or structural heart disease.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Cardiac pacing (permanent pacemaker implantation). - Supporting evidence: Pacemaker therapy is indicated to prevent symptomatic bradycardia and syncope in high-grade AV block. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient is minimized in reporting symptoms; thus, close assessment of symptom burden and risk is critical. No contraindications indicated. - Contraindications or cautions: None specific; consider comorbid conditions influencing perioperative risk if proceeding with device implantation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Not primary; pacemaker implantation is the definitive treatment. Pharmacological options are limited but may include atropine temporarily if bradyarrhythmia episodes are ongoing. - Rationale for selection: Medications are adjunctive or for acute management, not long-term solution. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief usually follows device implantation. - Key side effects to monitor: For pharmacologic agents like atropine \u2014 dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None specific, as pacing remains the main treatment.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoidance of precipitants such as dehydration, excessive caffeine, or stress that may worsen autonomic symptoms. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing symptoms, importance of adherence to follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, regular sleep, stress management techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Biofeedback or vagal maneuvers only if appropriate and under supervision.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Cardiology follow-up within 2 weeks for device assessment or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom diary, ECG/Holter monitoring, device interrogation post-implantation. - Red flag symptoms: Syncope, chest pain, palpitations with exertion, worsening dizziness. - Treatment response assessment: Resolution or reduction of dizziness, stability of conduction on device interrogation.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, non-technical language emphasizing safety and the importance of device therapy; reassure that symptoms are common but manageable. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize that pacing effectively prevents dangerous events; reassure that outpatient procedures are routine. - Adherence strategies: Encourage honesty about all symptoms; involve family if appropriate for support. - Family involvement: With patient consent, inform family members about symptoms and planned interventions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Electrophysiologist for device implantation within the next 1-2 weeks. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for ongoing management. - Community resources: Education on arrhythmia management; support groups if desired. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss pre-authorization for device implantation; assist with coverage inquiries.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of high-grade second-degree AV block, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent cardiac pacing with tailored patient education and close follow-up. The primary intervention is the placement of a permanent pacemaker to prevent further symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. This ensures immediate safety and long-term rhythm stability. Concurrently, non-pharmacological measures such as hydration, activity modification, and symptom awareness should be emphasized. Ongoing monitoring through device interrogation and symptom tracking will guide long-term management. Clear communication tailored to the patient's stoic/minimizer personality will facilitate adherence and reassurance, with family involvement considered as appropriate. Coordination with a cardiology electrophysiologist is essential for timely device implantation, supported by primary care for holistic management. The overall goal is symptom resolution, prevention of complications, and safe management of the conduction abnormality.",
