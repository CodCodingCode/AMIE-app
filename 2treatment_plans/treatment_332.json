    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Prim\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an antipsychotic such as risperidone 2 mg daily, supplemented by psychoeducation, supportive counseling, and stress management techniques. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor symptom resolution and medication tolerance, with ongoing assessments every month. The focus is on reducing psychotic symptoms, preventing relapse, and addressing psychosocial factors that may contribute to stability. Patient education will emphasize medication adherence, recognizing warning signs, and lifestyle modifications to support recovery. This approach aims to achieve symptom remission, improve functioning, and minimize risks, while carefully monitoring for side effects and involving family as appropriate for sustained support.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate risperidone 2 mg, provide psychoeducation, schedule follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom stabilization, medication adherence, patient understanding of condition.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete remission of acute symptoms, reduce relapse risk, strengthen functioning and insight.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication, importance of follow-up, recognizing symptoms, lifestyle tips for mental health.",
