    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation of hea\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage with hypovolemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt medical intervention with supportive care strategies. The initial management includes administering IV oxytocin to promote uterine contraction and controlling bleeding with uterotonics, alongside aggressive fluid resuscitation to restore circulatory volume. Physical measures such as uterine massage and patient positioning are essential. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood loss, and laboratory parameters is critical to assess response and detect deterioration. Providing emotional support and clear communication, especially considering her anxiety, will enhance cooperation and recovery. Involving obstetric specialists for ongoing management and potential interventions is necessary for sustained hemostasis. Follow-up care should focus on monitoring for recurrent bleeding, restoring hematologic stability, and addressing emotional well-being, with educational support for postpartum care. This integrated approach aims to stabilize the patient rapidly while minimizing risks and facilitating complete recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV access, start uterotonics infusion, begin fluid resuscitation, conduct physical exam to confirm bleeding source, and monitor frequently.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemostasis, stabilize hemodynamics, and monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit; provide emotional support.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery, monitor for anemia, and support mental health as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of monitoring bleeding, attend follow-up visits, and seek immediate care if symptoms worsen.",
