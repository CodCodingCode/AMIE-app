    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of septic arthritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt empiric intravenous antibiotics with supportive measures, close monitoring, and specialist involvement. Key interventions include initiating broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (such as Vancomycin plus Ceftriaxone) promptly to target likely bacterial pathogens, with adjustments based on culture results. Supportive measures include immobilization and rest of the affected joint, patient education on medication adherence and symptom monitoring, and pain management techniques. Early and frequent follow-up is essential, with reassessment within 48-72 hours, including clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, to monitor for improvement or signs of deterioration. In cases where fungal etiologies are suspected or confirmed, antifungal agents (e.g., amphotericin B, voriconazole) should be initiated accordingly, ideally in consultation with infectious disease specialists. Coordination with orthopedic surgery for joint drainage and close outpatient follow-up is vital to optimize outcomes. Implementing this plan aims to minimize joint destruction, prevent systemic complications, and promote recovery.",
