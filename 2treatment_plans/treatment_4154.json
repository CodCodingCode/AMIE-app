    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Pheochromocytoma\nJustification: The patient's episodes involve paroxysmal hypertension, severe headaches, sweating, palpitation, flushing, and a sense of a rush\u2014classic signs of catecholamine excess. The episodes are triggered or worsened by stress or positional changes like standing quickly. The presence of spikes in blood pressure along with a constellation of sympathetic symptoms suggests a catecholamine-secreting tumor such as pheochromocytoma. The episodes' variable duration and associated symptoms align with this diagnosis. The warning sensations prior to episodes and episodes occurring without clear triggers do not exclude this possibility, especially given the characteristic sympathetic overactivity.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nPheochromocytoma\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma requires prompt management to control catecholamine-induced hypertension and prevent severe complications such as hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, or organ damage. Initial treatment should focus on definitive diagnosis via biochemical testing and imaging to confirm tumor localization. In the interim, alpha-adrenergic blockade is essential to mitigate hypertensive episodes and reduce perioperative risks. Calcium channel blockers could be used if alpha blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Beta-blockers should be added only after adequate alpha blockade to control tachycardia and arrhythmia, avoiding unopposed alpha stimulation that could worsen hypertensive crises. Non-pharmacologic interventions primarily involve patient counseling to avoid triggers such as stress, positional changes, or certain medications. Once stabilized with appropriate pharmacotherapy, referral for surgical resection of the tumor is indicated, which is the definitive treatment. Monitoring and controlling blood pressure during this period is crucial, with close follow-up to assess treatment response. Education about recognizing symptoms and when to seek urgent care is also important.\n\nANSWER: Begin with initiating alpha-adrenergic blockade, such as phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin, to safely control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises. Once blood pressure is stabilized and the patient tolerates alpha blockade, add a beta-blocker like propranolol or metoprolol to manage tachycardia, ensuring that alpha blockade precedes beta-blockade. Educate the patient to avoid stress, positional changes, and medications that may provoke catecholamine release. Arrange for biochemical testing (plasma free metanephrines or urinary fractionated metanephrines) and imaging studies (CT or MRI of the abdomen) to confirm the diagnosis and localize the tumor. Consult with an endocrinologist and a surgeon experienced in adrenal tumor resection for definitive management. Throughout treatment, monitor blood pressure regularly, and educate the patient about symptoms warranting urgent medical attention. Once medical stabilization is achieved, coordinate surgical resection of the tumor, followed by ongoing surveillance for recurrence."
