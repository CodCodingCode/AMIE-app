    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of systemic symptoms s\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating methotrexate at 15 mg weekly, with regular monitoring of labs and clinical response, alongside physical therapy and patient education on disease and medication management. Immediate focus should be on starting therapy, assessing for contraindications, and providing symptomatic relief. Long-term management involves ongoing follow-up every 3 months to track disease activity and adjust medications as needed. The patient should be informed of potential side effects, signs of complications, and the importance of adherence. Coordination with a rheumatologist is essential within the next 1-2 weeks, with engagement of support services to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to reduce joint damage, improve function, and enhance quality of life, while carefully minimizing risks associated with therapy.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange rheumatology referral, perform baseline labs, and educate the patient on medication and symptoms.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate methotrexate, monitor for side effects, and assess early response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission or low activity, maintain joint function, and prevent damage.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain RA, importance of medication adherence, routine monitoring, and when to seek help.",
