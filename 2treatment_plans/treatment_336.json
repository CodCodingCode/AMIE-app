    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of eczema (atopic dermatitis), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating regular use of emollients and a short course of low to moderate potency topical corticosteroids applied twice daily to affected areas, along with education on trigger avoidance and skin care. This approach aims to reduce inflammation, restore skin barrier function, and minimize itching. The plan also emphasizes lifestyle modifications such as avoiding heat and sweating, wearing loose clothing, and maintaining skin hydration. Follow-up should occur in 2-4 weeks to monitor response, with adjustments made as needed. Patient education will focus on the importance of consistency and recognizing signs of secondary infection or flare. This strategy aims to improve skin comfort, reduce flare frequency, and prevent secondary complications, ensuring safe, sustainable long-term management.",
