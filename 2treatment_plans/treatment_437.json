    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Confidence: Subconjunctival hemorrhage is highly likely given the presentation of eye redness, swelling, tearing, and recent trauma from playing soccer. - Severity: Mild to moderate; typically benign, but extent of hemorrhage and any associated trauma should be assessed. - Urgency: Routine care, unless there are signs of globe rupture, visual changes, or trauma-associated complications. - Differential considerations: Corneal abrasion, trauma-related globe injury, or other ocular injuries; monitor for worsening symptoms.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment: Reassurance and observation; symptomatic management as needed. - Rationale: Self-limited condition, no specific treatment required unless visual disturbance occurs. - Patient considerations: Given the stoic_minimizer demeanor, emphasize the benign nature and importance of monitoring. - Cautions: Watch for signs of expanding hemorrhage or vision changes, which would warrant urgent review.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Medications: None routinely indicated for uncomplicated subconjunctival hemorrhage. - If discomfort occurs: Artificial tears or lubricating eye drops for irritation. - Timeline: Resolution typically occurs within 1-2 weeks. - Monitoring: Ensure no signs of infection or worsening bleeding.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Recommendations: Avoid rubbing the eye, and limit strenuous activity temporarily. - Education: Instruct that it should resolve spontaneously; no need for antibiotics. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid trauma. - Behavioral: Stress the benign nature to minimize patient anxiety.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up: Reassess in 1 week if no improvement or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Parameters: Visual acuity changes, globe integrity, symptom progression. - Red flags: Sudden vision loss, pain, associated trauma, or signs of globe rupture. - Response to treatment: Expect resolution; persistence beyond 2 weeks should prompt further evaluation.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Approach: Provide clear, reassuring information emphasizing the benign and self-limiting nature. - Concerns: Address any worries about vision loss or recurrence proactively. - Adherence: Encourage avoiding eye rubbing and follow-up appointments. - Family: Not necessary unless patient requests support or more education.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Referrals: No specialist needed unless abnormal findings; consider ophthalmology if visual symptoms or trauma is severe. - Healthcare team: Primary care follow-up for overall health management. - Resources: Provide educational leaflets on eye trauma and signs of complications. - Cost: Ensure the patient understands that outpatient observation is sufficient to minimize unnecessary expenses.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes reassuring the patient about the benign nature of this condition, advising observation, and providing symptomatic relief with artificial tears if needed. Initial management focuses on monitoring for any signs of worsening, such as vision changes or trauma-related complications, while emphasizing the importance of avoiding eye rubbing and strenuous activities. Follow-up should occur in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. The approach aims for spontaneous resolution within 1-2 weeks, minimizes unnecessary medication use, and ensures patient understanding and reassurance. This plan is designed to promote healing while reducing patient anxiety and preventing unnecessary interventions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reassure patient of benign nature, advise avoiding eye rubbing, and educate about signs of worsening. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for resolution, ensure no new symptoms develop. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm complete resolution; evaluate for any underlying trauma or bleeding disorders if recurrent or persistent. - Patient handout summary: Include information on subconjunctival hemorrhage, expected course, warning signs requiring urgent care, and self-care tips.",
