The patie\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating appropriate antiepileptic medications, implementing safety and supportive measures, and ensuring close monitoring, with careful attention to the patient's specific presentation and needs. Initial management focuses on controlling seizure frequency and severity, reducing triggers, and addressing associated neurobehavioral issues, while establishing a long-term management strategy emphasizing safety and quality of life. Follow-up care will include regular neurological assessments, seizure tracking, medication adjustments, and educational support for the patient and family, with clear instructions for recognizing warning signs. This approach aims to reduce seizure burden, improve neurological stability, and minimize side effects, while supporting emotional and sensory challenges involved in Dravet syndrome.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule urgent neurological consultation, start seizure safety measures (safe environment, seizure log), and discuss preliminary medication options.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate first-line antiepileptic therapy (e.g., stiripentol, valproate, or custom regimen based on specialist advice), educate family on seizure management and safety, and perform baseline labs and EEG.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve optimal seizure control, monitor medication effectiveness and side effects, develop individualized behavioral and educational plans, and assess neurodevelopmental progress.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize seizure safety, medication adherence, importance of regular follow-up, and support resources available.",
