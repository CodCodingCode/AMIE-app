    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's developmental history indicates significant delays in walking and talking, which are common early indicators of ASD. Behavioral features such as sensory sensitivities (e.g., to loud noises), repetitive behaviors (spinning in circles, staring at objects for extended periods), and difficulties with social communication (not understanding conversations, limited speech, and frustration when routines change) strongly suggest ASD. The child's challenges with understanding speech, communicating effectively, and navigating social interactions further support this diagnosis. The fatigue and confusion can be associated with increased cognitive and sensory overload, common in children with ASD. Overall, the constellation of developmental delays, behavioral patterns, sensory sensitivities, and social-communication deficits points toward ASD as the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the child's diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the primary goals are to enhance communication skills, reduce behavioral challenges, support sensory regulation, and facilitate social engagement. Non-pharmacological interventions such as behaviorally-based therapies (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis), speech and language therapy, occupational therapy for sensory integration, and structured routines are foundational and should be initiated or continued. These therapies are evidence-based and effective in promoting developmental skills and improving quality of life. Pharmacological treatment may be considered if there are significant problematic behaviors such as severe irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, or sleep disturbances that interfere with daily functioning. Medications like risperidone or aripiprazole can be used cautiously under specialist guidance for irritability, while melatonin may assist with sleep issues. Collaboration with specialists, including developmental pediatricians or child psychiatrists, can optimize treatment plans, but initial management by a primary care physician can focus on coordinating therapies and monitoring for medication side effects if prescribed.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this child with ASD involves establishing a multidisciplinary support framework. Initiate or continue behavioral interventions, including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy, to target communication, social skills, and reducing repetitive behaviors. Refer the child for speech and language therapy to improve communication abilities, and occupational therapy for sensory integration and daily living skills. Ensure structured routines and visual supports to aid understanding and reduce anxiety. Address sleep disturbances with behavioral strategies and consider melatonin supplementation if sleep problems persist. If behavioral issues such as irritability or hyperactivity are pronounced, consult a child psychiatrist for evaluation and potential medication management, such as risperidone or aripiprazole, with careful monitoring. Educate and involve caregivers in all aspects of intervention, emphasizing consistency and gradual skill development. Regular follow-up to assess progress and adapt interventions is crucial."
