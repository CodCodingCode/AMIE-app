The treatment plan includes prescribing preservative-free artificial tears, implementing eyelid hygiene, and advising lifestyle modifications such as hydration and screen breaks, with reassurance about the benign nature of floaters. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and education, with follow-up scheduled in 4-6 weeks to assess response and monitor for any new concerning features.
