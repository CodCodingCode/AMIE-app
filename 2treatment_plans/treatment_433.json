    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on history of vomiting, weight loss, malnutrition signs, and behavioral suspicion, though need for further confirmation via detailed inquiry. - Severity classification: Severe, considering significant weight loss, electrolyte disturbances risk, and physical signs of malnutrition. - Urgency level: Immediate, as electrolyte imbalance and malnutrition pose serious risks needing prompt intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Esophageal or gastric pathology, other eating disorder subtypes, and possible gastrointestinal motility issues.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Integrated multidisciplinary approach including psychotherapy, nutritional rehabilitation, and medical monitoring. - Supporting evidence: Behavioral therapy, especially CBT, is most effective; nutritional support is critical to address physical complications. - Patient-specific considerations: Potential withholding of purging behaviors, malnutrition severity, and fatigue; may need a sensitive approach to engagement. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid uncoordinated diet restriction or medication that suppresses appetite without addressing the underlying disorder.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Consider selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine 60 mg daily. - Rationale for selection: FDA-approved for bulimia nervosa; reduces binging and purging behaviors. - Expected timeline for improvement: Several weeks to observe reduction in symptoms. - Key side effects to monitor: Serotonin syndrome, weight changes, gastrointestinal upset. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Other SSRIs or antidepressive agents; avoid medications that lower seizure threshold or cause weight gain negatively.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with a mental health professional trained in eating disorders. - Patient education priorities: Nature of bulimia nervosa, importance of nutrition, avoiding triggers, and recognizing physical warning signs. - Lifestyle modifications: Structured meal plans, gradual normalization of eating patterns, regular sleep, stress reduction exercises. - Behavioral interventions: Techniques like self-monitoring, relapse prevention strategies, family therapy if appropriate.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Weekly or biweekly initially; adjust based on clinical stability. - Monitoring parameters: Weight, electrolyte levels, hydration status, symptom diary, mental health symptomatology. - Red flag symptoms: Severe electrolyte disturbances, syncope, worsening depression, or suicidal ideation requiring urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in purging episodes, weight stabilization, improved mood and energy.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language emphasizing support and non-judgment. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss confidentiality, treatment goals, and addressing fears about weight/behavior change. - Adherence strategies: Build trust, involve patient in goal setting, provide easy-to-understand handouts. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family for support, education, and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Mental health specialist with eating disorder expertise within 1 week. - Other healthcare team members: Nutritionist/dietitian, possibly primary care for physical health monitoring. - Community resources: Support groups like NEDA (National Eating Disorders Association), online resources. - Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm coverage for therapy, medications, and lab tests; discuss financial barriers with patient.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with a mental health professional trained in eating disorders, starting fluoxetine 60 mg daily to reduce binge-purge behaviors, and implementing nutritional rehabilitation through a dietitian\u2019s guidance. Immediate priorities involve close medical monitoring of electrolytes and physical health status, ensuring patient safety from electrolyte disturbances and malnutrition. Long-term management will focus on symptom reduction, weight stabilization, psychological support, and relapse prevention. Follow-up should occur weekly initially, with close monitoring of physical and mental health parameters. Patient education will emphasize understanding the disorder, importance of adherence, and early recognition of warning signs. This integrated approach aims to improve physical and mental health outcomes, reduce harmful behaviors, and support sustainable recovery while minimizing risks such as electrolyte imbalance and nutritional deficiency.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent labs (electrolytes, CBC, metabolic panel), schedule a mental health referral, and provide initial counseling. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stabilization of electrolytes, initiation and adherence to CBT and medication, and regular follow-up. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reduce frequency of purging episodes, improve nutritional status, and stabilize weight. - Patient handout summary: Key points about bulimia nervosa, treatment components, importance of compliance, safety precautions, and contact information for support services.",
