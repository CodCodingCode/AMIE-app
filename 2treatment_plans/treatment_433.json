    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on classic symptoms (polyuria, p\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus with Peripheral Neuropathy and Transient Visual Disturbances, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating basal-bolus insulin therapy, extensive patient education on blood glucose monitoring, dietary management, and lifestyle adjustments, with immediate emphasis on stabilizing blood glucose levels to prevent further complications. Careful titration of insulin, ongoing assessment of neuropathy and visual symptoms, and regular follow-up with endocrinology and ophthalmology will be essential. This approach aims to achieve optimal glycemic control, halt or slow neuropathic progression, and address the patient's anxiety through supportive communication. Initial management should focus on immediate glycemic stabilization, while establishing long-term self-care routines. Follow-up will include frequent blood glucose assessments, HbA1c monitoring at 3-month intervals, and monitoring of neurological and ocular health, with explicit instructions for urgent care if symptoms worsen.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, autoantibodies), initiate insulin education, and start insulin therapy as prescribed.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve target blood glucose levels, monitor for hypoglycemia, provide ongoing education, and evaluate neuropathy/vision symptoms.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain stable glycemic control, improve or stabilize neuropathy symptoms, ensure regular ophthalmology assessments, and support the patient's emotional well-being.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of insulin adherence, blood glucose monitoring, recognizing hypo/hyperglycemia, maintaining a healthy diet, and attending scheduled follow-ups.",
