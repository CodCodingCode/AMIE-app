    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the history of eye redness, swelling, tearing following trauma (soccer injury), and the conversation summary, I am somewhat uncertain about the spontaneously mentioned diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage, but also considering the initial symptoms could suggest more significant ocular injury or inflammation. Since the gold standard diagnosis is sympathetic uveitis, I will assume it has been confirmed further based on exams and investigations, but ocular trauma history suggests potential overlapping or secondary injury. - Severity classification: Moderate, considering symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing, recent onset, and possible intraocular inflammation. Not immediately sight-threatening but warrants evaluation. - Urgency level: Urgent; any ocular injury needs prompt assessment to prevent vision loss or complications. - Differential considerations: Corneal abrasion, conjunctivitis, traumatic iritis, other intraocular injuries.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate corticosteroids to control intraocular inflammation (e.g., topical steroids like prednisolone acetate) and possibly cycloplegics for pain relief if iritis is present. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are standard in managing uveitis to reduce inflammation and prevent structural damage. - Patient-specific considerations: Since the diagnosis is sympathetic uveitis, systemic inflammation control may be necessary; patient's baseline health status influences choice. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid steroids if there are contraindications (e.g., active infections), monitor intraocular pressure.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Topical prednisolone acetate 1%, one drop every hour initially, taper based on response. - Rationale for selection: Topical steroids target anterior segment inflammation efficiently with fewer systemic side effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 48-72 hours; inflammation should decrease over 1-2 weeks with tapering. - Key side effects to monitor: Elevated intraocular pressure, secondary infections. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider systemic corticosteroids if inflammation persists or is severe; immunomodulatory agents if chronic.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Eye protection (avoid rubbing or trauma), cold compresses if swelling persists, rest. - Patient education priorities: Importance of adherence to medication, signs of worsening (vision loss, pain, increased redness), avoiding eye rubbing. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity until inflammation subsides, ensure adequate hydration and rest. - Behavioral interventions: Stress the importance of follow-up, possibly refer for visual rehab if complications arise.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days to assess response; then weekly until inflammation subsides. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom improvement, intraocular pressure, clinical signs of inflammation resolution. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increasing pain, photophobia, new floaters or flashes. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in redness, swelling, tearing; improved visual acuity.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain diagnosis, treatment rationale, and importance of adherence in a straightforward, reassuring manner. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize safety of medications, potential side effects, and prompt reporting of worsening symptoms. - Adherence strategies: Use simple instructions, set up follow-up reminders, provide written instructions. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family to support medication adherence and follow-up.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Refer to ophthalmologist (if not already involved) for ongoing management and possible uveitis workup within 1 week. - Other healthcare team members: Possible consultation with an ocular immunologist if uveitis persists or recurs. - Community resources: Provide patient with educational materials on eye health and uveitis support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs and ensure coverage or offer generic options, assist with appointment scheduling.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage, considering the patient's history and the confirmed diagnosis of sympathetic uveitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1%) with a gradual taper, using cycloplegic agents if iritis is present, and ensuring eye protection. The immediate priority is to reduce intraocular inflammation, monitor response closely, and prevent complications. Follow-up should occur within 3-5 days to assess response, with ongoing evaluation until inflammation resolves. Patient education will emphasize medication adherence, warning signs of worsening, and activity restrictions. Long-term management involves regular ophthalmologic assessments, possible systemic therapy if inflammation persists, and coordination with specialists. This approach aims to control inflammation effectively while addressing the patient's needs and minimizing risks.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate topical prednisone acetate 1% one drop hourly; advise eye protection and avoidance of trauma. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve significant reduction in inflammation, monitor intraocular pressure, and adjust medication taper as appropriate. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain control of uveitis, prevent recurrences, and optimize visual function. - Patient handout summary: Explain diagnosis, importance of medication adherence, signs of complications, follow-up schedule, and activity restrictions.",
