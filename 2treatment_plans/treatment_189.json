    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate pharmacological stabilization with urgent surgical planning. Initiate prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductal patency and ensure adequate systemic and pulmonary circulation. Provide supportive neonatal intensive care, including temperature regulation, continuous monitoring, and caregiver education. Arrange urgent transfer to a tertiary pediatric cardiac surgery center for definitive arterial switch operation, ideally within the first week of life. Follow-up care should include close outpatient monitoring of oxygen saturation, vital signs, and developmental progress, with family education on recognizing warning signs and ensuring adherence to scheduled evaluations. This approach aims to stabilize the infant promptly, minimize hypoxia-related damage, and facilitate definitive correction to improve long-term outcomes while carefully managing risks associated with medical therapy.",
