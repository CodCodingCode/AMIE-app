    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder with language impairment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based speech and language therapy with behavioral interventions tailored to the child's developmental needs. Initial management involves engaging a speech-language pathologist for intensive communication therapy, implementing social skills training, and adopting structured behavioral techniques such as ABA to improve functional social and communicative abilities. Supportive educational accommodations and caregiver training are integral to this strategy. Pharmacological interventions are reserved for managing associated challenging behaviors and require specialist oversight. Regular follow-up at 4-6 weeks will assess progress and facilitate necessary adjustments. The plan emphasizes family involvement, use of visual aids, and community resources to foster social participation and emotional well-being. This multidisciplinary approach aims to enhance communication skills, reduce frustration, and support the child's ongoing development while minimizing risks related to medication side effects and ensuring sustainable progress.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Coordinate with speech-language pathologist referral; provide caregiver education on communication strategies.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate targeted speech therapy; establish home routines supporting communication; track initial response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve improved expressive and receptive language skills; enhance social engagement; support academic inclusion.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include engaging in regular speech therapy, using visual supports, involving family in strategies, and maintaining routine.",
