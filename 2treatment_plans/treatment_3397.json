    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis\nJustification: The patient's symptoms\u2014including fluctuating facial \"wiggliness,\" tingling, muscle weakness in the limbs, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and eyelid drooping after activity\u2014are characteristic of myasthenia gravis. The pattern of worsening after activity and improvement with rest is classical for a neuromuscular junction disorder. The longstanding history since childhood with episodic worsening, along with fatigue and ocular symptoms, supports this diagnosis as the most probable. Other considerations like neurological or metabolic disorders are less consistent with the fluctuating and activity-dependent nature of the symptoms.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMyasthenia Gravis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the established diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, management should focus on symptomatic relief, improving neuromuscular transmission, and preventing complications. The condition often benefits from pharmacologic agents such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction. Non-pharmacological measures include patient education about activity modifications to reduce fatigue, regular monitoring for symptom progression or crises, and awareness of potential side effects of medications. In the primary care setting, initiating medication with pyridostigmine and assessing for responsiveness is a practical first step. Referral to a neurologist for confirmatory testing (e.g., antibody assays, electromyography) and potential immunosuppressive therapy or thymectomy should be considered, but initial management can be safely started by the primary physician or psychiatrist with appropriate follow-up.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating oral pyridostigmine at a starting dose appropriate for the patient's weight and severity, typically 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with adjustments based on clinical response and tolerability. Educate the patient about taking the medication with food to minimize gastrointestinal side effects and advise on recognizing signs of excessive salivation, muscle weakness, or other adverse effects. Encourage the patient to incorporate energy conservation strategies, avoid fatigue, and report any worsening symptoms or signs of respiratory difficulty immediately. Arrange close follow-up within 1-2 weeks to assess symptom response and adjust medication dosing accordingly. Consider referral to neurology for further evaluation, including antibody testing and possible initiation of immunosuppressive therapy if symptoms are moderate to severe, or if pharmacologic management with pyridostigmine alone is insufficient. Additionally, educate the patient about the importance of immunizations\u2014such as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines\u2014and discuss lifestyle modifications to optimize overall function and safety until definitive treatment can be implemented."
