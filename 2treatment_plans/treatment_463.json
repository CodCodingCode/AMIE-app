    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment plan for autonomic dysfunction in a patient with polycythaemia vera presenting with positional dizziness, visual disturbances, headache, fatigu\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of autonomic dysfunction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating supportive measures such as increased hydration, salt intake, compression stockings, and gradual positional changes to alleviate orthostatic symptoms. Pharmacologically, starting fludrocortisone to expand plasma volume is appropriate, with close monitoring for side effects. Non-pharmacologic interventions, patient education, and lifestyle modifications are essential to support symptom control. Follow-up in 2-4 weeks will help assess response and adjust therapy accordingly. Additional referrals to neurology or autonomic specialists may be necessary if symptoms persist. This approach aims to improve orthostatic tolerance, reduce dizziness and visual disturbances, and enhance overall quality of life while considering the patient's stoic and minimizer characteristics to support adherence and engagement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule orthostatic blood pressure testing; initiate hydration and salt intake advice.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate fludrocortisone; monitor symptoms and side effects; reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stable orthostatic BP, reduced dizziness, and improved daily functioning.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of hydration, gradual position changes, medication adherence, and symptom tracking.",
