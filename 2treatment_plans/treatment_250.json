    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ischemic stroke affecting motor and vestibular pathways, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 75-300 mg daily), addressing polycythaemia through phlebotomy to reduce hematocrit levels, and implementing vestibular and motor rehabilitation. Managing underlying hypoxia related to high altitude by advising altitude limitation, oxygen therapy if indicated, and lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and hydration are also essential. Given the patient's anxiety, clear communication, reassurance, and involving support networks will be vital to enhance adherence and reduce stress. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks, monitoring neurological status, hematological parameters, and potential medication side effects will help guide ongoing management. Coordination with neurology, hematology, physiotherapy, and mental health services will support optimal recovery and secondary prevention. This integrated approach aims to stabilize neurological deficits, prevent further ischemic events, and improve functional outcomes while addressing the patient's emotional well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent neurology assessment, initiate aspirin therapy, schedule phlebotomy if hematocrit is elevated, and start basic vestibular and motor assessments.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize neurological deficits, optimize polycythaemia treatment, begin tailored rehabilitation programs, and provide patient education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve functional motor and vestibular stability, prevent recurrence, adapt lifestyle to reduce risk factors, and support mental health.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, symptom monitoring, avoiding high altitude, and seeking immediate care if worsening occurs.",
