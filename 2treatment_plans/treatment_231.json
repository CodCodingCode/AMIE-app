    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure likely secondary to neurocysticercosis from Taenia solium, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based antiparasitic therapy, corticosteroid management, and vigilant monitoring for neurological complications. The treatment plan includes initiating albendazole 400 mg twice daily combined with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and intracranial pressure. Immediate priority is to monitor neurological status closely, manage symptoms, and consider neurosurgical consultation if signs of herniation or mass effect worsen. Patient education focuses on medication adherence, recognition of worsening signs, and understanding the disease process. Follow-up involves regular clinical assessments, repeat neuroimaging within 1-2 weeks for response evaluation, and ongoing monitoring of laboratory parameters. Long-term management emphasizes completing antiparasitic courses, controlling intracranial pressure, and addressing potential residual neurological deficits. This approach aims to improve neurological outcomes, reduce intracranial pressure, and prevent complications while ensuring patient safety through coordinated multidisciplinary care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm medication regimen, assess neurological baseline, arrange follow-up imaging, and consult neurosurgery if indicated.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom stabilization, medication tolerance, dispel misconceptions, and establish regular follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Resolution or reduction of cystic lesions, absence of neurological deterioration, and functional recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain neurocysticercosis, importance of medication adherence, warning signs of worsening condition, and scheduled follow-up visits.",
