    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral stomatitis, likely herpangina or herpes gingivostomatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptomatic management with supportive measures tailored to the child's needs. The treatment plan includes administering age-appropriate analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce pain and fever, ensuring adequate hydration with cold fluids, and encouraging soft, bland foods to minimize oral discomfort. Good oral hygiene and avoiding irritants are essential. Education for caregivers on symptom monitoring, hydration importance, and signs of dehydration or secondary infection are critical. Follow-up in 48-72 hours is advisable to assess improvement, with escalation to urgent care if systemic symptoms worsen or dehydration occurs. This plan aims for symptom resolution within a week while minimizing risks of complications, ensuring comfort, and supporting recovery.",
