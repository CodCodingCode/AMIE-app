The treatment plan includes urgent volume resuscitation with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions, administration of tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding, and prompt surgical repair of the uterine rupture. Supportive care involves continuous monitoring of vital signs, bleeding, and laboratory values, alongside emotional reassurance, given her anxious disposition. Initial management focuses on stabilizing her hemodynamic status and controlling bleeding, while long-term strategies include close follow-up and education on postpartum recovery. Follow-up care will involve regular reassessment, lab monitoring, and addressing any complications or emotional needs, aiming for stabilization, recovery, and prevention of future episodes. This approach is designed to save her life, minimize complications, and support her emotional well-being while ensuring her understanding and active participation in her care.",
