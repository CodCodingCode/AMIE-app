    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Turner Syndrome spectrum or other gonadal dysgenesis\nJustification: The patient presents with primary amenorrhea, absence of breast development, and feelings of body dysmorphism related to lack of pubertal development. She has not undergone any puberty-related changes, which strongly suggests ovarian failure or dysgenesis. Her previous pelvic ultrasound, though unspecified, indicates that imaging was performed, which may have evaluated for gonadal presence or abnormalities. Since she is considering hormone testing, confirming her gonadal hormonal milieu (elevated FSH and LH with low estradiol, or other patterns) would be consistent with POI. The lack of breast development and primary amenorrhea may also indicate Turner syndrome (45,X karyotype), especially considering the presentation, but genetic testing would be necessary; however, this has not yet been performed. The emotional symptoms and body image concerns are consistent with the distress from delayed or absent puberty.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No (additional hormonal, genetic, and imaging data are necessary for a definitive diagnosis)\n\nANSWER:\nPrimary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) or Turner syndrome spectrum\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea, absence of breast development, and potential signs of body dysmorphism strongly suggest primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or Turner syndrome spectrum. Confirmatory testing, including hormonal profiling (elevated FSH and LH with low estradiol), karyotyping, and pelvic imaging, is essential but should be complemented with intervention to support pubertal development and address emotional well-being. Given her age and distress, initiating hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is necessary to induce secondary sexual characteristics, promote bone health, and improve psychological adaptation. Additionally, non-pharmacological approaches such as psychological support, counseling, and education about her condition are crucial for coping and body image concerns. Screening for associated conditions like cardiovascular anomalies and osteoporosis risk should be considered, and a multidisciplinary approach with endocrinology, psychology, and genetics is ideal, but initial management can be initiated within primary care or psychiatry settings.\n\nANSWER: Initiate low-dose combined estrogen therapy appropriate for her age and clinical presentation to induce and maintain secondary sexual characteristics and support bone health. After several months, add low-dose progestin to ensure endometrial safety. Provide psychological support through counseling or referral to mental health services to address body image and emotional distress. Educate the patient about her condition and the importance of ongoing monitoring, including routine bone density scans and cardiovascular assessments. Refer for genetic testing, including karyotype analysis, to clarify the diagnosis and guide further management. Coordinate with endocrinology and genetics specialists for comprehensive care, and ensure the patient understands that hormone therapy and supportive measures are integral to her physical and emotional health."
