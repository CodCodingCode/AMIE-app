    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of necrotising enterocolitis stage 2A/B, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate bowel rest with NPO status, initiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as ampicillin plus gentamicin), and supportive IV fluids to maintain hydration and electrolytes. Close clinical and laboratory monitoring is essential to assess disease progression and response. Careful attention should be given to early surgical consultation, particularly if signs of perforation or clinical deterioration occur.\nInitial management focuses on stabilizing the newborn, preventing complications, and monitoring for worsening symptoms. Caregivers should be educated about the condition, signs of worsening, and when to seek urgent care. Emotional support and reassurance are critical, given caregiver anxiety.\nFollow-up includes daily assessments during hospitalization and outpatient review post-discharge. Long-term goals involve gradual reintroduction of feeds if appropriate and ongoing developmental monitoring. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, nutritionists, and nursing staff, will coordinate comprehensive care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with imaging/labs, start NPO, initiate antibiotics, establish IV access and supportive care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for signs of improvement or deterioration, adjust antibiotics as needed, prepare for gradual feeding reintroduction.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure nutritional rehabilitation, developmental follow-up, and parental education to prevent complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points about NEC, treatment steps, warning signs, and when to seek urgent care.",
