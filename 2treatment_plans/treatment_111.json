    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hepatocellular injury with cholestasis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes thorough diagnostic clarification, addressing the underlying cause (such as viral hepatitis or biliary obstruction), and managing complications associated with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Initial management focuses on stabilization, symptom relief, and avoidance of hepatotoxic agents, while establishing long-term strategies for disease monitoring and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up care will include regular liver function tests, clinical assessments for decompensation, and tailored interventions based on progression or response.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent liver function testing, imaging studies (ultrasound or MRCP), and hepatology consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, initiate supportive and etiology-specific treatments, educate patient on symptom monitoring and lifestyle changes.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor disease progression, prevent complications, optimize liver health, and evaluate need for advanced therapies or transplant evaluation.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about liver disease, importance of adherence, warning signs to report, lifestyle modifications, and scheduled follow-ups.",
