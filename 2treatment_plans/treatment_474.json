The treatment plan includes consistent use of compression garments, skin care, limb elevation, and lifestyle modifications aimed at reducing swelling and preventing infections. Initial management focuses on patient education, adherence, and regular follow-up to monitor limb size and skin integrity. Collaboration with specialists such as lymphedema therapists and possibly endocrinologists will support long-term control. Follow-up assessments in 4-6 weeks will evaluate treatment adherence and effectiveness, with timely intervention if new or worsening symptoms occur. This approach aims to improve limb function, prevent complications, and enhance the patient's quality of life while respecting her stoic/minimizer tendencies by emphasizing the importance of proactive care and regular monitoring.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on limb elevation, skin hygiene, and compression garment use; ensure proper fitting and instructions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve consistent compression wear, monitor limb size, and reinforce education on skin care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain limb stability, prevent infections, and adjust compression as needed; assess for any systemic or hormonal contributions.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Maintain daily compression, limb elevation, skin care, and regular follow-up to control swelling and prevent complications.\"",
