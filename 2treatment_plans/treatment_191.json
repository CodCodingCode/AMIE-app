    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone or aripiprazole, complemented by psychoeducation and supportive therapy. Immediate priorities involve starting medication, monitoring for side effects, and scheduling close follow-up within 1-2 weeks. Long-term management will focus on ongoing symptom assessment, medication adherence, and psychosocial support to improve functioning and reduce relapse risk. Patient education will emphasize understanding symptoms, medication importance, and early relapse signs. Regular monitoring for side effects and psychosocial progress will ensure safety and efficacy. This integrated approach aims to stabilize symptoms effectively while addressing patient-specific communication needs and promoting adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate antipsychotic medication, provide psychoeducation, schedule follow-up within 1-2 weeks.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe for symptom improvement, assess medication tolerability, reinforce psychoeducation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve symptom remission, optimize medication regimen, and involve psychosocial supports.\n- Patient handout summary: Basic info on illness, medication use, importance of follow-up, signs of relapse or side effects.",
