    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria with cerebral involvement, I recommend initiating intravenous artesunate as the first-line treatment to rapidly reduce parasitemia while providing supportive care. This involves close monitoring of neurological status, vital signs, and laboratory parameters, with a focus on early identification of any deterioration. Supportive measures include hydration, oxygen therapy if indicated, and measures to manage increased intracranial pressure if present. The patient should be counseled on the importance of completing therapy, recognizing warning signs, and maintaining follow-up care. Collaboration with infectious disease specialists and neurologists is essential for ongoing management. Treatment aims to stabilize the patient within 24-48 hours, achieve parasite clearance, and prevent further neurological damage, with careful attention to potential side effects such as hemolysis. Follow-up includes daily clinical assessments during hospitalization, with outpatient follow-up until full recovery. The overall goal is rapid resolution of infection, neurological recovery, and prevention of relapse or complications.",
