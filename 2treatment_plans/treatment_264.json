    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach for a patient with suspected lymphoma or disseminated tuberculosis, given systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and the context of lenti\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lymphoma or disseminated tuberculosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt diagnostic evaluation with targeted empiric therapy as indicated. The initial focus should be on conducting an excisional lymph node biopsy and relevant microbiological studies to establish definitive diagnosis. While awaiting results, if TB is highly suspected, empiric anti-tuberculous therapy may be initiated carefully, with close monitoring for side effects. Simultaneously, supportive care including nutritional support and symptom management should be provided. Once diagnosis is confirmed, specific treatment (chemotherapy for lymphoma or tailored anti-TB regimen) will be started. Follow-up will involve regular clinical assessments, serial imaging, and laboratory monitoring to evaluate treatment response, with adjustments made based on evolving findings. Clear patient education and involving multidisciplinary specialists will be key to optimizing outcomes, minimizing risks, and ensuring adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule biopsy and microbiological testing; review HIV status; begin supportive care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Obtain diagnostic results; initiate specific therapy once diagnosis is clear; monitor for drug toxicity and symptom progression.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease control or remission; address any treatment-related complications; provide ongoing follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Explanation of diagnostic process, importance of adherence, potential side effects, and warning signs requiring urgent medical attention.",
