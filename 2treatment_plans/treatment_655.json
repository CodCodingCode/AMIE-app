    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan: confirming diagnosis, assessing severity, selecting appropriate interventions, and establishing follow-up. For pulmonary embolism, prompt and evidence-based management is critical, even though the initial diagnosis was diaphragmatic hernia, which suggests a complex clinical picture requiring careful differentiation. The severity appears severe, given cyanosis and respiratory distress, necessitating immediate action. Treatment focuses on stabilizing the patient, initiating anticoagulation, and arranging for definitive diagnosis and care. Patient-specific factors include variable symptom reporting and potential diagnostic confusion, so communication and clear instructions are vital.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate stabilization with supplemental oxygen, initiation of anticoagulation therapy, and thorough diagnostic assessment, with careful attention to the patient's complex presentation and potential underlying conditions. Initial management focuses on rapid stabilization and preventing clot propagation, while establishing long-term anticoagulation and follow-up care. Follow-up will include serial assessment of respiratory status, monitoring coagulation parameters, and imaging as needed, with clear instructions for the patient regarding recognition of worsening symptoms and when to seek urgent care. This approach is designed to improve oxygenation, prevent recurrence, and address underlying causes, while minimizing bleeding risks and ensuring sustainable management of PE.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 >94%, start empiric anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), obtain urgent chest CTA or V/Q scan to confirm diagnosis, and monitor vital signs closely. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, achieve stability, transition to oral anticoagulants such as warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (e.g., apixaban), and educate patient about medication adherence and symptom monitoring. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain anticoagulation, evaluate for underlying causes, and plan for duration of therapy based on risk assessment. Encourage smoking cessation, activity modification, and review of risk factors. - Patient handout summary: Explain PE, importance of anticoagulation, recognizing warning signs, activity advice, medication adherence, and follow-up schedule.",
