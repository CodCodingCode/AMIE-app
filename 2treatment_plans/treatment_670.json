    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The presentation suggests a vitreous hemorrhage or early retinal detachment, which are urgent ocular emergencies. Confidence in this diagnosis is high given the history of visual disturbances, floaters, dark spots, and worsening symptoms. The severity appears to be moderate to severe, as the symptoms are persistent and progressing, indicating potential risk for complete retinal detachment or vision loss. Urgency level is immediate to urgent, requiring prompt ophthalmologic evaluation. Differential considerations include posterior vitreous detachment with hemorrhage, choroidal or retinal tear, or retinal detachment without hemorrhage, all necessitating close monitoring.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment involves urgent ophthalmologic assessment with retinal examination, possibly imaging such as B-scan ultrasound if media opacities limit visualization. Immediate management prioritizes diagnosis and surgical intervention if needed (e.g., vitrectomy) for retinal detachment or hemorrhage. Supportive care includes bed rest, head positioning if indicated, and avoiding activities that increase intraocular pressure. Evidence supports prompt surgical repair for retinal detachment to optimize visual outcomes. Patient-specific factors include communication barriers; thus, rapid referral and clear communication are critical. Avoiding delays is essential to prevent permanent vision loss.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Medications are generally adjunctive at this stage; corticosteroids may be considered to reduce inflammation if inflammation is present, but definitive treatment relies on surgical repair. No specific pharmacological intervention is primary; however, intraocular pressure should be monitored if elevated, and medications like topical steroids or anti-glaucoma agents may be used if necessary under specialist guidance. Immediate pharmacological treatment alone is insufficient; surgical intervention is key.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Non-drug interventions include patient education on avoiding activities that may worsen detachment, ensuring safety during disruptions to vision, and understanding the urgency of follow-up. Stressing the importance of prompt assessment and avoiding self-treatment is critical. Lifestyle modifications involve minimizing activities that increase intraocular pressure. Behavioral interventions may include counseling on the potential impact and emotional support, especially if vision loss occurs.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up includes urgent ophthalmology consultation within 24 hours, with subsequent monitoring for visual changes or complications. Long-term follow-up depends on surgical outcomes. Symptoms indicating worsening\u2014such as increased shadow, curtain effect, or sudden vision loss\u2014necessitate immediate re-evaluation. Monitoring parameters include visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and retinal status.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the baseline communication style, I will use clear, simple language emphasizing urgency, the importance of immediate evaluation, and adherence to specialist advice. Address concerns proactively by explaining potential outcomes and emphasizing the need for urgent care. Reinforce the importance of follow-up and safety precautions. Use visual aids if helpful and involve family members if the patient consents, to support understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Referral to ophthalmology, preferably retina specialist, is urgent (within 24 hours). Coordinate with the ophthalmology team for surgical scheduling. Include any team members involved in follow-up care, such as nursing or rehabilitation services. Provide patient with educational materials about retinal detachment and recovery. Cost and insurance considerations should be addressed with patient support services if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vitreous hemorrhage or early retinal detachment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with possible surgical intervention, supported by patient education and close monitoring. The immediate priority is referral to an ophthalmologist\u2014preferably a retinal specialist\u2014within 24 hours for detailed examination and management, which may include vitrectomy or laser repair if indicated. Supportive measures include instructing the patient to avoid activities increasing intraocular pressure, maintaining bed rest if advised, and monitoring for worsening symptoms. Long-term management involves scheduled follow-up visits, ensuring surgical success, and addressing any residual visual deficits or complications. Patient understanding of the urgency and adherence to follow-up are vital for preserving vision. This plan aims to optimize surgical outcomes, minimize risks of permanent vision loss, and support the patient's comprehension and engagement in care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology referral; advise patient on symptom monitoring; instruct on activity restrictions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical intervention if needed; monitor post-op recovery; reassess visual function. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stable retinal attachment, monitor for complications, and support visual rehabilitation if necessary. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgency of eye symptoms, follow-up importance, activity restrictions, and signs of worsening that require immediate attention.",
