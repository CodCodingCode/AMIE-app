Initial management should prioritize prompt antibiotic therapy with Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin, along with supportive measures to maintain hydration and neurologic stability. Ongoing assessment includes frequent neurological evaluations, laboratory monitoring, and adjusting antibiotics based on culture results. Educate the patient on symptom recognition and adherence, involve family for support, and coordinate with infectious disease and neurology specialists as needed. Follow-up should occur within 48-72 hours to evaluate treatment response and prevent complications, aiming for full neurological recovery with minimized risks.",
