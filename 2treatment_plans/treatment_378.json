    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical presentation consistent with acute cerebrovascular event, likely ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, confirmed by urgent neuroimaging. - Severity classification: Severe; signs such as right-sided hemiparesis, aphasia, visual disturbances, and altered consciousness suggest significant neurological deficits. - Urgency level: Immediate; stroke symptoms require prompt evaluation and intervention to minimize brain damage and prevent deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other intracranial pathologies such as evolving hemorrhage, seizure activity, or metabolic causes need to be ruled out.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Rapid neuroimaging (CT/MRI), followed by stabilization and specific stroke management protocols. - Supporting evidence: Early imaging confirms hemorrhage vs ischemia, guiding targeted therapy; timely reperfusion therapy (if ischemic) and blood pressure management are critical. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, possible comorbidities, and ceasing any anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents if indicated. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoiding invasive procedures that can worsen bleeding; cautious blood pressure lowering in hemorrhagic cases.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: For ischemic stroke, IV thrombolysis (tPA) within 4.5 hours; for hemorrhagic, avoid thrombolytics and consider blood pressure control. - Rationale for selection: tPA is effective when administered promptly in ischemic stroke; antihypertensives help limit hematoma expansion in hemorrhagic stroke. - Expected timeline for improvement: Neurological status may stabilize or improve within days; close monitoring vital. - Key side effects to monitor: Bleeding (intracranial and systemic), allergic reactions, blood pressure fluctuations. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Mechanical thrombectomy or supportive care; for blood pressure, different antihypertensives.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Speech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and supportive care to maximize functional recovery. - Patient education priorities: Recognize stroke symptoms, importance of rapid response, medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Blood pressure control, diet (low salt, balanced), smoking cessation, moderate exercise. - Behavioral interventions: Rehabilitation programs, counseling for psychological support, strategies for safety and fall prevention.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment within 24-48 hours; outpatient follow-up within 1 week, then regularly based on recovery. - Monitoring parameters: Neurological status (NIH Stroke Scale), blood pressure, bleeding signs, laboratory values (coagulation profile). - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of headache, new neurological deficits, signs of bleeding, or consciousness deterioration. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in neurological deficits, ability to perform ADL, absence of complications.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, and straightforward language recognizing baseline patient behavior. - Addressing patient concerns: Anxiety about prognosis, treatment risks, and recovery expectations. - Adherence strategies: Involve family members, provide written instructions, schedule follow-ups. - Family involvement: Engage family in education and caregiving planning.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurocritical care, vascular neurology, and rehabilitation services promptly. - Other healthcare team members: Physical, occupational, and speech therapists; social workers. - Community resources: Stroke support groups, educational materials from stroke associations. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for acute interventions, rehabilitation, and outpatient services.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent neuroimaging to confirm stroke type, immediate stabilization, and tailored interventions depending on ischemic or hemorrhagic nature. For ischemic stroke, prompt thrombolytic therapy within the therapeutic window is prioritized, alongside blood pressure control and supportive care. For hemorrhagic stroke, focus on blood pressure management, neurological monitoring, and avoiding anticoagulation. Supportive therapies such as speech, occupational, and physical therapy are essential for recovery. Close monitoring of neurological status, vital signs, and signs of deterioration guides ongoing treatment. The plan emphasizes clear communication with the patient and family, early multidisciplinary involvement, and structured follow-up to optimize outcomes and minimize complications. This approach aims to reduce neurological deficits, support functional recovery, and prevent recurrence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate urgent neuroimaging, stabilize airway/breathing/circulation, and consult neurology/neurosurgery teams. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stability, administer appropriate therapies, and begin early rehabilitation. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maximize neurological recovery, prevent secondary strokes, and support functional independence. - Patient handout summary: Emphasizes recognizing stroke symptoms, importance of rapid care, medication adherence, lifestyle changes, and follow-up appointments.",
