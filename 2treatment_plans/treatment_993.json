    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate certainty; although the initial diagnosis was calciphylaxis, the final diagnosis is cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), indicating a potential misdiagnosis or a complex presentation. Given the description of necrotic, ulcerated, bleeding skin with foul odor and persistent progression, SCC is confirmed as the final diagnosis. - Severity classification: Severe, due to extensive necrosis, open wounds, bleeding, and persistent progression over several months, indicating advanced and potentially invasive disease requiring urgent attention. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed, considering the risk of infection, bleeding, and potential for systemic complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis), metastatic spread, or secondary complications like sepsis, alongside ongoing assessment for possible invasion.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision of the tumor with clear margins remains standard for SCC, especially localized lesions. - Supporting evidence: Complete surgical removal offers the best chance for cure and tissue preservation. For extensive or invasive tumors, Mohs micrographic surgery is preferred due to tissue-sparing benefit. - Patient-specific considerations: Wound care complexity, pain management needs, potential comorbidities influencing anesthesia or surgery, and emotional distress. - Contraindications or cautions: Ensure patient fitness for surgery; if not suitable, consider adjunctive therapies.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not primary medicine, but if surgery isn't feasible immediately, consider topical agents (e.g., 5-FU, imiquimod) for superficial SCC or systemic therapy for advanced cases, such as immunotherapy (cemiplimab). - Rationale for selection: Surgical excision is preferred; systemic immunotherapy may be indicated for inoperable or metastatic disease. - Expected timeline for improvement: Wound healing post-surgery typically seen in weeks; systemic therapies may take 2-3 months to show response. - Key side effects to monitor: Postoperative infection, wound dehiscence, systemic immunotherapy-related adverse events (immune-related side effects). - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapies.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Wound management with appropriate dressings, wound debridement if necrosis persists, infection control measures. - Patient education priorities: Importance of wound hygiene, recognizing signs of infection or bleeding, and adherence to follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid trauma to affected areas, optimize nutrition to support healing, manage comorbidities like diabetes if present. - Behavioral interventions: Pain management strategies, psychological support for coping with emotional distress and body image issues.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks post-treatment; sooner if signs of infection or worsening. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing progress, signs of infection (redness, warmth, pus), bleeding, and pain levels. - Red flag symptoms: Increased bleeding, signs of systemic infection, new or worsening pain, fever, or rapid lesion growth. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical inspection of wound resolution, histopathological confirmation if biopsies are performed, and imaging if invasion/metastasis is suspected.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain diagnosis, treatment options, and expected outcomes in simple, empathetic language. - Addressing patient concerns: Validate fears about mortality, provide reassurance about treatment plans, and discuss prognosis transparently. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize the importance of follow-up, wound care, and prompt reporting of new symptoms. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for wound care, emotional reassurance, and transportation if needed.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncology or dermatologic surgeon for excision; potentially plastic surgery for reconstruction. - Other healthcare team members: Wound care nurses, mental health professionals if psychological support is needed. - Community resources: Support groups for skin cancer patients, patient education materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for surgical procedures, advanced therapies, and supportive care options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines surgical excision as the primary intervention, supported by adjunctive wound care, patient education, and close follow-up. Initial management involves scheduling definitive surgical removal with histopathological confirmation of clear margins, alongside meticulous wound management to prevent infection and promote healing. For extensive or invasive lesions, consideration of adjunctive radiotherapy or systemic immunotherapy (e.g., cemiplimab) for disease control may be necessary. Ongoing monitoring will focus on wound healing, signs of infection or recurrence, and patient symptomatology, with follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks initially. Patient education will emphasize the importance of wound care, recognizing adverse signs, and adhering to follow-up plans. Coordination with surgical oncology, wound care specialists, and mental health providers will ensure comprehensive care. This plan aims to achieve tumor clearance, optimize skin healing, improve quality of life, and manage potential complications proactively.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange surgical consultation for excision, initiate wound education, and provide analgesics for pain control. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision, ensure proper wound dressing, monitor for infection, and manage pain effectively. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete wound healing, monitor for recurrence or metastasis, and support psychological well-being. - Patient handout summary: Explain the diagnosis, outline the treatment plan including surgery and wound care, emphasize signs needing urgent attention, and reinforce follow-up importance.",
