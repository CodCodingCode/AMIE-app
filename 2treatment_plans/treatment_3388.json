    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressively worsening gait instability, frequent falls, impaired balance, and difficulty with fine motor tasks over several years strongly suggests a neurodegenerative disorder. The new-onset dizziness, feelings of mental \"fuzziness,\" and swallowing difficulties indicate involvement of brain regions controlling motor coordination and bulbar functions. Additionally, the problematic eye movements, particularly difficulty with smooth pursuit, problems looking up or down, and occasional double vision, are characteristic of vertical gaze palsy and supranuclear gaze palsy, hallmark features of PSP. The absence of drooping eyelids (which rules out myasthenia gravis or ptosis) further supports this diagnosis. PSP often presents with postural instability, early falls, and ocular motility abnormalities, matching this case well. The fluctuating severity and symptoms involving gait, balance, ocular motor control, and swallowing point towards PSP as the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nProgressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gait instability, frequent falls, ocular motor disturbances, and bradykinesia. While there is no cure, symptomatic management can improve quality of life. Pharmacologic interventions such as levodopa may offer limited benefit for parkinsonian features, but typically have minimal impact on ocular and postural symptoms. Non-pharmacological strategies are crucial and include physical therapy aimed at improving gait and balance to reduce fall risk, occupational therapy for assistance with activities of daily living, and speech therapy to manage swallowing difficulties and prevent aspiration. Additionally, safety modifications at home, such as removing tripping hazards and installing grab bars, can help prevent injuries. Supportive care should also include regular monitoring for dysphagia, with early involvement of a speech-language pathologist and consideration of swallowing studies. Given the progressive nature of PSP, a multidisciplinary approach focusing on symptom management and fall prevention is essential.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive management plan that includes referral to physical and occupational therapy to improve gait, balance, and safety at home, and speech therapy to evaluate and address dysphagia. Consider a trial of low-dose levodopa to assess for any potential benefit in motor symptoms, understanding that response is often limited. Educate the patient and caregivers on fall prevention strategies, environmental safety modifications, and the importance of monitoring for worsening symptoms. Regular follow-up with neurology or movement disorder specialist is recommended for ongoing assessment and management adjustments. Supportive care, including nutritional counseling and psychological support, should be provided as needed to address the evolving needs associated with PSP."
