    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis and determine its severity and urgency. Since the patient presents with classic signs of viral conjunctivitis\u2014redness, swelling, tearing\u2014symptom onset within 2 days suggests a recent viral etiology. Given the patient's baseline health status and the absence of severe systemic symptoms or vision changes, this appears to be a mild to moderate case requiring routine care. Differential diagnoses such as bacterial conjunctivitis or allergic conjunctivitis are less likely but still worth monitoring if symptoms worsen or do not improve in a week.  Regarding treatment, current guidelines support supportive care for viral conjunctivitis, as antiviral medications are generally not indicated unless herpes zoster or simplex is suspected, which isn't indicated here. Education on hygiene to prevent transmission is crucial. Follow-up is necessary if symptoms persist beyond 1-2 weeks, or if visual acuity declines or pain worsens.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care with artificial tears and cold compresses, emphasizing good hygiene to prevent transmission, with careful attention to symptom monitoring. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and preventing spread, while establishing follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen. Follow-up care will include scheduled reassessment in 5-7 days and patient education on symptom progression, signs of complication, and when to seek urgent care. This approach is designed to promote symptomatic relief, reduce contagion, and prevent complications while minimizing unnecessary medication use and side effects.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on proper eye hygiene, recommend over-the-counter artificial tears, and advise avoiding touching or rubbing the eyes. Provide instructions on handwashing and disinfecting surfaces. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom improvement, ensure no worsening or development of complications, and reinforce hygiene practices. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution of conjunctivitis and prevent recurrence; monitor for any signs of secondary infection. - Patient handout summary: - Use artificial tears as needed to soothe the eyes - Apply cold compresses for swelling and discomfort - Practice frequent handwashing and avoid touching eyes - Do not share towels or pillows - Seek medical attention if vision changes, pain worsens, or symptoms last beyond 2 weeks",
