    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity. The patient displays classic symptoms of a duodenal ulcer, including nocturnal severe burning pain and postprandial discomfort. T\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease\u2014specifically a duodenal ulcer\u2014I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce gastric acid secretion, confirming and treating *Helicobacter pylori* infection if present, and making lifestyle modifications. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and ulcer healing, with long-term strategies to prevent recurrence.\nImmediate actions (today):\n- Prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole 20 mg once daily) for at least 4-8 weeks.\n- Arrange for testing for *H. pylori* infection via urea breath test or stool antigen test before starting eradication therapy.\n- Educate the patient about the importance of medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and lifestyle adjustments.\nShort-term goals (1-4 weeks):\n- Confirm *H. pylori* status and initiate eradication therapy if positive.\n- Achieve symptom control and improve sleep quality.\n- Educate on dietary modifications avoiding NSAIDs, alcohol, spicy foods, and smoking.\nLong-term objectives (3-6 months):\n- Confirm ulcer healing with repeat assessment if symptoms persist.\n- Educate about recurrence prevention, including lifestyle changes.\n- Schedule follow-up to reassess symptoms and consider endoscopy if symptoms persist or worsen.\nPatient handout summary:\n- Take prescribed medications exactly as directed.\n- Avoid NSAIDs, alcohol, spicy foods, and smoking.\n- Report any signs of bleeding (vomiting blood or dark stools), worsening pain, or other urgent symptoms immediately.\n- Follow up as scheduled for tests and reassessment.\nThis approach aims to promote ulcer healing, prevent complications, and improve the patient's quality of life, while minimizing medication side effects and addressing behavioral factors influencing disease course.",
