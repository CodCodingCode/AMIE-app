    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given recent synthetic cannabinoid use and presence of perceptual disturbances, paranoid ideation, halluc\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Synthetic cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive interventions, patient education, and cautious pharmacological management. The initial focus is on ensuring patient safety, symptom stabilization, and addressing substance use behaviors. Supportive care includes a safe environment and reassurance, with consideration of a low-dose atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone if symptoms persist or escalate. Close follow-up within 48-72 hours is essential to monitor symptom progression, side effects, and substance abstinence. Psychoeducation about the effects of synthetic cannabinoids and the importance of abstinence is key, along with non-pharmacologic strategies like sleep hygiene and stress management. Coordination with psychiatric specialists and community resources aims to promote recovery while minimizing risks of relapse or persistent symptoms. This approach strives for symptom resolution, improved functioning, and reduced harm associated with substance use.",
