    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (considering underlying bipolar features), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy and lifestyle modifications. The initial pharmacologic treatment involves starting sertraline 50 mg daily, with close monitoring for side effects and response. Concurrent supportive psychotherapy, focusing on psychoeducation and stress management, will enhance outcomes. It is essential to involve a psychiatrist to evaluate for bipolar disorder and consider mood stabilizers if indicated. Regular follow-up visits are scheduled every 2-4 weeks initially, with ongoing assessment of symptoms, side effects, and potential mood shifts. Education about the nature of depression and bipolar disorder, along with involving family members with patient consent, will support adherence and stability. This integrated plan aims to alleviate depressive symptoms, monitor for bipolar features, and establish a foundation for long-term mood stabilization and improved functioning.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate pharmacotherapy (sertraline 50 mg), schedule psychiatric consultation, and arrange for psychotherapy referral.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess medication tolerability, evaluate initial symptom changes, and educate the patient on symptom monitoring.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained remission, confirm bipolar diagnosis if applicable, and develop a long-term management plan.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain depression, treatment options, importance of medication adherence, warning signs of mood switches, and when to seek urgent care.",
