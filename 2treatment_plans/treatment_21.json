    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Primary Testicular Failure (Azoospermia/Oligozoospermia due to testicular dysfunction, possibly primary hypogonadism)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of decreased semen volume over several months, along with a slightly smaller or firmer testicles and discomfort, suggests impaired testicular function affecting spermatogenesis and hormone production. Symptoms of fatigue, feeling down, increased anxiety, and difficulty concentrating are consistent with decreased testosterone levels or hypogonadism. The absence of systemic illness, trauma, or medications points toward primary testicular pathology rather than secondary causes. The willingness to undergo blood testing aligns with further hormonal evaluation to confirm testicular failure.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional hormonal testing needed to confirm the diagnosis)\n- No further clarification needed: No (clinical exam and blood tests required for confirmation)\n\nANSWER:\nPrimary Testicular Failure\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is diagnosed with primary testicular failure, which involves impaired testicular function leading to low testosterone and compromised spermatogenesis. Management should address hormonal deficiencies and improve overall well-being. Since the diagnosis suggests primary hypogonadism, hormone replacement therapy with testosterone is appropriate to alleviate symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, and concentration issues, and to potentially improve testicular health. Prior to initiating therapy, confirming low serum testosterone levels and evaluating gonadotropins (LH and FSH) are essential to establish the diagnosis. Non-pharmacological strategies, such as lifestyle modifications including weight management, regular exercise, and stress reduction, can support hormonal health and overall well-being. Psychological support or counseling may also be beneficial if the patient experiences emotional distress related to fertility issues or body image concerns. It's important to monitor for potential side effects of testosterone therapy, including erythrocytosis and prostate health, through regular follow-up.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves confirming the diagnosis with baseline morning serum total testosterone, LH, FSH, and prolactin levels. Once confirmed, initiate testosterone replacement therapy via a suitable route (e.g., gels, patches, or injections) to restore testosterone levels, alleviate hypogonadal symptoms, and improve quality of life. In addition, advise the patient on lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, reducing alcohol intake, and managing stress. Offer psychological support or counseling as needed to address emotional or mental health concerns. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor testosterone levels, hematocrit, prostate health, and overall well-being, adjusting therapy as appropriate. Fertility preservation can be discussed, keeping in mind that exogenous testosterone can suppress spermatogenesis; therefore, if fertility is desired in the future, alternative options such as gonadotropin therapy (e.g., HCG, FSH) should be considered in consultation with a specialist."
