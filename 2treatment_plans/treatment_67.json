    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on recent trauma and conjunctival signs. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate, as symptoms began 2 days ago with localized redness, swelling, and tearing without vision changes or significant pain. - Urgency level: Routine care initially, but if vision loss or worsening develops, escalate to urgent. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasions, eyelid lacerations, orbital hematoma, or more serious ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with protective measures, topical lubrication, and anti-inflammatory agents as needed. - Supporting evidence: Restoring ocular surface integrity and reducing inflammation promotes healing and prevents infection. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety may cause increased concern about symptoms; reassure patient. - Contraindications or cautions: No contraindicated medications here; avoid eye drops with preservatives if possible; monitor for signs of infection.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (preservative-free), 1-2 drops every 1-2 hours as needed. - Rationale for selection: Relieves dryness and irritation, supporting ocular surface healing. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 48-72 hours. - Key side effects to monitor: None significant; educate patient to report worsening or signs of infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical anti-inflammatory drops like low-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 0.125%), if inflammation persists and no contraindications.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Protection of the eye\u2014avoid rubbing, minimize exposure to irritants. - Patient education priorities: Proper eye hygiene, avoiding contact with dirty hands, and recognizing warning signs. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest from strenuous activities; use sunglasses outdoors. - Behavioral interventions: Anxiety management techniques; reassurance; if anxiety persists, consider referral for counseling.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, signs of infection, vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, increasing swelling, double vision, or purulent discharge\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, reduced redness and swelling.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, and reassuring; use simple language. - Addressing patient concerns: Validate worries, explain expected recovery pathways. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions; schedule prompt follow-up. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family members for support and to reinforce instructions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmologist consultation if no improvement in 3-5 days or if condition worsens. - Other healthcare team members: None immediately; consider mental health referral if anxiety persists. - Community resources: Eye health educational materials; support groups for trauma. - Insurance/cost considerations: Use available outpatient services; discuss affordable options if medications are needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or eyelid contusion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with preservative-free artificial tears, protective measures to prevent further irritation, and close monitoring for signs of worsening or infection. Initial management centers on symptom relief and patient reassurance, with follow-up in 48-72 hours to evaluate healing progress. The plan emphasizes clear communication tailored to the patient's anxious temperament, ensuring understanding of the expected course and warning signs that necessitate urgent care. Long-term management involves continued symptom monitoring, eye protection, and prompt escalation if recovery stalls or complications arise.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate patient on eye protection, start artificial tears, advise on activity limitations, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, no signs of infection or vision problems, patient comfortable with eye care routine. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete healing, prevention of recurrence, address any residual anxiety if relevant. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions on eye hygiene, medication use, warning signs, and follow-up schedule.",
