    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of perineuritis of the optic nerve (a form of optic neuritis), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days) followed by a taper of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for approximately 11 days). This approach aims to rapidly reduce inflammation, preserve vision, and promote recovery. Concurrently, I suggest patient education about the condition, monitoring for side effects, and regular follow-up to assess visual improvement and identify any adverse effects. Coordination with neuro-ophthalmology for further evaluation, including MRI imaging, is essential to rule out underlying demyelinating disease such as MS. The plan emphasizes early intervention, vigilant monitoring, and supportive care to optimize visual and neurological outcomes while minimizing risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate consultation with ophthalmology or neurology for assessment; start planning for high-dose IV corticosteroids.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Improve visual symptoms; complete initial steroid course; stabilize patient with follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence; evaluate for underlying systemic disease; ensure visual function is preserved.\n- Patient handout summary: Educate about optic neuritis, treatment plan, importance of follow-up, and warning signs requiring urgent care.",
