    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of migraine aura with visual and vestibular symptoms, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes patient education on trigger avoidance, lifestyle modifications such as regular sleep, hydration, and stress management, and the use of simple analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for acute attacks. If episodes become frequent or disabling, consider prophylactic therapy under specialist supervision. Short-term follow-up in 4-6 weeks will assess symptom frequency, medication efficacy, and side effects, with ongoing monitoring for any neurological changes. I will communicate this plan using clear, simple language, involving caregivers to reinforce adherence and understanding. Additional referrals to a pediatric neurologist are indicated if symptoms escalate or do not improve, and educational resources will support coping strategies. This integrated approach aims to reduce episode frequency, improve quality of life, and ensure safe, age-appropriate management.",
