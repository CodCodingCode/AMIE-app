    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on typical symptoms of chest pain worsened by inspiration, associated with shortness of breath and episodic tachycardia; however, definitive diagnosis requires further testing such as echocardiography, ECG, and possibly inflammatory markers. - Severity classification: Likely moderate, given persistent symptoms over 3 days with some concern for ongoing myocardial or pericardial inflammation, but no evidence of tamponade, shock, or hemodynamic instability. - Urgency level: Urgent \u2014 requires prompt evaluation, including imaging and laboratory assessment, to confirm diagnosis and prevent complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, musculoskeletal pain, and other myocardial conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and rest. - Supporting evidence: NSAIDs reduce inflammation and pain in pericarditis and myocarditis; encouraging rest minimizes cardiac workload. - Patient-specific considerations: Avoid NSAIDs if patient has renal impairment or gastric ulcer; monitor for adverse effects. - Contraindications or cautions: NSAIDs contraindicated in certain renal, gastrointestinal, or bleeding disorders; caution in hypertensive patients.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Oral NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 600\u2013800 mg three times daily for 1\u20132 weeks), with assessment for symptom improvement. - Rationale for selection: NSAIDs are first-line for reducing inflammation and pain; widely supported by guidelines. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief typically within a few days; continued treatment for at least 1\u20132 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal irritation, renal function, blood pressure; monitor for signs of bleeding. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily), especially if recurrent episodes; corticosteroids as a last resort if NSAIDs contraindicated or ineffective.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest with limited physical activity until symptoms subside. - Patient education priorities: Recognize signs of worsening (e.g., worsening chest pain, dyspnea, signs of tamponade), importance of medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity, caffeine, and stimulants until otherwise advised. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques to reduce sympathetic tone.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1\u20132 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, ECG changes, repeat echocardiography if indicated, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR). - Red flag symptoms: Increasing chest pain, syncope, sudden worsening dyspnea, signs of cardiac tamponade. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, normalization of ECG, decreased inflammatory markers.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language, emphasize the importance of adherence, and encourage questions; reassure about the safety and purpose of treatments. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss potential side effects, reassure about safety, clarify that symptoms may improve with therapy. - Adherence strategies: Schedule follow-up, provide written instructions, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Only if patient consents; ensure they understand warning signs and support adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiology consultation for further evaluation and management, especially if symptoms persist or worsen. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing education on medication use and symptom monitoring. - Community resources: Patient education materials on myocarditis/pericarditis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medications are affordable; discuss insurance coverage for tests and specialist visits.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pericarditis/myocarditis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 600\u2013800 mg TID for 1\u20132 weeks) for inflammation and pain relief, combined with rest and activity restriction. Close follow-up within 1\u20132 weeks is essential to monitor symptom resolution, ECG changes, and inflammatory markers, with patient education on warning signs requiring immediate attention. An echocardiogram and further cardiac evaluation should be arranged promptly, and cardiology consultation obtained if symptoms persist or worsen. Supportive measures include stress reduction and avoiding strenuous activity. Emphasis on adherence, understanding potential side effects, and recognizing worsening symptoms will be a focus of communication. This approach aims to reduce inflammation, ease symptoms, prevent complications, and establish a sustainable management plan for recovery.",
