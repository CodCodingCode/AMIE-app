    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute limb ischemia due to arterial occlusion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent revascularization with medical stabilization, patient education, and close follow-up. Initial management includes administering IV unfractionated heparin to prevent thrombus propagation, ensuring the limb is kept warm and immobilized, and obtaining immediate vascular surgical consultation for possible surgical embolectomy or catheter-based revascularization. The patient must be prepared for urgent invasive intervention to restore blood flow and prevent limb loss. Post-procedure, regular monitoring of limb perfusion, neurological status, and signs of bleeding is essential. Long-term management involves controlling vascular risk factors through lifestyle modifications and medication adherence, with scheduled follow-up to assess recovery and prevent recurrence. Clear communication with the patient and family about the urgency, procedures, and prognosis will support compliance and reduce anxiety. Coordination with vascular surgery, nursing, and community resources will facilitate a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV heparin infusion, perform clinical assessment and limb examination, arrange urgent vascular surgical consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reperfusion, monitor for complications, optimize vascular risk factors, and ensure patient understanding.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain vascular health, prevent re-occlusion, and conduct rehabilitation as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgency of treatment, importance of follow-up, lifestyle changes, and recognizing signs of worsening condition.",
