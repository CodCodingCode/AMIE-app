    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High certainty; based on clinical features and biopsy results confirming melanoma. - Severity classification: Malignant melanoma requires immediate attention due to risk of metastasis; staging based on Breslow thickness and other histopathologic features is critical. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to determine staging and initiate treatment. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other pigmented lesions or benign melanosis, but confirmed melanoma takes precedence.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with margins appropriate to Breslow thickness, possibly sentinel lymph node biopsy if indicated. - Supporting evidence: Surgical removal with adequate margins is the cornerstone of melanoma management; adjuvant therapy considered if high risk. - Patient-specific considerations: Psychological distress necessitates compassionate communication and support. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid incomplete excision; monitor for signs of recurrence or metastasis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Not applicable initially; focus on surgical management. If systemic therapy needed, options include immunotherapy (e.g., pembrolizumab) or targeted therapy depending on mutation status. - Rationale for selection: For early-stage melanoma, surgery is primary; systemic therapy reserved for advanced stages. - Expected timeline for improvement: Surgical healing in weeks; systemic therapy responses in months. - Key side effects to monitor: Postoperative complications; for systemic therapy, immune-related adverse events. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Targeted therapies like BRAF/MEK inhibitors if mutation positive.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: UV protection, sun avoidance, skin surveillance. - Patient education priorities: Importance of skin monitoring, understanding prognosis, addressing fears. - Lifestyle modifications: Protective clothing, SPF use, smoking cessation. - Behavioral interventions: Psychological support, counseling, stress management techniques.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Regular dermatologic examinations every 3-6 months initially, then annually. - Monitoring parameters: Recurrence signs, new skin lesions, regional lymph node status. - Red flag symptoms: New or enlarging lesions, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss), pain, or neurological changes. - Treatment response assessment: Pathology report post-excision, physical exams, imaging if indicated.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, reassurance about treatment effectiveness and prognosis. - Addressing patient concerns: Alleviate anxiety by explaining the anatomy of treatment, support available. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, involve patient in decision-making. - Family involvement: Include family members if desired for support and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncologist, plastic surgeon if extensive excision, possibly medical oncologist for systemic therapy. - Other healthcare team members: Psychologist or counselor for emotional support, nurse navigator. - Community resources: Melanoma support groups, educational websites. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for surgery, follow-up, potential therapies.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with supportive care strategies. The plan involves performing a wide local excision with appropriate margins based on Breslow thickness, and considering sentinel lymph node biopsy if indicated to assess metastasis risk. Postoperative follow-up will include regular dermatologic examinations every 3-6 months initially, with education on skin surveillance and UV protection. Psychological support is also crucial to address her emotional distress. If the melanoma is high stage or has metastasized, systemic therapies such as immunotherapy or targeted agents may be considered after appropriate oncologic evaluation. Initial management focuses on definitive surgical removal and patient education, with long-term monitoring for recurrence or new lesions. Coordination with dermatology, surgical oncology, and mental health services will optimize outcomes, ensuring both physical and emotional needs are addressed.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule excisional biopsy and surgical planning; provide skin surveillance and UV protection counseling. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision; ensure pathology results are reviewed; initiate supportive counseling. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Surveillance for recurrence; consider adjuvant therapy if indicated; ongoing psychological support. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of regular skin exams, sun safety, psychological self-care, and adherence to follow-up.",
