    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the viral conjunctivitis diagnosis and assess its severity. Given the presentation of redness, swelling, and tearing lasting about 2 days after playing soccer, combined with the common appearance of viral conjunctivitis, the diagnosis seems probable. Severity is likely mild to moderate since the symptoms are recent and there is no mention of significant pain, vision changes, or purulent discharge, which would suggest more severe disease. Urgency is routine care, but monitoring for worsening signs is important. Differential diagnoses like bacterial conjunctivitis or allergic conjunctivitis should be considered but are less likely without purulent discharge or known allergen exposure. Treatment should focus on symptomatic relief and patient education, with attention to hygiene and prevention of spread. Pharmacologic intervention is mainly supportive, with referral if symptoms worsen.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive eye care, hygiene education, and symptomatic relief with careful attention to patient comfort and infection control. Initial management focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing spread, while establishing close follow-up for potential worsening or complications. Follow-up care will include monitoring symptom progression with clear instructions for the patient regarding signs of worsening, such as increased pain, vision changes, or becoming systemically unwell. This approach is designed to promote recovery, minimize transmission, and prevent secondary infections while reducing patient anxiety and promoting adherence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on proper hand hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and recommend cool compresses for comfort. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, prevention of transmission, and patient reassurance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery, Reinforcement of hygiene practices to prevent future episodes. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize that viral conjunctivitis is contagious, advise on hygiene measures, symptom management, and the importance of avoiding contact with others until symptoms improve.
