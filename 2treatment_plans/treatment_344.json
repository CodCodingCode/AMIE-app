    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAID therapy (e.g., naproxen 250-500 mg BID) for symptom relief, complemented by topical treatments for skin lesions and lifestyle modifications such as skin care routines, weight management, and stress reduction. Close follow-up within 4-6 weeks is essential to assess response and monitor for side effects. Patient education will focus on disease understanding, medication adherence, and recognizing warning signs that require prompt reevaluation. Additional referrals to rheumatology and dermatology will be scheduled if symptoms progress or persistence. This plan aims to control symptoms, prevent disease progression, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks associated with medication use.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe NSAID therapy, educate the patient about their condition and treatment plan, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization or improvement, monitor for side effects, reinforce skin care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain symptom control, prevent joint damage, and optimize skin disease management.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, skin care, activity modification, and need for follow-up.",
