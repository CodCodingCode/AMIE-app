    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the clinical presentation of recurre\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of focal impaired awareness seizures, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antiepileptic therapy with lamotrigine, titrated gradually to minimize side effects, while providing education on seizure management, safety, and lifestyle modifications. Immediate management focuses on starting medication and arranging close follow-up within 2-4 weeks to assess efficacy and tolerability. Long-term management emphasizes maintaining seizure control, monitoring for side effects, addressing potential underlying autoimmune or paraneoplastic conditions through appropriate referrals, and supporting the patient's overall well-being. Follow-up will include regular neurological evaluations, seizure diaries, and coordination with specialists. This approach aims to reduce seizure frequency, improve quality of life, and address any underlying autoimmune or paraneoplastic factors.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate patient education, order baseline labs (including CBC, liver enzymes), start lamotrigine with proper titration plan, and arrange neurology referral for EEG.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for medication side effects, document seizure frequency, adjust medication as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve seizure remission if possible, evaluate and address underlying autoimmune or paraneoplastic disorders, ensure medication compliance.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, safety tips, importance of follow-up, and recognizing warning signs requiring urgent care.",
