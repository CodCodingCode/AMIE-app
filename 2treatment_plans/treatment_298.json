    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the clinical presentation of epis\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysfunction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating non-pharmacologic measures such as increased fluid and salt intake, compression stockings, and gradual postural adjustments, supported by pharmacologic therapy with fludrocortisone to enhance plasma volume. These interventions aim to reduce symptom frequency and improve orthostatic tolerance. The plan also emphasizes patient education on symptom recognition and lifestyle modifications to prevent falls and injury, with close follow-up within 2-4 weeks to assess response and adjust treatment as needed. Long-term management involves monitoring blood pressure, electrolytes, and symptom control, with coordination of specialist referral if symptoms persist or worsen. This approach is designed to improve quality of life, minimize risks, and facilitate sustainable control of autonomic dysfunction.",
