    "output": "THINKING: Using systematic reasoning, I will first confirm the diagnosis and assess its severity and urgency. Since the symptoms began 2 days ago after playing soccer, conjunctivitis is a plausible diagnosis, likely viral given the context, but bacterial conjunctivitis is also common, especially with purulent discharge. The description of redness, swelling, and tearing suggests an acute presentation. For severity, mild to moderate seems appropriate unless there are significant vision changes or pain, which aren't indicated here. Given recent onset and no signs of vision impairment or ocular pain, this is not an urgent emergency but should be seen promptly. Differential considerations include conjunctivitis of other origins, corneal involvement, or trauma, but the recent activity supports conjunctivitis. In treatment, first-line management generally involves symptomatic relief, with antibiotics if bacterial, or reassurance if viral. Monitoring involves observing symptom progression or improvement, with patient education on hygiene and contact precautions. Overall, the plan should include eye hygiene, symptomatic treatments, and follow-up to ensure resolution.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Acute Conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with supportive measures, cautious use of antibiotics if bacterial etiology is suspected, and patient education to reduce transmission. Initial management focuses on symptomatic treatment and hygiene, while establishing follow-up to monitor resolution and prevent complications. Follow-up care will include assessment of symptom progression with clear instructions for the patient regarding the importance of hygiene and recognizing worsening symptoms. This approach is designed to promote swift recovery, minimize discomfort, and prevent spread, while ensuring safe and effective care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to begin diligent eye hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and discontinue contact sports until symptoms resolve. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, consider starting antibiotic eye drops after evaluation. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution, prevent transmission, and identify any cases requiring further investigation. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution, prevent recurrence, and provide education on eye health and hygiene. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize maintaining eye hygiene, using prescribed medications if indicated, avoiding contact with others, and seeking follow-up if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 7 days.",
