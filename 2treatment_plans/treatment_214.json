    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Viral Upper Respiratory Infection with Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive medical management with patient-centered education and follow-up. The treatment plan includes the use of nasal saline irrigations, analgesics (acetaminophen or NSAIDs), hydration, and humidification to alleviate symptoms. Patient education focuses on the natural history of viral infections, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care. The plan emphasizes symptomatic relief while closely monitoring for signs suggestive of underlying malignancy, such as persistent or worsening symptoms, facial swelling, or neurological changes. Follow-up is scheduled in 1-2 weeks, or sooner if symptoms escalate. Additional ENT evaluation is indicated if symptoms persist beyond this period. Communication will be tailored to the patient's stoic_minimizer style by providing straightforward, reassuring information and emphasizing the importance of follow-up and symptom reporting to ensure effective recovery while minimizing risks.",
