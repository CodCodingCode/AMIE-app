    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Very high; clinical presentation strongly \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor (most likely Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical removal of the tumor through unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which offers definitive cure and symptom resolution. In the interim or if surgery must be delayed, hormonal suppression with GnRH analogs or anti-androgens can be considered to mitigate virilization symptoms. Postoperative monitoring should focus on serum androgen levels, tumor markers, and symptom resolution, with follow-up visits scheduled every 3-6 months initially.\nInitial management emphasizes surgical excision, patient education about the nature of the tumor, and psychological support to address virilization effects. Long-term goals include monitoring for recurrence, assessing preservation of fertility if desired, and managing any residual hormonal imbalance.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange surgical consultation with a gynecologic oncologist; complete preoperative assessments.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Perform surgery; start postoperative monitoring; provide patient education and psychological support.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete tumor resection; monitor hormonal levels; assess recovery and fertility options.\n- Patient handout summary: Explanation of diagnosis and treatment plan, expected outcomes, importance of follow-up, and available support resources.",
