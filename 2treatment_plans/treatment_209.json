    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Heart Failure with Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an ACE inhibitor (e.g., enalapril), optimized diuretic therapy for symptom control, and lifestyle modifications such as salt restriction and weight monitoring. The goals are symptom relief, hemodynamic stabilization, and slowing disease progression while monitoring renal function and electrolytes. Immediate actions include medication adjustments today and scheduling follow-up in 1-2 weeks to assess response. Long-term management involves ongoing medication optimization, symptom tracking, and regular cardiac reevaluation, with specialized cardiology input, particularly regarding cardiac anatomy given his mitral atresia. Patient education emphasizes symptom recognition, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes, tailored to his stoic-minimizer personality. This approach aims to improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and manage the underlying cardiac condition sustainably.",
