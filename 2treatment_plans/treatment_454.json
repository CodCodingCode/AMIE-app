    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision with clear margins, possibly supplemented by inguinal lymph node assessment, depending on staging. Symptom management with analgesics and topical treatments will alleviate discomfort. Emphasis on wound care, hygiene, and smoking cessation will support healing and reduce recurrence risk. The patient will be followed closely with scheduled postoperative evaluations, and she will receive education about signs of recurrence or complications. Coordination with gynecologic oncology and surgical teams is essential for optimal outcomes. This approach aims to achieve local control, accurate staging, and psychological support, ensuring the best possible prognosis while minimizing risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange biopsy review, schedule surgical consultation, and initiate symptom control measures.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Perform definitive surgery, monitor wound healing, and provide patient and family education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Evaluate for recurrence, address any adjuvant therapies if indicated, and support ongoing psychological well-being.\n- Patient handout summary: Clear explanation of diagnosis, treatment options, postoperative care instructions, warning signs, and contact information for urgent concerns.",
