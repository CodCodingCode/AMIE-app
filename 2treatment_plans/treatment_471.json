    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of multidirectional shoulder instability with suspected labral pathology, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes structured physical therapy focusing on shoulder stabilization and scapular mechanics, along with NSAIDs for pain relief. Education to reassure the patient about the condition, along with lifestyle modifications to avoid provocative activities, will support recovery. Close follow-up in 4 weeks is essential to monitor progress, with additional specialist referral considered if no improvement. This approach aims to reduce pain and instability symptoms, restore function, and minimize potential progression of joint pathology, while addressing the patient's anxiety to promote adherence and optimal outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe NSAIDs as appropriate; provide patient education on activity modification; schedule physical therapy evaluation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain reduction; initiate shoulder stabilization exercises; reassess symptom progression.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Improve stability and function, reduce instability sensations, and prevent recurrence.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of adherence to physical therapy, medication use as directed, activity modifications, and follow-up schedule.",
