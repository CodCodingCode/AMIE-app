    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Sinonasal Schwannoma (or Schwannoma involving the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses)\nJustification: The patient's gradual onset of unilateral nasal congestion, fullness, partial anosmia, and recent facial numbness around the cheek and periorbital area suggests a lesion impacting the sensory nerves in the region. The absence of systemic symptoms, skin changes, or signs of infection reduces the likelihood of inflammatory or infectious causes. The lack of palpable extranasal masses but presence of regional nerve symptoms points toward a mass arising within the sinonasal region, potentially originating from the nerve sheath tissues. Imaging in such cases often reveals an expansile, well-circumscribed lesion consistent with a schwannoma. The progression over months and positional worsening could be related to the lesion's growth and effect on adjacent structures.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nSinonasal Schwannoma\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of sinonasal schwannoma, the primary goal is to address the tumor effectively while minimizing patient morbidity. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment for schwannomas, especially when they cause symptoms such as nasal congestion, facial numbness, and sensory deficits. The treatment plan should involve referral to an otolaryngologist or a head and neck surgeon experienced in skull base and sinonasal procedures for definitive surgical removal. Preoperative imaging should be reviewed to determine the tumor's extent and plan an appropriate surgical approach, which may range from endoscopic to open techniques depending on size and invasion. Non-pharmacological management includes advising the patient on sinonasal hygiene and nasal decongestants to relieve symptoms temporarily. Pharmacological options are limited in this context but may include corticosteroids to reduce associated inflammation or swelling if indicated, and pain management if necessary. Since schwannomas are benign, there's no indication for chemotherapy or radiation unless complete excision is not feasible, or there's residual or recurrent tumor. Close follow-up with serial imaging post-operatively will be essential for early detection of recurrence.\n\nANSWER: The patient should be promptly referred to an otolaryngologist or head and neck surgeon for surgical evaluation and management of the sinonasal schwannoma. Prior to surgery, review of detailed imaging (CT or MRI) should be ensured to assess tumor size and involvement. Supportive care includes nasal saline irrigations and, if needed, nasal decongestants to alleviate congestion. Consider short-term corticosteroids if swelling or inflammation exacerbates symptoms, and provide analgesics for any facial discomfort. The patient should be educated about the surgical procedure, potential risks, and the importance of post-operative follow-up with serial imaging to monitor for recurrence. Coordination with a multidisciplinary team may be necessary for optimal management."
