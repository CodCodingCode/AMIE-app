    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt empirical intravenous antibiotics with surgical consultation for possible drainage, supported by close clinical and laboratory monitoring. This includes initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics such as Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, tailored based on culture sensitivities, and ensuring early surgical evaluation. The management prioritizes controlling infection, reducing pain and swelling, and preventing progression to systemic illness. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, warning signs of worsening infection, and activity restrictions. Follow-up will be scheduled within 48-72 hours to evaluate treatment response, with ongoing assessments at 1 week and continued monitoring of symptoms and inflammatory markers. Coordination with orthopedic and infectious disease specialists is essential to optimize care. This plan aims to resolve the infection promptly while minimizing complications and supporting the patient's recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone), arrange urgent surgical consult and imaging.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical stabilization, confirm diagnosis, and implement any necessary drainage or debridement.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete infection resolution, restore limb function, and evaluate for underlying pathology, especially considering suspicions of neoplasm.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points to remember include adherence to medications, activity restrictions, recognizing worsening symptoms, and attending all follow-up appointments.",
