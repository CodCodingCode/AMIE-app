    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation and ima\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of uterine fibroid with abnormal uterine bleeding, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating tranexamic acid during bleeding episodes and NSAIDs for pain control to reduce bleeding quickly. Immediate stabilization with blood transfusion if anemia develops may be necessary. We will monitor her hemoglobin levels, symptom progression, and watch for signs of worsening bleeding or thromboembolic events. Surgical options, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, should be planned once she is stabilized and after further evaluation with imaging and counseling about long-term management. Patient education will focus on recognizing emergency symptoms and understanding treatment options. Follow-up assessments will be scheduled within a week to evaluate response and plan definitive care. This approach aims to stop acute bleeding, improve quality of life, and address underlying pathology with minimal risks, while ensuring long-term management aligned with her preferences and health status.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Assess vital signs, confirm stability, start tranexamic acid and NSAIDs, obtain labs (hemoglobin), and provide pelvic rest.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Control bleeding, monitor hemoglobin, and plan for definitive surgical intervention if indicated.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete definitive treatment, reduce fibroid burden, and prevent recurrent bleeding.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about fibroids, medication use, warning signs, and upcoming follow-up.",
