    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive distal weakness and sensory disturbances in the feet and legs beginning in his early twenties, with a slow, worsening course over decades, strongly suggests a hereditary peripheral nerve disorder. The tingling and numbness, along with shocks or pins and needles, indicate distal sensory involvement. The family history of similar symptoms in relatives further supports a hereditary condition. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a common hereditary neuropathy characterized by distal muscle weakness, atrophy, neurological sensory deficits, and often a benign, slowly progressive course. The age of onset, symptom progression, and family history align with classic CMT presentation.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive distal weakness, sensory deficits, and muscle atrophy, which are gradually worsening over time. As there is no cure for CMT, treatment focuses on managing symptoms, maintaining function, and preventing complications. Non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and regular exercise can help preserve muscle strength, improve mobility, and delay disability. Using orthotic devices like ankle braces can assist with gait stability and prevent falls. Pain management should be individualized; if neuropathic pain is significant, medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin may be considered. Patient education regarding injury prevention, foot care, and the importance of routine monitoring is essential. Pharmacological options are limited and primarily symptomatic. Vitamin supplementation has not proven effective, so current management emphasizes supportive measures and multidisciplinary care.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should involve referral to physical and occupational therapy to promote muscle strength, flexibility, and functional mobility, with emphasis on joint protection and balance training to prevent falls. Use of orthotic devices such as ankle-foot orthoses may improve gait stability. Regular foot care, including skin inspection and appropriate footwear, is important to prevent ulcers or injuries. Pharmacologic management can include neuropathic pain agents like gabapentin or pregabalin if pain is problematic. Patient education about activity pacing, injury prevention, and recognizing signs of worsening symptoms is vital. Additionally, scheduling routine follow-up to monitor disease progression and adapt interventions as needed will be beneficial. While no disease-modifying treatment exists, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary supportive approach can significantly enhance quality of life."
