    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis (Lyme neuroborreliosis), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 14\u201321 days, given its efficacy and CNS penetration, supported by neurologic assessment and symptom monitoring. The focus is on early intervention to prevent long-term neurological deficits, with close follow-up at 1-2 weeks during therapy and again at 4-6 weeks post-treatment to evaluate symptom resolution and detect any adverse effects. Patient education will emphasize the importance of completing therapy, recognizing warning signs, and maintaining hydration and rest. Supportive lifestyle modifications and psychological reassurance are also incorporated to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to reduce neurological sequelae, improve symptoms, and ensure safe, sustainable recovery while minimizing treatment risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange for IV ceftriaxone initiation, conduct baseline neurological exam, and educate the patient about therapy importance.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antibiotic course, monitor for side effects, and reassess symptom progression.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve full or near-full neurological recovery, establish ongoing preventive care, and evaluate for any persistent deficits.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasizes medication adherence, symptom monitoring, importance of follow-up, and lifestyle considerations.",
