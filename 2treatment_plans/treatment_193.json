    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderately certain; traumatic conjunctivitis with subconjunctival hemorrhage following recent injury aligns with clinical presentation. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing, and localized subconjunctival hemorrhage without vision change or severe pain suggest mild to moderate severity. - Urgency level: Routine care; no immediate threat to vision or signs of orbital fracture or globe rupture. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, intraocular injury, or other ocular trauma complications.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care with artificial tears, cold compress, and protection. - Supporting evidence: Conservative management alleviates symptoms and promotes healing in traumatic conjunctivitis. - Patient-specific considerations: Stoic_minimizer may underreport symptoms; ensure clear communication. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical steroids unless prescribed after evaluation; be cautious with NSAIDs if bleeding persists.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears 1-2 drops as needed; artificial lubricants to soothe symptoms. - Rationale for selection: Moistening eye surface reduces irritation; safe and non-invasive. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within a few days; subconjunctival hemorrhage typically resolves in 2-3 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; watch for allergic reactions or worsening symptoms. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines/steroids if inflammation persists after evaluation.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid rubbing eyes, and shield affected eye if necessary. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of benign nature of subconjunctival hemorrhage, importance of protection, and signs of worsening. - Lifestyle modifications: Use protective eyewear during sports; avoid strenuous activity if discomfort persists. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage reporting of new or worsening symptoms; reinforce adherence to protective measures.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1 week to assess healing; sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Resolution of redness, swelling, and tearing; visual acuity; no signs of additional injury. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, increasing swelling, or signs of intraocular injury. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and patient re-assessment at follow-up.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanations emphasizing that the injury is usually benign and self-limited; acknowledge stoicism but encourage open symptom reporting. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure regarding safety and encourage questions; discuss that minimal intervention is often sufficient. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize importance of protective measures and follow-up; provide written instructions. - Family involvement: If applicable, include family in education about eye protection.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen or do not improve in 1-2 weeks, or if signs of complications. - Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff regarding injury management. - Community resources: Provide eye safety and injury prevention materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to affordability for follow-up visits and eye protection equipment.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis with subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive measures such as artificial tears, cold compresses, and eye protection, tailored to the patient's injury. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and preventing further trauma, while long-term management emphasizes monitoring for resolution and potential complications. Follow-up care will include reassessment in 1 week to ensure healing and patient education on warning signs. This approach aims to promote timely recovery, minimize discomfort, and prevent complications, with particular attention to the patient's stoic behavior by ensuring clear communication and encouraging symptom reporting.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about injury, instruct on use of artificial tears, advise on protection, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom improvement, resolution of subconjunctival hemorrhage, and reassurance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full recovery of ocular surface, return to normal activities with protective measures. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of injury, expected course, symptom management, signs of worsening, and safety tips for eye protection.",
