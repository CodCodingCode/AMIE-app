    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Parkinson's Disease with non-motor features possibly indicating early cognitive impairment or mild neurodegenerative changes.\n\nJustification:  \nThe patient reports a two-year history of gradually progressive motor symptoms including twitching and increasingly frequent, less controllable tremors that manifest both at rest and during activity\u2014characteristic of Parkinsonian tremors. The accompanying non-motor symptoms\u2014cognitive fogginess, forgetfulness, mood swings, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances with restless nights, and racing thoughts\u2014are commonly associated with Parkinson's Disease, particularly in its early to moderate stages or with accompanying Lewy body pathology. Additionally, sensory complaints like tingling or numbness and autonomic features such as constipation and orthostatic dizziness could be manifestations of Parkinson's disease's autonomic involvement or comorbid conditions. The presence of postural hypotension (dizziness when standing) supports autonomic dysfunction. Taken together, these features strongly suggest Parkinson's Disease with non-motor and autonomic involvement rather than alternative differential diagnoses like essential tremor or other neurocognitive disorders.\n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes  \n\nANSWER:  \nParkinson's Disease with non-motor and autonomic features END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease with non-motor and autonomic features, the treatment approach should be comprehensive, targeting both motor symptoms and non-motor aspects to improve quality of life. Pharmacological therapy typically involves initiating dopaminergic medications such as levodopa/carbidopa to address motor disturbances, especially as symptoms progress. Non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, sleep issues, and autonomic dysfunction, require adjunctive therapies; for example, antidepressants or anxiolytics for mood and anxiety, sleep hygiene strategies or sleep aids for sleep disturbances, and lifestyle modifications or medications (like laxatives) for autonomic symptoms such as constipation. Non-pharmacological interventions are equally important, including physical therapy and regular exercise to improve motor function and balance, cognitive engagement activities to help with cognitive impairment, and patient education about disease progression and safety measures for fall prevention and orthostatic hypotension management. Regular follow-up should focus on medication titration, side effect management, and monitoring for cognitive decline or psychiatric symptoms. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach involving primary care, neurology, and support services will optimize patient outcomes.\n\nANSWER: Initiate pharmacological treatment with levodopa/carbidopa to address motor symptoms, starting at low doses and titrating as tolerated. Consider adding a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., sertraline) if mood or anxiety symptoms are significant. Recommend non-pharmacological interventions including physical therapy focused on gait and balance exercises, cognitive engagement activities, sleep hygiene education, and dietary adjustments or laxatives for constipation. Educate the patient about orthostatic hypotension management, such as gradual position changes and adequate hydration. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy, side effects, and progression of non-motor symptoms, and coordinate with specialists as needed."
