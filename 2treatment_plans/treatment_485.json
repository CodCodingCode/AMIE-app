    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  \nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the described pigmented, rough skin\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating systemic antifungal therapy with itraconazole 200 mg once daily, alongside patient education on disease nature, treatment duration, and adherence. Immediate management should focus on confirming diagnosis with laboratory studies and addressing ocular involvement urgently through ophthalmology consultation. Long-term management involves monitoring liver function, lesion progression, and systemic symptoms, with follow-up every 2\u20134 weeks.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start itraconazole therapy, schedule ophthalmology assessment, and provide patient education on medication adherence and wound care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe clinical improvement, monitor for side effects, and ensure ocular symptoms stabilize.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve resolution or significant improvement of skin lesions, prevent recurrence, and manage any residual ocular or systemic issues.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points about medication schedule, side effects to watch for, importance of follow-up, and signs requiring urgent care.",
