    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Very high, as clinical presentation and \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis of the hip, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating with non-pharmacological interventions such as weight management, physical therapy, and activity modification, along with the careful use of analgesics like acetaminophen or NSAIDs based on individual risk factors. Pharmacological treatment should be monitored for efficacy and side effects, with reassessment scheduled in 4-6 weeks. Education on disease progression, lifestyle adjustments, and realistic goals will empower the patient. Long-term management may involve referrals for intra-articular injections or surgical consultation if conservative measures are insufficient. Follow-up will focus on symptom relief, functional improvement, and safety. This approach aims to alleviate discomfort, preserve joint function, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks and supporting the patient's active participation in care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Review current medications and renal, hepatic, and GI risk profiles; provide patient education; and initiate conservative measures.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve adequate pain control with medications, optimize physical therapy engagement, and reinforce activity modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain symptom stability, improve function, and reassess need for invasive procedures if conservative measures are insufficient.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the nature of osteoarthritis, importance of weight and activity management, medication safety, and when to seek urgent care.",
