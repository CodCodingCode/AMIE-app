    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to develop a treatment plan for a patient diagnosed with retinal detachment, noting that the initial mention of \"congenital malformations of choroid\" suggests a complex or underlying pathology, but the presentation indicates an acute, potentially sight-threatening condition. Since the symptoms appear recent and severe, urgent intervention is warranted. The standard of care for retinal detachment involves surgical repair, and conservative measures are insufficient in this scenario. Patient education and follow-up are crucial, especially considering communication concerns. Coordination with ophthalmology is essential.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent ophthalmologic surgical intervention to reattach the retina, supported by immediate assessment and stabilization. Initial management focuses on prompt surgical repair to prevent permanent vision loss, while establishing ongoing monitoring and visual rehabilitation. Follow-up care will include close ophthalmologic follow-up to assess anatomic and functional outcomes, with clear instructions for the patient regarding symptom reporting and activity restrictions. This approach is designed to preserve visual function while minimizing risks of re-detachment or complications, ensuring long-term ocular health.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology consultation for surgical evaluation; educate the patient on the urgency of symptom reporting and activity restrictions, including avoiding strenuous activities and head positions that could worsen detachment. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair (e.g., pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, vitrectomy) as determined by surgical assessment; ensure postoperative eye care and identify any signs of complications or re-detachment. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve retinal reattachment confirmed by imaging, optimize visual recovery through rehabilitation, and monitor for secondary complications such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of surgical treatment, postoperative care instructions, activity restrictions, and signs of complications that require immediate medical attention.",
