The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with acetaminophen, adequate hydration, rest, and nasal congestion management, along with patient education on warning signs requiring immediate attention. Given the patient's age and symptoms indicating possible cardiorespiratory involvement, close follow-up in 48-72 hours is essential, with instructions to seek urgent care if worsening dizziness, breathlessness, or fever occurs. This approach aims for symptom resolution within a week, minimizes unnecessary medication use, and ensures safety through active monitoring.",
