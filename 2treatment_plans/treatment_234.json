    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High certainty that this is viral conjunctivitis given typical signs and recent onset post-exposure. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, given the recent onset, redness, tearing, swelling, without vision impairment or significant pain. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no signs of complications or vision-threatening features. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, foreign body, or other ocular infections.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with supportive care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, and good hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Studies support that viral conjunctivitis is self-limited and alleviated with symptomatic care; antibiotics are unnecessary unless bacterial superinfection is suspected. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's active lifestyle (playing soccer) warrants advice on preventing contagion and minimizing activities that could worsen symptoms. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid steroids unless ophthalmologist advises, to prevent prolonged viral shedding or side effects.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (e.g., preservative-free eye drops) as needed, and possibly topical antihistamines if allergic component suspected. - Rationale for selection: They provide symptomatic relief without adverse effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; monitor for worsening redness, pain, or vision changes, which would require urgent evaluation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: If secondary bacterial infection suspected, consider topical antibiotics; however, this is rarely needed initially.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand washing, avoiding touching or rubbing eyes, using clean tissues, and refraining from sharing towels or pillows. - Patient education priorities: Emphasize contagiousness, hygiene measures, and avoiding contact sports until resolution. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, avoiding eye irritants, and limiting activities that can increase conjunctival irritation. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce compliance with hygiene and activity restrictions; consider brief counseling if patient has concerns about social/work impact.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen; sooner if vision changes or significant pain occurs. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, signs of secondary infection, or complications such as vision disturbance. - Red flag symptoms: Increased pain, sudden vision loss, photophobia, or signs of secondary bacterial infection. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and absence of worsening signs within the expected timeframe.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing that viral conjunctivitis is common, self-limited, and manageable with supportive care. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about contagion, expected recovery timeline, and importance of hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Reinforce hygiene measures and activity modifications with simple instructions; provide written handouts if preferred. - Family involvement: If appropriate, educate family members to prevent spread, especially if living together.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology referral if symptoms worsen, vision changes, or no improvement after 1 week. - Other healthcare team members: Not typically necessary; primary care management suffices unless complications arise. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on conjunctivitis and hygiene; advise on sports activity restrictions. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure patient is aware of cost-effective supportive treatments; no costly medications are typically required.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive symptomatic care with patient education and activity modifications. The plan includes the use of preservative-free artificial tears, cold compresses, strict hygiene measures, and activity restrictions such as avoiding contact sports until symptoms resolve. Monitoring will focus on symptom progression, and the patient will be reassessed within 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. Communication will emphasize reassurance, hygiene importance, and safe activity resumption. Follow-up with ophthalmology is indicated if symptoms persist beyond a week or if any red flag features develop. This strategy aims to promote symptom resolution, prevent contagion, and minimize complications.",
