    "output": "THINKING: Using systematic reasoning, I first confirm the primary diagnosis of panic attack, recognizing that it is a common psychiatric emergency characterized by acute episodes of intense fear and physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and difficulty breathing, which match the patient's presentation. The patient\u2019s history suggests that she experienced a sudden onset with no warning, and anxiety appears to be a significant component, possibly exacerbating her symptoms. The severity seems moderate given the physical symptoms but no evidence of life-threatening complications. Urgency is routine outpatient management, but vigilance is necessary if symptoms worsen. Differential diagnoses such as cardiac events, amniotic fluid embolism (noting that the initial context mentions aminotic fluid embolism, which is a mismatch and needs clarification\u2014here, I proceed with panic attack as diagnosis).  Next, evidence-based treatment for panic attacks includes reassurance, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and pharmacotherapy if needed. Non-pharmacologic interventions like psychoeducation and stress management are first-line. Pharmacological options are secondary and should be considered if episodes impair functioning or do not respond to initial behavioral therapy.  Given her baseline and recent surgery, stress reduction and addressing underlying anxiety are important. Monitoring is essential to ensure no escalation or misdiagnosis.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of panic attack, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes psychoeducation about panic attacks, implementation of cognitive-behavioral coping techniques, and consideration of pharmacotherapy if episodes persist or impair functioning, with initial focus on reassurance and stress management. This approach addresses the acute symptoms while establishing long-term coping strategies. Initial management focuses on providing reassurance, educating about managing anxiety, and monitoring symptoms closely. Follow-up care will include scheduled reassessment in 1-2 weeks to evaluate symptom frequency and severity, with instructions for the patient to seek urgent care if physical symptoms suggest cardiac or other medical emergencies.  This plan aims to reduce panic episodes, improve the patient\u2019s overall anxiety, and prevent future episodes through coping strategies and selective medication if needed, with attention to her recent surgery and baseline health.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reassure the patient, educate about panic attacks, and advise stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing exercises. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Establish a therapeutic alliance, implement cognitive-behavioral techniques, and evaluate the need for pharmacotherapy if episodes are frequent or disabling. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve significant reduction in panic episodes, improve coping skills, and monitor for recurrence or underlying anxiety disorders. - Patient handout summary: Educate patient on panic attack symptoms, reassure that this is treatable, introduce relaxation techniques, and promote follow-up for further assessment and management.",
