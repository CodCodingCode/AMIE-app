    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical features of persistent, crusted, bleeding, firm, scar-like lesion with irregular borders and surface changes suggests squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering duration (>3 months), surface ulceration, crusting, bleeding, and induration indicating invasive potential. - Urgency level: Urgent, as SCC can invade locally and has potential for metastasis if untreated. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Desmoplastic melanoma, amelanotic melanoma, keratoacanthoma, hypertrophic actinic keratosis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with clear margins (usually 4-6 mm). - Supporting evidence: Surgery is the definitive treatment, providing histopathological confirmation and complete removal. - Patient-specific considerations: Lesion location (neck), age, potential for cosmetic concern, and comorbidities. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid incomplete excision; consider anesthesia risks in elderly or comorbid patients.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If appropriate, consider adjunctive or alternative treatments. - Primary medication choice: Topical agents like 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod are options for superficial SCC or actinic keratosis but not for invasive SCC. - Rationale for selection: Invasive SCC requires surgical management; topical agents are better suited for less invasive lesions. - Expected timeline for improvement: N/A for surgery; post-op healing varies but generally within 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Surgical site infection, wound healing complications. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Radiation therapy for inoperable cases or when surgery is contraindicated.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions. - Primary non-drug interventions: Sun protection measures, avoidance of UV exposure, regular skin examinations. - Patient education priorities: Importance of early detection, sun safety, wound care, and wound monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Use of broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing, avoiding peak sun hours. - Behavioral interventions: Skin self-examination techniques, referral for psychosocial support if needed.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Establish follow-up and monitoring. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 2 weeks post-surgery for wound evaluation; subsequent visits at 3 and 6 months. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, signs of local recurrence, new lesions. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, or new lesions warrant urgent reassessment. - Treatment response assessment: Complete wound healing and absence of recurrence on follow-up exams.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Communicate clearly considering her baseline patient type. - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language emphasizing the importance of treatment and follow-up. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss fears about surgery, recurrence, and cosmetic outcomes proactively. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, ensure understanding, schedule timely follow-ups. - Family involvement: Encourage involvement if the patient desires support and assistance with wound care or decision-making.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Additional care coordination. - Specialist referrals needed: Dermatologic surgeon or head/neck surgeon for excision; possibly oncology if high risk features are present. - Other healthcare team members: Wound care nurse, primary care provider for ongoing monitoring. - Community resources: Skin cancer support groups, educational handouts. - Insurance/cost considerations: Review coverage for surgical procedures, pathology, and follow-up visits.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision with clear margins to ensure complete removal of the lesion, supported by histopathological confirmation. Post-operative wound care and regular follow-up are essential to monitor healing and detect any recurrence early. The patient should be educated about sun protection, skin self-examination, and signs of recurrence. Adjunctive treatments such as topical agents are not indicated for invasive SCC but may be considered in superficial or in situ cases under specialist guidance. The management emphasizes timely surgical intervention, patient engagement, and coordinated care with specialists to optimize outcomes. Initial actions include scheduling surgery promptly, instructing on wound care and sun safety, and arranging follow-up in 2 weeks with ongoing surveillance. Short-term goals focus on wound healing and patient understanding, while long-term management aims to prevent recurrence through sun protection and regular skin checks. This approach aims to eradicate the lesion, minimize recurrence risk, and maintain the patient's quality of life.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule surgical excision, provide wound care instructions, and reinforce sun protection. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete healing of the surgical site, ensure patient understanding of wound management. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through ongoing skin examinations, reinforce sun safety behaviors. - Patient handout summary: Key points include the nature of SCC, importance of complete removal, wound care steps, sun protection tips, and follow-up schedule.",
