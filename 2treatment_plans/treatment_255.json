    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder with sensory processing disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based behavioral and environmental interventions with ongoing support tailored to the child's sensitivities. The key interventions include sensory integration therapy, environmental modifications (e.g., noise-canceling devices, dim lighting), structured routines, and family education on sensory management techniques. Initial management prioritizes creating a predictable environment and implementing coping strategies. Long-term, consistent therapy and environmental adjustments aim to reduce overstimulation and improve adaptive functioning, with regular follow-up every 4-6 weeks to monitor progress. It is important to involve occupational therapists, developmental specialists, and family members to ensure cohesive support. Engaging the family in education and intervention planning will help sustain improvements and address the child's specific needs. This plan seeks to enhance the child's comfort, participation, and quality of life while minimizing distress and behavioral disruptions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Refer to occupational therapy for sensory integration assessment; educate family about sensory sensitivities and environmental adaptations.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Establish tailored sensory-friendly routines; monitor behavioral responses and emotional well-being; reinforce use of sensory tools.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reduce sensory overload episodes; improve child's participation in daily routines and social settings; support family with ongoing education and resources.\n- Patient handout summary: \u201cUnderstanding and managing sensory sensitivities help you feel more comfortable. Use sensory tools, keep routines predictable, and seek help from therapists. Your family and therapists are here to support you every step.\u201d",
