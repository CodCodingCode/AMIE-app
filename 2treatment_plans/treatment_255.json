    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the recent postpartum status, bilateral breast swelling, firmness, warmth, tenderness, and rapid symptom progression without systemic symptoms. - Severity classification: Moderate. The patient exhibits localized signs of early mastitis with pain and firmness but no systemic illness or skin changes. Still, symptoms are worsening quickly, warranting prompt intervention. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to prevent progression to more severe mastitis or abscess formation. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Engorgement versus mastitis; watch for developing redness, fluctuant areas, or systemic symptoms indicating progression.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Continue breastfeeding, apply warm compresses, and start antibiotics if bacterial mastitis is suspected. - Supporting evidence: Mastitis is often bacterial; early antibiotic therapy with supportive measures reduces symptom duration and complication risk. - Patient-specific considerations: She is breastfeeding and appears otherwise well, favoring preservation of breastfeeding. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if signs are mild; however, given rapid worsening, antibiotics are indicated.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Oral dicloxacillin 500 mg four times daily for 10\u201314 days. Alternatively, cephalexin if allergic to penicillin. - Rationale for selection: Effective against common bacterial pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), safe in breastfeeding. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 48\u201372 hours of antibiotics. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, potential for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Clindamycin if MRSA suspected or penicillin allergy.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent breastfeeding or milk expression, warm compresses before feeds, gentle breast massage. - Patient education priorities: Importance of continued breastfeeding, breast emptying, and signs of worsening infection. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, rest, maintaining good nipple hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Positioning techniques to facilitate drainage, relaxation techniques to reduce stress.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48\u201372 hours to evaluate symptom progression or resolution. - Monitoring parameters: Pain, breast firmness, presence of erythema, systemic symptoms, any new palpable fluctuance. - Red flag symptoms: Development of fluctuance, systemic illness (fever, chills), skin discoloration, or worsening symptoms despite therapy. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement within expected timeline, absence of new or worsening signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language, emphasizing what the patient needs to do and what to expect, checking for understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about breastfeeding safety, explain signs of improvement, and when to seek urgent care. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, encourage questions, and reassure about the importance of completing therapy. - Family involvement: Encourage partner or family support with breastfeeding practices and recognizing warning signs.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Typically not immediate; consider referral to a lactation consultant for breastfeeding guidance. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators, breastfeeding specialists. - Community resources: Lactation support groups, educational materials on breastfeeding and mastitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Prescriptions covered; ensure patient pharmacy access and affordability.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lactational mastitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antibiotics such as dicloxacillin if signs point toward bacterial infection, promoting frequent breastfeeding and milk expression, and applying warm compresses to facilitate milk flow and reduce discomfort. The patient should be advised about proper breastfeeding techniques, hydration, and rest. Follow-up should occur within 48\u201372 hours to assess symptom resolution and detect any worsening signs. Clear communication using simple language and reassurance will help ensure adherence, with encouragement to contact healthcare services immediately if systemic symptoms develop or if there is no improvement. This approach aims to resolve the infection effectively while supporting continued breastfeeding and preventing complications.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on regular breastfeeding, apply warm compresses, and initiate antibiotics if indicated. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, continuation of breastfeeding, and monitoring for any complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Resolution of mastitis episodes, establishment of effective breastfeeding, and education to prevent recurrence. - Patient handout summary: Key points on recognizing symptoms, importance of frequent breastfeeding, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care.",
