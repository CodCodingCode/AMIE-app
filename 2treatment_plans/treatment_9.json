    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with supportive oncology care, tailored to the patient's clinical status. The initial priority is to confirm the diagnosis via imaging and biopsy, then proceed with surgical resection\u2014either partial or radical nephrectomy\u2014based on tumor characteristics. For systemic symptoms or suspected metastasis, referral to an oncologist is essential for consideration of targeted therapy or immunotherapy.\nThe treatment plan includes surgical intervention as the mainstay, complemented by close postoperative monitoring with imaging and labs. Non-pharmacological measures focus on pain control, nutritional support, behavioral health, and patient education about disease process and treatment expectations. Follow-up is scheduled at regular intervals, with vigilant assessment for recurrence or complications and responsive management of side effects.\nImplementation guidance includes immediate steps today\u2014such as arranging confirmatory imaging and surgical consultation\u2014followed by short-term goals like preoperative optimization, and long-term objectives emphasizing ongoing surveillance and supportive care. The plan aims to optimize oncologic outcomes, preserve renal function when possible, and ensure patient understanding and engagement throughout treatment.\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange imaging studies, refer to urology oncology, and prepare the patient for surgical consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical resection, manage perioperative care, and initiate systemic therapy if indicated.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence, adjust systemic treatments, provide rehabilitative support, and reinforce lifestyle modifications.\nPatient handout summary: \u201cYour diagnosis of kidney cancer requires prompt surgical removal, with additional treatments depending on the extent. Follow-up care includes regular scans to check for recurrence, and supportive therapies are available to help manage symptoms and side effects. Your active participation and adherence to follow-up plans are crucial for the best outcomes.\u201d",
