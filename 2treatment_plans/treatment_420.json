    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation of advanced periodontitis with significant tissue destruction, gum swelling, \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of advanced periodontitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initial non-surgical periodontal therapy with scaling and root planing, adjunctive systemic antibiotics (such as amoxicillin and metronidazole), and rigorous oral hygiene reinforcement. Supportive therapies such as antimicrobial mouth rinses and lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation, systemic health management) are integral. The immediate priority is controlling active infection and inflammation to prevent further tissue destruction. Follow-up care will focus on clinical reassessment at 4\u20136 weeks, with ongoing maintenance to sustain periodontal stability. Clear patient education about oral hygiene importance, potential for healing, and early warning signs will be emphasized. Coordination with a periodontist is advised if surgical intervention becomes necessary. This approach is designed to optimize tissue healing, prevent tooth loss, and promote long-term periodontal health, while carefully monitoring for adverse effects and patient adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about his condition, initiate professional cleaning, and consider starting antibiotics if signs of active infection warrant.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve periodontal inflammation control, patient compliance with oral hygiene, and monitor for side effects of medications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize periodontal status, maintain oral hygiene, and schedule regular maintenance visits.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include importance of daily brushing and flossing, regular dental visits, medication adherence, and recognizing symptoms that need prompt attention.",
