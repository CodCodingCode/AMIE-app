The treatment plan includes initiating appropriate chemotherapy\u2014typically combination regimens such as R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone)\u2014to target the malignant lymphoid cells, supported by staging investigations (e.g., PET-CT, bone marrow biopsy) to determine disease extent.

Simultaneously, the patient should receive education on disease implications, treatment expectations, and side effect monitoring.\nInitial management focuses on timely initiation of therapy given the systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy suggestive of active disease. Long-term management will include regular follow-up evaluations with physical examinations, laboratory studies, and imaging to assess response and detect relapse.\nFollow-up care will include monitoring of treatment tolerance, symptom progression, and potential adverse effects, with patient involvement in decision-making.
