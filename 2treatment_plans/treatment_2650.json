    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Parkinson's disease (probable Parkinsonian syndrome)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive gait difficulty with frequent falls, leg heaviness, and wobbliness, especially worsening with activity and standing, along with postural dizziness and leg tingling, aligns with typical Parkinsonian features. The symptom progression over more than a year and the absence of alternative explanations such as systemic illness, neuropathy, or orthopedic issues supports the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The lack of other systemic or neurological signs makes Parkinson's the most probable primary diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nParkinson's disease\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s symptoms are consistent with probable Parkinson\u2019s disease, characterized by progressive gait difficulty, frequent falls, leg heaviness, wobbliness, postural dizziness, and leg tingling. Management of Parkinson\u2019s involves both non-pharmacological strategies to improve quality of life and physical functioning and pharmacological interventions to address motor symptoms. Since this diagnosis is early and the patient\u2019s symptoms are primarily motor with some balance issues, initiating treatment with dopaminergic therapy such as levodopa can be effective in reducing symptoms. Additionally, non-pharmacological measures like physical therapy focusing on gait and balance, falls prevention, regular exercise, and education about the disease process are essential. Careful monitoring for medication side effects and adjusting therapy as needed are also important. These measures are practical, evidence-based, and manageable in a primary care or psychiatric setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with a referral to a neurologist for comprehensive evaluation and initiation of dopaminergic therapy, typically starting with levodopa/carbidopa to improve motor symptoms. In parallel, recommend non-pharmacologic strategies including regular physical therapy focused on gait, balance, and fall prevention, and encourage daily exercise tailored to the patient\u2019s capacity. Educate the patient about disease progression, safety measures to prevent falls, and the importance of adherence to therapy. Monitor for side effects of medication, such as dyskinesias or orthostatic hypotension, and adjust treatment accordingly in cooperation with neurology as needed. Regular follow-up to assess symptom progression and response to therapy should be scheduled to optimize management."
