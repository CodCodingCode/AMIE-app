The treatment plan includes urgent incision and drainage of the abscess, with appropriate wound hygiene and observation. Antibiotics targeting common skin flora, such as MRSA, may be prescribed based on clinical judgment and systemic signs. Initial management focuses on relieving pain, reducing infection, and preventing further spread, while educating the patient and family on wound care and signs of worsening. Follow-up assessments will be scheduled within 48-72 hours to monitor healing and identify any complications early. This approach aims to resolve the current infection effectively, minimize recurrence risk, and promote healing, while addressing the patient's concerns and ensuring adherence through clear communication and family involvement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Perform incision and drainage under local anesthesia, provide wound care instructions, start empiric antibiotics if systemic signs are present, and educate the patient and family.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Ensure wound healing, monitor for signs of recurrence or complication, and manage pain effectively.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through hygiene, possibly consider surgical intervention if recurrent or persistent issues.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of keeping the wound clean and dry, watching for signs of worsening, completing prescribed medications, and following up as scheduled.",
