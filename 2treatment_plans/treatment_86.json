    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on eye symptoms following trauma and characteristic signs. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms are recent and not indicated to be vision-threatening or causing functional impairment. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but patient should be advised to seek urgent attention if vision changes or worsening symptoms occur. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, foreign body in the eye, allergic conjunctivitis, or other trauma-related injuries.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with artificial tears, lubricating ointments, and avoidance of eye irritants. - Supporting evidence: Conservative measures effectively reduce discomfort and promote healing in uncomplicated conjunctivitis. - Patient-specific considerations: Recent trauma might necessitate careful examination; the likelihood of foreign bodies or abrasions must be ruled out before initiating treatments. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical steroids unless prescribed by ophthalmology, as improper use may delay healing or cause ocular pressure issues.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tear drops (preservative-free), used liberally throughout the day; for mild inflammation, optional use of warm compresses. - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive, safe, and effective for symptomatic relief in conjunctivitis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 48-72 hours; if no improvement, reassess. - Key side effects to monitor: None significant with lubricants; monitor for signs of worsening infection or irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamine drops if allergic component suspected; antibiotic eye drops only if bacterial infection confirmed.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid rubbing eyes, protect eyes during activity, and minimize exposure to irritants. - Patient education priorities: Inform on the benign nature of mild conjunctivitis, importance of hygiene to prevent spread, and signs warranting immediate care. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and hydration to support healing; avoid contact lens use until resolved. - Behavioral interventions: Hand hygiene reinforcement, avoiding eye contact with shared items.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual changes, signs of worsening infection. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, vision changes, photophobia, persistent or worsening redness/swelling. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution and absence of signs of secondary infection.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing reassurance and expectations. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that most cases resolve quickly with conservative management, and reassure about safety. - Adherence strategies: Encourage regular use of artificial tears, adherence to hygiene, and prompt follow-up if needed. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family members to reinforce hygiene and care instructions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology evaluation if symptoms persist beyond 72 hours, worsen, or if any atypical features arise. - Other healthcare team members: None immediately, unless complications develop. - Community resources: Patient education materials on eye hygiene and conjunctivitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Prescribe over-the-counter lubricants; consider cost and access for follow-up if necessary.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Traumatic Conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with artificial tears and eye hygiene measures, avoiding topical steroids unless guided by specialists, and vigilant monitoring for signs of complications. Initial management focuses on comfort and prevention of secondary infection while ruling out other ocular trauma. Follow-up is planned within 48-72 hours to assess healing, with instructions to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen significantly. Patient education will emphasize eye hygiene and symptom awareness, aiming for rapid recovery while minimizing potential risks. This approach is designed to ensure effective healing, prevent complications, and optimize patient comfort and safety.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on symptoms to monitor, provide artificial tears, and advise on protective eye habits. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm resolution of symptoms, ensure no signs of infection or injury, and reassess if needed. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through hygiene education; monitor for any residual or recurrent symptoms. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions on eye care, signs of worsening, when to seek urgent care, and follow-up schedule.",
