Recognize that the patient's symptoms are chronic, with sig\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of GERD, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy, implementing lifestyle and dietary modifications, and close follow-up to assess response and adjust as necessary. The focus is on symptom control, healing of esophageal mucosa, and reduction of nocturnal and extraesophageal symptoms, with ongoing evaluation to prevent complications. This approach aims to improve the patient's quality of life while minimizing medication risks and promoting sustainable long-term management of GERD.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole 40 mg once daily before breakfast) for an initial 4-8 weeks; advise the patient to avoid triggers such as spicy, fatty foods, caffeine, and late-night eating; provide dietary and lifestyle counseling.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess symptom response, especially nocturnal episodes and cough; reinforce lifestyle changes; adjust medication if needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained symptom control, prevent esophageal damage, and reduce extraesophageal manifestations; consider further investigations if symptoms persist.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain GERD, medication purpose and side effects, lifestyle modifications, warning signs prompting reevaluation, and importance of adherence.",
