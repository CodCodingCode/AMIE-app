    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan for inhalant-induced psychotic disorder.  \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Hi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating abstinence from inhalants, providing supportive psychoeducation, and considering low-dose antipsychotic medication if symptoms persist. Emphasis should be placed on monitoring symptom resolution, addressing substance use, and engaging behavioral therapy. Initial management focuses on ensuring safety and promoting inhalant cessation, while long-term strategies aim for sustained recovery and relapse prevention. Follow-up care will include regular reassessment of symptoms, side effects, and substance use status with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs and when to seek immediate help. This approach is designed to support symptom resolution, prevent recurrence, and promote overall wellness while minimizing medication side effects and ensuring sustainable management of this condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on inhalant risks, confirm substance cessation, and consider starting low-dose risperidone if hallucinations are distressing.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe for symptom improvement, support abstinence, and address any medication side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve full symptom resolution, maintain abstinence, and implement behavioral health interventions.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include avoiding inhalants, understanding psychosis signs, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care.",
