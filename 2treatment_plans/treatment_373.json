    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Uncertain; initial presentation suggests primary syphilis but the final diagnosis was penile SCC, indicating previous confusion or misclassification. - Severity classification: The current diagnosis (penile SCC) suggests a potentially advanced or localized tumor, which warrants staging. Lymphadenopathy and lesion characteristics indicate at least moderate severity. - Urgency level: Urgent; penile SCC requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent progression or metastasis. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other causes of penile lesions such as infectious ulcers, other neoplasms, or inflammatory conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision (penectomy or local excision depending on stage), possibly combined with lymphadenectomy if lymph nodes are involved. - Supporting evidence: Early surgical intervention offers the best chance of cure for localized SCC; adjuvant therapies considered for advanced disease. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient\u2019s age, comorbidities, extent of tumor invasion, lymph node involvement. - Contraindications or cautions: Bleeding risk, underlying health conditions that impair surgery tolerance.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not typically first-line; management is primarily surgical. However, if metastatic or advanced disease, chemoradiation may be indicated. - Rationale for selection: Surgery remains primary; systemic therapy is reserved for advanced or metastatic cases. - Expected timeline for improvement: Surgical healing over weeks; tumor control requires staging and possible adjunct therapy. - Key side effects to monitor: Surgical site infection, lymphedema, systemic chemotherapy toxicity if used. - Alternative medications: Targeted therapy or immunotherapy may be options in refractory cases but are not standard first-line.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Wound care, infection control. - Patient education priorities: Disease pathology, importance of follow-up, wound care. - Lifestyle modifications: Smoking cessation if applicable, good hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling to address emotional impact, coping strategies.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess every 1-2 weeks post-treatment, then at regular intervals for surveillance. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, lymph node status, signs of recurrence. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, bleeding, rapid swelling, new or worsening systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Physical examination, imaging as needed, pathology review.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, straightforward explanations; validate stoic style but emphasize importance of follow-up. - Addressing patient concerns: Worries about treatment outcomes, side effects, sexual function. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, involve the patient in decisions, provide written materials. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family to support adherence, especially for postoperative care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Urologic oncology surgeon, possibly medical oncology. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for wound care, psychological support if needed. - Community resources: Cancer support groups, educational programs. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for procedures and therapies; discuss cost-effective options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of penile squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical evaluation and intervention\u2014preferably tumor excision or partial/total penectomy depending on tumor stage\u2014with possible lymphadenectomy if lymph nodes are involved. Adjuvant therapies such as radiation or chemotherapy should be considered based on staging and metastasis. Initial management focuses on staging the extent of disease, managing symptoms, and preparing the patient for surgery, while establishing long-term surveillance to detect recurrence. Follow-up care will include scheduled physical exams, imaging as indicated, and patient education about signs of recurrence or complications. This approach aims to achieve oncologic control, preserve function where possible, and involve the patient actively in their care, minimizing risks and supporting recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent urologic oncology consultation for biopsy and staging; initiate wound care and educate the patient on lesion management. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic work-up; plan and perform definitive surgical treatment; monitor wound healing. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure oncologic remission, monitor for recurrence, provide rehabilitation and psychosocial support. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of SCC, treatment options, importance of follow-up, wound and symptom management, contact info for emergencies.",
