    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to create a comprehensive, evidence-based treatment plan for conjunctivitis (or minor ocular trauma such as corneal abrasion). The plan should address immediate management, medication choices, patient education, follow-up, and coordination, considering the patient's baseline behavior and recent injury. I will formulate detailed, practical steps aligned with standard clinical guidelines.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctivitis or minor ocular trauma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt symptom relief, prevention of complications, patient education, and follow-up with considerations for the patient's baseline behavior.  Initial management focuses on establishing accurate diagnosis, symptom control, and eye protection, with long-term strategies aimed at recovery and prevention of recurrence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Perform a thorough eye examination to confirm diagnosis; if corneal abrasion is suspected, consider fluorescein staining and slit-lamp assessment; advise avoiding eye rubbing and protective measures such as eye shields while sleeping; recommend topical artificial tears if irritation persists. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom resolution; prescribe appropriate topical therapy such as antibiotic eye drops if bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected; educate the patient on hygiene to prevent spread if infectious; advise avoidance of contact lenses and irritants. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete healing with no residual visual impairment; prevent recurrent episodes through eye protection and hygiene; evaluate for underlying causes if recurrent. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize adherence to treatment, hygiene practices to prevent contagion, signs of worsening (such as increased pain, vision changes), and when to seek urgent care.
