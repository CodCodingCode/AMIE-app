    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. The primary diagnosis is herpes simplex keratitis, but the patient\u2019s presentation following soccer with redness, swelling, and tearing suggests superficial ocular injury with possible initial conjunctivitis. Since herpes simplex keratitis is the gold standard diagnosis, but not definitively confirmed, I must differentiate between traumatic conjunctivitis and infectious keratitis. Herpes simplex keratitis requires urgent specialist evaluation due to risk of corneal ulceration and vision loss. The severity is likely moderate to severe if there is corneal involvement, but absent classic ulcer signs I can cautiously classify as moderate. Urgency is immediate to urgent because herpes simplex keratitis can rapidly cause complications. Differential considerations include bacterial or viral conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion, and other infectious or inflammatory ocular conditions.  Now I\u2019ll select evidence-based treatments. Herpes simplex keratitis mandates antiviral therapy\u2014typically topical and/or oral antivirals\u2014since antibiotics alone are ineffective. In traumatic conjunctivitis, supportive care is often sufficient, but given the final diagnosis, antiviral therapy is indicated. Patient-specific considerations include playing sports, which warrants protective eye measures. Contraindications include avoiding steroids initially unless prescribed by an ophthalmologist, as they can exacerbate HSV keratitis without proper supervision.  Pharmacologically, topical antiviral agents like trifluridine or ganciclovir gel are first-line, with oral acyclovir as adjunct if severe. Expected timeline: improvement within 1 week, but close monitoring needed to assess response and prevent complications. Side effects include local keratopathy with certain antivirals and systemic side effects with oral antivirals like gastrointestinal upset.  Non-pharmacologically, advise eye rest, protective measures (e.g., sunglasses, avoiding rubbing), and hygiene to prevent secondary infection. Educate about signs of worsening such as increasing pain, vision changes, or perforation\u2014prompt immediate care.  Monitoring involves follow-up within 48-72 hours to evaluate response; further visits depend on clinical course. Key red flags: vision loss, worsening pain, corneal perforation, or new ocular symptoms.  Communication should be clear, empathetic, and informative, considering the patient's baseline. Explain the seriousness of herpetic keratitis, importance of medication adherence, and the need for follow-up. Address concerns about medication effects and activity restrictions post-treatment.  Coordination includes timely referral to ophthalmology, especially for diagnosis confirmation and management guidance. Engage healthcare team members for ongoing support and provide educational materials about HSV keratitis.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical antiviral therapy\u2014such as ganciclovir 0.15% gel applied five times daily or trifluridine 1% drops every 2 hours during waking hours\u2014and considering oral acyclovir 400 mg three times daily for 7-10 days, especially if there is corneal involvement or extensive disease. Supporting evidence indicates that prompt antiviral therapy reduces ulceration risk and promotes healing. Patient-specific factors, such as recent trauma and participation in sports, necessitate emphasizing eye protection and hygiene, avoiding eye rubbing, and monitoring closely for worsening symptoms.  Initial management focuses on prompt antiviral therapy, protective eye measures, and patient education about the disease process. Long-term management involves scheduled ophthalmology follow-up within 48-72 hours, with ongoing assessment of symptom improvement and potential side effects. Patient education should include recognition of worsening signs\u2014such as increased pain, vision changes, or perforation\u2014and the importance of adherence to therapy and follow-up.  Implementation guidance: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate topical antiviral treatment and instruct on eye protection and hygiene; arrange ophthalmology referral. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical improvement; monitor for side effects; adjust treatment if necessary. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, preserve visual acuity, and ensure complete healing with no complications.  Patient handout summary: - Use prescribed antiviral eye drops as directed. - Avoid touching or rubbing the eye. - Protect your eye from injury and sun exposure. - Follow up promptly if symptoms worsen. - Attend all scheduled ophthalmology appointments for ongoing care.  This approach aims to effectively treat herpetic keratitis, minimize risks, and preserve vision through targeted therapy and close monitoring.",
