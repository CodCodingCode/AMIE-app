    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your plan. Step 1 involves confirming the diagnosis and assessing its severity and urgency. This patient's symptoms\u2014rectal bleeding, altered bowel habits w\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasm, likely rectal or sigmoid adenocarcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt diagnostic evaluation with colonoscopy and biopsy, staged imaging to assess disease extent, and expedient referral to a colorectal specialist. Symptomatic management involves advising the patient on dietary and bowel habits, and providing psychological support to address anxiety.\nInitial management focuses on confirming diagnosis through colonoscopy within the next week, ensuring the patient is optimized for the procedure. Supportive measures include counseling to reduce distress and clear communication about the diagnostic process. Long-term management will depend on staging results, which will guide surgical intervention, possible neoadjuvant therapy, and follow-up.\nFollow-up care will include regular assessments post-diagnosis, monitoring for symptoms of obstruction, bleeding, or metastasis, and involvement of multidisciplinary teams for treatment planning. The patient should be educated on recognizing warning signs requiring urgent attention, such as worsening bleeding, severe pain, or signs of obstruction.\nThis approach aims to achieve early diagnosis and staging, initiate appropriate oncologic and surgical treatments, and provide psychological support to improve adherence and reduce anxiety, while minimizing risks associated with delayed care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent colonoscopy, inform the patient about the need for diagnostic tests, and provide supportive counseling.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic workup, initiate staging investigations, and start patient education on symptoms and prognosis.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Coordinate definitive surgical or oncologic treatment based on staging, monitor treatment response, and offer ongoing psychological support.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Your symptoms may be caused by a serious condition called colorectal cancer. We will perform tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment. Managing your symptoms, understanding your condition, and staying engaged with your care team are key to your recovery.\"",
