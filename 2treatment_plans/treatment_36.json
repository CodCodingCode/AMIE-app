    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the clinical presentation and well-differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor as the gold standard. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, due to evident virilization signs affecting quality of life, menstrual irregularity, and hormonal imbalance. - Urgency level: Urgent; requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent progression of virilization and potential tumor-related complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other androgen-secreting tumors, ovarian hyperthecosis, androgen-producing adrenal tumors, idiopathic hirsutism.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision of the tumor (ovarian tumor resection). - Supporting evidence: Complete removal of androgen-secreting neoplasm often results in rapid reversal of virilization signs. - Patient-specific considerations: Young age, desire for fertility preservation, tumor differentiation status. - Contraindications or cautions: May include perioperative risks; hormonal therapy considerations if surgery delayed.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: GnRH analogs (e.g., leuprolide) as neoadjuvant therapy to suppress gonadotropins temporarily if surgery is delayed, or androgen antagonists (e.g., spironolactone 50-100 mg twice daily). - Rationale for selection: These medications help block androgen effects and may reduce virilization symptoms pre-operatively. - Expected timeline for improvement: Signs may partially improve within 1-3 months, but definitive resolution depends on tumor removal. - Key side effects to monitor: Electrolyte disturbances, menstrual irregularities, hormonal side effects. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Finasteride, flutamide (with monitoring), or combined anti-androgen therapy.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Psychological support for body image and emotional impact. - Patient education priorities: Nature of tumor, expected outcomes, importance of follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain balanced diet to support recovery, gentle exercise, stress reduction. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling or support groups for virilization effects.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Postoperative assessments at 2 weeks, then every 3-6 months. - Monitoring parameters: Serum testosterone and DHEA-S levels, menstrual cycle regularity, virilization signs, imaging as indicated. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of symptoms, new pelvic pain, signs of tumor recurrence, or hormonal crises. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical improvement in virilization, hormonal normalization.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing the importance of surgery and monitoring. - Addressing patient concerns: Worries about fertility, surgery risks, hormonal effects. - Adherence strategies: Reassurance, scheduled follow-ups, providing written information. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve support persons for education and compliance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Gynecologic oncologist or surgeon, endocrinologist for hormonal management. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators, mental health support if needed. - Community resources: Support groups for women with hormone-related conditions. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure coverage for surgery, hormonal therapy, and follow-up tests.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of virilizing hyperandrogenism secondary to a well-differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with hormone suppression strategies and supportive care. Immediate management involves scheduling surgical resection of the ovarian tumor to eliminate androgen overproduction. Preoperative counseling and assessment will prepare the patient for surgery, with consideration of hormonal suppression (e.g., GnRH analogs or anti-androgens) as adjuncts if needed to reduce virilization symptoms temporarily. Postoperative follow-up will involve regular hormonal monitoring, assessment of virilization reversal, and management of menstrual irregularities, with ongoing psychological support. This integrated plan aims to relieve symptoms, preserve fertility when possible, and monitor for recurrence, all tailored to the patient's individual context to optimize outcomes and safety.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange surgical consultation, conduct baseline hormonal assessment, and discuss surgical plan and expectations with the patient. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision, monitor surgical recovery, and evaluate hormonal levels for normalization. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm resolution of virilization signs, establish menstrual regularity, and conduct surveillance imaging as indicated. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of the tumor, importance of surgery, hormonal changes expected, need for follow-up, and psychological support resources.",
