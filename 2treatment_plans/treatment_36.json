    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary di\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Hoarding Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tailored for hoarding, motivational interviewing, and pharmacotherapy with sertraline. Initial management focuses on improving insight, safety, and organizational skills while providing emotional support. Pharmacological intervention aims to reduce hoarding severity and comorbid symptoms. Follow-up will include regular reassessment of clutter, safety, insight, and mood, with adjustments to therapy and medication as needed. The plan emphasizes patient-centered communication, safety, gradual change, and coordination with mental health professionals and community resources to facilitate sustainable recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate patient education; discuss safety concerns; consider starting sertraline; provide information about hoarding disorder; schedule initial therapy appointment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Establish rapport, start medication; begin motivational interviewing; set small decluttering tasks; monitor for side effects and safety risks.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reduce clutter levels significantly, improve safety, enhance insight, and develop organizational habits; evaluate need for ongoing therapy or medication adjustments.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding hoarding as a treatable condition; the importance of gradual change; safety considerations; medication basics; and available support resources.",
