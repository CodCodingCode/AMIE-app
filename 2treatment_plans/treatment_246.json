    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease (prolapsed internal hemorrhoids), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes dietary modifications such as increasing fiber intake and hydration, topical therapies to reduce pain and bleeding, and patient education on bowel habits and straining prevention. Pharmacological interventions should focus on topical agents like lidocaine ointment and stool softeners as needed. Non-pharmacological interventions emphasize lifestyle changes and behavioral techniques to prevent worsening. Follow-up should occur in 2-4 weeks to assess symptom improvement and prolapse status, with prompt attention to any signs of complication. Involving a colorectal specialist may be appropriate if symptoms persist or worsen. Clear communication tailored to the patient's confusion-prone style will enhance adherence, and involving family members can support care. This approach aims to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent progression or complications of hemorrhoidal disease.",
