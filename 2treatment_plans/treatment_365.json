    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin), supportive care measures such as hydration and airway management, and close neurological monitoring. The plan emphasizes rapid stabilization and diagnostic clarification, including CSF analysis and imaging as needed. Long-term management involves continued hospitalization until clinical stabilization, followed by outpatient neurological follow-up and rehabilitation if necessary. Patient and family education will focus on understanding the condition, the importance of adherence to therapy, and recognizing signs of deterioration. The overall goal is to minimize neurological damage, prevent complications, and facilitate recovery, while closely monitoring for adverse effects and adjusting therapy based on ongoing evaluation.",
