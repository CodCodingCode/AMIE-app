    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of autoimmune myocarditis with systemic involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) to reduce myocardial inflammation, alongside vigilant cardiac monitoring and arrhythmia management. Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil may be added if steroid tapering is needed or if response is inadequate. Supportive care involves lifestyle modifications, stress management, and patient education on symptom monitoring. Follow-up will focus on clinical assessment, echocardiography, and inflammatory markers, with close attention to potential side effects. Coordination with cardiology and rheumatology specialists is essential to optimize systemic and cardiac management. The goal is to reduce myocardial inflammation, control arrhythmias, prevent progression to heart failure, and address systemic autoimmune features to improve overall prognosis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate corticosteroid therapy after confirming no contraindications, order baseline labs, and schedule cardiology and rheumatology consultations.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess response to steroids, monitor for side effects, adjust medications as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission of cardiac and systemic symptoms, taper steroids cautiously, and stabilize cardiac function.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain importance of medication adherence, symptom monitoring, follow-up appointments, and warning signs requiring urgent evaluation.",
