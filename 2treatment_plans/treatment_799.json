    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; conjunctivitis following minor trauma in a child suggests traumatic conjunctivitis, but infectious causes need to be ruled out.\n- Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate, given the description of redness, swelling, tearing that began 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n- Urgency level: Routine care with close follow-up, as no signs of vision-threatening injury or systemic involvement are mentioned.\n- Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, foreign body, or infectious conjunctivitis.\n\nNext, I select treatments based on current clinical guidelines.\n- First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with soothing measures, prevention of secondary infection, and patient reassurance.\n- Supporting evidence: Traumatic conjunctivitis usually self-limiting; symptomatic relief plus caution to avoid further injury.\n- Patient-specific considerations: Child involved in sports, worried family, recent trauma; minimize discomfort, avoid unnecessary medications.\n- Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical steroids unless severely inflamed or other ocular pathology identified; monitor for worsening symptoms.\n\nPharmacological interventions:\n- Primary medication choice: Artificial tears 1-2 drops frequently to lubricate the eye; consider topical antihistamines if significant allergic component.\n- Rationale for selection: Promotes comfort, reduces irritation, safe in children.\n- Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within a few days; if not, re-evaluate.\n- Key side effects to monitor: None significant with artificial tears, but watch for allergy to drops.\n- Alternative medications if first-line fails: Antibiotic ointments are generally not indicated unless secondary bacterial infection occurs.\n\nNon-pharmacological interventions:\n- Primary non-drug interventions: Keep eye clean, avoid rubbing or further trauma, use eye protection if playing sports.\n- Patient education priorities: Explain that this is a minor injury, symptoms should improve, and signs to watch for.\n- Lifestyle modifications: Rest from contact sports until recovery, maintain eye hygiene.\n- Behavioral interventions: Emphasize gentle handling of eyes and seeking care if symptoms worsen.\n\nMonitoring & follow-up strategy:\n- Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen.\n- Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, absence of worsening redness, swelling, vision changes.\n- Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision loss, increasing redness, photophobia, or signs of orbital cellulitis.\n- Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement with decreased redness and tearing.\n\nPatient communication strategy:\n- Communication approach: Clear, reassuring, and simple explanations tailored to worried family. Emphasize that most cases resolve quickly.\n- Addressing patient concerns: Explain the injury is minor, symptoms are expected to improve, and how to prevent future injuries.\n- Adherence strategies: Encourage use of artificial tears regularly, follow-up visits.\n- Family involvement: Keep family informed, involve them in eye protection measures and monitoring.\n\nCoordination & referrals:\n- Specialist referrals needed: None initially unless worsening symptoms or suspicion of other issues.\n- Other healthcare team members: Could involve ophthalmology if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye safety and injury prevention.\n- Insurance/cost considerations: Use over-the-counter lubricants, avoid unnecessary prescriptions.\nANSWER: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient and family on eye protection and hygiene, prescribe artificial tears, and advise against contact sports. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, normal ocular appearance, and no signs of secondary infection or complication. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reinforce eye safety in sports, prevent future trauma, and ensure complete healing. - Patient handout summary: Clarify that minor eye injuries often heal quickly with proper care, outline warning signs, and stress the importance of follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen.",
