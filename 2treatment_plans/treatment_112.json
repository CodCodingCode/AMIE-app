    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (with confirmation of enteroviral etiology), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric IV antibiotics such as Ceftriaxone, while closely monitoring the child's neurological status and hydration. Once CSF analysis confirms viral etiology, antibiotics can be discontinued. Supportive care with hydration, rest, and comfort measures is essential. Family education will focus on the typically benign course of viral meningitis, warning signs of deterioration, and the importance of follow-up. Short-term follow-up within 24-48 hours will assess symptom progression and laboratory results, with longer-term monitoring aimed at full recovery and early detection of any complications. This approach aims for rapid symptom resolution, minimizes risks associated with unnecessary antibiotics, and ensures supportive care tailored to the child's needs.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate empiric IV antibiotics, obtain CSF and blood cultures, monitor vital signs, and ensure hydration.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm viral etiology, discontinue antibiotics if appropriate, and monitor for symptom resolution.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no neurological deficits; provide education for prevention and reassurance.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain meningitis types, treatment plan, importance of hydration, signs of worsening, and follow-up schedule.",
