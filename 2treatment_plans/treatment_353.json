    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis with secondary tissue necrosis in a patient with type II leprosy reaction, I recommend initiating high-dose corticosteroid therapy with prednisone at 1-2 mg/kg daily, carefully monitoring for side effects and tapering over subsequent weeks. Supportive measures include diligent skin and limb care, infection prevention, and patient education on recognizing worsening symptoms. Close follow-up is essential, initially within 1-2 weeks, to assess clinical response and adjust therapy accordingly. Collaborate with dermatology and leprosy specialists, and involve a multidisciplinary team for wound management and physiotherapy. The goal is to control vasculitis, prevent further tissue loss, and stabilize systemic symptoms, while minimizing therapy-related risks. Patient adherence and prompt reporting of any worsening are critical to successful outcomes.",
