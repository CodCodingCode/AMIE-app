    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)\nJustification: The patient's progressive gait instability, early falls, difficulty controlling movements, and increasingly unsteady gait over several years suggest a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor coordination and balance. The recent speech disturbances and visual symptoms such as double vision and blurring point toward brainstem and white matter involvement. The increased urinary frequency and worsening with fatigue or heat further support an autonomic and degenerative process. PSP is characterized by early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, and axial rigidity, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and progression. The gradual worsening and combination of motor, ocular, and autonomic features strongly favor PSP over other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, especially given the vertical eye movement issues and gait disturbances.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nProgressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances. Currently, there is no cure for PSP, and management is primarily supportive to improve quality of life and manage symptoms. Pharmacological options are limited, but some agents such as levodopa may provide mild benefit in certain motor symptoms, although responses are typically less robust than in Parkinson's disease. Non-pharmacological interventions include physical therapy to address gait instability and falls, occupational therapy for daily living support, speech therapy to assist with dysarthria and swallowing issues, and measures to address autonomic symptoms like urinary frequency. Given the progressive nature, regular monitoring and safety modifications at home to prevent falls are crucial. Psychoeducation for patient and caregivers about disease progression and symptom management should also be provided.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a multidisciplinary supportive approach. Prescribe a trial of low-dose levodopa/carbidopa to assess any potential symptomatic benefit, understanding it may be limited. Refer the patient to physical therapy for gait training, balance exercises, and fall prevention strategies. Arrange speech therapy to address speech difficulties and swallowing concerns. Encourage occupational therapy for assistance with daily activities and safety modifications at home. Monitor autonomic symptoms and consider anticholinergic or other therapies if urinary symptoms become problematic, in consultation with specialists if needed. Educate the patient and caregivers about disease progression and safety precautions, emphasizing fall prevention and regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and adjust supportive care accordingly."
