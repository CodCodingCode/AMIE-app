    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to develop a treatment plan for viral conjunctivitis. Confirm diagnosis certainty, assess severity, and urgency. Given the patient's recent onset, eye symptoms, and typical presentation, viral conjunctivitis is likely. Severity appears mild to moderate based on redness, swelling, tearing, and duration of 2 days. Urgency is routine care unless worsening or affecting vision. Monitor for differential diagnoses like bacterial conjunctivitis or herpetic keratoconjunctivitis.  Select evidence-based treatments, emphasizing symptomatic relief and infection control. First-line treatment includes supportive measures such as artificial tears and good hygiene. Pharmacologic interventions may include antiviral if herpes origin suspected, but otherwise, no specific antivirals are generally indicated. Consider patient concerns given family involvement; ensure education to prevent spread. Follow-up scheduled to assess resolution or progression.  Communication should be clear, reassurance-focused, addressing worries and emphasizing hygiene. Involving family members in education enhances adherence. No immediate specialist referral unless atypical progression.  Implement practical steps today and plan for follow-up within a few days to weeks based on clinical response.  ---\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive measures such as artificial tears for symptomatic relief and strict eye hygiene to prevent spread, with an emphasis on patient education. Topical antibiotics are generally not indicated unless bacterial superinfection is suspected. If herpes simplex virus is suspected (e.g., vesicles, dendritic lesions), antiviral therapy like topical trifluridine or oral acyclovir may be considered, but typically, most cases are self-limited.  Initial management focuses on symptom comfort, preventing transmission, and monitoring for deterioration. The patient should be advised on maintaining hand hygiene, avoiding touching or rubbing the eyes, and not sharing towels or bedding. Follow-up is recommended within 3\u20135 days to ensure improvement or to evaluate for potential secondary bacterial infection.  In terms of patient communication, explain that viral conjunctivitis usually resolves within 1\u20132 weeks, and that symptomatic relief is the main treatment goal. Reassure about the benign nature but emphasize hygiene to prevent transmission, especially given family involvement. Encourage adherence to hygiene practices and provide educational materials.  Additional care coordination involves advising the patient to seek urgent care if they experience vision changes, intense pain, or signs of secondary bacterial infection. No immediate referral to ophthalmology unless symptoms worsen or do not improve within the specified follow-up window.  ---  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on eye hygiene, provide artificial tears, and advise on symptom monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, prevention of transmission, and patient reassurance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no complications, reinforced hygiene habits, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize maintaining eye hygiene, avoiding touching the eyes, handwashing, and monitoring for worsening symptoms or vision changes.",
