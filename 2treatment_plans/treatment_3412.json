    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes several core features consistent with ASD, such as delays in speech and motor development, repetitive interests, sensory sensitivities (to loud noises and bright lights), variable behaviors depending on environmental stimuli, social withdrawal, difficulties with communication, and sensory sensitivities. The observed behavior of becoming upset orisolated when overwhelmed, and the presence of both hyperactivity and withdrawal, align with typical ASD characteristics. The variability in behavior across environments further supports this diagnosis, as children with ASD often have difficulty adapting to changes and sensory overloads.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The child's presentation aligns with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by social communication challenges, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, and developmental delays. Management of ASD is typically multimodal, involving both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological strategies such as behavioral therapy (e.g., applied behavior analysis), speech therapy, and occupational therapy targeting sensory integration are foundational and should be initiated to promote developmental skills, improve communication, and reduce maladaptive behaviors. Given potential hyperactivity or irritability associated with ASD, a cautious trial of medication such as a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine) or an atypical antipsychotic (e.g., risperidone or aripiprazole) may be considered to manage severe behavioral disturbances if these interfere significantly with daily functioning. Pharmacological treatment should be closely monitored for side effects. It is essential to involve specialists as needed but primary care or psychiatry can coordinate initial interventions and monitor progress. Education and environmental modifications aimed at reducing sensory overload and promoting structured routines are also critical components of care.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive management plan that includes referral to early intervention services, specifically to speech-language therapy, occupational therapy focusing on sensory integration, and behavioral therapy such as applied behavior analysis. Educate the family on sensory sensitivities and strategies to minimize environmental triggers. Consider the addition of low-dose pharmacotherapy (e.g., risperidone or aripiprazole) to address severe irritability or hyperactivity if these behaviors are pervasive and impact functioning, with close outpatient monitoring for side effects. Provide family support and education regarding ASD to promote understanding and strategies for home management. Reassess regularly and collaborate with specialists to tailor and adjust interventions as needed."
