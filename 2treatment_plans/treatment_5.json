    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Infantile Epilepsy, specifically a form related to early-onset seizures such as West syndrome or benign infantile seizures.\nJustification: The infant presents with a history of abnormal eye movements and limb jerks persisting for several months, which are suggestive of seizure activity. The recent worsening of feeding, fussiness, and sleepiness may indicate ongoing or escalating seizure activity or another neurologic process. The absence of fever or obvious illness reduces the likelihood of an infectious cause, pointing toward a neurologic etiology. The age (3 months) is typical for certain epilepsy syndromes that manifest early in infancy, particularly those characterized by abnormal movements and developmental concerns. A key step will be to confirm the neurological nature of these movements through clinical description and likely investigations such as EEG.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nInfantile epilepsy (possible West syndrome or benign infantile seizures)END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the suspected diagnosis of infantile epilepsy, possibly West syndrome or benign infantile seizures, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis with an EEG to characterize the seizure activity and determine the specific epilepsy syndrome. Early intervention is important to minimize developmental impact and prevent further seizure escalation. Priorities include initiating appropriate anti-epileptic medication, addressing any contributing factors such as feeding difficulties, and arranging for specialist neurodevelopmental evaluation. Non-pharmacological measures such as ensuring a safe environment to prevent injury during seizures and supporting nutritional intake are also important. Since West syndrome is associated with hypsarrhythmia on EEG, prompt treatment with specific medications is necessary to improve outcomes, but awaiting EEG results, empiric initiation of therapy can be considered in consultation with neurology.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include arranging an urgent outpatient EEG to confirm the diagnosis and classify the seizure type. Pending EEG results, initiate empiric treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or oral corticosteroids if West syndrome (infantile spasms) is suspected, as these are first-line therapies. Additionally, consider starting low-dose practically tolerated antiepileptic medication such as vigabatrin, especially if infantile spasms are confirmed or strongly suspected, given its efficacy in this syndrome. Ensure close monitoring of seizure activity and developmental progress. Provide parental education on seizure safety and establish a follow-up with pediatric neurology. Supportive measures include optimizing feeding, ensuring a safe environment, and addressing sleep issues. If the diagnosis is uncertain or the infant shows worsening symptoms, hospitalization for further evaluation and management may be warranted."
