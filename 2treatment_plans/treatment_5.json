    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of suspected sepsis progressing toward septic shock, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt empiric antimicrobial therapy with aggressive supportive care. The initial management includes administering broad-spectrum IV antibiotics to cover likely pathogens, ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation, and continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters. Supportive measures such as oxygen therapy and vasopressors should be initiated as indicated to maintain hemodynamic stability. Patient education will focus on the urgency of treatment and recognizing worsening symptoms. This plan incorporates close follow-up within 24-48 hours to assess response, with ongoing monitoring of organ function and vital signs, and early involvement of infectious disease specialists. Communication strategies will respect the patient's stoic minimize approach, emphasizing the importance of timely intervention and support. Long-term management will address source control, potential ICU care if needed, and outpatient follow-up to prevent recurrence and address underlying risks. This coordinated approach aims to improve survival, minimize complications, and ensure comprehensive recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics, establish IV access, start fluid resuscitation, monitor vital signs continuously, and prepare for possible ICU transfer.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stability, identify infection source, and complete appropriate antibiotic course.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full recovery from infection, prevent recurrence through ongoing monitoring and education, and manage any sequelae.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize signs of deterioration, importance of medication adherence, hydration, and early follow-up visits.",
