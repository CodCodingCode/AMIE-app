    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bleeding peptic ulcer, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent hemodynamic stabilization, high-dose intravenous PPI therapy, and prompt endoscopic evaluation and management. The plan includes close monitoring of vital signs and blood counts, patient education on recognizing warning signs, lifestyle modifications such as dietary adjustments and smoking cessation, and coordination with gastroenterology specialists. Immediate actions involve stabilizing the patient in the emergency setting, starting IV PPI therapy, and preparing for urgent endoscopy within 24 hours. Short-term goals focus on controlling bleeding, preventing rebleeding, and correcting anemia. Long-term management will address underlying causes, prevent recurrence, and ensure adequate follow-up. This approach aims to stabilize the patient rapidly, minimize complications, and promote healing while engaging the patient effectively in their care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Stabilize with IV fluids, start IV pantoprazole, monitor vitals and ongoing bleeding.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemostasis, establish definitive endoscopic treatment, and evaluate for underlying causes.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, manage risk factors, and conduct follow-up endoscopy as indicated.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, recognizing rebleeding symptoms, lifestyle changes, and follow-up plans.",
