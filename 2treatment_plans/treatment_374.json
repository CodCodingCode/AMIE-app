    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of capillary hemangioma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines careful observation with patient education and selective intervention if indicated. The initial management should be reassurance and close monitoring, emphasizing that many small hemangiomas resolve spontaneously. If the lesion enlarges significantly, causes functional impairment, or develops ulceration or bleeding, consider pharmacological therapy such as oral propranolol, with appropriate safety measures. Additional interventions, including laser therapy or surgical excision, can be considered if conservative measures fail or complication occurs. Follow-up should be scheduled in 4-6 weeks to assess lesion progression, with patient education on recognizing warning signs. This plan aims to minimize unnecessary treatments while ensuring proactive management of potential complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about the lesion, advise avoidance of trauma, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reassess lesion size, symptoms, and ensure no urgent changes.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Observe for spontaneous regression; intervene if lesion becomes problematic.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of monitoring, signs to report, and reassurance regarding natural course.",
