    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes surgical evaluation for resection when appropriate, initiation of standard chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX, and supportive care to address anemia and nutritional deficits. Immediate priorities involve evaluating surgical fitness, managing symptoms, and ensuring adequate nutritional and emotional support. Long-term management will involve regular follow-up with imaging, lab monitoring, and ongoing symptom assessment to evaluate treatment efficacy and detect recurrence. Key education will focus on treatment adherence, symptom recognition, and the importance of follow-up, all delivered with empathetic communication tailored to the patient's stoic demeanor. The multidisciplinary team will coordinate care with surgical, medical, nutritional, and supportive services, facilitating access and minimizing barriers. This approach aims to improve disease control, enhance quality of life, and optimize overall prognosis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Complete staging work-up (imaging, labs), assess surgical fitness, address anemia, and initiate discussions about treatment options.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve surgical assessment, begin systemic therapy if appropriate, and provide nutritional and emotional support.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete initial treatment cycles, monitor for response, manage side effects, and plan for ongoing surveillance.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include importance of treatment adherence, recognizing warning signs, scheduled follow-up appointments, and available support services.",
