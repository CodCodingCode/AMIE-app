    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation: The patient's symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing, starting after playing soccer, and the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis suggest a likely irritant or minor ocular surface injury. Confidence in this diagnosis is high, but I must ensure no signs of corneal abrasion or foreign bodies, which can sometimes be missed. Severity appears mild to moderate, given symptoms are localized and without vision loss or severe pain. Urgency level is routine, pending a careful examination to rule out more serious injuries. Differential considerations include corneal abrasion, foreign body, allergic conjunctivitis, or other ocular trauma complications.  Step 2 - Treatment selection: The primary management of traumatic conjunctivitis involves removing any irritants, protecting the eye, and relieving symptoms. Supportive care is first-line, including artificial tears and eye hygiene. Antibiotic prophylaxis is typically not necessary unless there is evidence of epithelial disruption or risk of secondary infection, but cautious monitoring is warranted. Since the injury is recent, avoiding further trauma is critical. Patient education on preventing additional injury is essential.  Step 3 - Pharmacological interventions: Topical lubricants (artificial tears) are safe and effective to soothe the ocular surface. Antibiotic drops or ointments might be considered if there\u2019s any epithelial compromise, but generally, conservative without antibiotics suffices. No systemic medications are indicated unless complications arise. If no epithelial defect is detected, pharmacologic treatment is limited to supportive care. Side effects include allergic reactions to drops; monitor for worsening symptoms.  Step 4 - Non-pharmacological interventions: Rest and protection of the eye, avoidance of contact sports until healing, and maintaining eye hygiene are key. Patient education on avoiding eye rubbing, and signs of worsening, is vital. Encourage careful eye protection in the future. Stress the importance of follow-up if symptoms worsen.  Step 5 - Monitoring & follow-up: Re-evaluate in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. Watch for increasing pain, vision changes, or signs of corneal injury. Improvement should be seen within several days if uncomplicated. Educate on red-flag symptoms such as vision loss, intense pain, or signs of infection requiring immediate care.  Step 6 - Communication: Given the baseline for autism spectrum disorder, communicate clearly, simply, and perhaps with visual aids if needed. Reassure the patient about the common nature of injury and importance of follow-up. Involvement of family or caregivers can facilitate adherence. Be mindful of communication preferences to reduce anxiety.  Step 7 - Coordination: No immediate referral to ophthalmology unless symptoms worsen or there is suspicion of corneal injury. Follow-up with primary care in 1-2 days. Provide educational materials on eye injury care. Consider involving eye care specialists if symptoms persist or complications develop.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or ocular surface irritation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes the use of preservative-free artificial tears to soothe the ocular surface, along with protective measures such as eye rest and avoidance of contact sports until healed. Supportive care is the primary intervention, with careful monitoring for any signs of epithelial damage or complications. Patient education is crucial to prevent further injury and recognize warning signs that necessitate prompt medical attention. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and minimizing infection risk, while establishing close follow-up within 24-48 hours to assess healing progress. Follow-up care will include checking for symptom improvement and educating the patient about outcomes and warning signs. This approach aims to promote healing, prevent complications, and ensure safe return to normal activities, while minimizing risks associated with unnecessary medication use.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Perform a thorough eye examination to confirm injury extent, remove any visible debris, initiate artificial tears, and advise rest and protection. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, healing of ocular surface, and return to normal activity with protective measures. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, reinforce eye safety, and monitor for any late complications. - Patient handout summary: Use visual aids if possible to explain eye injury care, emphasize hygiene, signs of worsening, and importance of follow-up.
