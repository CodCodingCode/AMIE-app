The initial management includes intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline, with consideration for adding metronidazole based on clinical findings, to effectively cover common pathogens. Close monitoring of symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory indicators will guide the assessment of response, with follow-up within 48-72 hours. Patient education will emphasize adherence to medication, abstinence from sexual activity during treatment, and recognition of warning signs requiring urgent medical attention. Additional care involves gynecology referral if no improvement or complications arise, and coordination with nursing and community resources to support ongoing care. This plan aims to promptly control the infection, prevent complications, and promote long-term reproductive health.",
