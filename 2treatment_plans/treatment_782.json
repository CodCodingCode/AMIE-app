    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation and history suggesting contact lens-related infectious keratitis. - Severity classification: Moderate to potentially severe, considering several days of symptoms, the possibility of infection progressing without prompt treatment, and risk factors like overnight lens wear. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed; corneal infections can rapidly worsen, risking perforation or vision loss. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Sterile contact lens keratitis versus infectious; corneal abscess formation.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Empirical ophthalmic antibiotic therapy targeting likely pathogens; consider topical fluoroquinolones. - Supporting evidence: Fluoroquinolones have broad coverage, excellent penetration, and are recommended as initial empiric therapy for contact lens-related bacterial keratitis. - Patient-specific considerations: Contact lens wear, potential non-compliance, uncertain history; risks of delaying treatment. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid corticosteroids initially until infection is controlled to prevent worsening.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, one to two drops every hour while awake. - Rationale for selection: Broad-spectrum activity against common pathogens, good ocular penetration, and favorable safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some symptomatic relief within 48-72 hours; signs of healing or worsening should be monitored. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions, corneal toxicity, patient compliance with frequent dosing. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider fortified antibiotics or adding topical aminoglycosides if no improvement.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Advise discontinuation of contact lens use immediately until infection resolves. - Patient education priorities: Importance of strict hygiene, avoiding overnight wear, and adherence to medication regimen. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain hand hygiene, avoid water contact with the eye, and replace lens solution regularly. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce proper contact lens care and schedule follow-up for supervision.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate within 24-48 hours to assess response. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, corneal appearance, signs of perforation. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening pain, vision loss, increasing redness, or signs of perforation require urgent reassessment. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction of pain/swelling, resolution of epithelial defect, and normalization of ocular examination findings.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (chronology_confused), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear explanations with visual aids if possible; repeat key points to ensure understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize the importance of prompt treatment to preserve vision, and clarify misconceptions about medication and hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, set reminders for dosing, and involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: If feasible, involve a family member for support with medication adherence and follow-up.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Refer to an ophthalmologist promptly for expert evaluation and possible admission if deterioration occurs. - Other healthcare team members: Coordinate with primary care for ongoing management and follow-up. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on contact lens hygiene and keratitis prevention. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs, insurance coverage, and assist with access to necessary treatments.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of contact lens-associated infectious keratitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intensive topical fluoroquinolone therapy (e.g., moxifloxacin 0.5% every hour while awake), immediate discontinuation of contact lens wear, and detailed patient education on hygiene and risk factors. Close follow-up within 24-48 hours is critical to assess response, with escalation of care if no improvement or worsening occurs. The plan emphasizes clear communication tailored to the patient's potential confusion, involving family support as needed, and engaging ophthalmology specialists urgently if the condition deteriorates. This approach aims to preserve vision, prevent complications, and promote adherence through practical education and ongoing monitoring.",
