    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postoperative mediastinitis or pericarditis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam, administering NSAIDs like high-dose aspirin for inflammation, and obtaining diagnostic imaging and cultures to confirm the diagnosis. Supportive care involves rest, adequate hydration, and close symptom monitoring. Early engagement with cardiology and infectious disease specialists is vital for tailored management. Ensuring thorough patient education on symptom recognition and adherence is essential, especially considering the patient's stoic personality. Follow-up will focus on clinical reassessment within 48-72 hours, laboratory monitoring, and symptom evaluation, aiming for resolution of pain and fever. This systematic, vigilant approach aims to prevent progression to severe complications while promoting optimal recovery and minimizing risks.",
