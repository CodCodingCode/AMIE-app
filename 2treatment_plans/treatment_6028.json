    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of a 6-month history of increasing neck pain with episodic numbness and tingling in the hands that worsens with neck movement suggests a cervical spinal cord or nerve root involvement. The symptom pattern\u2014exacerbation by neck movements, especially after sports or lifting\u2014indicates mechanical cervical spine pathology. The recent increase in stumbling and feeling \"off\" supports a possible cervical cord compression. The absence of weakness, difficulty swallowing, or bowel/bladder issues reduces the likelihood of advanced myelopathy, but early or mild cord compression remains plausible. The lack of recent trauma points toward degenerative changes as a primary cause. These findings are characteristic of cervical spondylosis causing neural impingement, consistent with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.\n \nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCervical Spondylotic Myelopathy END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) with symptoms of neck pain, episodic paresthesias, and recent gait instability, the primary goals are to prevent progression and manage symptoms. Non-pharmacologic approaches such as activity modification, physical therapy focusing on cervical stabilization and posture, and avoiding activities that exacerbate symptoms are essential. Early mobility and maintaining cervical range of motion can help prevent stiffness and muscle deconditioning. Pharmacologically, pain management with NSAIDs can help reduce neck pain and inflammation. If the patient experiences significant discomfort or nerve-related symptoms, a short course of muscle relaxants or neuropathic pain agents like gabapentin might be considered, but these should be individualized. Close monitoring of neurological status is important to detect any progression, and early referral to a specialist (neuromuscular or spine surgeon) should be arranged if symptoms worsen or neurological deficits develop.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating conservative management with activity modification to avoid neck positions that worsen symptoms, and engaging the patient in cervical physiotherapy focusing on posture correction and gentle neck stabilization exercises. NSAIDs can be used for pain relief as needed. If pain persists or nerve symptoms intensify, consider adding neuropathic agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin. The patient should be instructed to monitor for new or worsening neurological signs, including weakness, gait disturbance, bowel or bladder changes, and to seek urgent evaluation if these occur. An early consultation with a spine specialist or neurologist is recommended to assess the need for further imaging and potential surgical intervention if symptoms progress."
