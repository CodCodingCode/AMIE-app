The treatment plan includes surgical excision with appropriate margins performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, complemented by NSAID therapy for pain control. Initial management focuses on scheduling definitive surgery promptly while providing detailed education about the condition and postoperative expectations. Long-term management involves regular clinical and radiographic follow-up to monitor for recurrence over at least 2-5 years, given the potential for late recurrences. Patient education emphasizes the importance of follow-up and oral hygiene. The plan aims to achieve complete tumor removal, preserve function and aesthetics, and minimize recurrence risks, while addressing potential side effects and ensuring patient understanding and cooperation.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange referral to maxillofacial surgery, provide pain management, and educate the patient about the condition.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Schedule surgical intervention, ensure preoperative assessment, and reinforce postoperative care instructions.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgery, assess wound healing, and establish a follow-up schedule with periodic imaging.\n- Patient handout summary: Include information about the nature of ameloblastoma, surgical plan, importance of follow-up, and symptoms warranting urgent re-evaluation.",
