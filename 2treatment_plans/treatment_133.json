    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the patient\u2019s history of a perceived large black iris lesion, visual disturbances, and progressive worsening, the suspicion of iris melanoma is high but requires definitive confirmation through ophthalmologic examination and potentially anterior segment imaging (e.g., slit-lamp exam, ultrasound biomicroscopy). Confidence in the diagnosis is moderate until biopsy or confirmatory imaging confirms. - Severity classification: If confirmed, iris melanoma can range from localized to more invasive. The current report of worsening visual symptoms suggests at least moderate severity. Urgency depends on signs of growth, intraocular invasion, or systemic spread. - Urgency level: Urgent ophthalmologic referral is needed for prompt diagnosis and staging due to recent symptom progression and risk of vision loss. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Coloboma, benign nevi, or other pigmented iris lesions; intraocular foreign body; secondary pigmented lesions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision (for small, localized iris melanoma), plaque brachytherapy, or enucleation if advanced. - Supporting evidence: Early intervention reduces risk of local invasion and metastasis. For small, localized lesions, conservative surgery or radiotherapy offers high control with eye preservation. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient\u2019s age, lesion size, location, visual function, and psychological distress must influence choice. - Contraindications or cautions: Caution with radiation if lesion is small and accessible; avoid unnecessary enucleation unless advanced disease.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If applicable, medications might include ocular treatments, but primarily, definitive local therapy is procedural. Adjunctive corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory agents may be used post-operatively. - Primary medication choice: Post-operative corticosteroid eye drops (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1%) four times daily after surgery or radiotherapy. - Rationale for selection: Reduces inflammation and promotes healing. - Expected timeline for improvement: Initial reduction in inflammation within a week. - Key side effects to monitor: Elevated intraocular pressure, steroid-induced glaucoma. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drops if steroids contraindicated.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Encourage regular eye check-ups, avoid ocular trauma, and manage systemic health. - Patient education priorities: Importance of timely treatment, understanding the nature of melanoma, potential for eye preservation versus risks. - Lifestyle modifications: Protect the eye from injury, avoid smoking (if relevant, as it can influence healing). - Behavioral interventions: Stress management and counseling to address emotional distress; referral to support groups if desired.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate within 1 month post-treatment; quarterly during the first year, then semiannually. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, lesion size via slit-lamp exam, ultrasound imaging for growth. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden pain, new floaters, ongoing decrease in vision, signs of metastasis. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical examination and imaging to confirm lesion stability or regression.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear visuals and analogies; break down information into manageable segments; be patient and allow time for questions. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that early treatment offers good prognosis and eye preservation; acknowledge emotional distress and provide supportive counseling. - Adherence strategies: Provide written summaries; involve family if appropriate; schedule regular follow-ups. - Family involvement: Encourage discussion with family members to support understanding and adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Immediate referral to ocular oncology or orbital surgeon for confirmation and treatment planning. - Other healthcare team members: Coordinate with ophthalmic nurses, possibly mental health support for anxiety. - Community resources: Provide educational materials from ocular melanoma foundations or support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for procedures, imaging, and follow-up visits to ensure affordability.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of iris melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with confirmatory imaging and biopsy as indicated, followed by tailored intervention such as surgical excision or radiotherapy aimed at local tumor control and eye preservation. Post-treatment, the patient will receive anti-inflammatory eye drops to promote healing, with close monitoring of intraocular pressure and lesion status. Emphasis will be placed on patient education about the condition, treatment rationale, and follow-up importance; psychological support should be offered to address emotional distress. The follow-up schedule will initially be set at 1 month post-intervention, then regularly to detect early signs of recurrence or metastasis. Clear communication, involving family support, and coordination with specialists are essential to optimize outcomes and ensure the patient\u2019s understanding and adherence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology consult, obtain detailed ocular imaging, and discuss initial assessment. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete definitive diagnosis, initiate local therapy, and manage inflammation. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve tumor control, maintain visual function, and monitor for recurrence or metastasis. - Patient handout summary: Encourage adherence to follow-up, explain the importance of monitoring, and provide reassurance about treatment efficacy.",
