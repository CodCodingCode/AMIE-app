    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt, evidence-based antibiotic therapy with supportive care and close monitoring. The initial management includes administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as clindamycin and gentamicin, to target common postpartum pathogens. Adequate hydration, rest, and patient education on medication adherence and symptom monitoring are essential. Follow-up should occur within 48-72 hours to assess clinical response, with ongoing evaluation for potential complications. If no improvement or worsening occurs, specialist consultation will be necessary. This plan aims to resolve the infection effectively, prevent progression to sepsis, and support the patient's postpartum recovery while minimizing medication side effects and ensuring patient understanding and adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics, monitor vital signs, ensure hydration, and educate the patient about warning signs needing urgent care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution, confirm infection clearance through clinical assessment, and support postpartum recovery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery without sequelae, assess for any residual complications, and provide ongoing postpartum support.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain diagnosis, treatment plan, importance of adherence, expected recovery timeline, and when to seek immediate care.",
