    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Somatic symptom disorder with predominantly sensory symptoms, possibly with an underlying anxiety component\nJustification: The patient reports sensations described as weird, shaky, and tingling in his legs that are non-painful, fluctuate with stress and emotional states, and are temporarily relieved by distraction. The absence of objective neurological deficits, along with symptoms exacerbated by stress and emotional triggers, suggest a psychosomatic origin rather than an organic neurological or muscular pathology. The sensation of feeling \"off\" or \"weird\" in his head, and balance issues without other neurological symptoms, further support a functional or somatic symptom disorder linked to psychological factors rather than an underlying neurological disease.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nSomatic symptom disorder with predominantly sensory symptoms END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of fluctuating, non-painful sensory symptoms that are exacerbated by stress, with no objective neurological deficits, aligns with a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder with predominantly sensory manifestations. Considering the possible underlying anxiety component, a combined approach targeting psychological factors and stress management is appropriate. Non-pharmacological interventions such as psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and stress reduction techniques can help address the psychological contributors and improve symptom management. Pharmacological treatment should be reserved for cases where anxiety symptoms are significantly interfering with functioning or when non-pharmacological measures are insufficient. In such cases, low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be beneficial, given their efficacy in treating anxiety and somatic symptom disorders.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with patient education about the nature of somatic symptom disorder, emphasizing the role of stress and emotional factors in symptom exacerbation. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy to help the patient develop coping strategies and challenge health-related anxieties. Incorporate stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, or biofeedback. If symptoms or associated anxiety are significantly impacting functioning or persist despite psychosocial interventions, consider initiating a low-dose SSRI (e.g., escitalopram or sertraline) after discussing potential benefits and side effects. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor symptom progression, treatment adherence, and any side effects, with adjustments made accordingly."
