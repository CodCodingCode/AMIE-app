    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of varicella meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric intravenous acyclovir therapy promptly, adjusting doses based on weight and renal function, alongside supportive measures such as hydration and rest. Close inpatient monitoring of neurological status, renal function, and signs of disease progression is essential. Education for caregivers should focus on medication adherence, monitoring for neurological deterioration, and timely communication of concerns. Follow-up should be planned within 48-72 hours during hospitalization and in outpatient settings within 1-2 weeks, with ongoing assessment of neurological recovery. Engagement with pediatric infectious disease and neurology specialists will facilitate optimal management, ensuring safe and effective resolution of the infection. This approach aims to reduce morbidity, prevent complications, and support full recovery while minimizing risks associated with therapy.",
