    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and determine urgency. Since the presentation with redness, swelling, and tearing began 2 days ago after playing soccer, viral conjunctivitis is a common cause, especially in this context, and is usually mild and self-limited. No signs of sight-threatening complications or significant pain suggest a mild form. The patient\u2019s congenital condition (subpulmonary stenosis) does not directly impact conjunctivitis management but warrants consideration for overall health. Treatment should focus on symptomatic relief and patient education, with reassurance about the benign nature of viral conjunctivitis. Given the patient's information_withholder personality, clear, straightforward communication is essential.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of uncomplicated viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with supportive measures, patient education, and careful follow-up, with attention to the patient's specific context. Immediate management emphasizes reassurance and hygiene practices, while long-term management involves monitoring for symptom resolution. Follow-up care will incorporate symptom assessment and guidance on when to seek further care, with clear instructions on preventing transmission and recognizing signs of complications. This approach aims to promote comfort, prevent spread, and ensure the condition resolves without unnecessary interventions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to practice frequent handwashing, avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and refrain from sharing towels or bedding. Recommend cold compresses to reduce swelling and tearing. Provide reassurance about the self-limiting nature of viral conjunctivitis. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom improvement, ensure no progression or signs of secondary infection. Educate about proper hygiene to prevent contagion. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution of symptoms, no recurrence, and patient understanding of eye health hygiene. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize hygiene practices, symptom monitoring, when to seek urgent care (e.g., vision changes, intense pain, worsening redness), and reassure about the typical self-limited course.",
