    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis with Pulmonary Embolism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate initiation of anticoagulation with LMWH, supplemented by careful assessment of bleeding risk and hemodynamic stability. Long-term management involves transitioning to oral anticoagulation (such as warfarin or a DOAC), with close follow-up for bleeding and clot resolution. Patient education will focus on recognizing symptoms of bleeding or recurrence, lifestyle modifications to reduce risk, and addressing anxiety through reassurance and information. Follow-up visits in the first week and periodically over 3-6 months are essential to monitor treatment response and adherence, adjusting therapy as needed, and coordinating with specialists. This approach aims for optimal clot resolution, prevention of recurrence, and minimized risk of complications, tailored to the patient\u2019s age and anxiety profile.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis via imaging if not yet done; start LMWH; provide patient education and reassurance.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stable anticoagulation, monitor for bleeding, and assess symptom improvement.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete anticoagulation course per guidelines, address residual anxieties, and prevent further thrombotic events.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, signs of bleeding or worsening symptoms, activity recommendations, and follow-up schedule.",
