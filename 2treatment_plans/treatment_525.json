    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate certainty; clinical presentation \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpes simplex meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intravenous acyclovir promptly to target HSV infection, along with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics until bacterial etiology is excluded. Supportive measures such as hydration, head elevation, and neuro-monitoring are essential. Close monitoring of renal function and neurological status will be maintained throughout hospitalization. Clear communication will be used to ensure patient understanding despite their stoic disposition, emphasizing the importance of adherence and follow-up. Follow-up in 48-72 hours during hospitalization and outpatient review within one week will ensure timely assessment of treatment response. This approach aims to resolve the infection, prevent complications, and optimize neurological outcomes while addressing patient-specific factors and potential challenges in adherence.",
