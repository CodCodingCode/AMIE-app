    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach for a 14-year-old male with suspected exercise-induced arrhythmia or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with confirmed polymorphic ventricul\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes activity restriction, further diagnostic testing such as echocardiography and advanced electrophysiological studies, and initiation of pharmacotherapy if indicated. It emphasizes immediate safety measures, ongoing risk stratification, and psychosocial support to both the patient and family.\nInitial management focuses on limiting strenuous physical activity to prevent sudden cardiac events, conducting detailed cardiac imaging, and performing Holter or event monitors to document arrhythmias. Pharmacologic therapy, such as beta-blockers, may be initiated if ventricular arrhythmias persist or if hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is confirmed, aiming to reduce arrhythmia frequency and symptom burden.\nFollow-up care involves regularly scheduled evaluations\u2014every 3 to 6 months initially\u2014to reassess symptoms, medication tolerance, and device needs if indicated. Patient education should cover understanding symptoms, activity restrictions, and emergency response planning, ensuring the patient and family recognize warning signs requiring urgent attention.\nThis approach aims to reduce arrhythmia risk, prevent sudden cardiac death, and support the patient\u2019s safe participation in daily activities and future development.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate patient and family about activity restrictions, arrange urgent outpatient cardiology referral, and order baseline echocardiogram and ECG.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic testing, monitor for ongoing arrhythmias, and initiate beta-blocker therapy if appropriate.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve arrhythmia control, optimize medical therapy, consider ICD placement if high-risk features emerge, and develop a tailored activity plan.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of activity restrictions, explain diagnosis, outline medication purpose and side effects, and stress emergency response steps.",
