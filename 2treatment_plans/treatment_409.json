    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach, confirming the primary diagnosis of infectious pericarditis while considering the possibility of pulmonary embolism due to the presentation of chest pain and dyspnea. The severity appears severe given the acuteness and potential for rapid deterioration, warranting urgent evaluation. Treatment must address the underlying infection, manage symptoms, and prevent complications, with careful monitoring and patient education. Given the ocular symptoms and recent activity, further examination of ocular findings and activity history is essential, but initial focus should remain on stabilizing and diagnosing the cardiopulmonary concern.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious pericarditis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiation of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen 600-800 mg orally every 8 hours to reduce inflammation and pain, along with close hospitalization and cardiology consultation to rule out or treat other serious conditions like pulmonary embolism. Empiric antibiotics may be considered if bacterial origin is suspected, guided by pericardial fluid analysis or clinical suspicion. Supportive care includes monitoring vital signs, oxygen supplementation if hypoxic, and rest.  Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient, confirming diagnosis via echocardiography and laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, ESR, blood cultures), and addressing symptoms while awaiting definitive diagnosis. Long-term management involves treating the underlying infection if identified, potential pericardiocentesis if fluid accumulation causes tamponade, and ongoing cardiology follow-up.  Follow-up care will include repeat echocardiography in 1-2 weeks to assess resolution, symptom monitoring, and assessment for pericarditis recurrence. Patient education will cover the importance of medication adherence, reporting worsening symptoms such as increasing chest pain, shortness of breath, or signs of cardiac tamponade.  This approach aims to reduce inflammation, treat infection, and prevent complications, while adjusting for patient-specific factors like recent activity, ocular symptoms, and overall baseline health.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Admit for cardiopulmonary evaluation, start NSAIDs, initiate oxygen therapy if needed, obtain echocardiogram, and draw laboratory tests including blood cultures. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, start antimicrobial therapy if indicated, monitor for complications, and ensure symptom resolution. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete infection treatment, prevent recurrence, and manage any residual cardiac or ocular issues. - Patient handout summary: \"Your diagnosis is infectious pericarditis. You will receive medications to reduce heart inflammation and fight infection, with close monitoring. Rest and avoid strenuous activity until cleared. Report worsening chest pain, difficulty breathing, or fainting immediately. Follow-up visits are essential to ensure recovery.\"",
