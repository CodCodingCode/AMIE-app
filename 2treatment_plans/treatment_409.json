    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary diag\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Cat Scratch Disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7-14 days to target Bartonella henselae effectively, along with supportive wound care to keep the lesion clean. The patient should be monitored closely within the first week for symptom improvement and potential side effects, with follow-up in 3-7 days. Educate the patient on maintaining hygiene, avoiding further scratches, and recognizing worsening symptoms such as increasing redness, pain, or systemic signs. Emphasize medication adherence and consult a specialist if symptoms do not improve or worsen. Immediate actions today include confirming current temperature, assessing systemic symptoms, and starting the prescribed antibiotics. Short-term goals are symptomatic improvement and lesion resolution, with long-term focus on prevention and pet safety education. A patient handout summarizing disease nature, medication instructions, warning signs, and prevention tips will support adherence and understanding. This structured approach aims to promote recovery, prevent complications, and support overall patient health.",
