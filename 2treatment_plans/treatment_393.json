    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute hepatitis, likely toxic or alcohol-induced, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate abstinence from alcohol and cessation of hepatotoxic OTC medications, supportive care including hydration and nutrition, and close laboratory monitoring. Initiate regular follow-up within 1-2 weeks to assess liver function and clinical status. Patient education will focus on the importance of alcohol abstinence, recognizing warning signs, and lifestyle modifications. For persistent or worsening symptoms, or if laboratory parameters decline, referral to hepatology is essential. This approach aims to promote liver recovery, prevent progression to liver failure, and support long-term abstinence and health.",
