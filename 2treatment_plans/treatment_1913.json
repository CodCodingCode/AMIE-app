    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Common fibular nerve compression, likely at the level of the fibular neck or around the lateral knee.\nJustification: The patient's intermittent episodes of foot weakness, numbness, tingling, and difficulty lifting the foot\u2014particularly when sitting with legs crossed or in pressure-related positions\u2014are characteristic of localized nerve compression affecting the common fibular nerve. The symptoms are relieved by shifting position, suggesting mechanical nerve irritation rather than polyneuropathy or central nervous system pathology. The absence of systemic or back symptoms, stability over time, and no other neurological deficits make extrinsic compression at the lateral aspect of the knee the most probable cause.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCommon fibular nerve compression END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of common fibular nerve compression, likely localized at the fibular neck or lateral knee, suggests a mechanical nerve irritation that is relieved with positional changes. The management should focus on reducing nerve compression and preventing further episodes. Non-pharmacological measures such as physical modifications to avoid sustained pressure or positions that exacerbate symptoms are essential. Physical therapy can help strengthen surrounding muscles and educate the patient on ergonomic habits. If symptoms are significantly bothersome or persistent, short-term use of anti-inflammatory agents may help reduce nerve inflammation. In cases with ongoing discomfort or functional impairment, a corticosteroid injection around the affected nerve might be considered; however, this should typically be coordinated with specialists. Surgical intervention is rarely first-line but could be contemplated if conservative measures fail over an extended period.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan includes advising the patient to avoid prolonged pressure on the lateral knee or crossing legs for extended periods, especially in positions that exacerbate symptoms. Implementing knee padding or cushioning when sitting for prolonged periods can help reduce nerve compression. Encouraging gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the lower limb, particularly targeting the muscles around the fibular region, may alleviate pressure. Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can be used temporarily for symptom relief. If symptoms persist beyond several weeks or significantly impair daily activities, consider referral to a neurologist or orthopedic specialist for further evaluation, which may include nerve conduction studies or consideration of corticosteroid injections for more targeted relief. Regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression is also recommended."
