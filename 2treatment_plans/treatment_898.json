    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the presentation of redness, swelling, soreness following activity, typical of viral conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are localized without significant discharge, vision changes, or signs of secondary bacterial infection. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no signs of danger such as worsening pain, visual impairment, or systemic symptoms. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, orbital cellulitis (rare, but watch for worsening pain, proptosis, fever).  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care including artificial tears and cold compresses. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; symptomatic relief is primary. - Patient-specific considerations: No contraindications to basic supportive therapy; minimal discomfort reported. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless secondary bacterial infection is confirmed; avoid touching or rubbing eyes to prevent secondary infection.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (non-prescription), preservative-free, as needed. - Rationale for selection: To soothe irritation, promote comfort, and maintain eye hygiene. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; watch for worsening symptoms indicating secondary infection or other issues. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Rarely necessary; antibacterial drops if secondary bacterial conjunctivitis develops (e.g., erythromycin ointment).  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand washing, avoid touching eyes, using separate towels, not sharing personal items. - Patient education priorities: Convey that the condition is contagious and hygiene minimizes spread. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, avoid screen time if eye discomfort worsens. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage adherence to hygiene practices.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment in 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, pain severity, visual changes, development of discharge. - Red flag symptoms: Significant pain, decreased vision, proptosis, worsening redness, or systemic symptoms like fever warrant immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or improvement in redness and soreness.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, straightforward explanation of the condition, emphasizing its self-limiting nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about prognosis, discuss contagiousness, and importance of hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Simplify hygiene instructions, set realistic expectations. - Family involvement: Educate family members about transmission prevention.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: None typically for uncomplicated viral conjunctivitis unless abnormal signs appear. - Other healthcare team members: None indicated; support at primary care level adequate. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Use over-the-counter supportive measures first; recommend cost-effective eye care options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care with artificial tears and cold compresses to alleviate discomfort, strict eye hygiene measures to prevent spread, and patient education emphasizing the self-limited and contagious nature of the condition. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and hygiene while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics. Follow-up in 3-5 days will help assess recovery, with instructions to seek urgent care if symptoms worsen or new concerning signs develop. This approach aims to promote healing, prevent secondary infections, and minimize the impact on the patient\u2019s daily activities.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on eye hygiene, recommend artificial tears, advise avoiding eye rubbing, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, prevention of secondary infection and transmission, reassurance and patient understanding. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no complications, reinforced hygiene habits. - Patient handout summary: Importance of hand hygiene, use of supportive measures, signs of worsening, when to seek urgent care, and reassurance about the natural course of viral conjunctivitis.",
