    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of continuous bleeding with large clots, symptoms of hypovolemia, and the history of obstetric complication (obstructed labor with suspected uterine rupture), I am highly confident in postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony or retained tissue, possibly complicated by uterine rupture. - Severity classification: Likely severe, as evidenced by large clot passage, hemodynamic symptoms (dizziness, racing heart, weakness), and ongoing bleeding, indicating significant blood loss. - Urgency level: Immediate care required to stabilize hemodynamics and prevent shock. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Uterine rupture complications, coagulopathies, and other obstetric emergencies.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Active management with uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin), uterine massage, and surgical intervention if necessary. - Supporting evidence: Uterotonics are proven to reduce bleeding by promoting uterine contraction; surgical measures are indicated if bleeding persists despite medication. - Patient-specific considerations: Hemodynamic instability necessitates rapid intervention; clot passage suggests ongoing bleeding that may not respond solely to medications. - Contraindications or cautions: Multiple transfusions or surgical intervention may be complicated if coagulopathies present.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: IV oxytocin (e.g., 40 units in 500 mL isotonic solution infusion), administered promptly. - Rationale for selection: First-line agent with rapid onset for uterine contraction; well-established safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Hemostatic effect within minutes to hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Hypotension, tachycardia, fluid overload. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Misoprostol, carboprost, or ergometrine, with caution given side effect profiles; additionally, consider surgical options if pharmacologic measures are insufficient.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Uterine massage to promote contraction; positioning the patient in a Trendelenburg position to improve perfusion. - Patient education priorities: Inform about the importance of reporting worsening bleeding, dizziness, or fainting. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and adequate hydration; avoid strenuous activity until stabilized. - Behavioral interventions: Relaxation techniques if anxiety persists; psychological support following stabilization.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess every 1-2 hours in acute phase; outpatient follow-up in 1-2 days after stabilization. - Monitoring parameters: Vital signs, estimated blood loss, uterine tone, presence of ongoing bleeding, hemoglobin/hematocrit levels. - Red flag symptoms: Severe dizziness, chest pain, worsening bleeding or signs of shock \u2014 require immediate emergency attention. - Treatment response assessment: Stabilization of vital signs, cessation of bleeding, improved uterine tone.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, direct, empathetic explanation emphasizing the urgency and steps taken. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the effectiveness of treatments and her safety; acknowledge her emotional distress and offer support. - Adherence strategies: Encourage active participation in care; clarify the importance of follow-up and medication compliance. - Family involvement: With patient's permission, include family members in education and planning for support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Obstetric surgeon or gynecologist urgently if surgical intervention required. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for continuous monitoring, anesthesiology if surgical procedures planned. - Community resources: Post-discharge counseling on postpartum care, mental health support if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss with patient and family about potential costs of blood products, surgery, and follow-up care.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage likely due to uterine atony or retained tissue with possible uterine rupture, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate stabilization with targeted interventions. The initial management includes prompt administration of IV oxytocin to promote uterine contraction, uterine massage, and vigilant monitoring of vital signs and bleeding. If bleeding persists or the patient remains hemodynamically unstable, urgent surgical consultation for possible uterine repair or hysterectomy is warranted. Blood transfusions should be arranged to correct hypovolemia, alongside fluids and support measures. Patient education is vital, emphasizing recognition of worsening symptoms, reassurance about the treatment plan, and the importance of follow-up in the postpartum period. Monitoring will continue until stabilization, with reevaluation at regular intervals, and appropriate referrals made as necessary. This plan aims to stabilize the hemorrhage, prevent shock, and address underlying causes efficiently.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV oxytocin infusion, perform uterine massage, establish IV access, begin fluid resuscitation, and arrange blood transfusion. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemostasis, stabilize hemoglobin levels, monitor for complications, and support patient recovery. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure postpartum follow-up, assess for anemia, provide psychological support if needed, and review obstetric history for future planning. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of postpartum hemorrhage, importance of monitoring bleeding, signs of ongoing or worsening bleeding, follow-up schedule, and contact information for emergencies.",
