Step 1 involves confirming diagnosis and assessing severity to\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of venous stasis dermatitis secondary to chronic venous insufficiency, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes implementing compression therapy with appropriately fitted graduated compression stockings to improve venous return and reduce edema, alongside leg elevation whenever possible to decrease venous pressure. Topical corticosteroids may be used for short-term flare management to reduce inflammation, accompanied by skin moisturization to restore barrier function. Patient education should focus on leg elevation techniques, skin care, and adherence to compression therapy, emphasizing the importance of regular follow-up. Long-term management involves monitoring skin integrity, symptom progression, and ensuring compliance with compression wear, with referrals to vascular specialists if symptoms or skin changes worsen or if venous ulcers develop.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on proper leg elevation and skin care, assess fit for compression stockings, and prescribe appropriate compression garments.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve comfortable use of compression stockings, reduce leg swelling and itching, and monitor for any skin irritation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Improve skin condition, prevent skin breakdown, and optimize venous function through ongoing compression therapy and lifestyle modifications.\n- Patient handout summary: Include instructions on daily compression use, skin moisturizing, leg elevation, signs of worsening (such as increased redness, warmth, or ulceration), and when to seek urgent care.",
