    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given overlapping features with Kawasaki disease (fever, conjunctivitis, irritability, mouth and extremity changes). - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe, considering high fever, systemic irritability, and prominent physical signs, which suggest significant involvement requiring prompt intervention. - Urgency level: Urgent; Kawasaki disease can lead to coronary artery aneurysms if not treated promptly, so immediate recognition and treatment are imperative. - Differential considerations: Postcardiotomy syndrome (which is noted as the currently confirmed diagnosis), also other vasculitides or infectious causes such as toxic shock syndrome; careful assessment needed to confirm Kawasaki disease diagnosis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg single infusion plus high-dose aspirin. - Supporting evidence: IVIG significantly reduces coronary artery complications; aspirin's anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects are well-established in Kawasaki disease management. - Patient-specific considerations: Young child, recent surgical history may influence drug safety profile; monitor for contraindications such as allergy to immunoglobulin or aspirin intolerance. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for allergic reactions, renal function (for IVIG), and risk of bleeding (for aspirin).  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: IVIG 2 g/kg, administered as a single infusion over 10-12 hours; high-dose aspirin 80-100 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours. - Rationale for selection: IVIG reduces inflammation and prevents coronary aneurysm formation; aspirin\u2019s anti-inflammatory at high doses and antiplatelet at lower doses post-acute phase. - Expected timeline for improvement: Fever should resolve within 36 hours; clinical signs and irritability should improve over days. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions, aseptic meningitis (rare), renal function for IVIG; gastrointestinal bleeding, Reye syndrome risk for aspirin. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Repeat IVIG or corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) if fever persists after initial treatment.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Supportive care including adequate hydration, comfort measures, and fever management. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, recognition of side effects, and follow-up schedule. - Lifestyle modifications: Not specifically indicated acutely but educate on activity restrictions if any cardiac complications develop later. - Behavioral interventions: Address irritability with comforting strategies; involve child life specialists if needed.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-assess clinically within 1 week after treatment; echocardiogram at 2 and 6 weeks to monitor coronary arteries. - Monitoring parameters: Fever resolution, appearance of rash, conjunctivitis, extremity changes, and cardiac function via echocardiography. - Red flag symptoms: Persistent or recurrent fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, signs of cardiac failure; seek urgent care if present. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical improvement (fever, irritability), normalization of inflammatory markers.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language; repeat information to ensure understanding given patient's age and confused chronology. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the safety and importance of treatment; clarify the reason for urgent intervention. - Adherence strategies: Engage caregiver actively, provide written instructions, and schedule follow-up appointments promptly. - Family involvement: Educate caregivers on recognizing warning signs, importance of medication adherence, and when to seek immediate care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Pediatric cardiologist for ongoing cardiac monitoring; rheumatologist if diagnosis is uncertain or atypical features. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for IVIG administration and monitoring; potentially a child life specialist for emotional support. - Community resources: Educational materials on Kawasaki disease; support groups if available. - Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm coverage for IVIG; discuss financial aspects with family.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes administering IVIG at 2 g/kg as a single infusion alongside high-dose aspirin therapy (80-100 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours). This intervention aims to reduce systemic inflammation and prevent coronary artery complications. Immediate management prioritizes complete symptom assessment and stabilization, while long-term care involves regular echocardiographic monitoring and follow-up with pediatric cardiology. Educating the caregiver about medication adherence, potential side effects, and warning signs ensures active participation in care. Follow-up will include clinical evaluations at one week and echocardiography at 2 and 6 weeks to gauge treatment response and detect cardiac involvement early. This approach is designed to optimize recovery while minimizing risks, with particular attention to the patient\u2019s age, recent surgical history, and systemic symptoms.",
