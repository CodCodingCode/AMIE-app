    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Acute Viral Hepatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care measures such as rest, hydration, and nutritional support, avoiding hepatotoxic substances, and regular monitoring of liver function tests. Immediate actions involve arranging baseline labs, educating the patient on disease course and warning signs, and advising abstinence from alcohol and herbal substances. Short-term goals focus on symptom resolution and normalization of labs over 1-4 weeks, with close follow-up to detect any signs of progression or complications. Long-term objectives aim for complete recovery and prevention of further liver injury, including avoiding hepatotoxic agents and ensuring vaccination if indicated. Follow-up will involve repeated labs, symptom assessment, and possible specialist referral if the patient\u2019s condition changes. The approach is designed to optimize recovery, minimize risks, and support the patient\u2019s understanding and adherence\u2014particularly considering her narrative style\u2014to facilitate a positive outcome.",
