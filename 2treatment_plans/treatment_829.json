    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach based on the given diagnosis and patient context. First, confirm the diagnosis and severity to determine urgency. Solid papillary carcinoma in situ, with ongoing bleeding and a palpable lump, suggests a significant concern for progression or invasive disease, necessitating prompt evaluation. The physical findings, such as a hard lump, swelling, and bleeding, indicate a potentially severe presenting scenario requiring urgent intervention. Based on current guidelines for invasive breast carcinoma, management typically involves surgical excision with consideration of adjuvant therapy depending on staging and receptor status. The patient's age and symptoms influence the treatment plan, and multidisciplinary care involving oncology, surgery, and possibly radiation is essential. Patient-specific factors, including emotional distress, must be addressed through communication and education. Follow-up will be crucial to monitor treatment response and detect recurrence. The plan should include immediate diagnostic steps, surgical referral, perioperative management, and psychosocial support.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt diagnostic confirmation via biopsy, surgical excision (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy depending on tumor size and location), and staging assessments (including imaging for metastasis). Postoperative management may encompass sentinel lymph node biopsy to evaluate regional spread. Adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted agents, should be considered based on tumor receptor status and staging results. Immediate management should focus on coordinating surgical referral and perioperative planning, with attention to managing pain, bleeding, and emotional support. Long-term strategies involve regular oncological follow-up, imaging surveillance, and consideration of radiation therapy if indicated. Patient education will emphasize the importance of treatment adherence, recognizing symptoms of recurrence, and understanding the prognosis. Monitoring will include clinical exams, imaging, and assessment of therapy side effects, with close follow-up scheduled in 3-4 weeks post-treatment initiation. Communication should be empathetic and clear, addressing concerns, setting realistic expectations, and involving the patient actively in decision-making. Multidisciplinary coordination with surgical, medical, and radiation oncology teams is essential, and referrals to psychosocial support services will optimize overall care. This integrated approach aims to achieve optimal disease control, preserve quality of life, and support the patient's emotional well-being.",
