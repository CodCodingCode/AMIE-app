    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Very high; presentation highly consistent \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical intervention with supportive medical management and clear patient communication. Immediate management involves admitting the patient for laparoscopic or open appendectomy, initiating broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (such as piperacillin-tazobactam), and maintaining NPO status with IV fluids to stabilize hydration. Careful monitoring of vital signs, labs, and clinical status is essential to detect any deterioration early. Surgery should be scheduled promptly\u2014ideally within the next few hours\u2014to reduce the risk of perforation and sepsis. Post-operatively, continue antibiotics as indicated, monitor for signs of infection or complications, and ensure adequate pain control and mobilization.\nThis plan emphasizes early intervention, effective infection control, and patient-centered communication, tailored to a stoic-minimizer to ensure understanding and compliance. Follow-up includes close inpatient assessment and outpatient review as needed, with education to recognize warning signs and prevent delayed complications. The aim is to resolve the acute event swiftly, restore health, and prevent recurrence or sequelae in the future.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange emergency surgical consultation, start IV broad-spectrum antibiotics, initiate NPO and IV fluids, and monitor vitals continuously.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgery, manage post-operative recovery, monitor for complications, and provide education on wound care and signs of infection.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete healing, assess for any post-surgical issues, and reinforce preventive measures if applicable.\n- Patient handout summary: Highlight the urgency of surgery, treatment plan, importance of antibiotics, signs to watch for, and follow-up schedule.",
