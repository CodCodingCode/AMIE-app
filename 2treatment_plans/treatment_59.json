    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; clinical features of hyperandrogenism, hyperpigmentation, and possible adrenal involvement su\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Non-Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating low-dose hydrocortisone therapy to suppress excess adrenal androgen production and address hyperpigmentation, alongside thorough hormonal evaluation for confirmation. Initial management focuses on symptom control, hormonal normalization, and menstrual regulation, while ensuring patient education and adherence. Follow-up care will include regular clinical assessments and hormonal monitoring at 4-week intervals initially, then every 3-6 months long-term, with clear instructions for recognizing symptoms that warrant urgent evaluation. This approach aims to improve clinical symptoms, restore menstrual cycles, and prevent long-term complications, while minimizing side effects and empowering the patient through education and support.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange endocrinology consultation for confirmatory testing, educate patient on condition, and prescribe low-dose hydrocortisone.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom response, adjust steroid dose if needed, and reinforce education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve menstrual regularity, normalize androgen levels, and assess medication tolerability.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain CAH, treatment purpose, importance of adherence, possible side effects, and follow-up schedule.",
