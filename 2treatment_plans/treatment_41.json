    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: The confirmed secondary diagnosis is atrio\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of atrioventricular septal defect with critical respiratory compromise, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent stabilization with definitive cardiology evaluation and supportive care. Initial management includes oxygen supplementation, diuretics such as furosemide to reduce pulmonary congestion, and positioning to improve breathing. Close monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular status is essential, with frequent reassessment and early cardiology consultation for surgical planning. Caregivers should be educated on recognizing worsening symptoms, ensuring adequate nutrition, and maintaining a calm environment. Follow-up will focus on symptom resolution, preparation for surgical repair, and ongoing monitoring of weight, feeding, and respiratory function. This multidisciplinary approach aims to improve the infant\u2019s immediate stability and long-term outcome while minimizing risks associated with delayed intervention.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer oxygen as needed, start diuretics under supervision, place infant in semi-upright position, and alert pediatric cardiology for urgent assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize respiratory status, optimize nutrition, complete diagnostic evaluations (echocardiogram), and plan for surgical intervention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete corrective surgery, improve growth and development, and ensure caregiver understanding of ongoing care needs.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Seek emergency care for increased difficulty breathing, cyanosis, or pauses in breathing. Keep follow-up appointments, support feeding and positioning, and trust the team to plan for surgery to repair the heart defect.\"",
