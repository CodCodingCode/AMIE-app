    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the combination of systemic illness,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Infectious Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis (Ebola virus disease), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate supportive care with IV fluids, strict infection control, and consideration of Ebola-specific antivirals or monoclonal antibody therapy. Supportive measures aim to stabilize hemodynamics, manage bleeding, and prevent complications. Patient education will focus on disease severity, need for isolation, and treatment adherence, with constant communication tailored to the patient's confusion. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and bleeding symptoms is essential, along with continuous reassessment. Coordination with infectious disease and critical care specialists is vital for optimal management. This approach aims to improve survival, minimize transmission, and support recovery, while carefully managing potential side effects and addressing the patient's behavioral challenges.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV fluid therapy, establish isolation and PPE protocols, contact infectious disease specialists, and start supportive care measures.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize vital signs, control bleeding, improve gastrointestinal symptoms, and monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete viral clearance, prevent relapse, and support functional recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of hydration, infection control, adherence to supportive care, and reporting worsening symptoms promptly.",
