    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the presentation and recent sexua\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious proctitis, likely gonococcal in origin, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes administering intramuscular ceftriaxone 250 mg in a single dose along with oral azithromycin 1 g to cover possible co-infections. This approach should be complemented by advising abstinence from sexual activity until completion of therapy and resolution of symptoms, as well as thorough patient education on medication adherence, safe sex practices, and partner notification. Follow-up is essential within one week to assess symptom resolution and monitor for side effects, with additional care coordinated with sexual health specialists if needed. This strategy aims to effectively eradicate infection, prevent transmission, and promote patient well-being while minimizing complications and ensuring long-term STI management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis via testing; administer first dose of antibiotics; counsel patient on abstinence.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom relief; ensure partner treatment; reinforce safe sex.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence; routine STI screening; behavioral counseling.\n- Patient handout summary: Include info on medication, transmission prevention, signs of complications, and follow-up plans.",
