    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderately certain based on clinical prese\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious cervical lymphadenitis (likely suppurative), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric antibiotic therapy with penicillin VK, as this is effective against streptococcal infections, along with supportive measures such as warm saline gargles, hydration, and rest. Close monitoring of symptoms within 48-72 hours is essential, with plans for follow-up in one week to ensure resolution. In case of worsening symptoms, development of abscess, or lack of improvement, prompt referral to an ENT specialist is warranted. Education should focus on completing the full course of antibiotics, recognizing signs of complication, and understanding when to seek urgent care. This approach aims for effective resolution of infection while minimizing risks of progression or complications.",
