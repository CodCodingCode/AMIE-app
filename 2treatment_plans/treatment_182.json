    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation with breast skin changes, palpable axillary lymph node, and known invasive ductal carcinoma. - Severity classification: Severe, due to skin involvement (dimpling, thickening), and metastatic lymphadenopathy, indicating locally advanced disease. - Urgency level: Urgent. This requires prompt oncologic intervention to prevent further progression and address skin involvement. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible ulceration, infection, or additional metastatic sites.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Multimodal therapy including neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, surgical resection, and post-operative radiotherapy as indicated. - Supporting evidence: For invasive ductal carcinoma with skin and nodal involvement, combination therapies improve survival and local control. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient\u2019s overall health, age, and performance status should inform treatment tolerability. - Contraindications or cautions: Allergies to chemotherapy agents, comorbidities impacting surgery or radiation tolerability.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: An anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy regimen (e.g., doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by paclitaxel), doses per protocols. - Rationale for selection: These agents are standard first-line for stage III invasive breast cancer and have proven efficacy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Tumor response often begins within 2-3 cycles (~6-9 weeks), with measurable reduction expected by 3 months. - Key side effects to monitor: Cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, neuropathy, alopecia. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Capecitabine, vinorelbine, or targeted therapy if HER2-positive (e.g., trastuzumab).  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Nutritional support, skin care, and physical activity tailored to patient tolerance. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of treatment goals, potential side effects, importance of adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintaining good nutrition, avoiding infection risk, moderate exercise. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, counseling if needed, support groups.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Every 3-4 weeks during chemotherapy, then post-surgery every 3 months for the first 2 years. - Monitoring parameters: Tumor size, skin condition, lymphadenopathy, blood counts, cardiac function. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid worsening of skin changes, new ulcerations, infections, severe side effects. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical exam, imaging (tumor markers, mammography, MRI if indicated), and patient-reported symptom relief.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, factual, empathetic with an opportunity for questions. - Addressing patient concerns: Anxiety about treatment side effects, prognosis, and impact on daily life. - Adherence strategies: Encourage involvement in decision-making, provide written information, and schedule regular follow-up. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family members for support and assistance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Breast surgical oncologist, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist within 1-2 weeks. - Other healthcare team members: Oncology nurses, nutritional support, potential physical therapy. - Community resources: Support groups for breast cancer, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage early, consider patient assistance programs for medication costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of invasive (ductal) breast carcinoma with skin involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline and taxane agents to reduce tumor burden, followed by surgical resection (mastectomy or wide local excision) and post-operative radiotherapy to maximize local control. Supportive care will address skin integrity, nutrition, and symptom management. Close monitoring of tumor response, side effects, and potential complications will guide ongoing management. The plan emphasizes clear communication, patient education, and involvement of multidisciplinary teams, ensuring adherence and addressing concerns. Long-term follow-up will focus on surveillance for recurrence, management of treatment-related side effects, and psychosocial support to promote optimal outcomes and quality of life.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging (mammogram, ultrasound), blood tests, consultation with oncology and surgical teams, and provide patient education. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy, manage side effects, and prepare for definitive surgery. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgery, assess pathology, and proceed with adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic therapy as indicated. - Patient handout summary: Importance of timely treatment, expected process, side effect management, and follow-up schedule.",
