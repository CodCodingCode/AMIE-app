    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute coronary syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines critical hemodynamic management with definitive revascularization and supportive care. The initial management focuses on rapid stabilization with vasopressor and inotropic support, strict fluid and volume status monitoring, and urgent transfer to a cardiac catheterization facility for revascularization (preferably PCI). Concurrently, the patient should be monitored intensively with ongoing assessment of vital signs, perfusion, and organ function.\nThis includes administering vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to sustain blood pressure, considering inotropes (e.g., dobutamine) to improve cardiac output, and providing oxygen therapy as needed. Blood tests, telemetry, and imaging will guide ongoing management. Patient education about the severity, necessity for invasive procedures, and lifestyle modifications will be emphasized.\nFollow-up will be arranged within a week post-stabilization, with closer monitoring during ICU stay. The goal is to restore hemodynamic stability, prevent multi-organ failure, and plan for long-term secondary prevention with medical therapy (antiplatelets, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins). The plan aims to improve survival, prevent complications, and promote recovery while being vigilant for potential adverse events.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate vasopressor/inotropic support, secure ICU transfer, start continuous monitoring, and prepare for urgent coronary intervention.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stability, confirm revascularization, start secondary prevention medications, and monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Optimize cardiac function, reduce risk factors, and commence cardiac rehab.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of treatment, the importance of following medical advice, recognizing warning signs, and attending all follow-up appointments.",
