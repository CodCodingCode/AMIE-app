    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan for lumbar spinal stenosis with radiculopathy. First, confirm the diagnosis confidence, assess severity based on functional impact and symptoms, and determine urgency. Next, select evidence-based first-line treatments such as physical therapy and lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic options like NSAIDs can be considered, balancing benefits and side effects. Non-pharmacological interventions will focus on activity modification, posture, and patient education. Close follow-up is essential to monitor symptom progression and response to therapy. Effective communication tailored to the patient's baseline behavioral style will promote adherence. Coordination with specialists may be necessary if symptoms worsen or do not improve.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis with radiculopathy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a structured physical therapy program focused on core stabilization, flexibility, and gait training, along with education on activity modifications to reduce nerve compression. Pharmacologically, initiating NSAIDs such as naproxen 500 mg twice daily can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, with monitoring for gastrointestinal or renal side effects. Patient education will emphasize ergonomic adjustments, weight management, and techniques to minimize sitting or standing durations that exacerbate symptoms. Lifestyle modifications include maintaining a healthy weight, regular low-impact exercise like walking or swimming, and avoidance of prolonged sitting. Regular follow-up at 4-6 week intervals will assess symptom progression, functional capacity, and medication tolerability. The patient should be advised to immediately seek care if new or worsening neurological deficits, bladder or bowel changes, or increasing weakness occur. Communication will be clear, emphasizing the rationale for each intervention, addressing concerns about medication side effects, and encouraging active participation. Coordination with physical therapists and consideration for referral to a spine specialist is planned if symptoms do not improve or worsen over 6-8 weeks. This approach aims to reduce pain, improve function, and prevent disease progression while minimizing risks.",
