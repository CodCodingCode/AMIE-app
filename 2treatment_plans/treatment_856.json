    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Very low, since the patient has a diagnosed Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, not necrotizing fasciitis. The lesion's presentation (necrotic tissue, blackish tissue, necrosis) can sometimes mimic necrotizing infections but is more typical of mycobacterial or ulcerative processes. - Severity classification: Given the ulcer size (10 cm), necrosis, and rapid enlargement, this appears severe and potentially complicated but not necessarily necrotizing fasciitis. The absence of systemic symptoms suggests moderate severity, but close assessment is required. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to evaluate the extent of tissue damage, rule out superimposed infections, and determine the need for surgical intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Secondary bacterial infection, possible ischemia, or superimposed infections such as necrotizing fasciitis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Continue or escalate antibiotic therapy targeted at Mycobacterium ulcerans, which generally involves a combination of antibiotics such as streptomycin plus rifampicin, and consider surgical debridement if necrosis is extensive. - Supporting evidence: Antibiotic therapy combined with surgical removal is standard for Mycobacterium ulcerans to limit tissue destruction. - Patient-specific considerations: No current systemic symptoms but lesion enlarging, with necrosis; ruling out superimposed bacterial or necrotizing skin infection is critical. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for drug interactions and toxicity, especially aminoglycosides.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Initiate rifampicin (600 mg daily) plus streptomycin (15 mg/kg daily IM) for at least 8 weeks, following WHO guidelines. - Rationale for selection: These are effective for Mycobacterium ulcerans and help prevent lesion progression. - Expected timeline for improvement: Initial signs of healing within 4-6 weeks; complete resolution over several months. - Key side effects to monitor: Hepatotoxicity (rifampicin), ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (streptomycin), and adverse drug reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider clarithromycin-based regimens or surgical intervention if medical therapy is inadequate.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Regular wound care with wound cleaning, proper dressing, and monitoring for secondary bacterial infection. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, wound hygiene, signs of worsening infection, and avoiding trauma. - Lifestyle modifications: Elevate limb to reduce edema; maintain good nutrition to support healing. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce understanding and compliance, possibly involving wound care specialists or community health workers.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess weekly during the initial 2-4 weeks, then biweekly or monthly. - Monitoring parameters: Wound size and appearance, signs of secondary infection, adherence to medications, and side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, spreading redness, fever, or systemic symptoms\u2014prompt immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Photographic documentation of wound progress, clinical examination, and patient-reported symptom changes.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, honest, and empathetic language, explaining the condition and treatment rationale simply. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the treatment duration and potential side effects; address fears about surgery. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize importance of medication compliance, scheduled follow-ups, and wound management. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for medication administration and wound care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Infectious disease specialist and surgical team (for possible debridement or surgical management) within a week. - Other healthcare team members: Wound care nurses, physiotherapists if mobility affected. - Community resources: Access to wound clinics, patient support groups, or educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with medication coverage, ensuring access to necessary antibiotics and follow-up care.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a 8-week course of antibiotics with rifampicin and streptomycin, complemented by thorough wound care and close monitoring for secondary infection or complications. Surgical consultation for debridement or excision should be arranged promptly if necrosis worsens. Emphasis is placed on medication adherence, wound hygiene, and patient education to facilitate healing. Follow-up will focus on wound assessment, side effect monitoring, and timely adjustments to therapy, aiming for lesion resolution and functional recovery while minimizing adverse effects and preventing complications.",
