    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation consistent with attachment-related separation anxiety disorder, especially with history of emotional distress upon separation and trauma considerations. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, given the significant distress (physical symptoms, emotional turmoil) affecting functioning and risk of worsening attachment insecurity. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but with close monitoring given the potential for escalation or development of comorbidities. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, PTSD, or FASD (given foster care background), but attachment-related issues are primary.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Trauma-informed psychotherapy focusing on attachment and anxiety management; consider individual and family therapy. - Supporting evidence: Evidence supports attachment-based interventions like TF-CBT or dyadic therapy improving emotional regulation and attachment security. - Patient-specific considerations: The adolescent's guarded communication style suggests need for rapport-building; trauma history indicates need for sensitive, phased therapy. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid confrontational approaches; be cautious with psychoeducation initially to prevent overwhelm.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), such as fluoxetine 10 mg daily, titrated cautiously. - Rationale for selection: SSRIs have data supporting use in anxiety and attachment-related conditions in adolescents, with a tolerable side effect profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: 4-6 weeks for noticeable anxiolytic effect. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep changes, increased suicidal ideation; regular follow-up required. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Sertraline, escitalopram, or considering augmentation with psychotherapy.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Consistent routines, stable environment, and development of secure attachment behaviors. - Patient education priorities: Understanding anxiety and attachment issues; normalizing emotional responses. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, stress management techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Attachment-focused therapies, social skills training, family therapy involving foster caregivers.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Every 2-4 weeks initially, adjusting based on response. - Monitoring parameters: Severity of separation anxiety symptoms, physical complaints, medication side effects, emotional state. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening suicidal ideation, self-harm behaviors, significant functional decline, or new trauma symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom diaries, standardized anxiety scales, caregiver reports.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use gentle, empathetic language; validate feelings; avoid pressure. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about confidentiality, emphasize gradual progress. - Adherence strategies: Set achievable goals, involve patient in goal-setting, provide clear explanations. - Family involvement: Engage foster caregivers to support therapy and medication adherence; consider family therapy to strengthen attachment.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Child and adolescent psychiatrist for medication management; trauma-informed therapist or attachment specialist. - Other healthcare team members: School counselors, social workers involved in foster care. - Community resources: Support groups for attachment trauma; educational materials for understanding attachment and anxiety. - Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm coverage for therapy and medications; provide assistance as needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of attachment-related separation anxiety disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based trauma-informed psychotherapy with cautious pharmacotherapy and supportive lifestyle modifications. This plan emphasizes building trust through attachment-focused therapy, judicious use of SSRIs like fluoxetine if indicated, and involving foster caregivers in the therapeutic process. Initial management involves establishing rapport, educating the patient about their condition, and close monitoring of symptoms and medication effects. Long-term goals include reducing separation anxiety, improving emotional regulation, and strengthening attachment security, leading to improved daily functioning and emotional well-being.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule initial psychotherapy with a trauma-informed therapist; discuss medication options with a child psychiatrist; educate foster caregivers about attachment and anxiety. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate therapy sessions; consider starting fluoxetine if symptoms persist or significantly impair functioning; monitor for side effects; establish routines. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduction in separation anxiety symptoms; develop coping skills; strengthen caregiver-patient attachment; assess need for medication tapering or continuation. - Patient handout summary: Remember to follow routines, communicate openly with caregivers and your therapist, and attend all appointments to actively participate in your recovery.",
