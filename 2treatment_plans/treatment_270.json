    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes hospitalization with IV antibiotics (such as piperacillin-tazobactam), supportive measures like IV fluids, and bowel rest. Early surgical consultation for cholecystectomy should be prioritized, ideally within 24-48 hours of stabilization. Throughout hospitalization, monitor vital signs, inflammatory markers, and clinical symptoms to assess improvement. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs, treatment importance, and postoperative care. After stabilization, plan for definitive surgical management while emphasizing lifestyle modifications to reduce recurrence risk. This approach aims to resolve infection, prevent complications, and facilitate symptom resolution while ensuring safe, coordinated care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit patient for IV antibiotics, initiate IV fluids, perform abdominal ultrasound to confirm gallstones/inflammation, and consult surgery.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgery, monitor for postoperative complications, and educate on lifestyle changes.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through lifestyle modifications, monitor for residual symptoms, and ensure routine follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Include information on symptoms to monitor, medication adherence, post-op care, and when to seek urgent care.",
