    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ischemic priapism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent decompression with intracavernosal phenylephrine injection, close patient monitoring, and thorough patient education. The immediate priority is to perform penile aspiration and administer intracavernosal phenylephrine to relieve the ischemia and prevent tissue necrosis. Follow-up will include reassessment of erectile function and symptoms within 24-48 hours, with ongoing education about recognizing early signs of recurrence and avoiding triggers. Engage urology promptly if initial measures fail, and involve the patient\u2019s support network as appropriate to enhance adherence. The overall goal is to preserve erectile function, prevent tissue damage, and ensure safe, effective resolution of the condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prepare for penile aspiration, perform intracavernosal phenylephrine injection under sterile conditions with vital sign monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Ensure symptom resolution, monitor for recurrence, and address any erectile or tissue complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through counseling, manage underlying risk factors, and assess for any long-term sequelae.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of early treatment, explain the procedure and medications used, outline warning signs, and stress the importance of follow-up care.",
