    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpes zoster with central nervous system involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines high-dose antiviral therapy with neurological assessment and symptom management. The initial management should focus on prompt initiation of valacyclovir 1,000 mg three times daily for 7-10 days, tailored to renal function, to reduce viral replication and mitigate neurological complications. Close neurological monitoring is essential to detect any progression of deficits, and supportive measures such as analgesia, skin care, and hydration should be emphasized. Follow-up within 3-5 days is necessary to evaluate symptom progression, and further neurologic assessment should be scheduled as indicated. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognition of warning signs, and skin care. This plan aims to prevent long-term sequelae, promote recovery, and facilitate coordinated care with specialist consultation as needed.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start antiviral therapy, assess renal function, and educate the patient on medication adherence and warning signs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce rash severity, control pain, monitor neurological status, and ensure recovery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent postherpetic neuralgia, monitor for residual neurological deficits, and provide supportive therapies.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of early antiviral treatment, signs of worsening, skin care tips, and follow-up schedule.",
