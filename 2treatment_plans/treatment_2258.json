    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy, most consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), specifically an inherited demyelinating or axonal peripheral neuropathy.\n\nJustification: The patient is a 14-year-old presenting with a progressive 2-year history of gait instability, frequent falls, distal weakness and wasting in the peripheral limbs, tremors, sensory disturbances (numbness, tingling), and balance issues. The gradual worsening over time, absence of acute episodes, and family history of similar symptoms suggest an inherited peripheral neuropathy. CMT is the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy in adolescents, characterized by distal muscle weakness, atrophy, sensory deficits, and gait problems. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, consistent with the patient's father having milder symptoms. The lack of signs indicating central nervous system involvement (such as speech or vision issues) further supports a peripheral neuropathy diagnosis rather than a central cause.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), the management primarily focuses on symptom relief, functional preservation, and prevention of complications. Since CMT is a progressive peripheral neuropathy with no cure to halt progression, treatment is supportive. Non-pharmacological strategies, such as physical and occupational therapy, are crucial for maintaining muscle strength, flexibility, balance, and gait stability, which can help reduce fall risk and improve quality of life. Use of appropriate orthotic devices (e.g., ankle-foot orthoses) can enhance gait and stability. Patient education regarding injury prevention and walking aids is essential. Pharmacologic options are limited; pain may sometimes require medications like gabapentin or duloxetine if neuropathic pain is present. Regular monitoring for complications such as foot ulcers or deformities is important, with early interventions as needed. Family counseling and genetic counseling should also be offered to discuss inheritance patterns and implications for relatives.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive supportive management plan that includes referral to physical and occupational therapy to improve strength, balance, and gait stability; recommend the use of appropriate orthotic devices to aid mobility; provide education on injury prevention and fall risk reduction; and consider pharmacologic therapy (e.g., gabapentin or duloxetine) if neuropathic pain is reported. Arrange for regular follow-up to monitor disease progression, screen for foot deformities or ulcers, and involve a multidisciplinary team as appropriate. Genetic counseling should be offered to discuss inheritance and family planning options."
