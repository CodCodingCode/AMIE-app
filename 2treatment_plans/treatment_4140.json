    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)\nJustification: The patient's chronic, itchy, thickened, and scaly skin predominantly on the neck and wrists with a dry, rough appearance and clear edges is characteristic of atopic dermatitis. The exacerbation with stress and certain soaps, along with nocturnal itching that disturbs sleep, aligns with atopic eczema's typical presentation. The failure of over-the-counter treatments, including steroids, suggests a chronic, possibly more severe or recalcitrant form. The absence of blistering, oozing, or crusting elsewhere makes other differential diagnoses less likely. A personal or family history of allergies would further substantiate this diagnosis, but even without it, the clinical features are strong.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAtopic Dermatitis (Eczema) END",
    "output": "THINKING: In managing atopic dermatitis that is chronic, thickened, and itchy despite previous over-the-counter steroid use, a comprehensive approach involves both identifying and avoiding triggers, as well as optimizing topical and possibly systemic therapy. Non-pharmacological measures such as regular moisturization with emollients are essential to repair skin barrier function and reduce dryness and itching. Since the patient reports exacerbation with stress and certain soaps, education on gentle skin care, avoiding known irritants, and stress management techniques are integral. For pharmacological treatment, a prescription-strength topical corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor (e.g., tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) may be indicated for flares, with careful ongoing monitoring. If the skin is significantly thickened and lichenified, a brief course of a more potent topical steroid can be considered, alongside antihistamines to reduce nocturnal pruritus. In more severe or refractory cases, or if the dermatitis impacts quality of life substantially, a short course of systemic therapy such as oral corticosteroids or immunomodulators may be necessary under specialist guidance. Overall, the goal is to reduce inflammation, restore skin barrier integrity, and prevent future flares.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan includes regular application of liberal, fragrance-free emollients multiple times daily to maintain skin hydration and barrier function. Initiate a moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroid (e.g., triamcinolone or fluocinonide) applied to affected areas during flare-ups to control inflammation, with careful duration to minimize side effects. Consider adding a topical calcineurin inhibitor if the dermatitis persists or recurs frequently, especially on sensitive areas. Educate the patient to avoid known irritants such as harsh soaps and allergens, opt for gentle skin cleansers, and practice stress-reduction techniques. For nocturnal itching disrupting sleep, oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine or hydroxyzine, can be used as adjuncts. If the condition remains poorly controlled despite topical therapy and lifestyle measures, referral for further assessment and possibly systemic treatments may be warranted, but initial management should focus on barrier repair, trigger avoidance, and targeted anti-inflammatory therapy."
