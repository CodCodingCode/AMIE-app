    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Vestibular Migraine (also known as migrainous vertigo)\n\nJustification: The patient\u2019s presentation includes persistent headaches, visual disturbances (flashes, light sensitivity, blurriness), nausea, dizziness, imbalance, mental fog, episodic weakness or disorientation, and intermittent speech difficulty\u2014all of which fluctuate and worsen with physical activity and positional changes. Symptoms such as worsened headaches upon waking and during activities, sensitivity to focusing, and variations with movement are characteristic of vestibular migraine. The absence of recent head trauma and the episodic nature further support this diagnosis, which is common in young adults and often presents with aura-like visual symptoms and neurological disturbances that do not indicate a structural lesion.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nVestibular Migraines END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of vestibular migraine, management should focus on both lifestyle modifications and symptom control. Non-pharmacological interventions are essential as first-line strategies to reduce migraine frequency and severity, including identifying and avoiding potential triggers such as stress, certain foods, sleep disturbances, or dehydration. Incorporating vestibular rehabilitation exercises may help with dizziness and balance issues, and ensuring adequate stress management can improve overall quality of life. Pharmacological treatments should be considered for patients experiencing frequent or severe episodes; for prophylaxis, options like lifestyle modifications are preferred initially, with medications such as propranolol, amitriptyline, or other migraine preventives considered if symptoms persist or worsen. Acute symptom relief can be achieved with analgesics and anti-nausea medications as needed, but these should be used judiciously to prevent overuse. This comprehensive approach aims to reduce the frequency, severity, and impact of vertiginous and headache symptoms, improving functional capacity.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves educating the patient about lifestyle modifications to identify and avoid common triggers, establishing a regular sleep schedule, maintaining hydration, managing stress, and avoiding known dietary triggers. Initiate prophylactic therapy with a migraine preventive agent such as propranolol or amitriptyline, titrated gradually to effective doses, considering the patient\u2019s comorbidities and preferences. Encourage vestibular rehabilitation therapy if dizziness and imbalance persist to improve balance and reduce vertigo episodes. For acute symptom management, recommend over-the-counter analgesics for headaches and anti-nausea medications as needed, while emphasizing the importance of avoiding medication overuse. Follow-up should monitor symptom response and adjust treatments accordingly, with referral to a neurologist if symptoms remain refractory or worsen."
