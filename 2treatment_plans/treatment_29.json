    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum panic disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based psychological therapy with pharmacological management as needed, tailored to her postpartum status and individual needs. Initial management includes engaging her in cognitive-behavioral therapy, providing thorough education about panic disorder and postpartum anxiety, and promoting lifestyle modifications such as sleep hygiene and stress reduction techniques. Pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor like sertraline may be initiated if symptoms are moderate to severe or do not improve with therapy alone, with careful monitoring for side effects and breastfeeding safety. Regular follow-up in 2-4 weeks will assess symptom progression, medication tolerance, and therapeutic response, with adjustments as necessary. Clear communication, involving her in treatment decisions, and potential family support will enhance adherence. Additional psychiatric consultation is available if persistent or worsening. Community resources and support groups can augment her recovery, aiming to improve her overall functioning and well-being during the postpartum period.",
