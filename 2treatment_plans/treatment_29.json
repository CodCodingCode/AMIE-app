    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Testicular Torsion\nJustification: The patient presents with sudden, severe, sharp unilateral testicular pain that started abruptly during sleep along with swelling and redness. He also reports nausea and vomiting, classic associated symptoms. The absence of trauma, prior episodes, or palpable masses reduces the likelihood of other causes such as epididymitis or torsion of testicular appendage. The sudden onset and severity, combined with systemic symptoms like nausea and vomiting, strongly suggest testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention to save the testicle.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nTesticular Torsion END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of testicular torsion, this is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible ischemic damage to the testicle. The primary goal is prompt diagnosis followed by surgical detorsion and orchiopexy. Non-pharmacological management includes immediate stabilization and rapid transfer to a surgical facility equipped to perform emergency orchiopexy. Pain management can be provided with analgesics such as IV opioids to ensure patient comfort while awaiting surgical intervention. Antibiotics are not typically indicated unless there is evidence of infection, which is not suggested in this presentation. The urgency and severity of symptoms, along with systemic signs, necessitate rapid action rather than prolonged observation or conservative management.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should immediately arrange for urgent transfer to the emergency department for surgical consultation. Administer IV analgesics (e.g., morphine or fentanyl) for pain relief en route or in the emergency setting. Ensure the patient is kept in a comfortable position, avoiding pressure on the affected side. Once at the hospital, prompt surgical exploration is essential to detorse the testicle and perform orchiopexy to prevent future torsion. No medications can substitute for surgery in this emergency; thus, rapid recognition and transfer are critical. If time permits before definitive surgery, consider IV fluids for hydration and antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) to control nausea and vomiting."
