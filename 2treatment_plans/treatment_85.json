    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; clinical presentation suggests\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of asthma or airway hyperreactivity, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting bronchodilators, educating the patient on inhaler technique and trigger avoidance, and scheduling close follow-up to monitor symptom control. Additional interventions involve environmental modifications, lifestyle advice, and potential referral to specialists for further assessment and management. Initial management focuses on symptom control and risk reduction, while establishing a long-term plan emphasizing adherence and follow-up. Follow-up will include virtual or in-person visits in 4-6 weeks to evaluate response, with ongoing adjustment based on clinical progress. This approach aims to attain symptom control, improve activity tolerance, and prevent exacerbations, while minimizing medication side effects and addressing patient concerns.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on inhaler use, provide written asthma action plan, and confirm current medication adherence.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve good inhaler technique, reduce symptom frequency, and assess functional status.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain symptom control, minimize exacerbations, and evaluate the need for long-term controller adjustments.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize regular medication use, trigger avoidance, recognizing worsening symptoms, and the importance of follow-up care.",
