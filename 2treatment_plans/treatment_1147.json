    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma (IBC)  \nJustification: The patient's presentation of a rapidly developing, erythematous, swollen, and \"shiny\" breast with skin changes like bumpy texture, skin tightening, and inversion of the nipple, coupled with a palpable axillary lump, is classic for IBC. The absence of trauma or infection, along with systemic symptoms like weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue, further suggests a malignancy rather than an infectious process. The rapid progression over a month and presence of a lump under the arm support local metastatic spread typical of advanced inflammatory breast cancer. The lack of fever and systemic infection signs makes infectious mastitis less likely, especially given the duration and systemic symptoms.  \nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional diagnostics, like imaging and biopsy, are necessary to confirm diagnosis and assess extent)  \n- No further clarification needed: No (more testing and clinical evaluation are needed before concluding diagnosis)  \n\nANSWER:  \nInflammatory Breast Carcinoma  \nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Inflammatory Breast Carcinoma (IBC) is an aggressive and advanced form of breast cancer that requires prompt and comprehensive management. Given the diagnosis, treatment should prioritize immediate oncologic intervention to improve survival chances and symptom control. This includes confirming diagnosis with imaging (such as breast MRI or mammography) and tissue biopsy if not already performed. Since IBC is typically managed with multimodal therapy, systemic treatment with chemotherapy is essential to address both regional and potential distant disease. Surgery (modified radical mastectomy) is often considered after initial chemotherapy to remove residual disease, but this depends on the patient's response and overall condition. Radiation therapy is a critical component for local control. Supportive care such as pain management, addressing skin changes, and psychosocial support should also be integrated. Non-pharmacological measures like patient education, nutritional support, and palliative care involvement are important to optimize quality of life. This treatment plan is realistic for a primary care physician or psychiatrist to coordinate with oncology specialists to facilitate timely referral and initiation of therapy.\n\nANSWER: The patient should be urgently referred to a multidisciplinary oncology team for confirmation of diagnosis via biopsy and staging with imaging. Immediately, initiation of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy\u2014preferably with an anthracycline and taxane-based regimen\u2014is recommended to reduce tumor burden and control disease progression. Supportive care should include analgesics for pain, skin care to manage skin changes, and nutritional support. The patient should be counseled about the aggressive nature of IBC and the importance of prompt, comprehensive treatment. Post-chemotherapy, surgical consultation for possible mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy should be considered to achieve local control. Psychological and palliative care services should be offered as needed to support the patient through this intensive treatment process. Coordination with oncology specialists is essential for optimal management and follow-up."
