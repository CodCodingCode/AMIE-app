    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given episodic cyanosis,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical and medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes consideration of early surgical correction or palliation tailored to the specific cardiac anomaly, ongoing pulmonary vasodilator therapy to optimize oxygenation, and symptomatic management with oxygen and activity modifications. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient, assessing surgical candidacy, and controlling pulmonary hypertension, while establishing a long-term management plan involving regular cardiology follow-up and monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters. Follow-up care will include frequent assessments of oxygen saturation, cardiac function, and symptomatology with clear instructions for recognizing red flag symptoms. This approach aims to improve oxygenation, reduce cyanotic episodes and risks, and enhance overall quality of life while minimizing treatment-related risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospital admission for stabilization, oxygen therapy, initiation of pulmonary vasodilator therapy, and urgent cardiology consultation for surgical evaluation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic imaging, optimize medical therapy, prepare for potential surgery, and educate patient on symptom management.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve surgical correction if feasible, maintain optimal pulmonary pressures, and establish routine follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include recognizing symptoms of deterioration, medication adherence, activity adjustments, and importance of follow-up appointments.",
