    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: I am quite certain of lymphoma diagnosis given lymphadenopathy characteristics and systemic symptoms. However, definitive diagnosis requires biopsy. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, as the patient has progressively enlarging lymph nodes, systemic symptoms like fatigue and episodic chest pains, and risk of progression. - Urgency level: Urgent, as lymphoma typically requires prompt diagnosis and management to prevent progression. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possibility of other malignancies, infections (e.g., tuberculosis, viral), or autoimmune conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate diagnostic biopsy (excisional lymph node biopsy) for histopathological confirmation, followed by staging. Once subtype is confirmed, treatment may include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combined modalities. - Supporting evidence: Biopsy is the gold standard; early staging guides therapy intensity. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, comorbidities, and possible anxiety affecting cooperation. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in biopsy; consider patient's anxiety to optimize cooperation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not initiated until confirmation and staging; post-diagnosis, treatment includes chemotherapeutic regimens tailored to lymphoma subtype. - Rationale for selection: Specific histological subtype (e.g., diffuse large B-cell vs. follicular) guides therapy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic response varies; some patients respond within weeks after initiating chemotherapy. - Key side effects to monitor: Myelosuppression, infection risk, organ toxicity, treatment-related adverse effects. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Salvage therapies, targeted agents, or clinical trial enrollment.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Supportive care includes adequate nutrition, rest, and stress reduction. - Patient education priorities: Explain the diagnostic process, potential treatments, side effects, and prognosis. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain balanced diet, moderate activity, adequate sleep, and stress management. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling or support groups to address anxiety and provide emotional support.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Return for biopsy results within 1-2 weeks; subsequent treatment planning as soon as diagnosis confirmed. - Monitoring parameters: Symptoms, physical exam, blood counts, imaging results, treatment side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, rapid lymph node growth, fever, severe shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms requiring urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical response, repeat imaging, and laboratory tests at specified intervals.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language; acknowledge anxiety; provide thorough explanations. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the diagnostic process, prognosis, and treatment options. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, involve patient in decision-making, schedule regular follow-up. - Family involvement: With patient's consent, involve family to support understanding and adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Hematology/oncology for diagnosis confirmation and treatment plan. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing support, mental health services if needed. - Community resources: Connect with support groups or counseling services. - Insurance/cost considerations: Provide cost-effective treatment options; discuss insurance coverage early.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lymphoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes obtaining an excisional lymph node biopsy for definitive diagnosis, followed by appropriate staging to guide therapy. Once the subtype and stage are clarified, initiating chemotherapy regimens tailored to the specific lymphoma type is essential, with supportive care to manage side effects. Supportive interventions include patient education about the diagnostic process, treatment options, and side effects, alongside lifestyle modifications to improve overall well-being. Close monitoring of symptoms, treatment response, and potential adverse effects will be maintained through scheduled follow-up visits, with clear instructions for red flag symptoms prompting immediate medical attention. Given the patient's anxiety, communication will be empathetic, transparent, and involve her actively in decision-making, possibly involving family support if desired. Coordination with hematology/oncology specialists and support services will ensure comprehensive, timely care aiming for optimal outcomes and quality of life.",
