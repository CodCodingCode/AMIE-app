    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of perforated viscus with peritonitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical intervention with antibiotics and supportive care. Immediate management includes emergent laparotomy or laparoscopy to repair the perforation, along with broad-spectrum IV antibiotics aimed at covering intra-abdominal pathogens. Supportive measures involve IV fluids, pain control, and close hemodynamic monitoring. Postoperatively, the patient should receive ongoing ICU care as needed, with regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory markers, and clinical status. In addition to surgical treatment, patient education should emphasize the seriousness of the condition, the importance of adherence to medications, signs of deterioration, and postoperative care instructions. Follow-up should be scheduled within 1-2 weeks for wound assessment and recovery monitoring. Efforts to involve family and provide clear, empathetic communication will help improve compliance and reduce anxiety. Coordination with surgical, infectious disease, and critical care teams is essential for optimal outcomes. This integrated plan aims to stabilize the patient promptly, prevent complications, and facilitate recovery while addressing individual needs and potential barriers.",
