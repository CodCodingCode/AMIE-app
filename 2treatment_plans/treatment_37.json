    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone to induce remission, along with sodium restriction, diuretics if necessary, and close monitoring of proteinuria and serum albumin. This approach should be complemented by lifestyle modifications such as dietary adjustments and activity level monitoring. Initial management requires close follow-up within 2-4 weeks to assess response and adjust treatment accordingly. Long-term goals focus on achieving and maintaining remission, preventing complications, and addressing underlying causes if identified. The care plan emphasizes patient education on medication adherence, symptom recognition, and lifestyle changes, with family support integrated into ongoing care. Specialist referral to nephrology should be arranged promptly, and regular laboratory monitoring will guide ongoing management. This strategy aims to optimize outcomes while minimizing side effects and ensuring sustainable disease control.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange nephrology consultation, order baseline labs (urinalysis, serum albumin, renal function, lipids), and begin patient education.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate steroids, implement dietary restrictions, monitor initial response, and evaluate for side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve proteinuria remission, stabilize renal function, and address any secondary causes.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasizes medication importance, dietary changes, signs to watch for, and follow-up schedule.",
