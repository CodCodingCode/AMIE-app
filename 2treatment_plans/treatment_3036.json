    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (Relapsing-Remitting or Progressive)  \nJustification: The patient's age, gradual onset and progression of symptoms, bilateral distal sensory disturbances (tingling, numbness), and gait instability are characteristic. The absence of facial, bulbar, or visual symptoms reduces the likelihood of conditions like MND or myasthenia gravis. The combination of weakness, sensory changes, increased fatigue, and progression over years aligns with MS, particularly given the sensory and motor involvement, which is common in demyelinating processes. The lack of rapid progression, reflex abnormalities, or signs suggestive of alternative diagnoses makes MS the most probable.  \n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes  \n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (END)",
    "output": "THINKING: Considering the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, a comprehensive management approach should address both symptom management and disease modification. As a primary care physician or psychiatrist, initiating disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can help reduce relapse frequency and delay disability progression, provided a neurologist has confirmed the diagnosis and discussed options. Symptom management may include physical therapy to maintain mobility and reduce fatigue, as well as education on energy conservation strategies. Non-pharmacological measures such as regular exercise, adequate rest, and nutritional support can improve overall well-being. Pharmacologically, agents such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, or newer oral DMTs might be indicated, but these require specialist input. Symptomatic treatment for sensory disturbances and gait instability might include medications like gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic pain, and physical therapy for balance and strength. Regular neurological follow-up and coordination with neurology are essential for ongoing management, monitoring for disease progression, and treatment adjustments.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating disease-modifying therapy (DMT) after consultation with a neurologist to reduce relapse rates and slow progression. Symptom management includes recommending physical therapy for gait stability and sensory deficits, along with education on energy conservation. Pharmacologically, consider prescribing medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin for neuropathic sensory symptoms, and possibly muscle relaxants if spasticity is present. Encouraging regular exercise tailored to the patient's capabilities, ensuring adequate rest, and maintaining nutritional support are crucial non-pharmacological strategies. It\u2019s important to arrange routine follow-up with neurology for ongoing assessment, and to monitor for side effects or new symptoms requiring further intervention."
