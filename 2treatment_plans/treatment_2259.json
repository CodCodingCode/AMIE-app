    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy (HSMN), potentially a subtype such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive distal weakness and sensory loss in the hands and feet, along with symptoms like tripping, dropping objects, impaired proprioception, muscle weakness in the lower limbs, and difficulty with balance, suggests a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. The chronic and gradually progressive pattern over years, absence of diabetes or alcohol use, and the sensory-motor features are characteristic of a hereditary neuropathy like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The age of onset and symptom progression further support this diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No (additional details about family history, electrodiagnostic studies, or genetic testing are required to confirm)\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the primary goal is to manage symptoms, preserve function, and prevent complications. Since this is a hereditary condition characterized by progressive distal weakness and sensory loss, there is no cure, and treatment is mainly supportive. Non-pharmacological interventions include physical and occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength, improve gait, and adapt to sensory deficits. Use of orthotic devices may enhance balance and reduce falls. Patient education about safety strategies is essential to prevent injuries. Pharmacological options for neuropathic pain (if present) could include agents like gabapentin or pregabalin. Additionally, regular monitoring for secondary complications such as foot ulcers, joint deformities, or pressure sores is important.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating and coordinating supportive care, including referral to physical and occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength, improve gait and balance, and prevent deformities. Consider prescribing orthotic devices for foot support to reduce tripping and falls. Educate the patient on safety measures to prevent injuries due to sensory loss. If neuropathic pain is present, initiate medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin, titrating to tolerated doses. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor disease progression, address emerging symptoms, and manage complications proactively. Referral to a neurologist or specialist in neuromuscular disorders may be beneficial for comprehensive management and genetic counseling."
