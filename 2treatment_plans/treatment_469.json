The treatment plan includes initiating topical ketoconazole 2% cream once daily for 2-4 weeks to target the Malassezia yeast involved in the condition, complemented by gentle skin cleansing practices and avoidance of irritants. Supportive measures include patient education on adherence, proper skin care, and lifestyle modifications such as wearing loose, breathable clothing and managing sweating.\nInitial management focuses on reducing fungal colonization and inflammation to alleviate symptoms and prevent further skin irritation. Follow-up is scheduled in 2-4 weeks to assess response, with a plan to modify therapy if needed. Patients will be instructed to monitor for signs of secondary infection, worsening symptoms, or side effects like skin irritation. This approach aims to achieve symptom resolution, minimize recurrence, and improve quality of life through sustainable skin care habits.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe ketoconazole 2% cream, provide skin care instructions, and set follow-up appointment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce scaling, redness, and itching; ensure adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Minimize flare-ups, establish skin maintenance routines, and reassess need for maintenance therapy or referral.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize daily application of antifungal cream, gentle cleansing, avoiding irritants, and follow-up schedule.",
