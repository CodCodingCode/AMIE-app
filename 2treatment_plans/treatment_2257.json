    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\nJustification: The patient presents with progressive muscle weakness involving both upper and lower limbs, muscle wasting (particularly noted in legs), decreased reflexes, and persistent numbness. The gradual worsening over time, combined with physical findings of muscle wasting and weakness affecting daily activities, supports a motor neuron disease. The absence of sensory loss typical of peripheral neuropathies and the presence of lower motor neuron signs (weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia) point towards ALS. The diffuse nature of symptoms without sensory or autonomic features further supports this diagnosis. As no alternative explanation (e.g., autoimmune, metabolic, or psychiatric causes) fits as closely, ALS remains the most probable.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), the primary goal is to optimize quality of life, slow symptom progression where possible, and address functional limitations. While there is no cure for ALS, certain pharmacological treatments like riluzole and edaravone have been shown to modestly slow disease progression. Non-pharmacological interventions focus on symptom management, respiratory support, nutritional preservation, and maintaining mobility and independence. Early involvement of multidisciplinary care teams, including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, nutritionists, and respiratory specialists, is essential. Additionally, planning for advance directives and providing psychosocial support are crucial components of comprehensive care.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with the initiation of riluzole 50 mg twice daily, which has been shown to modestly prolong survival. Consider prescribing edaravone if accessible and appropriate, as it may offer additional benefit in certain cases. A referral to a multidisciplinary ALS clinic should be arranged for comprehensive management, including physical and occupational therapy to maintain mobility and function, and speech therapy to address dysarthria and dysphagia. Nutritional assessment and intervention, including diet modifications or the potential need for gastrostomy, should be prioritized to prevent malnutrition. Respiratory function should be monitored regularly, and pulmonary support (e.g., non-invasive ventilation) introduced if signs of respiratory compromise develop. Symptomatic treatments such as muscle relaxants or spasticity agents can be used as needed, and psychosocial support or counseling should be provided to support emotional well-being. Regular follow-up to adjust interventions based on disease progression is essential."
