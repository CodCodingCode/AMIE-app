The prolapse appears intermittent and manageable, suggesting mil\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rectal prolapse, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating conservative measures such as increased dietary fiber, adequate hydration, and avoiding straining through behavioral modifications and pelvic floor exercises supported by physiotherapy. Pharmacological interventions like stool softeners can be used to facilitate bowel movements if needed. Close follow-up in 4-6 weeks is essential to assess symptom improvement or progression, with ongoing education about symptom monitoring and when to seek urgent care. This approach aims to reduce symptoms, prevent progression, and improve quality of life while avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures initially, reserving surgical consultation for cases that do not respond or worsen. Implementation involves immediate lifestyle modifications, regular follow-up, and potential referral for physiotherapy or surgical evaluation as needed, ensuring a tailored and patient-suitable management plan.",
