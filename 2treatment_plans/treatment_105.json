    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nPrimary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation consistent with uncomplicated diverticulitis; however, confirmation with physic\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of diverticulitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating outpatient antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7-10 days, along with supportive measures like bowel rest, hydration, and gradual dietary fiber reintroduction once symptoms improve. Physical examination and possibly imaging should be performed promptly to confirm the diagnosis and rule out complications. The patient should be monitored closely for symptom progression, with follow-up in 3-7 days to assess clinical improvement. I will educate the patient on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary fiber supplementation and smoking cessation, will be encouraged to reduce recurrence risk. In case of worsening symptoms or signs of complication, hospitalization and potential surgical consultation should be pursued. This management aims to resolve the current episode effectively while preventing future complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Conduct physical exam and vital signs, obtain labs and imaging if indicated, start antibiotics if outpatient management is appropriate.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution, ensure medication adherence, and evaluate need for further intervention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain dietary and lifestyle modifications, monitor for recurrence, and plan follow-up if indicated.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about diverticulitis, medication instructions, warning signs of worsening illness, and lifestyle tips.",
