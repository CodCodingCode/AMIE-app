    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain primarily in the thumb, index, and middle fingers that worsen at night and with repetitive hand activities are classic presentation features of CTS. The symptoms being exacerbated by typing and holding objects, along with difficulty gripping small objects and mild weakness during activity, further support median nerve compression at the wrist. The fact that symptoms can extend to other fingers in some cases also aligns with median nerve distribution. The absence of significant shoulder or neck symptoms or weakness suggests a localized nerve entrapment rather than cervical radiculopathy or other systemic neurological conditions.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's presentation consistent with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), the primary goals are to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, and improve hand function. Non-pharmacological measures such as wrist splinting, particularly at night, can reduce median nerve compression caused by wrist flexion during sleep. Activity modifications that reduce repetitive wrist movements and avoid prolonged wrist awkwardness are also critical. Recognizing that symptoms are exacerbated by activities like typing and gripping, ergonomic adjustments and taking regular breaks are advisable. Pharmacologically, if symptoms are moderate to severe, oral NSAIDs may be considered for symptomatic relief, although they do not address nerve compression directly. In cases where symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative measures, corticosteroid injections may provide additional relief. Referral for evaluation of surgical decompression is appropriate if symptoms significantly impair daily function or fail to improve with conservative treatment over several months.\n\nANSWER: Initiate conservative management with the use of a wrist splint to be worn at night to maintain the wrist in a neutral position and reduce median nerve pressure. Educate the patient on activity modifications, emphasizing ergonomic adjustments and frequent breaks during repetitive hand use. Consider prescribing an over-the-counter NSAID, such as ibuprofen, for short-term symptom relief if tolerated. If symptoms do not improve within 4-6 weeks or are severe, refer the patient to a specialist for further evaluation, which may include corticosteroid injections or surgical decompression if indicated. Encourage follow-up to assess response and adjust the treatment plan as needed."
