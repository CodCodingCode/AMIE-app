The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 40-60 mg daily with planned taper), closely monitoring for infection, bleeding, and treatment response, and providing education on medication adherence and symptom reporting. Immediate management focuses on controlling inflammation and preventing complications, while ongoing care involves regular follow-up, laboratory assessments, and potential adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy as needed. This approach aims to reduce systemic inflammation, improve skin and systemic symptoms, and prevent further organ involvement, all while carefully considering his immunosuppressed state and ensuring safety through vigilant monitoring.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with skin biopsy, baseline labs (CBC, renal function, inflammatory markers, HIV viral load), and order imaging if necessary.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve initial symptom control, monitor for side effects, and reinforce adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize vasculitis activity, prevent relapses, and optimize HIV management concurrently.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain vasculitis condition, importance of medication adherence, signs of complications, and follow-up schedule to ensure understanding and engagement.",
