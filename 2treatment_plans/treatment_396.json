The presence of internal emotions that flood and fluctuate suggest episodes of mood instability. Though no specific psychotic features are reported, the emotional upheaval and cognitive complaints point toward a mood disorder with potential atypical features. The absence of physical symptoms, negative family history, and lack of symptoms suggestive of a primary medical or neurological condition support a psychiatric etiology.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMajor depressive disorder with atypical features and mood instability  \nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with atypical features and mood instability potentially indicative of a bipolar spectrum disorder, it is important to approach treatment carefully to avoid triggering mood episodes, especially if an underlying bipolar condition is suspected. Non-pharmacological strategies such as psychoeducation about mood fluctuations, sleep hygiene, and stress management can support symptom management. Pharmacologically, selecting an antidepressant that has a lower risk of triggering hypomanic or manic episodes is crucial; mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics with mood-stabilizing properties may be appropriate. Since this patient presents with significant mood instability, irritability, and emotional flooding, a mood stabilizer such as lamotrigine or valproate might be considered. If an antidepressant is warranted, it should be used cautiously, ideally in combination with a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. Close monitoring of mood symptoms, side effects, and overall functioning is essential during treatment initiation and adjustment.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include initiating psychoeducation about mood symptoms, sleep hygiene, and stress reduction techniques. Pharmacologically, consider starting a mood stabilizer such as lamotrigine to address mood instability and atypical features; if depressive symptoms are predominant and the risk of mood switching is low, an SSRI (e.g., sertraline) could be cautiously added alongside the mood stabilizer, with close monitoring for any signs of mood elevation or adverse effects. Avoid antidepressants alone without mood stabilization in case of underlying bipolar spectrum features. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess treatment response and adjust as necessary, and the patient should be advised on recognizing early signs of mood shifts or hypomania. This approach aims to stabilize mood symptoms while minimizing risks associated with potential bipolar spectrum disorder."
