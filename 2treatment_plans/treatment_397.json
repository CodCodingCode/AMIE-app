    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Congenital or adult-onset hyperandrogenism, most likely due to androgen excess such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: The patient exhibits signs consistent with androgen excess, including a deeper voice, increased body hair, acne, increased skin oiliness, and tiredness, all persisting for approximately two months. The absence of menstrual periods indicates possible anovulation or amenorrhea, which is common in hyperandrogenic states. No recent medication or exposure history suggests this is endogenous. The overall presentation aligns with elevated androgen levels affecting secondary sexual characteristics and metabolism.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nThe most probable diagnosis is hyperandrogenism, likely due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or a form of ovarian or adrenal androgen excess.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with signs of hyperandrogenism such as a deeper voice, increased body hair, acne, skin oiliness, and amenorrhea, all persisting for around two months. These features suggest androgen excess, which could be due to conditions like PCOS or androgen-secreting tumors originating from the ovaries or adrenal glands. Given the absence of recent medication or exposure history and the clinical presentation, initial management should focus on confirming the diagnosis through hormonal evaluations and imaging to rule out tumor sources. Since the patient is in the primary care or psychiatric setting, it is practical to initiate a treatment plan that addresses symptomatic relief and potential underlying causes while arranging for definitive diagnostic workup.\n\nANSWER: The management should begin with lifestyle modifications, emphasizing weight management and regular exercise, which can help reduce androgen levels and improve menstrual regularity if PCOS is confirmed. Pharmacologically, a combined oral contraceptive pill containing estrogen and progestin can regulate menstrual cycles, decrease ovarian androgen production, and improve skin symptoms. If the patient has significant hirsutism or acne, anti-androgens such as spironolactone may be considered, provided pregnancy is not planned or is ruled out, as it can counteract androgen effects. Simultaneously, baseline hormonal workup including serum testosterone, DHEA-S, LH, FSH, and ultrasound imaging of the ovaries and adrenal glands should be scheduled to identify or exclude tumor causes. Further specialist referral to endocrinology or gynecology may be needed if initial treatments are insufficient or if tumors are suspected."
