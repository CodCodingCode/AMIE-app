    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of spontaneous tension pneumothorax, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines emergency decompressive procedures with subsequent definitive management and patient education. The immediate priority is to perform a needle thoracostomy to quickly relieve intrathoracic pressure, followed by placement of a chest tube to ensure ongoing lung re-expansion. The patient should receive analgesics judiciously for comfort once stabilized. Long-term care includes counseling on smoking cessation, activity modifications, and avoiding triggers that may precipitate recurrence. Close monitoring with chest imaging and clinical assessments will guide ongoing treatment. Coordination with pulmonology or thoracic surgery is essential for evaluating underlying causes and preventing future episodes. Throughout, clear communication tailored to the patient's confusion-prone explanation style, with written summaries, will facilitate understanding and adherence. This approach aims to stabilize the patient rapidly, prevent recurrence, and promote pulmonary health.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Perform needle decompression emergently, then insert a chest tube; monitor vital signs continuously.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm lung re-expansion via imaging, manage pain, and educate on lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Investigate underlying causes, assess for recurrence risk, and support smoking cessation.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include recognizing symptoms, importance of avoiding smoking and strenuous activity, and following scheduled follow-up appointments.",
