    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis provided is viral conjunctivitis, but the patient\u2019s context mentions hypertensive crisis as the gold standard diagnosis and the presentation with eye redness, swelling, tearing after playing soccer. The primary concern should be confirming whether this is indeed viral conjunctivitis or if there is a more serious ocular or systemic condition. Given the presentation and recent activity, viral conjunctivitis seems plausible but requires proper assessment. Severity is likely mild to moderate unless signs of vision impairment or significant pain appear. The urgency is routine care unless there are red flag symptoms like vision loss, intense pain, or signs of secondary bacterial infection. Treatment typically includes supportive care such as hygiene measures, symptomatic relief, and patient education, especially since the condition is viral. Medication options are mainly supportive, with avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics. Monitoring involves assessing symptom progression, and follow-up is important if symptoms worsen. Given the patient\u2019s information_withholder personality, clear and factual communication emphasizing reassurance and education will be key. Family involvement is optional, depending on patient preference. Coordination with ophthalmology is advisable if symptoms do not improve or worsen.\nANSWER: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:   - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on typical viral conjunctivitis presentation.   - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms are recent with redness, tearing, and swelling but no mention of vision changes or significant pain.   - Urgency level: Routine care needed; urgent if vision is affected or pain is severe.   - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, keratitis, or other ocular infections if symptoms evolve or worsen.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION:   - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care with artificial tears, hygiene measures, and symptomatic relief.   - Supporting evidence: These interventions are standard for viral conjunctivitis, which is self-limited.   - Patient-specific considerations: No contraindications noted; avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection suspected.   - Contraindications or cautions: Minimize touching or rubbing eyes; watch for worsening symptoms.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:   - Primary medication choice: Artificial tear drops (over-the-counter), lubricating eye drops as needed.   - Rationale for selection: To relieve irritation and keep eye moist, supporting comfort and healing.   - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 3-7 days.   - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; ensure drops are preservative-free if used long-term to avoid irritation.   - Alternative medications if first-line fails: If bacterial superinfection suspected, consider topical antibiotics like erythromycin ointment.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:   - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent handwashing, avoiding touch or rubbing eyes, disinfecting common surfaces.   - Patient education priorities: Explain that viral conjunctivitis is contagious, hygiene measures reduce spread, and symptoms generally resolve autonomously.   - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid activities that may irritate eyes or promote spread (e.g., swimming pools).   - Behavioral interventions: Encourage patience and adherence to hygiene guidelines.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:   - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen.   - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, vision changes, increased redness, pain, or discharge.   - Red flag symptoms: Vision loss, severe pain, intense photophobia, no improvement after a week.   - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief, reduction in redness and tearing.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:   - Communication approach: Provide clear, concise information about viral conjunctivitis, emphasizing self-care and expected course. Use straightforward language suited for the information_withholder style.   - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that most cases resolve with supportive care, but warn about signs indicating need for prompt care.   - Adherence strategies: Encourage consistent hygiene, following advice, and reporting worsening symptoms promptly.   - Family involvement: Discuss if patient desires; consider including family in education if they are involved in care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:   - Specialist referrals needed: Only if symptoms worsen, vision changes, or no improvement after 7 days.   - Other healthcare team members: None required initially; can involve ophthalmologist if persistent or complicated cases.   - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye hygiene and infection control.   - Insurance/cost considerations: Recommend over-the-counter remedies and emphasize simple hygiene to minimize costs.  Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care with artificial tears and strict hygiene measures, along with clear patient education to foster understanding and compliance. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and infection control, with routine follow-up to monitor progression. Attention to patient education ensures they understand the self-limited nature of the condition and when to seek further care. This approach aims for symptom resolution within a week, minimizes the risk of transmission, and reduces unnecessary antibiotic use, promoting safe and effective recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:   - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to start using over-the-counter artificial tears as needed, maintain hand hygiene, avoid eye touching, and refrain from sharing towels or personal items. Provide education on symptoms to watch for.   - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Expect symptom improvement within a few days; reassess in 3-5 days to confirm resolution or address persistent symptoms.   - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no complications; reinforce hygiene practices to prevent recurrence.   - Patient handout summary: Emphasize handwashing, avoid eye rubbing, do not share personal items, use lubricating eye drops for comfort, and seek medical attention if vision changes, pain intensifies, or symptoms persist beyond one week.",
