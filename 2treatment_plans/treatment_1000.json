    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan, adhering strictly to the outlined format. This involves confirming diagnosis and severity, selecting evidence-based treatments, considering pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, planning follow-up, and effectively communicating with the patient. Given the patient's presentation with ongoing cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and fatigue, the primary goal is to stabilize her asthma exacerbation while considering underlying factors, patient behavior, and safety. The plan should be comprehensive, practical, and tailored to her specific context.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes optimizing bronchodilator therapy, initiating anti-inflammatory treatment, patient education, and close follow-up with attention to her specific symptoms and concerns. Initial management focuses on alleviating acute symptoms and preventing progression, while establishing long-term control strategies. Follow-up care will include symptom monitoring and education on trigger avoidance, with clear instructions for the patient regarding when to seek urgent care. This approach is designed to improve respiratory function, reduce future exacerbation risk, and support sustainable asthma management while minimizing side effects and fostering patient engagement.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer a nebulized or inhaled /short-acting beta-agonist/ (e.g., albuterol 2-4 puffs every 20 minutes as needed for acute relief) and assess response. Provide education on inhaler technique and trigger avoidance. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate inhaled corticosteroid therapy (e.g., fluticasone 100-250 mcg twice daily), review symptom control, and reinforce trigger management. Arrange for spirometry if not recently performed. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve optimal asthma control with minimal symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and develop an individualized management plan. Reassess inhaler technique and medication adherence regularly. - Patient handout summary: Educate on inhaler use, recognize early signs of exacerbation, avoid known triggers, adhere to prescribed medication, and contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
