    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive gait disturbance, leg stiffness, and balance issues starting at a relatively young age strongly suggests a neurodegenerative spasticity syndrome. The family history of similar neurological issues further supports a hereditary pattern. The absence of sensory deficits and other upper motor neuron signs aligns with HSP, which primarily involves progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to corticospinal tract degeneration. The patient's age, mild tingling sensation, and absence of other nerve symptoms make multiple sclerosis less likely, especially in the absence of demyelinating features or sensory deficits. Parkinson\u2019s disease is less probable given the predominant spasticity without tremor and the early age of onset. Spinal cord pathology could be considered but is less likely without specific signs like sensory level or bladder involvement. The possibility of a functional gait disorder is lower given the progressive nature and family history.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by lower limb spasticity, weakness, and gait difficulties. Since the condition is hereditary and progressive, the focus of management involves symptomatic relief, slowing progression where possible, and improving quality of life. Pharmacologically, muscle spasticity can be reduced with medications such as muscle relaxants; non-pharmacological interventions like physical therapy, assistive devices, and lifestyle modifications are crucial for maintaining mobility and preventing complications. Given the diagnosis, initiating a multidisciplinary approach is essential. As a primary care physician or psychiatrist, while you may not manage all aspects directly, pharmacological management with drugs like baclofen or tizanidine, combined with physical therapy, can significantly improve the patient's functional status. Additionally, regular follow-up to monitor disease progression, manage side effects, and address psychological or emotional impacts is important.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should focus on symptomatic management of spasticity and gait disturbances. Initiate pharmacotherapy with muscle relaxants such as baclofen or tizanidine to reduce lower limb spasticity, tailoring the dose gradually to minimize side effects. Recommend consistent physical therapy focusing on stretching, strengthening, and gait training to maintain mobility and prevent contractures. Consider referral to physiotherapy and occupational therapy services for tailored interventions, including the use of orthotic devices or assistive walking aids. Educate the patient about energy conservation strategies and safety measures to prevent falls. Regular monitoring for medication effectiveness and side effects, along with psychological support or counseling if needed, should be incorporated into ongoing care. Collaboration with neurology specialists for further assessment and potential genetic counseling can also be beneficial."
