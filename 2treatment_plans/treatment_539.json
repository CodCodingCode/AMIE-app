    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing after trauma suggest traumatic conjunctivitis, but rule out infectious conjunctivitis and foreign body. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate, considering symptoms are recent and not described as vision-threatening or extensive. No mention of severe pain or vision loss. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to prevent worsening, but not immediately life-threatening. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Infectious conjunctivitis (bacterial or viral), corneal abrasion, foreign body, or other ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with education, lubricants, and careful observation; use of topical antibiotics only if secondary infection suspected. - Supporting evidence: Conservative management suffices for traumatic conjunctivitis, which often resolves spontaneously. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient is a young, active individual; no indication of immunosuppression. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical steroids unless otherwise specified; monitor for signs of infection or worsening.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (lubricating eye drops), preservative-free, instilled as needed. - Rationale for selection: To soothe eye, reduce discomfort, and promote healing without risks associated with steroid drops. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 48-72 hours; full resolution in 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: None significant; ensure no adverse reactions or signs of secondary infection develop. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Antibiotic drops, if infection develops, or referral for further assessment.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid rubbing eyes, keep eye area clean, practice hand hygiene to prevent secondary infection. - Patient education priorities: How to perform proper eye hygiene, importance of avoiding irritants, recognizing signs of worsening. - Lifestyle modifications: Use protective eyewear during sports if trauma risk persists. - Behavioral interventions: Preventive measures, educating on avoiding further injury.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity changes, signs of secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, vision disturbance, purulent discharge, eyelid swelling, worsening redness. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief, reduction in redness and tearing within 2-3 days.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clearly and simply explain diagnosis and management, using reassurance and visual aids if helpful. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize that condition is common, usually self-limited, and that symptoms should improve quickly. - Adherence strategies: Encourage adherence to treatment and follow-up, ask about understanding, reassure about safety. - Family involvement: Include family if appropriate to ensure support and compliance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Not routinely; refer to ophthalmology if worsening or no improvement after 3-5 days. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care follow-up, possibly pharmacy for medication instructions. - Community resources: Eye health educational materials, injury prevention info. - Insurance/cost considerations: Use affordable OTC options for lubricants; ensure follow-up is accessible.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines conservative symptomatic management with patient-centered education and careful monitoring. Initial management includes the use of preservative-free artificial tears to soothe the eye, along with instructions to avoid rubbing and ensure proper eye hygiene. No antibiotics are immediately indicated unless signs of secondary infection develop. The patient should be informed about expected improvement within a few days and advised to seek follow-up in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. Follow-up will assess symptom resolution and detect any complications. The care plan emphasizes reassurance, prevention of further injury, and timely escalation if recovery does not occur as expected, aiming for full recovery with minimal risks.",
