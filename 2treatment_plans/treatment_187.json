The treatment plan includes confirming the diagnosis via biopsy and staging, stabilizing the patient to manage hemoptysis and systemic symptoms, and initiating appropriate oncologic therapies based on staging. Initial management focuses on urgent diagnostic evaluation and symptom control while establishing a multidisciplinary care plan. Follow-up will include regular assessment of symptoms, imaging, and laboratory tests to monitor response and detect complications. Patient education will emphasize the importance of diagnostic procedures, treatment adherence, and recognizing warning signs. This approach aims to improve prognosis, enhance quality of life, and coordinate care seamlessly within the patient's complex clinical context.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent bronchoscopy or biopsy to confirm pathology; stabilize airway and bleeding; initiate supportive care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic staging; start oncologic treatment as appropriate; monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease control or remission; provide supportive and palliative care as needed; optimize quality of life.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on diagnosis, treatment options, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.",
