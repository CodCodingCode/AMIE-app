    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical features consistent with diagnosed epilepsy type, but need EEG confirmation. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering recurrent episodes with postictal confusion, possible injury risks, and impact on quality of life. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed due to frequency and potential for injury or other complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other epileptic syndromes, syncope, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiation of an antiepileptic drug (AED) effective for generalized tonic-clonic seizures. - Supporting evidence: AEDs such as levetiracetam, valproate, or lamotrigine are established as effective for generalized seizures. - Patient-specific considerations: Adult male, possible side effect profiles, comorbidities, medication tolerability. - Contraindications or cautions: Liver issues (avoid valproate if significant hepatic disease), cognitive effects, potential drug interactions.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily, titrated up as needed. - Rationale for selection: Favorable side effect profile, minimal drug interactions, efficacy in generalized seizures. - Expected timeline for improvement: Clinical response may be observed within 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Behavioral changes, mood disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Valproate, lamotrigine, or topiramate.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Seizure safety measures (e.g., avoiding driving until controlled), sleep hygiene, avoiding seizure triggers. - Patient education priorities: Adherence importance, recognizing seizure warning signs, safety precautions. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate sleep, stress management, avoiding alcohol and illicit substances. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling or support groups if emotional distress present.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment in 2-4 weeks to evaluate medication tolerance and seizure control. - Monitoring parameters: Seizure frequency, medication side effects, mood changes, adherence. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening, new neurological deficits, suicidal ideation, severe side effects. - Treatment response assessment: Monitoring seizure frequency and severity, patient diary, possible repeat EEG.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation of diagnosis, treatment rationale, and safety measures. - Addressing patient concerns: Worries about side effects, driving restrictions, lifestyle impact. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication schedule, emphasize importance, provide written instructions. - Family involvement: With patient consent, educate family members on seizure management and safety.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology for ongoing management and possible EEG studies. - Other healthcare team members: Epilepsy nurse educator, mental health counselor if needed. - Community resources: Seizure support groups, Epilepsy Foundation educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Review medication formulary coverage, costs, and assistance programs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an antiepileptic medication such as levetiracetam, along with seizure safety education and lifestyle modifications. Immediate priorities are to start medication, ensure patient safety, and arrange close follow-up within a few weeks to assess response. Long-term management focuses on seizure control, medication adherence, lifestyle adjustments, and regular neurological monitoring. Follow-up care will include seizure frequency evaluation, side-effect assessment, and ongoing patient education to promote optimal outcomes while minimizing risks. This approach aims to achieve seizure reduction or freedom, improve quality of life, and ensure patient safety through coordinated multidisciplinary support.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate levetiracetam 500 mg BID, provide seizure safety education, and schedule follow-up in 2-4 weeks. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Titrate medication as needed, monitor for side effects, and review seizure diary. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained seizure control, patient adherence, and address any side effects or concerns. - Patient handout summary: Importance of medication adherence, safety precautions, recognizing warning signs, and when to seek medical attention.",
