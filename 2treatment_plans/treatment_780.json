    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment: The presentation of acute neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, visual distortions, and unsteadiness is highly suggestive of severe hypocalcemia causing tetany. The certainty of the diagnosis is high given the clinical picture. Urgency is high; this is potentially life-threatening if airway, breathing, or cardiac issues arise. Differential considerations include neurological conditions, metabolic disturbances, or medication effects, but hypocalcemia is the primary concern. Step 2 - Evidence-based treatment selection: First-line treatment involves correcting calcium levels promptly. For symptomatic hypocalcemia, intravenous calcium gluconate is preferred to rapidly restore calcium. Oral supplementation may follow once stabilized. The evidence supports prompt correction to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Patient-specific factors include age, potential comorbidities, and risk of vascular access issues. Step 3 - Pharmacological interventions: IV calcium gluconate 10-20 mL of 10% solution administered slowly under cardiac monitoring is appropriate. Monitoring for arrhythmias, infiltration, or extravasation is essential. If intravenous access is not feasible or if symptoms improve, transition to oral calcium (e.g., calcium carbonate) with vitamin D analogs like calcitriol may be necessary. Step 4 - Non-pharmacological interventions: Educate the patient about dietary calcium and vitamin D intake, avoiding medications that can lower calcium or interfere with absorption. Stress management and sleep hygiene might reduce episodic symptoms. Step 5 - Monitoring & follow-up: Continuous ECG monitoring during IV calcium administration, repeat serum calcium levels hourly, and assessment of symptom resolution. Follow-up labs in 24-48 hours to confirm calcium normalization. Watch for signs of hypocalcemia recurrence. Step 6 - Patient communication: Given her worry and family involvement, clearly explain the plan, reassurance about the urgency and safety of treatment, and importance of follow-up. Address concerns about potential causes and long-term management. Step 7 - Coordination & referrals: Consult endocrinology if underlying causes (e.g., hypoparathyroidism) are suspected. Coordinate with nursing staff for IV administration, dietitians for nutritional counseling, and involve family in education.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypocalcemia presenting as tetany, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt correction of calcium deficiency with patient-centered education and close monitoring. The initial management includes administering intravenous calcium gluconate to rapidly restore serum calcium levels, along with continuous cardiac monitoring. After stabilization, transition to oral calcium and vitamin D analogs will help sustain calcium levels. Ongoing assessment of serum calcium, symptoms, and addressing underlying causes will be essential for long-term control. Patient education focusing on dietary intake, recognizing symptoms of recurrence, and emphasizing adherence to therapy are critical. Coordination with specialists and involving family members will support adherence and timely intervention. This plan aims to promptly alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and establish a foundation for durable management of calcium balance.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV calcium gluconate infusion under cardiac monitoring, confirm diagnosis with repeat labs, and monitor for symptom improvement. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve and maintain normal serum calcium levels, identify and treat underlying cause, educate patient on dietary and medication adherence. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain stable calcium levels, prevent recurrent tetany, optimize related endocrine function, and monitor for potential complications. - Patient handout summary: Explain hypocalcemia causes, symptoms, treatment steps, importance of medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care.",
