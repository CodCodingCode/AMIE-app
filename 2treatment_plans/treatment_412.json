    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary di\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with functional daytime incontinence, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based behavioral strategies with pharmacological options tailored to the child's needs. Initial management should focus on using enuresis alarms alongside bladder training, scheduled voiding, and caregiver education to encourage consistency. If nocturnal enuresis persists, adding desmopressin at bedtime may be beneficial, with close monitoring for hyponatremia. Throughout, addressing emotional factors and providing reassurance are critical, especially given the child\u2019s stoic tendencies. Follow-up in 2-4 weeks will help assess progress, adjust interventions, and monitor for side effects. Engaging the family and considering referrals if needed will ensure a supportive environment for long-term success. This integrated plan aims to reduce symptoms, promote bladder control, and improve emotional well-being while minimizing adverse effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate caregivers about enuresis, start bladder diary, instruct on implementing behavioral techniques, discuss fluid restriction before bedtime.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve consistent use of alarm, monitor reduction in nocturnal and daytime episodes, evaluate medication effectiveness if prescribed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete remission, develop sustained bladder control, and address any emotional or social impacts.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points about enuresis, importance of alarm training, medication safety, and emotional support strategies.",
