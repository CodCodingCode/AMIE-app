    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly the cerebellar-predominant or parkinsonian type\nJustification: The patient's progressive unsteadiness and falls, especially worsening with multitasking and fatigue, along with abnormal eye movements (jerking, difficulty with vertical gaze), suggest a neurodegenerative disorder affecting cerebellar and autonomic functions. The occurrence of dizziness, visual disturbances, speech difficulties, and falls over years that improve with rest are typical features of MSA. The worsening with stress and fatigue, plus the history of abnormal eye movements and gait instability, supports a diagnosis involving cerebellar and autonomic nuclei involvement, both characteristic of MSA. Other differentials such as Parkinson's disease or primary cerebellar ataxia are less likely given the pattern of autonomic and oculomotor symptoms, and the progression over years is suggestive of a neurodegenerative process rather than a static or reversible condition.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple System Atrophy (MSA) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, autonomic, and cerebellar features. Since no cure exists, treatment primarily focuses on symptom management to improve quality of life and safety. Non-pharmacological approaches like physical and occupational therapy can help maintain mobility, balance, and activity levels, reducing fall risk. Addressing autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension may involve non-pharmacologic measures including increased salt and fluid intake, compression stockings, and gradual position changes. Pharmacologically, certain medications can alleviate specific symptoms: for example, using carefully titrated medications such as treprostinil or midodrine for orthostatic hypotension, and considering medications like clonazepam for limb or REM sleep-related movement disorders if present. Involvement of a neurologist specialized in movement disorders is advisable for complex management, but primary care or psychiatry can initiate and coordinate symptomatic treatment, ensuring close monitoring for adverse effects and disease progression.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with symptomatic management aimed at improving quality of life. Recommend engaging the patient in physical and occupational therapy for balance, gait, and fall prevention. Advise non-pharmacologic measures for orthostatic hypotension, including increasing salt and fluid intake, wearing compression stockings, and instructing gradual changes in position. Consider pharmacologic therapy with medications such as midodrine or fludrocortisone to manage orthostatic symptoms, starting at low doses and titrating carefully. Address specific autonomic or motor symptoms with appropriate agents if they arise, under specialist guidance. Ensure regular neurological follow-up for progression assessment, and provide patient and caregiver education about disease course, safety precautions, and symptom management strategies."
