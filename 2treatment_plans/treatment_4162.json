    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient presents with a subacute course (3 weeks) of neurological symptoms including headaches, mental fog, blurred and double vision, right-sided weakness, fatigue, and episodic visual disturbances. These symptoms are consistent with demyelinating processes affecting multiple central nervous system pathways. The presence of visual disturbances such as blurriness and double vision suggest optic nerve involvement (optic neuritis), common in MS. The unilateral weakness and cognitive changes point toward multifocal CNS involvement. The temporal progression over weeks and the combination of sensory and visual symptoms are characteristic features of MS, especially in a relatively young adult. No signs point toward alternative diagnoses like stroke (which is usually sudden onset), infection (no fever or systemic signs), or tumor (less likely with this symptom pattern and duration).  \nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) indicates an inflammatory demyelinating process of the central nervous system requiring prompt initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to reduce the frequency of relapses and delay progression. In addition to addressing the long-term management with DMT, acute symptoms such as optic neuritis may benefit from corticosteroids to hasten recovery, although this is more symptom-specific. Symptomatic treatment for fatigue, spasticity, or cognitive issues can also improve quality of life. Non-pharmacological interventions include patient education, physical therapy to maintain mobility, and cognitive support if needed. Starting with an interferon-based DMT or other oral agents like dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, or fingolimod can be considered, tailored to patient preferences, comorbidities, and potential side effects. Symptom management, especially for visual disturbances and weakness, can include targeted therapies and referral to neurology and physiotherapy services for comprehensive care.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include initiating a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, or fingolimod, depending on patient factors and preferences, to reduce relapse frequency and disease progression. Corticosteroids, such as high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, may be administered over 3-5 days to treat acute optic neuritis and other active neurological symptoms for faster symptom resolution. Patient education about MS, including recognition of relapse symptoms and importance of adherence to therapy, should be provided. Refer the patient to neurology for comprehensive MS management, and recommend physical and occupational therapy to support mobility and function. Encourage lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, stress management, and smoking cessation if applicable. Follow-up should be arranged for ongoing assessment of response to treatment and adjustment of therapeutic strategies as needed."
