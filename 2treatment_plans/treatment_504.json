    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate administration of intramuscular epinephrine, vital sign monitoring, and positioning to optimize airway patency. Supportive medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids can be administered subsequently to reduce ongoing symptoms. Patient education is prioritized to instruct on allergen avoidance, recognition of early symptoms, and proper use of adrenaline auto-injectors. Close follow-up within 24-48 hours is essential for reassessment, with referral to allergy specialists for testing and long-term management. Behavioral support may be appropriate to address anxiety about recurrent episodes, enhancing compliance and reassurance. This approach aims to rapidly stabilize the patient, prevent deterioration, and establish a foundation for safe, long-term allergy management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IM epinephrine promptly, position patient supine with legs elevated if tolerated, assess airway, breathing, and circulation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm allergy with testing, educate patient on avoidance and auto-injector use, establish follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Develop a personalized allergy management plan, ensure auto-injector availability, and monitor for future episodes.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include recognizing anaphylaxis, emergency auto-injector use, allergen avoidance, and when to seek urgent care.",
