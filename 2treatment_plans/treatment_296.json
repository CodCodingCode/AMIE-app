    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary diagnosis is preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, confirmed by presentation of eyelid redness, swelling, and tearing after trauma during soccer. Confidence is high given the clinical picture. Severity appears mild to moderate since the infection seems localized without signs of systemic illness, proptosis, or visual changes. Urgency level is routine care with outpatient management unless worsening occurs. Differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis or allergic conjunctivitis; monitoring for progression to orbital cellulitis is necessary.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment includes outpatient antibiotic therapy targeting common pathogens. Supportive care and patient education are essential. This approach is supported by clinical guidelines indicating antibiotics for uncomplicated preseptal cellulitis in immunocompetent patients. The patient\u2019s recent trauma and presentation favor this route. Caution is needed to monitor for signs of progression, which would require escalated care.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary medication: Oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily for 5-7 days. Rationale: Broad-spectrum coverage, including if Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is involved. Expected improvement: Symptoms should begin improving within 48-72 hours. Monitor for side effects: Allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, adherence. Backup options: Clindamycin or cephalexin if allergy or intolerance present.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primarily include cold compresses applied to eyelid to reduce swelling and discomfort. Patient education: Importance of adherence to medication, signs of worsening infection, and proper eyelid hygiene. Lifestyle: Rest, avoiding further trauma, and elevating the head when resting. Behavioral: Encourage reporting any increase in fever, visual changes, or worsening swelling immediately.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up in 48-72 hours to evaluate response. Track symptom improvement, presence of pain, swelling, and any new symptoms. Seek immediate care if patient develops fever, visual changes, proptosis, or worsening pain as these may indicate orbital cellulitis. Assess response based on reduction in eyelid swelling and symptom resolution.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Use clear, empathetic language addressing the patient\u2019s anxious style by emphasizing the plan\u2019s rationale, normal expectations, and safety monitoring. Reassure that most cases improve with treatment and that prompt reporting of any new or worsening symptoms is crucial. Simplify instructions and confirm understanding. Address worries about complications and reassure about follow-up plans. Enhance adherence through written instructions and ensuring the patient feels supported and informed. Involve family if appropriate, to support compliance and observation.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: No immediate specialist referral needed unless symptoms deteriorate. Consider ENT or ophthalmology consultation if no improvement or progression occurs. Coordinate with nursing or pharmacy for medication education. Provide educational materials on eyelid hygiene and injury prevention. Check insurance coverage and affordability of prescribed antibiotics to optimize access.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating oral broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, with supportive measures like cold compresses and eyelid hygiene. Close outpatient follow-up within 48-72 hours is essential to monitor response and detect any signs of progression. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognizing warning signs, and proper eyelid care. This approach aims for efficient resolution of infection, symptom relief, and prevention of complications, while minimizing potential side effects and ensuring the patient\u2019s understanding and engagement in their care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Prescribe antibiotics, instruct on eyelid care, and educate about warning signs. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antibiotic course, monitor symptom improvement, and reassess at follow-up. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through eyelid hygiene and injury awareness, with ongoing observation if necessary. - Patient handout summary: Include medication instructions, signs of worsening infection, follow-up schedule, and eyelid hygiene tips.",
