    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate, as physical signs suggest cellul\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of soft tissue infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric oral antibiotics, such as cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 7-10 days, along with supportive measures like limb elevation and warm compresses. Diagnostic imaging (e.g., ultrasound or MRI) should be obtained promptly to confirm the presence of an abscess or evaluate for possible malignancy, given the patient's concern for giant cell sarcoma. If an abscess is identified, surgical drainage may be necessary. Regular follow-up within 48-72 hours is critical to assess treatment response and monitor for signs of worsening infection or systemic illness. Education will focus on recognizing warning signs requiring urgent care, medication adherence, and the importance of completing diagnostics. Coordination with specialists, including oncology, may be needed if malignancy is confirmed. This approach aims to resolve the infection effectively, ensure early detection of potential malignancy, and optimize the patient\u2019s functional recovery while minimizing progression or complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Measure temperature, conduct thorough physical exam, order diagnostic imaging, and start empiric antibiotics.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in swelling, warmth, and tenderness; confirm or rule out malignancy; ensure compliance with therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence, confirm definitive diagnosis, initiate appropriate oncologic treatment if necessary.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain signs of infection worsening, importance of medication completion, follow-up schedule, and diagnostic process.",
