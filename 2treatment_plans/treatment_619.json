    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment plan. First, I will confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity to determine urgency. Given the presentation and the biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, I consider this a confirmed malignancy requiring prompt evaluation. Severity classification depends on lesion size, invasion, and regional spread; generally, this appears to be localized but potentially invasive. Urgency is immediate to urgent, as untreated vulvar cancer can progress. Differential considerations include infectious and benign inflammatory lesions, but biopsy provides confirmation.  Next, I will base treatment on evidence-based guidelines, which recommend surgical excision as primary treatment for localized vulvar SCC. Additional treatments depend on stage; in early cases, wide local excision with clear margins is preferred. The rationale is high cure rates when detected early. Patient-specific factors include age, extent of disease, and emotional distress; some may influence surgical choices and support needs. Contraindications or cautions involve ensuring complete excision and avoiding overtreatment.  Pharmacological treatments are limited for localized solid tumors; thus, the mainstay is surgical. For advanced or unresectable cases, chemoradiation may be considered.  Non-pharmacological interventions involve surgical management, patient education about treatment options, wound care, and emotional support. Stress management and counseling are important given emotional distress.  Follow-up includes Regular physical exams every 3-6 months initially, with attention to recurrence signs, monitoring surgical site healing, and addressing psychosexual impacts. Patient should be informed about symptoms warranting immediate care (e.g., wound changes, bleeding, new lumps).  Communication should be clear, empathetic, and tailored to her storytelling style\u2014informing her step-by-step, allowing questions, and emphasizing collaborative care.  Coordination involves referral to gynecologic oncologists or vulvar surgeons, possibly planning multidisciplinary care if nodes or spread are suspected. Support groups and educational resources should also be offered.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision aiming for clear margins, possibly complemented by sentinel lymph node biopsy if indicated, to ensure complete removal of the lesion while preserving function. Additional treatments such as radiation or chemoradiation are considered if the tumor extends beyond early stages. Initial management focuses on confirming tumor staging through physical examination and imaging if necessary, followed by surgical intervention. Long-term management involves regular surveillance every 3-6 months, monitoring for recurrence, and providing emotional support to address distress. Patient education will emphasize wound care, recognizing signs of recurrence, and maintaining follow-up appointments. This approach aims to maximize the chance of cure, minimize the risk of recurrence, and support the patient's overall well-being, while carefully considering her emotional and informational needs.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange biopsy result review, initiate consultation with gynecologic oncology, and prepare for surgical assessment. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Perform surgical excision with margin assessment, ensure wound healing, and provide psychological support. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete staging workup, initiate follow-up schedule, and assess for any further treatments if necessary. - Patient handout summary: Clearly explain the diagnosis, treatment options, importance of follow-up, wound care instructions, and signs of recurrence for her to remember.",
