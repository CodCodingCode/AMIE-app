    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of severe congestive heart failure with hypoxemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate stabilization with oxygen therapy and inotropic support, careful monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, and preparation for potential advanced interventions such as mechanical circulatory support. Initial management focuses on rapid hemodynamic stabilization, optimizing oxygenation, and addressing underlying causes. Long-term care involves heart failure-specific medications, lifestyle modifications, and patient education to prevent recurrence and improve quality of life. Follow-up care will involve frequent reassessment of cardiac function, monitoring for signs of deterioration, and coordination with cardiology specialists. This approach aims to improve survival, preserve organ function, and enable the patient to recover functionally while minimizing risks associated with therapy.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate oxygen therapy, start IV inotropes (dobutamine), monitor vital signs and ECG, insert invasive hemodynamic monitoring if available.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stability, optimize pharmacologic therapy, evaluate for advanced support, and educate patient and family.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Implement heart failure regimen, optimize comorbidities, monitor for symptom remission or progression, and plan for possible device therapy or transplantation.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Your condition is a severe form of heart failure requiring urgent treatment. You will receive medications and supportive therapies to stabilize your heart function. Lifestyle changes and regular follow-up are essential for your recovery and long-term health.\"",
