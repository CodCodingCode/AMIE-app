    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Bartholin cyst\nJustification: The patient's description of a tender, slightly enlarging bump located on the outside, near the lower part of the labia, that is sometimes more tender after menstrual periods or sexual activity, is characteristic of a Bartholin cyst. These cysts commonly present as painless or tender swellings near the posterior aspect of the labia minora, often fluctuate with hormonal or activity-related changes. The absence of discharge, pus, foul smell, systemic symptoms, or signs of infection suggests a non-infected cyst rather than an abscess or other infectious process. The fact that the bump feels separate from surrounding tissues and has been stable for about two weeks aligns with typical presentation of a benign Bartholin cyst.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nBartholin cyst END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given that the patient has a Bartholin cyst characterized by a tender but non-infected swelling that has been stable for about two weeks, the initial management should focus on symptomatic relief and conservative observation. Since there are no signs of infection or abscess, antibiotic therapy is unnecessary at this stage. Non-pharmacological measures such as sitz baths can help reduce discomfort and promote drainage if the cyst enlarges or becomes infected later. If the cyst remains painful or enlarges significantly, minimally invasive procedures like incision and drainage or marsupialization might be considered, but these are typically performed by a specialist. In the current context, initiating simple symptomatic measures and monitoring would be appropriate for a primary care setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves recommending warm sitz baths several times daily to soothe the area and promote potential spontaneous drainage. Advise the patient to avoid sexual activity and irritants until symptoms resolve. If pain persists or the cyst enlarges, consider a prompt evaluation for possible incision and drainage or referral to a gynecologist for minor procedural management. Educate the patient to return if signs of infection develop (increased redness, swelling, pus, foul odor, fever) or if symptoms worsen. No antibiotics are indicated at this stage unless signs of infection or abscess formation are present."
