    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach. First, I need to confirm the diagnosis of congenital cyanotic heart disease, likely tetralogy of Fallot, based on clinical presentati\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of congenital cyanotic heart disease, likely tetralogy of Fallot, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt stabilization with oxygen therapy and careful assessment through echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate severity. An urgent referral to pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery should be initiated for surgical repair.\nInitial management focuses on maintaining adequate oxygenation, monitoring for hypoxemia, and supporting feeding and nutrition. Long-term management involves definitive surgical correction typically performed within the first few months of life, with ongoing cardiology follow-up to assess repair outcomes and monitor for complications. Caregiver education should emphasize recognizing cyanosis episodes, avoiding hypoxic triggers, and promptly seeking care if the infant exhibits increased distress or new symptoms.\nFollow-up care will include regular outpatient visits at intervals determined by the cardiologist, monitoring growth, development, and cardiac function, and planning for surgical intervention. Emphasis on family support, understanding the importance of surgical repair, and preparing them for postoperative care is essential.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate supplemental oxygen as needed, ensure clear communication with pediatric cardiology, and stabilize the infant\u2019s condition while arranging urgent echocardiography and specialist consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic evaluation, start preoperative planning, educate caregivers on signs of deterioration, and optimize nutrition and growth.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgical repair, monitor for complications, support developmental milestones, and provide ongoing outpatient follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the nature of the heart defect, importance of surgery, signs to watch for (e.g., increased cyanosis, difficulty breathing), and the need for regular follow-up to ensure long-term health.",
