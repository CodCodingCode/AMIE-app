    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. I am somewhat certain that the primary diagnosis is retinal detachment or tear, but the context mentions \"Choroidal haemorrhage or rupture\" as the gold standard, which suggests some uncertainty. Given recent trauma and visual disturbances, this is an urgent ophthalmic emergency. Severity likely ranges from moderate to severe because retinal detachment can threaten vision if not promptly addressed. The urgency level should be immediate, as delay could result in irreversible vision loss. Differential considerations include other ocular injuries such as choroidal hemorrhage, intraocular foreign bodies, or vitreous hemorrhage, which need to be monitored.  Now, selecting evidence-based treatment: The first-line treatment per guidelines for retinal detachment/tear is prompt ophthalmologic surgical consultation\u2014urgent repair is often necessary. Supportive evidence indicates that early surgical intervention within days to prevent progression of detachment yields the best visual outcomes. Patient-specific considerations include emotional distress and potential difficulty complying with follow-up, so reassurance and clear communication are important.  Pharmacological interventions are limited in this context; the mainstay is surgical management. However, medications like cycloplegics can help reduce pain and prevent posterior synechiae, and intraocular pressure may need monitoring.  Non-pharmacological interventions include restricting activities that increase intraocular pressure (e.g., heavy lifting, strenuous exercise), advising bed rest with head positioning if applicable, and eliminating any intraocular pressure-lowering drugs unless ocular hypertension is present.  Monitoring and follow-up are critical: The patient needs immediate ophthalmology referral today. Continued assessment of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and symptom progression. Watch for red flags such as increasing pain, further visual loss, or signs of choroidal hemorrhage.  Patient communication must acknowledge their emotional distress, explaining the urgency and treatment options empathetically, emphasizing that timely surgical intervention can improve outcomes.  Care coordination involves urgent ophthalmology referral, possibly to a retina specialist, and ensuring access to surgical facilities. Additional support might include counseling or patient support groups.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment or tear, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent ophthalmologic surgical consultation for possible retinal repair, as early intervention is crucial to preserve vision. Initial management focuses on immediate referral and activity restrictions to prevent further detachment, along with reassurance and emotional support. Follow-up care will include close monitoring for progression or complications, assessment of visual function, and adherence to post-operative instructions if surgery is performed. Patient education should emphasize recognizing warning signs and the importance of prompt care, while ensuring emotional support to alleviate distress. This approach aims to optimize visual outcomes while minimizing risks and facilitating long-term ocular health.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology referral; advise patient to avoid strenuous activity or intraocular pressure-increasing actions; provide symptomatic relief as needed. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical intervention; evaluate postoperative visual recovery; monitor for complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve the best possible visual acuity; stabilize retinal anatomy; adjust management based on recovery progress. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgency of treatment, activity restrictions, signs of worsening to watch for, and the importance of follow-up visits.",
