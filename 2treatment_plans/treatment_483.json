The treatment plan includes initiating anti-inflammatory therapy with NSAIDs such as indomethacin to control acute inflammation, along with supportive measures like rest, elevation, and cold packs. Careful monitoring of renal function and gastrointestinal side effects is essential given the patient\u2019s lead exposure history. Education on lifestyle modifications\u2014especially reducing purine-rich foods and lead exposure\u2014is also crucial. Follow-up should occur within 48-72 hours to assess responsiveness and prevent complications. Involving a rheumatologist for further assessment and managing potential recurrent episodes may be necessary. This approach aims to rapidly alleviate symptoms, prevent joint damage, and address underlying lead toxicity, with attention to safety and adherence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate NSAID therapy, advise rest and joint elevation, provide patient education. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain control, monitor renal function and gastrointestinal tolerance, reinforce lifestyle modifications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reduce frequency of gout attacks, minimize lead exposure, and evaluate for possible chelation therapy if indicated. - Patient handout summary: Key points about medication use, trigger avoidance, importance of follow-up, and recognizing warning signs requiring urgent care.",
