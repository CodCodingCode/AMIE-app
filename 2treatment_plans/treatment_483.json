    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis with episodic inflammatory flare, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating acetaminophen for pain relief, advocating for regular low-impact exercise, weight management, and patient education on disease understanding and activity modification. During flare-ups, intra-articular corticosteroids may be considered for symptom relief. Close follow-up in 4-6 weeks will monitor symptom progression and medication tolerance, with instructions to seek urgent care if signs of infection or worsening inflammation occur. Clear communication tailored to the patient's storytelling style will facilitate understanding and adherence. Long-term management focuses on functional improvement, minimizing flare frequency, and addressing comorbidities. This plan aims to enhance quality of life, reduce pain, and maintain joint function while carefully avoiding medications contraindicated for her profile.",
