    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Very high; clinical presentation strongly \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate hospital admission with rapid initiation of IV fluids\u2014starting with isotonic saline\u2014to correct dehydration, followed by continuous IV regular insulin infusion to normalize blood glucose and ketone levels. Electrolytes, particularly potassium, should be closely monitored and replaced as needed to prevent arrhythmias. Careful assessment and gradual correction of acidosis are essential, with ongoing monitoring of vital signs, mental status, and laboratory parameters. Patient education on insulin adherence, recognizing early symptoms of DKA, and long-term diabetes management should be provided as stabilization occurs. This approach is designed to rapidly resolve metabolic derangements, prevent complications such as cerebral edema, and set the stage for long-term diabetes care. Follow-up will involve endocrinology consultation, patient education, and development of a sustainable insulin regimen, with attention to psychosocial factors affecting adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospitalize patient, initiate IV fluids, start continuous insulin infusion, monitor electrolytes and vital signs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve metabolic normalization, educate patient on diabetes management, and establish a follow-up plan.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain glycemic control, prevent recurrent DKA, and integrate lifestyle modifications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of adherence to insulin therapy, recognize early warning signs, and reinforce regular follow-up with healthcare providers.",
