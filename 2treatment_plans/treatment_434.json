    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: The clinical presentation and preliminary imaging strongly suggest periosteal fibrosarcoma, but definitive diagnosis requires histopathological confirmation from a biopsy. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe, given the recent rapid growth, neurological symptoms, and potential nerve involvement, indicating an aggressive neoplasm with possible local invasion. - Urgency level: Immediate to urgent; early surgical intervention is often necessary for malignant soft tissue tumors with nerve involvement to prevent further neurological deficits and metastasis. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: other soft tissue sarcomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, or metastatic lesions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with wide margins is the primary definitive treatment for fibrosarcomas; adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated. - Supporting evidence: Complete surgical resection improves local control and survival; radiotherapy reduces local recurrence risk. - Patient-specific considerations: The nerve involvement and proximity to neurovascular structures necessitate multidisciplinary planning. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid incomplete resection, which increases recurrence risk; caution with neurologic preservation during surgery.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If needed, adjunctive medications may include pain management and possibly chemotherapy. - Primary medication choice: NSAIDs and neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin, for symptomatic relief. - Rationale for selection: NSAIDs for inflammation and pain; gabapentin for nerve pain and burning sensations. - Expected timeline for improvement: Within 1-2 weeks for symptom relief. - Key side effects to monitor: NSAIDs for gastrointestinal or renal issues; gabapentin for sedation or dizziness. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: opioids for severe pain, considering risks; other neuropathic agents like pregabalin.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest and symptom monitoring; gentle limb mobilization as tolerated. - Patient education priorities: Importance of early treatment, neurological symptom significance, potential for surgical intervention. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain overall health with balanced diet, avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques, supportive counseling for anxiety related to diagnosis.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks post-initial intervention, then regularly every 4-6 weeks until treatment stabilized. - Monitoring parameters: Tumor size, neurological deficits, pain level, wound healing post-surgery. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing weakness, sudden worsening of pain, new neurological deficits, signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, imaging to evaluate treatment effects and margins.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, simple language emphasizing the importance and urgency of treatment, ensuring understanding through open-ended questions. - Addressing patient concerns: Likely worries about surgery, nerve damage, and prognosis; provide reassurance and brief, factual explanations. - Adherence strategies: Reiterate the importance of follow-up, involve the patient actively in decision-making to foster trust. - Family involvement: With permission, involve family members in discussions to support adherence and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncologist for tumor excision, possibly neurosurgeon or nerve specialist for nerve preservation planning, radiation oncologist if radiotherapy is indicated. - Other healthcare team members: Oncology nurses, physiotherapists for post-operative rehab, pain management specialists. - Community resources: Educational materials on soft tissue tumors, support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage upfront, plan for potential surgical and radiotherapy costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of periosteal fibrosarcoma with nerve involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excision with adjunctive radiotherapy if indicated, supported by symptom management and vigilant follow-up. Initial management should prioritize confirming diagnosis via biopsy, planning multidisciplinary surgical intervention aiming for clear margins while preserving nerve function when possible. Symptomatic treatment includes NSAIDs and neuropathic pain agents like gabapentin, with close monitoring for side effects. Educate the patient about the importance of early treatment, potential risks, and the necessity of follow-up. Refer to surgical oncology and possibly neurosurgery for operative planning, and coordinate with radiation oncology if needed. Follow-up appointments should occur every 4-6 weeks initially, focusing on tumor progression, neurological status, and wound healing. Address patient concerns through empathetic, simple explanations, ensuring understanding and engagement in care. Family involvement should be encouraged to support adherence and emotional coping. This integrated plan aims to achieve optimal tumor control, preserve neurological function, and improve the patient's quality of life.",
