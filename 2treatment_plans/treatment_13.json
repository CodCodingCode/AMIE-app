    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nThe patient's presentation of ocular redness, eyelid swelling, thick yellow mucus discharge, and itching after exposure suggests bacterial conj\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical antibiotic therapy with fluoroquinolone eye drops (e.g., ofloxacin 0.3%) to be applied every 2 hours initially, then tapered as symptoms improve over 5-7 days. This will be complemented by eyelid hygiene with warm compresses, strict hand hygiene, and avoidance of eye rubbing to prevent transmission. Patient education will emphasize completing the full medication course, maintaining hygiene, and monitoring symptoms. Follow-up in 48-72 hours will assess treatment response, with instructions to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen. This approach aims for rapid symptom resolution, reduced contagiousness, and prevention of complications, while minimizing side effects and supporting the patient\u2019s understanding and adherence to treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe topical antibiotics, instruct on eyelid hygiene, and educate about hygiene measures.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, adherence to medication, and prevention of spread.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevention of recurrent infections and reinforcement of good ocular hygiene.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of completing antibiotics, hygiene practices, signs of worsening, and when to seek further care.",
