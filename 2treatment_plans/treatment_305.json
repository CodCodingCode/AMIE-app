    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute mixed lineage leukemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin under close hematologic monitoring, supportive care with transfusions and infection prophylaxis, and diligent follow-up with repeated labs and bone marrow assessment. This approach aims to induce remission while carefully managing potential side effects. Immediate actions today involve arranging hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment, ensuring supportive care resources are in place, and consulting hematology specialists. Short-term goals include completing induction therapy, monitoring for complications, and assessing treatment response within 2-4 weeks. Long-term management will focus on consolidative therapy, possible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and psychosocial support. Clear patient education on recognizing complications and adherence importance, combined with family involvement, will help optimize outcomes and safety.",
