    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to approach this complex presentation. First, confirm the certainty of the diagnosis of autoimmune blistering disease, such as Bullous Pemphigoid or Linear IgA Bullous Dermato\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of an autoimmune blistering disease, such as Bullous Pemphigoid or Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, managing secondary infections, and providing supportive wound care, with careful attention to the patient's immune deficiency and behavioral challenges. Initial management focuses on controlling disease activity and preventing complications, while establishing long-term management through regular follow-up and monitoring. Follow-up care will include close assessment of skin healing, systemic symptoms, and immune status, with clear instructions for the patient and caregivers regarding wound management, signs of infection, and medication adherence. This approach is designed to induce remission, minimize side effects, and improve quality of life while safeguarding the patient\u2019s immune health and ensuring sustainable long-term management of this condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence; start supportive skin wound care and infection prevention measures; consult dermatology and immunology specialists.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate first-line immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., systemic corticosteroids); monitor for response and side effects; provide caregiver education on wound care and infection signs.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease control and remission; stabilize immune function; minimize medication side effects; reinforce patient and caregiver understanding.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, skin and wound care, infection monitoring, and follow-up appointments.",
