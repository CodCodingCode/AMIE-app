    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Since the clinical presentation (acute onset of redness and tearing) aligns with viral conjunctivitis, and given the typical course, I am fairly certain of this diagnosis, though confirmation via ocular examination is essential. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are recent and primarily confined to redness and tearing without evidence of significant pain, visual impairment, or systemic illness. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but should be evaluated promptly to rule out other serious conditions. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, keratitis, or systemic autoimmune processes\u2014though less likely given the brief symptom duration.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care; symptomatic relief with artificial tears and education on hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited, and supportive care reduces symptoms and transmission risk. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's stoic_minimizer tendency suggests underreporting symptoms; thorough examination and patient education are crucial. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection is suspected; avoid touching or sharing towels to prevent spread.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prescribe preservative-free artificial tears, frequent application (e.g., every 1-2 hours as needed). - Rationale for selection: These provide symptomatic relief and help flush viral particles without side effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal, but advise on proper eye hygiene. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None typically necessary; if significant irritation persists, consider antihistamines or lubricants for comfort.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Good hand hygiene, avoiding touching eyes, and avoiding shared linens or towels. - Patient education priorities: Importance of hygiene in preventing spread, normal course of viral conjunctivitis, and when to seek further care. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, hydration, and maintaining eye cleanliness. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce adherence to hygiene practices and warn against eye rubbing.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days to assess symptom progression; sooner if worsening occurs. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity, development of pain, vision changes, or secondary infection signs. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, decreased vision, photophobia, or signs of systemic illness\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or progression within expected timeline.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, gentle reassurance emphasizing normalcy of symptoms and importance of hygiene. - Addressing patient concerns: Acknowledge her stoicism while gently emphasizing caution and monitoring. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, written summaries, and involve her in shared decision-making. - Family involvement: Not necessary unless the patient consents or if there are household exposures.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Not urgent; refer to ophthalmologist if symptoms worsen, or if atypical features develop. - Other healthcare team members: None immediately required. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about viral conjunctivitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Prescriptions are inexpensive; emphasize simple hygiene to minimize additional costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes advising supportive care with preservative-free artificial tears, emphasizing rigorous eye hygiene to prevent transmission, and close monitoring of symptoms. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and education, with a follow-up in 3-5 days to evaluate progress. I will ensure clear communication tailored to her stoic_minimizer style, emphasizing the self-limiting nature of the condition and the importance of hygiene. Monitoring will focus on symptom progression and warning signs requiring urgent care. This approach aims to facilitate symptom resolution while minimizing risks of secondary infection or complications, ensuring sustainable recovery and patient understanding.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on eye hygiene, prescribe artificial tears, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, no secondary infections, adherence to hygiene practices. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, reinforce hygiene education if needed. - Patient handout summary: Key points include symptom management, hygiene practices, signs warranting urgent care, and follow-up schedule.",
