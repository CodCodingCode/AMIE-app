    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressively worsening axial rigidity, muscle stiffness with episodes of locking, frequent falls, difficulty with fine motor tasks, increased muscle stiffness in hands, ocular motor disturbances (particularly difficulty looking up or down, eyelid drooping), speech difficulties, cognitive changes such as forgetfulness and confusion, and sleep disturbances (including movements like jumping or getting stuck) are characteristic features of PSP. The gradual progression and the worsening of eye movement problems further support this diagnosis, as PSP is known for early ocular motility impairment, especially vertical gaze palsy, along with axial rigidity and postural instability. The absence of significant urinary or bowel dysfunction helps differentiate PSP from some other Parkinsonian syndromes.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional tests like MRI might be needed for confirmation)\n- No further clarification needed: Yes (clinical features are characteristic, but imaging can confirm)\n\nANSWER:\nProgressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy characterized by postural instability, ocular motor abnormalities, and cognitive decline. Currently, there is no cure for PSP, and management focuses on alleviating symptoms, improving quality of life, and preventing complications. Pharmacological options are limited but may provide some benefit for certain symptoms; for example, limited responsiveness to levodopa has been observed, though benefits are often modest. Non-pharmacological strategies are crucial for addressing mobility issues, falls, speech difficulties, and cognitive changes. A multidisciplinary approach involving physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and caregiver support is essential. This approach aims to improve motor function, assist with swallowing and communication, and reduce fall risk. Given the progressive nature of PSP, regular monitoring for complications such as nutritional issues, mood disturbances, and worsening motor symptoms should be incorporated into the care plan.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this patient with PSP should include pharmacological management aimed at symptom relief, such as a trial of low-dose levodopa to assess for any motor benefit, recognizing that response may be limited. Importantly, underlying non-pharmacological interventions should be implemented: engage physical therapy to address balance, gait stability, and fall prevention; occupational therapy to assist with activities of daily living and recommend modifications to the home environment for safety; and speech therapy to evaluate and support swallowing and speech difficulties. Additionally, consider referring to a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative disease team for comprehensive care, and provide caregiver education and support resources. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression, manage emerging symptoms, and adjust interventions accordingly. The overall goal is to optimize functional independence and safety while managing symptoms as directly as possible."
