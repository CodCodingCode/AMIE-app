    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on presentation of vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain radiating to the back, and fetal concerns, consistent with placental abruption. - Severity classification: Severe, given the heavy bleeding, pain intensity, signs of hypovolemia (dizziness, weakness), and potential fetal compromise. - Urgency level: Immediate action required due to maternal hypovolemia risk and fetal distress. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Preterm labor, vasa previa, less likely placenta previa, but urgent ultrasound needed to clarify.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Stabilization with IV fluids, maternal monitoring, fetal assessment, and preparation for delivery if indicated. - Supporting evidence: Rapid maternal stabilization improves outcomes and reduces maternal and fetal morbidity; delivery is often necessary if abruption is severe. - Patient-specific considerations: Emotional distress, concern about fetal health, potential need for urgent delivery. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary interventions that could delay stabilization; careful monitoring of maternal bleeding and fetal status.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Intravenous isotonic fluids (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's), titrated to restore circulatory volume. - Rationale for selection: Immediate volume expansion to stabilize maternal hemodynamics. - Expected timeline for improvement: Hemodynamic stabilization should be evident within hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Signs of fluid overload, pulmonary edema. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Blood products if bleeding worsens and hemoglobin drops significantly.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Bed rest as tolerated, close monitoring of bleeding and fetal movement, and ensuring a calm environment. - Patient education priorities: Recognize signs of worsening bleeding or fetal distress, importance of timely reporting. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity, abstain from sexual intercourse, and ensure adequate hydration. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling to address anxiety, involve family for support.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Continuous maternal and fetal monitoring in hospital; reassess every 2-4 hours initially. - Monitoring parameters: Maternal vital signs, bleeding quantity, fetal heart rate monitoring, laboratory labs including hemoglobin/hematocrit. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing bleeding, abdominal pain worsening, reduced fetal movements, signs of maternal shock. - Treatment response assessment: Hemodynamic stability, reduction in bleeding, fetal heart rate patterns.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (worried_family_involved), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language, explaining each step and its purpose. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about maternal stabilization and fetal monitoring, discuss the likelihood of delivery if necessary. - Adherence strategies: Reiterate importance of reporting any changes immediately, involve family in learning about warning signs. - Family involvement: Include family members in updates and education to reduce anxiety and facilitate support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Immediate obstetric consultation, possible transfer to a higher-level facility with neonatal intensive care. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for continuous monitoring, neonatology if delivery imminent. - Community resources: Support groups for pregnant women experiencing complications, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure documentation of urgency for prompt coverage and support with logistics.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of placental abruption, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate stabilization, continuous monitoring, and preparation for possible urgent delivery. Initial management involves IV fluid resuscitation, maternal and fetal assessment, and close observation in a hospital setting. Key interventions include stabilizing maternal hemodynamics, monitoring bleeding and fetal well-being, and preparing for emergent delivery if maternal or fetal condition deteriorates. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs and engaging family support. Follow-up care involves regular reassessment, lab monitoring, and coordination with obstetric specialists. This plan aims to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes while minimizing risks associated with the condition.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Establish IV access, begin fluid resuscitation, perform urgent ultrasound, and continuous fetal monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Maternal stabilization, fetal assessment, and planning delivery if indicated. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure postpartum recovery, monitor for complications, and provide counseling/support. - Patient handout summary: Important signs to watch for, activities to avoid, and when to seek immediate care.",
