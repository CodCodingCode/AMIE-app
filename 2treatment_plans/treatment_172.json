    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical intervention with supportive management strategies. Immediate action involves promptly referring the patient to a pediatric ophthalmology or retina specialist for definitive surgical repair (e.g., scleral buckle, vitrectomy) to reattach the retina. Preoperative management focuses on maintaining calmness, avoiding activities that could worsen the detachment, and possibly using mydriatic drops for comfort.\nThe treatment plan includes patient and family education on the urgency of surgery, recognition of worsening symptoms, and post-operative care. Short-term goals include obtaining surgical intervention within 24-48 hours and ensuring the patient remains in a safe, stable condition. Long-term management centers around monitoring visual recovery, preventing complications such as secondary detachments, and providing visual rehabilitation support if needed.\nFollow-up will involve close ophthalmologic monitoring of retinal attachment status, intraocular pressure, and visual acuity. Key patient education points include the importance of immediate response to new symptoms and adherence to postoperative instructions. The approach aims to maximize the chance of visual preservation while minimizing risks associated with delayed treatment or secondary complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with ophthalmology; facilitate urgent referral; educate the patient and family; reinforce activity restrictions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair; monitor for complications; support recovery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Assess visual function; rehabilitate if necessary; schedule follow-up imaging and examinations.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of surgery, symptom monitoring, activity restrictions, and importance of follow-up care.",
