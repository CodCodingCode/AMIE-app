    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The girl's presentation includes several core features consistent with ASD, such as social withdrawal, shyness, and limited peer engagement, alongside profound sensory sensitivities to loud noises, bright lights, and textures. She exhibits early developmental delays, particularly in speech and understanding language, and has difficulty adapting to routines and changes. Her reactions to sensory stimuli and her internal feelings of discomfort and the desire to escape social situations further reinforce ASD diagnostic criteria. Although her symptoms may overlap with other conditions like social anxiety disorder, the combination of persistent sensory sensitivities, early developmental history, and social communication difficulties most strongly suggests ASD. The information collected is comprehensive enough to reach a confident diagnosis without residual uncertainty.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a comprehensive treatment plan should address the core deficits in social communication and behavioral flexibility, as well as sensory sensitivities. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early behavioral therapy\u2014including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)\u2014can help improve social skills, communication, and daily living skills. Sensory integration therapy may aid in managing sensory sensitivities and reducing distress caused by stimuli like loud noises and textures. Structured routines and visual supports can foster predictability and comfort for the individual. While pharmacological treatment is not curative, it may be beneficial for managing associated symptoms like anxiety, irritability, or hyperactivity if these significantly impair functioning. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be considered for anxiety or repetitive behaviors, and atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone or aripiprazole) may be used for severe irritability or aggression under careful monitoring. The primary care physician or psychiatrist should coordinate these interventions with specialists in ASD to tailor the approach to the patient\u2019s specific needs.\n\nANSWER: Initiate engagement with a multidisciplinary team that includes behavioral therapists experienced in autism interventions, occupational therapists for sensory integration, and speech-language therapy for communication delays. Implement consistent routines and visual supports at home and school to enhance predictability and reduce anxiety. Consider starting a trial of an SSRI, such as sertraline, if anxiety or repetitive behaviors are prominent, with close monitoring for side effects. If severe irritability or aggression is present and impairing, discuss the option of a short-term trial of an atypical antipsychotic like risperidone or aripiprazole, ensuring proper medical oversight. In addition, educate caregivers about sensory sensitivities and coping strategies, and promote participation in social skills groups where feasible. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to assess progress, refine interventions, and monitor medication response and tolerability."
