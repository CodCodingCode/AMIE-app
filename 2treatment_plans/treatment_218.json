    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; clinical presentation of redness, tearing, and swelling after trauma suggests traumatic conjunctivitis or minor corneal abrasion. However, given the recent activity and eye symptoms, trauma is more likely. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are recent and localized without signs of infection or perforation. - Urgency level: Routine care; persistent or worsening symptoms warrant follow-up, but immediate intervention isn't necessary unless vision changes or severe pain occur. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, conjunctivitis (viral, bacterial, allergic), intraocular injury, or other ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with topical lubricants and protective measures; avoid unnecessary antibiotics unless signs of infection. - Supporting evidence: Conservative management is effective for minor abrasions and traumatic conjunctivitis, promoting healing and preventing secondary infection. - Patient-specific considerations: No prior ocular issues; activity-related cause; baseline health status presumed stable. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical corticosteroids unless specific inflammation warrants; monitor for infection.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (preservative-free), 1-2 drops every 2-4 hours as needed. - Rationale for selection: Provides lubrication, relieves irritation, promotes epithelium healing. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within a few days; resolution typically in 1 week. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; ensure the patient for any worsening symptoms, or signs of infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin ointment) if secondary bacterial infection develops.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest eye, avoid rubbing, and protective eyewear during activity. - Patient education priorities: Proper eye hygiene, signs of worsening, when to seek urgent care. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity initially; use eye protection during sports. - Behavioral interventions: Emphasize adherence to follow-up and symptom monitoring.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, presence of increasing redness or pain. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, blurred vision, photophobia, or suggesting possible corneal perforation or other serious injury\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief, decreased redness, and tearing.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward, focusing on reassurance and expectations. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize the benign nature of minor trauma, importance of monitoring, and safety measures. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, set reminders, and verify understanding. - Family involvement: Not typically necessary unless patient has cognitive or health literacy concerns.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: If symptoms worsen or complications arise, refer to ophthalmology within 1 week. - Other healthcare team members: Not typically required for initial management. - Community resources: Provide eye safety and injury prevention info. - Insurance/cost considerations: Prescribe low-cost over-the-counter lubricants; discuss need for specialist if deterioration occurs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or minor corneal abrasion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes the use of preservative-free artificial tears for symptomatic relief, eye protection, and activity modification. Initial management focuses on providing comfort, preventing infection, and monitoring for severe symptoms. Follow-up in 48-72 hours is essential to ensure healing and identify any signs of complication. Patient education will emphasize the importance of eye protection, symptom monitoring, and prompt communication if symptoms worsen. This approach aims to promote rapid healing, minimize discomfort, and prevent secondary infections while maintaining patient safety and engagement.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Prescribe artificial tears, advise eye protection, and review warning signs. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, healing of any epithelial defect, and prevention of secondary infection. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with no residual effects, reinforced eye safety measures. - Patient handout summary: Importance of eye protection, use of lubricants, signs of worsening, and when to seek further care.",
