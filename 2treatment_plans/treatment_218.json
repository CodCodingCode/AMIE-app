    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based interventions with patient-centered strategies. The plan includes performing canalith repositioning maneuvers (e.g., Epley maneuver) to resolve current vertigo episodes, supplemented by short-term vestibular suppressants like meclizine if needed for symptom relief. Patient education on positional triggers, fall prevention, and safety will be prioritized. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy may be introduced if residual balance issues persist. Follow-up in 1-2 weeks is essential to assess symptom resolution and ensure no new neurological deficits emerge. The patient should be advised to avoid rapid head movements and to modify her environment to prevent falls. Coordination with specialists such as neuro-otologists or physical therapists will support her recovery, and support resources should be provided. This approach aims to reduce vertigo, enhance stability, and improve her quality of life while monitoring for any neurological changes.",
