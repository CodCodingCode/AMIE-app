    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Congenital Unilateral Cryptorchidism (Undescended Testis)\nJustification: The child has had a non-palpable testis since birth, with no history of hormonal treatment or previous descent, and no spontaneous descent observed. The physical examination suggests that the testis remains undescended. Since no other abnormalities or syndromic features are reported, this presentation fits with congenital cryptorchidism. The normal physical development and absence of other anomalies reduce the likelihood of syndromic or complex causes. This condition is common and usually diagnosed clinically by physical examination, and spontaneous descent by age 1 is possible, but in the absence of descent, intervention is often necessary. The lack of symptoms like pain or swelling argues against acquired causes or injury.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCongenital Unilateral Cryptorchidism END",
    "output": "THINKING: The child's diagnosis of congenital unilateral cryptorchidism indicates that the testes have not descended into the scrotum. Since spontaneous descent usually occurs within the first few months of life, persistent undescended testis after one year warrants intervention to prevent potential complications such as infertility and malignancy. The standard approach involves surgical correction, typically orchiopexy, which is aimed at repositioning the testis into the scrotum. Pharmacological treatments like hormonal therapy (e.g., hCG or GnRH analogs) are generally considered less effective in older children or when the testis has failed to descend spontaneously by this age, and they are not usually first-line in primary care settings. As such, the primary management should focus on timely referral for surgical evaluation. Non-pharmacological measures include routine follow-up assessments, tracking the condition, and parental education regarding the importance of surgical correction to prevent future complications.\n\nANSWER: The recommended treatment plan involves referring the child to a pediatric urologist or surgeon experienced in orchiopexy. Surgical correction should ideally be performed between 6 months and 18 months of age to minimize risks. In the interim, the primary care physician should monitor for any changes in the scrotal and inguinal areas, provide supportive counseling to the parents, and ensure comprehensive follow-up. Pharmacological intervention is generally not indicated at this stage, so the focus remains on timely surgical management to correct the cryptorchidism and mitigate future risks."
