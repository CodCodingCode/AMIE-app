    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Constitutional Delay of Puberty\nJustification: The patient is a female with some breast development and pubic hair, indicating some activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The absence of menarche at her age, coupled with normal growth and absence of dysmorphic features, suggests a normal variant of delayed puberty rather than a pathological process. It is common for girls with constitutional delay to have delayed puberty but otherwise develop normally without any significant underlying systemic or genetic disorder. The possibility of underlying syndromes (e.g., Turner syndrome) appears unlikely given the absence of dysmorphic features and normal growth, and no mention of other symptoms. The bone age assessment (if known) likely shows delayed skeletal maturity, supporting constitutional delay. This is a common, benign cause of delayed puberty in adolescents who develop normally otherwise.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nConstitutional Delay of Puberty END",
    "output": "THINKING: As the patient demonstrates some breast development and pubic hair with no menarche at her age, combined with normal growth and a lack of dysmorphic features, her presentation is consistent with constitutional delay of puberty. This is a benign, self-limited condition common in adolescents who develop normally but on a delayed timeline. The main goals are to monitor her development, ensure that puberty proceeds appropriately, and address any psychosocial concerns. Pharmacological intervention is generally not necessary unless the delay causes significant psychological distress or if there are other concerns such as abnormal findings suggestive of an underlying pathology. Education and reassurance are crucial, emphasizing that her pubertal development is within the normal spectrum of variation. If puberty does not initiate spontaneously within a reasonable time frame or if she experiences significant psychosocial impact, hormonal therapy with low-dose sex steroids can be considered under specialist supervision. Routine follow-up to monitor growth, development, and psychosocial well-being should be maintained.\n\nANSWER: The primary management involves reassurance and education about the normalcy of her development and the expected timing of puberty. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor progression of secondary sexual characteristics and growth parameters. If she exhibits persistent or worsening delay, or if psychosocial concerns arise, consider initiating low-dose testosterone (for girls, usually estrogen therapy) to induce puberty, initiated under endocrinology guidance. No immediate pharmacological treatment is indicated at this stage. Encourage maintenance of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. If there are any new concerns or if puberty does not progress over the next 6-12 months, refer to a pediatric endocrinologist for further assessment and management."
