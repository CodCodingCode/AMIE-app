    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given ocular redness, swelling, and blurry vision following physical activity; symptoms suggest conjunctivitis or episcleritis, but rule out more serious causes such as scleritis or infectious keratitis. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; patient reports minimal pain and no purulent discharge, but symptoms may be underestimated. Need detailed exam to confirm. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed for prompt assessment to prevent potential complications, especially considering visual symptoms. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Scleritis, infectious keratitis, or other ocular infections that require different treatment approaches.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: For episcleritis or mild conjunctivitis, might consider supportive care initially; if episcleritis is confirmed, topical vasoconstrictors or NSAID eye drops can be used. For conjunctivitis, artificial tears and hygiene are mainstays. - Supporting evidence: Episcleritis often resolves spontaneously, but NSAID drops or topical corticosteroids can hasten recovery. Conjunctivitis is generally self-limited; antibiotics are reserved for bacterial causes. - Patient-specific considerations: Her recent physical activity and emotional distress may influence inflammation, but overall, conservative management is preferred first. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid steroid eye drops unless confirmed episcleritis, and monitor for increased intraocular pressure or steroid side effects.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Prescribe topical NSAID drops (e.g., ketorolac 0.5%) twice daily for episcleritis; reassurance/supportive measures for conjunctivitis. - Rationale for selection: Effective for reducing inflammation with a favorable safety profile in mild cases. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms likely improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Local irritation, eyelid edema, and rare corneal toxicity; instruct patient to report worsening or new pain/discharge. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical corticosteroids if episcleritis worsens or does not respond and diagnosis confirmed, but generally used cautiously.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid strenuous activity, and minimize eye rubbing. - Patient education priorities: Explain the benign nature of episcleritis/conjunctivitis, importance of avoiding irritants, and importance of follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain eye hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing eyes, and manage emotional stress. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques or counseling if emotional distress affects perception of symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-7 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, absence of increased redness, pain, or discharge, and no new visual disturbances. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of pain, vision loss, eye severe pain, or purulent discharge requiring prompt ophthalmology referral. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, decreased redness/swelling, and patient-reported relief.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language to explain the diagnosis, expected course, and importance of adherence. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the benign nature but emphasize the need for follow-up to rule out more serious causes. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, explain rationale for medications, and schedule follow-up appointments. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for eye care and emotional reassurance if needed.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology referral if symptoms worsen, do not improve in 7 days, or if diagnostic uncertainty remains. - Other healthcare team members: Educate primary care team about signs of escalation. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about eye health and stress management. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs and ensure affordable options are available.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of episcleritis or conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical NSAID eye drops (e.g., ketorolac 0.5%) twice daily to reduce inflammation, coupled with supportive measures such as rest, avoiding eye rubbing, and maintaining eye hygiene. Patient education will focus on understanding the benign nature of the condition, signs of worsening (e.g., increased pain, vision change, purulent discharge), and the importance of follow-up within a week.  Monitoring will involve a re-evaluation in 3-7 days to assess symptom resolution and ensure no progression. The patient should seek immediate care if experiencing severe pain, rapid vision loss, or worsening symptoms. Additional management includes emotional support and reassurance given her distress, and consideration of ophthalmologic referral if no improvement or if diagnosis is uncertain. This plan aims for symptom resolution within a week, minimizes risks, and promotes long-term eye health and patient well-being.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Conduct a thorough ocular examination, confirm diagnosis, and initiate topical NSAID therapy. Provide eye hygiene instructions and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Resolution of redness and swelling, patient understands condition and prevention strategies, and no complications develop. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution, monitor for recurrence, and address emotional well-being as needed. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, signs warranting urgent care, proper eye care, and follow-up schedule.",
