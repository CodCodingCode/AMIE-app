    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on symptoms of hyperglycemia in a pregnant woman with known pre-existing type 2 diabetes. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe given persistent symptoms, abnormal vision, and recent symptoms suggesting metabolic decompensation. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed due to symptomatic hyperglycemia and potential risk for diabetic ketoacidosis or fetal compromise. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Gestational hypertensive disorders, infections, other neurological causes, eye pathology unrelated to diabetes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Immediate blood glucose stabilization with intravenous fluids and insulin therapy, and establishing close glucose monitoring. - Supporting evidence: Tight glycemic control improves maternal and fetal outcomes, reduces risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, and prevents further complications. - Patient-specific considerations: Pregnancy status necessitates insulin; mild hypoglycemia risk; emotional state may affect adherence. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid oral hypoglycemics that are contraindicated in pregnancy; monitor for hypoglycemia.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Initiate insulin therapy\u2014preferably rapid-acting insulin analogs (e.g., insulin lispro) prior to meals plus basal insulin (e.g., insulin detemir or glargine). - Rationale for selection: Insulin is the safest and most effective for glycemic control during pregnancy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Blood glucose levels should stabilize within hours to a day after insulin initiation. - Key side effects to monitor: Hypoglycemia, injection site reactions, cautious monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Adjust insulin regimen; consider adding or modifying basal-bolus doses; oral agents are generally avoided but may be considered under specialist guidance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Nutritional counseling emphasizing carbohydrate management, small frequent meals, adequate hydration. - Patient education priorities: Recognize hyperglycemia symptoms, insulin administration techniques, fetal movement monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain safe physical activity as tolerated, sleep hygiene, stress reduction. - Behavioral interventions: Psychological support or counseling for managing anxiety and family concerns, referral to diabetes educator.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: In-hospital or clinic reassessment within 24-48 hours; outpatient visits every 1-2 weeks until stable. - Monitoring parameters: Blood glucose levels (pre-meal and post-meal), ketone testing if hyperglycemia persists, fetal well-being assessments, HbA1c after stabilization. - Red flag symptoms: Signs of ketoacidosis (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing), worsening vision, labor signs, or fetal distress. - Treatment response assessment: Achieving target glucose levels (generally fasting 60-90 mg/dL, postprandial <120 mg/dL), reduction in symptoms, fetal well-being.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic explanations; involve family members respectfully; provide reassurance. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize that hyperglycemia is manageable with appropriate treatment and that her and the fetus's health are priorities. - Adherence strategies: Simplify insulin regimen if possible, schedule regular follow-up, provide written instructions and contact info. - Family involvement: Encourage family participation in education sessions, support system, and decision-making.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Maternal-fetal medicine specialist for fetal assessment and management during pregnancy. - Other healthcare team members: Diabetes educator, nutritionist, possibly a mental health professional. - Community resources: Prenatal support groups, diabetes education programs, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assess coverage for insulin, testing supplies; facilitate access to necessary medications and education.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of uncontrolled hyperglycemia in a pregnant woman with pre-existing type 2 diabetes, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent metabolic stabilization with ongoing diabetes management tailored for pregnancy. Immediate actions include initiating insulin therapy to rapidly control blood glucose, providing patient education on insulin administration and diet, and close monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being. In the short term (next 1-4 weeks), focus on achieving glycemic targets, adjusting insulin doses, and ensuring proper nutrition. Long-term management (3-6 months) aims to maintain stable blood glucose levels, optimize fetal growth, and prevent complications. Follow-up includes regular blood glucose testing, fetal assessments, and multidisciplinary team involvement. This structured plan aims to improve maternal and fetal outcomes while minimizing risks associated with uncontrolled diabetes.",
