    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the presentation of headache\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating prompt empiric IV antibiotics\u2014ceftriaxone and vancomycin\u2014while providing supportive care such as hydration and neurological monitoring. Immediate management focuses on stabilizing the patient and preventing neurological complications. Long-term management involves close follow-up to monitor clinical response, manage any neurological deficits, and provide education to prevent future risks. This approach aims to rapidly control infection, minimize risks of residual neurological damage, and ensure sustainable recovery, all tailored to the patient's age and recent measles history.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer empiric IV antibiotics promptly, establish IV access, monitor vital signs and neurological status continuously, and perform initial laboratory assessments including blood cultures.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical stabilization, monitor for adverse effects, adjust antibiotics based on culture results, and assess neurological recovery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete the antimicrobial course, monitor for potential neurological sequelae, and ensure complete recovery through follow-up visits and supportive therapies.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of early antibiotic treatment, close monitoring, and follow-up; encourage hydration and rest; inform about potential neurological signs requiring urgent care.",
