    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: I am quite certain that the episodic visual disturbances preceding the headache are consistent with migraine with aura given the described aura features. However, given the patient's hesitant reporting and the possibility of underreported neurological symptoms, I remain cautious. - Severity classification: Likely moderate, considering the frequent occurrence and associated dizziness and nausea, but without additional neurological deficits or severe dysfunction reported. - Urgency level: Routine care is appropriate, but urgent evaluation is necessary if new neurological deficits or persistent aura symptoms occur. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: other neurological issues like transient ischemic attacks or other visual or neurological disturbances.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Pharmacologic prophylaxis for frequent migraines and acute management of attacks. - Supporting evidence: Evidence supports use of medications like CGRP inhibitors or beta-blockers for prevention; NSAIDs and triptans for acute attacks. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's vague reporting necessitates detailed history and possibly lifestyle modifications; contraindications include any cardiovascular comorbidities. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid triptans if there are cardiovascular risks; monitor for medication overuse headache.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: For acute attacks, NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 6-8 hours as needed); for prevention, a low-dose beta-blocker such as propranolol 40 mg BID. - Rationale for selection: NSAIDs are effective for symptom relief; propranolol is well-supported for migraine prophylaxis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within hours for acute; prophylactic benefits over 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: For NSAIDs\u2014gastric irritation, renal function. For beta-blockers\u2014heart rate, blood pressure, bronchospasm. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Triptans for acute attacks if appropriate; amitriptyline or topiramate for prevention.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Consistent sleep schedule, hydration, avoiding known triggers (stress, certain foods). - Patient education priorities: Recognize aura, when to seek urgent care, medication use, trigger management. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep, stress reduction techniques (mindfulness, biofeedback), healthy diet. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy if stress-related factors prominent.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 4 weeks to evaluate treatment efficacy and tolerability. - Monitoring parameters: Frequency, severity of attacks, aura episodes, side effects from medications. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening, new neurological deficits, prolonged aura, persistent neurological symptoms, or changes in aura pattern. - Treatment response assessment: symptom diaries, patient-reported outcome scales.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language, emphasizing routine over complex details to match patient's confused chronology style. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety and effectiveness of treatments, clarify the importance of adherence. - Adherence strategies: Provide written summaries, set reminders, involve family if possible. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve trusted family members to support adherence and recognition of warning signs.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Consider referral to neurology if episodes persist, worsen, or if diagnosis remains uncertain. - Other healthcare team members: Educate primary care team, consider involving behavioral health for stress management. - Community resources: Migraine support groups, educational websites. - Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm medication costs and access, suggest generic options where available.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of migraine with aura, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs for acute attack relief and starting a prophylactic agent such as propranolol to reduce attack frequency. Lifestyle modifications, including sleep hygiene, hydration, trigger avoidance, and stress management, are essential. The plan emphasizes patient education on recognizing aura, medication use, and when to seek urgent care. Follow-up is scheduled in four weeks to evaluate response, with ongoing monitoring of symptoms and side effects. This approach aims to reduce attack frequency and severity, improve quality of life, and prevent complication escalation while minimizing medication-related risks.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about migraine patterns and trigger avoidance, start NSAID for acute relief if currently experiencing an attack. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate prophylactic therapy, establish symptom and trigger diaries, reinforce lifestyle recommendations. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduced frequency and intensity of migraines, evaluate medication tolerability, consider adjustments based on response. - Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding migraine aura, medication use instructions, trigger management, importance of adherence, and when to seek urgent care.",
