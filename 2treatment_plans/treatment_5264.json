    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes significant social communication deficits (minimal eye contact, limited interest in engaging with others, lack of meaningful speech development), repetitive behaviors (hand-flapping, rocking), strict routines, and sensory sensitivities\u2014all characteristic features consistent with ASD. Additionally, developmental delays in speech, motor skills (late sitting, inconsistent crawling), and narrow interests further support this diagnosis. The presence of behaviors like lining up toys and distress when routines are altered are also classic signs. Although some motor delays are noted, they are common in ASD presentations. The complexity and combination of these behavioral, developmental, and sensory features strongly suggest ASD rather than other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The child's presentation of ASD with significant social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, and developmental delays indicates the need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as early behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis), speech therapy, and occupational therapy, are fundamental to address communication challenges, reduce repetitive behaviors, and improve adaptive skills. Establishing routines and sensory accommodations in the child's environment can also help reduce distress and improve functioning. Pharmacological treatment may be considered if there are associated symptoms such as severe irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, or anxiety that interfere with therapy or daily functioning. In such cases, medications such as risperidone or aripiprazole are FDA-approved for irritability in ASD and can be initiated under careful monitoring. Overall, the treatment plan should be tailored to the child's specific needs, emphasizing early intervention and supportive therapies to optimize developmental outcomes.\n\nANSWER: Initiate early intervention with comprehensive behavioral therapy, such as Applied Behavior Analysis, along with speech and occupational therapy to improve communication, adaptive skills, and reduce repetitive behaviors. Engage the family in training to support routines and sensory sensitivities. Monitor the child's behaviors and emotional well-being regularly. If significant irritability, aggression, or hyperactivity are observed and interfere with participation in therapies or daily activities, consider the cautious initiation of pharmacological treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole, starting at low doses and titrating carefully while monitoring for side effects. Coordinate with specialists such as developmental pediatricians or child psychiatrists for ongoing assessment and management."
