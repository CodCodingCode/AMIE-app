    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)\nJustification: The clinical presentation of sudden, painless vision loss in one eye combined with symptoms such as scalp tenderness, headache around the temple, jaw claudication, and a history of systemic symptoms like fatigue and feeling hot/chilly strongly suggest giant cell arteritis. The patient\u2019s scalp tenderness and jaw pain are characteristic of cranial ischemic symptoms, and the presence of high blood pressure and cardiovascular history increases the risk for vascular inflammatory processes. The rapid progression of vision loss in one eye aligns with ischemic optic neuropathy caused by inflammation of the temporal arteries in GCA. No systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss are currently reported, but they are often absent initially or may be subtle, especially in early stages. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent contralateral eye involvement and systemic complications.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nGiant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis), immediate treatment is critical to prevent further visual loss and systemic complications such as stroke or aortic aneurysm. The characteristic presentation of sudden painless vision loss, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and systemic symptoms strongly supports this diagnosis. Since GCA can cause irreversible blindness if not promptly managed, swift initiation of corticosteroid therapy is essential even before biopsy results confirm the diagnosis. Non-pharmacological measures such as patient education about the importance of adherence to therapy, monitoring for side effects, and scheduling further diagnostic confirmation with temporal artery biopsy are also important. Monitoring for systemic involvement and adjusting treatment accordingly should be part of ongoing care. \n\nANSWER: The primary treatment should involve initiating high-dose corticosteroids immediately, such as oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (commonly 60 mg daily), to rapidly reduce arterial inflammation and prevent further visual deterioration. An urgent referral to ophthalmology and rheumatology for further assessment, including a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, is recommended. In addition to corticosteroids, adjunctive measures include recommending low-dose aspirin (81-162 mg daily) to decrease the risk of ischemic complications, if not contraindicated. The patient should be counseled about potential side effects of steroids and monitored regularly for response and adverse effects, with dose tapering guided by clinical response and biopsy results. Long-term management may involve gradual corticosteroid tapering and consideration of steroid-sparing agents if prolonged therapy is needed."
