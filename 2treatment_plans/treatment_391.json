The initial step is urgent wide local excision of the lesion with appropriate margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy to assess regional spread, followed by histopathological staging. Postoperative management involves closely monitoring wound healing, regional lymph nodes, and signs of recurrence during regular follow-up intervals. Patient education should focus on sun safety, skin self-examination, and recognizing signs of recurrence. Additional interventions include referral to a melanoma specialist or multidisciplinary team for staging and consideration of systemic therapy if advanced disease is identified. Efforts should be made to ensure the patient understands the importance of adherence to follow-up schedules and lifestyle modifications to reduce risk of further skin cancers. This approach aims to maximize survival outcomes, minimize risks, and promote long-term skin health.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent surgical consultation for wide excision and staging; educate the patient about the diagnosis and urgency.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision with clear margins, perform pathology assessment, and initial follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ongoing surveillance for recurrence, management of any adjuvant therapies, and reinforcement of sun safety behaviors.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of early surgery, regular skin exams, sun protection, and scheduled follow-up visits.",
