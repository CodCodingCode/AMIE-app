    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Non-obstructive azoospermia (testicular failure or primary testicular pathology)\nJustification: The patient, a 29-year-old male with azoospermia confirmed on semen analysis, reports no history of testicular infections, trauma, or surgeries, and physical examination of the testes is normal. These findings make obstructive causes less likely. The absence of abnormalities on physical exam suggests testicular development and structure are intact. Since the patient is willing to undergo hormonal testing, measuring serum FSH, LH, and testosterone would help clarify whether the azoospermia is due to primary testicular failure (likely elevated FSH and LH with low-normal testosterone) or obstructive causes (normal hormone levels). The overall presentation points toward a non-obstructive etiology, which is common in cases with azoospermia and normal physical exam findings.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nNon-obstructive azoospermia (testicular failure or primary testicular pathology) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of non-obstructive azoospermia indicating primary testicular failure or pathology, the primary goal is to evaluate potential options for fertility. Since the physical examination is normal and no obstructive cause is suspected, initial management should focus on confirming the hormonal profile through serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels. This will help determine the underlying testicular function. Pharmacological interventions such as hormonal therapy (e.g., menotropins or hCG) are generally not indicated unless hormonal evaluation suggests a modifiable endocrine imbalance; however, their efficacy in primary testicular failure is limited. Non-pharmacological options include counseling about the prognosis of fertility, discussing assisted reproductive techniques (ART) such as testicular sperm extraction (TESE) combined with assisted reproductive methods like IVF with ICSI, which can achieve biological paternity in some cases. Reflexively, if hormonal assessment indicates an abnormal endocrine profile, tailored hormonal therapy might be considered, but for primary testicular failure, the mainstay is discussing ART options. A referral to a reproductive urologist or fertility specialist is advisable for further assessment and planning.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should order serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels to confirm testicular function status. Regardless of hormonal results, the patient should be counseled about the limited natural fertility prognosis related to primary testicular failure and referred to a reproductive specialist for discussion of assisted reproductive options, such as testicular sperm extraction combined with IVF/ICSI. Supportive care may include psychological counseling to address emotional impacts related to infertility. Pharmacological treatments are generally not indicated in cases of primary testicular failure unless hormonal abnormalities are identified that could be modified, but the emphasis should be on reproductive planning and support."
