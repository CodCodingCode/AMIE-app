    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a low-dose atypical antipsychotic such as risperidone 0.5-1 mg daily, along with psychoeducation about symptoms, stress reduction, and lifestyle modifications. Close follow-up is essential, with reassessment in 2 weeks and ongoing monitoring of symptoms and side effects. Behavioral interventions like CBT and involvement of mental health specialists are advisable to support recovery and relapse prevention. Communication should be transparent and collaborative, emphasizing the temporary nature of brief psychosis and the importance of adherence. Coordination with psychiatric services and community resources will optimize support and long-term stability, aiming for symptom resolution and improved functioning while minimizing side effects and addressing patient concerns.",
