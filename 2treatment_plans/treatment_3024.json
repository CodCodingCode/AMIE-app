    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Insomnia Disorder with possible underlying Anxiety or Mood component\nJustification: The patient's primary complaints include persistent difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening, and non-refreshing sleep, consistent with insomnia. The described daytime symptoms\u2014fatigue, \"out of it,\" headache, irritability, and mood fluctuations\u2014are common in chronic insomnia. Additionally, the patient's worries, restlessness at night, and difficulty quieting the mind suggest underlying anxiety that may perpetuate sleep issues. The absence of significant changes in appetite, weight, or pervasive depressive symptoms makes primary mood disorders like depression less likely as the primary diagnosis. The variability and triggers\u2014like exertion and sleep deprivation\u2014support a diagnosis of primary insomnia possibly influenced or maintained by anxiety.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nInsomnia Disorder with underlying Anxiety features\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Insomnia Disorder with potential underlying anxiety components, the treatment approach should prioritize addressing both sleep difficulties and anxiety symptoms through a combination of sleep hygiene, behavioral interventions, and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. Non-pharmacological measures are essential as first-line therapy, including establishing a consistent sleep schedule, creating a calming bedtime routine, and avoiding stimulating activities before bed. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is highly effective and should be recommended if accessible, as it targets maladaptive thoughts and behaviors that maintain insomnia. Additionally, since anxiety appears to contribute to sleep disturbance, relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or brief anxiety management strategies should be incorporated. Pharmacological options may be considered for short-term use if sleep remains severely impaired or if anxiety symptoms are significantly distressing, with medications such as a low-dose sedative-hypnotic (e.g., zolpidem or zaleplon) or an antidepressant with sedative properties (e.g., trazodone) in a cautious, limited-duration manner. Importantly, any pharmacologic intervention should be used judiciously to minimize dependency and side effects, with close monitoring.\n\nANSWER: The initial treatment plan should focus on non-pharmacological strategies, including educating the patient on sleep hygiene practices\u2014such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and screens before bedtime, and creating a comfortable sleep environment. Recommending cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is advisable to address maladaptive sleep thoughts and behaviors. Incorporating relaxation techniques like mindfulness, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce nighttime restlessness and anxiety. If sleep difficulties persist or are severely impairing daytime functioning, a short course of medication such as low-dose zolpidem or trazodone may be considered for immediate relief, used sparingly and for the shortest duration necessary. Follow-up should focus on evaluating sleep patterns and anxiety symptoms, reinforcing sleep-only medication use if prescribed, and considering referral for specialized CBT-I or mental health support if needed."
