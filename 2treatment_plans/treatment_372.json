    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation and confi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of optic neuritis (perineuritis of the optic nerve), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent vision loss, followed by a tapering course of oral steroids. This approach aims to speed recovery and preserve visual function. Concurrently, I will provide detailed patient education about the disease process, treatment expectations, and side effect monitoring. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to assess response, monitor for steroid side effects, and coordinate further neurological evaluation for underlying causes such as multiple sclerosis. Supportive interventions, lifestyle modifications, and family involvement will be emphasized to optimize outcomes. This holistic plan is intended to maximize recovery, minimize risks, and establish a foundation for long-term management of this condition.",
