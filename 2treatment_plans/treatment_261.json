    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Heart Failure with Volume Overload, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a loop diuretic such as furosemide to alleviate volume overload, along with careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. Non-pharmacological interventions emphasize sodium and fluid restrictions, elevation of legs, and education on symptom recognition. Follow-up in 1-2 weeks is crucial to assess response, with ongoing monitoring of symptoms, weight, vitals, and labs. Communication should be empathetic and clear to ensure understanding and adherence, and early cardiology referral is essential for further treatment optimization. This approach aims to improve symptom control, prevent progression, and enhance quality of life while minimizing risks.",
