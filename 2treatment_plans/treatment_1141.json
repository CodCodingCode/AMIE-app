    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Parkinson's disease\nJustification: The patient exhibits progressive motor symptoms including bradykinesia (difficulty climbing stairs, difficulty rising from sitting), resting tremor, muscle stiffness (rigidity), and a voice or facial expression change, all of which are characteristic features of Parkinson's disease. The progression over several years aligns with the typical course of the disease. The self-consciousness about facial appearance may reflect hypomimia, common in Parkinson's. While symptoms such as weakness can sometimes suggest atypical Parkinsonian syndromes or other neurodegenerative disorders, the combination of tremors at rest, rigidity, and progression over time strongly points toward Parkinson's disease as the most probable diagnosis. Additional features like sensory symptoms are not prominent here, and no signs suggest alternative diagnoses like multiple sclerosis, ALS, or cerebellar ataxia.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nParkinson's disease END",
    "output": "THINKING: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. The management goal is to improve functional mobility, reduce symptoms, and enhance quality of life. Pharmacological treatment, typically with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, is the cornerstone of therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions, including patient education, physical therapy, and fall prevention strategies, are essential adjuncts to optimize function and safety. Early initiation of medication can significantly improve motor symptoms and help maintain independence, while non-pharmacological strategies support overall well-being. Since this is a primary care or psychiatric setting, a practical, evidence-based plan focusing on initiating pharmacotherapy and recommending supportive measures is appropriate.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with initiating pharmacological therapy using levodopa-carbidopa to manage motor symptoms effectively, tailoring the dosing to the patient's response and tolerability. In addition, consider prescribing a dopamine agonist (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) as adjunct therapy if necessary. Encourage the patient to participate in physical therapy focused on gait and balance to minimize fall risk and maintain mobility. Educate the patient about lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and routines for daily activities. Review and monitor for medication side effects, such as dyskinesias or orthostatic hypotension. Regular follow-up to assess treatment efficacy and adjust medications accordingly should be scheduled. Lastly, provide support and education about disease progression, recognizing the importance of multidisciplinary involvement as needed."
