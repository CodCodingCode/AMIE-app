    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; subconjunctival hemorrhage is common after trauma but requires confirmation that no other injury exists. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as subconjunctival hemorrhage typically causes localized redness and swelling without significant vision impairment or pain. - Urgency level: Routine care needed unless visual changes or pain develop. Immediate action if vision loss, severe pain, or signs of globe rupture. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, orbital fracture, intraocular foreign body, or retinal injury if symptoms worsen.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation with symptomatic management; usually no specific medical therapy needed for subconjunctival hemorrhage. - Supporting evidence: Most cases resolve spontaneously within 1-2 weeks; interventions focus on alleviating discomfort. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient engaged in strenuous activity (soccer), watch for re-injury, ensure no other ocular injury. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid NSAIDs if bleeding is ongoing or if there's concern for bleeding tendency; ensure no signs of more severe trauma.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears or lubricating eye drops for comfort, e.g., preservative-free artificial tears four times daily. - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive, safe, reduces irritation. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief typically within a few days; hemorrhage resolves in 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: No significant side effects, just ensure no adverse reactions in eye or systemic. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines or mild corticosteroids if inflammation or discomfort persists and no contraindications.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid rubbing the eye, limit strenuous activity that risks further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Signs of worsening condition, importance of protecting the eye, avoiding cross-contamination. - Lifestyle modifications: Use eye protection during sports, keep head elevated when resting to reduce intraocular pressure. - Behavioral interventions: Educate on proper eye hygiene and prompt reporting of new symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, absence of additional symptoms like pain or vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, vision loss, nausea/vomiting, or signs of globe rupture require immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in redness, discomfort, and no new symptoms at follow-up.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language with visual aids if possible; emphasize reassurance about the benign nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about healing, address fears of vision damage, discuss activity restrictions. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, confirm understanding, encourage questions. - Family involvement: With consent, involve family members to support adherence and provide reassurance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen, no improvement, or if signs of other injury. - Other healthcare team members: Educate on eye safety, possibly involve sports medicine if recurrent trauma. - Community resources: Eye safety education programs; support groups for eye injury. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to prescribed eye drops, follow-up appointments; provide cost-effective options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of trauma-related conjunctival injury (likely subconjunctival hemorrhage), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes observation with symptomatic relief using artificial tears, patient education on signs of worsening, and activity modifications to prevent further trauma. No antibiotics or systemic treatments are generally indicated unless atypical features arise. Close follow-up in 1-2 weeks is essential to ensure resolution and to monitor for any signs of additional ocular injury. Clear communication tailored to the patient's information-withholder style involves simple explanations, reassurance, and written instructions. Coordination with ophthalmology is advised if symptoms do not improve or if any red flag symptoms occur. This approach aims to promote healing, preserve eye health, and minimize anxiety or unnecessary interventions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate patient on injury, prescribe lubricating eye drops, advise rest and activity modification, and schedule follow-up in 1-2 weeks. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, healing of subconjunctival hemorrhage, reassurance of recovery. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure no secondary ocular injury, reinforce eye safety during sports, and prevent recurrence. - Patient handout summary: Key points about injury, signs to watch for, medication use, activity restrictions, and follow-up plan.",
