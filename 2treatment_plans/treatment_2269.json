    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Peripheral neuropathy, likely with a predominant demyelinating component such as Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive distal limb symptoms over several years\u2014including tingling, burning sensations, and weakness affecting fine motor skills\u2014suggests a peripheral nerve process. The spread of abnormal sensations upward and worsening with activity are characteristic of a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. The symptoms' progression and the presence of foot pain and sensory disturbances point towards a demyelinating process, especially CIDP, which often presents with symmetrical distal weakness and sensory deficits. The absence of spine or brain symptoms reduces likelihood of central causes. No mention of systemic illness or acute onset makes other causes less likely, and the gradual progression aligns with CIDP rather than an acute neuropathy.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nPeripheral neuropathy, likely CIDP\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, likely CIDP, the treatment approach should aim to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response responsible for demyelination. CIDP is typically responsive to immunomodulatory therapies, and early initiation can help prevent further nerve damage and improve function. Non-pharmacological measures, such as physical therapy, can support strength and coordination, prevent contractures, and improve quality of life. Since CIDP often requires specialized treatment, coordination with neurology is ideal, but primary care physicians or psychiatrists can initiate certain therapies if specialist input is unavailable. Pharmacologically, corticosteroids are a mainstay and relatively straightforward to start in primary care, with careful monitoring for side effects. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is also highly effective but may require referral or collaboration with neurology for administration. Plasma exchange is another option but less commonly initiated outside specialized centers. Symptomatic treatments, such as analgesics for nerve pain, can be added as needed. Overall, early immunomodulation combined with supportive therapies offers the best chance for stabilization or improvement.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy, such as prednisone, to suppress the immune-mediated demyelination after consultation with neurology. The patient should be referred to neurology for further evaluation, including confirmatory testing like nerve conduction studies, and consideration of IVIG therapy if indicated. In addition, recommend engaging physical therapy to maintain muscle strength, coordination, and prevent contractures. Symptomatic management of neuropathic pain with agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin can be added if pain persists. Regular monitoring for treatment response and side effects is essential, and the patient should be closely followed for progression or improvement. Coordination with neurology will optimize immunotherapy choices and adjust treatment as needed."
