    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Panic Disorder with somatic symptoms (including sensory disturbances and physiological sensations such as dizziness, heart racing, and tingling)\nJustification: The patient's episodes are characterized by sudden onset of intense physical sensations\u2014shakiness, dizziness, heart racing\u2014particularly triggered by emotional stress or anxiety, with episodes occurring multiple times weekly. The sensation profile is typical of panic attacks, often accompanied by fears of passing out and temporary cognitive fuzziness. The absence of chest pain, difficulty breathing, weakness, or loss of consciousness diminishes suspicion for medical emergencies such as cardiac arrhythmias or neurological events. The pattern of heightened symptoms in stressful situations, especially at school, aligns with panic attacks linked to anxiety. The episodic nature, duration, and sensory symptoms support this diagnosis over other conditions such as seizure disorders, hyperthyroidism, or neurological causes.\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nPanic Disorder with somatic symptoms END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Panic Disorder with somatic symptoms, a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication can be effective. CBT is considered first-line treatment, especially for panic attacks, as it helps patients identify and challenge maladaptive thoughts, reduce avoidance behaviors, and develop coping strategies. Pharmacologically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are preferred due to their efficacy and tolerability, and they are often started at a low dose with gradual titration. Initiating therapy should be done alongside patient education about the disorder, reassurance that their symptoms are manageable, and instruction on breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to help mitigate acute episodes. This approach is practical for primary care or psychiatry settings and can be tailored based on patient response and preferences.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include starting the patient on an SSRI, such as sertraline or paroxetine, with careful monitoring for side effects and dose adjustments over several weeks. Psychotherapy should be initiated concurrently, focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies to manage anxiety and panic symptoms. Patient education about the nature of panic attacks and reassurance about the benign course of the disorder are essential. Additionally, teaching relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness exercises can help reduce the frequency and severity of episodes. Regular follow-up is important to assess treatment response, facilitate medication adjustments, and support the patient's recovery journey."
