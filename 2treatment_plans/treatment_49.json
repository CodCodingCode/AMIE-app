    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia-induced syncope, specifically related to asystolic cardiac arrest, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt implantation of a permanent pacemaker to prevent recurrence of bradyarrhythmia, supported by thorough arrhythmia monitoring via an implantable device. This intervention aims to restore stable heart rhythm and prevent future syncope or arrest episodes. Initial management focuses on immediate device placement and continuous monitoring, while long-term strategies involve follow-up assessments and patient education to ensure adherence and early detection of potential complications. Follow-up care will include device interrogation, symptom review, and supportive counseling for lifestyle modifications. This approach is designed to improve patient safety, prevent sudden cardiac events, and promote long-term cardiac stability while minimizing procedural risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange for urgent cardiology and electrophysiology consultation; prepare for pacemaker implantation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete device implantation; monitor for complications; educate the patient on device operation and symptom recognition.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular follow-up visits for device checks; optimize lifestyle; reassess cardiac status.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of the pacemaker, adherence to follow-up, recognition of warning signs, and lifestyle modifications for heart health.",
