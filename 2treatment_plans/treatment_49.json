    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given the presentation of sudden dyspnea, palpitations, chest tightness after postpartum period; though initial data suggests pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism was the final diagnosis. - Severity classification: Severe, as the patient exhibits acute cardiopulmonary compromise with confusion, chest tightness, and shivering. - Urgency level: Immediate, prompt intervention is critical to stabilize the patient and prevent deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Cardiac arrhythmia, other thromboembolic events, or ongoing hemorrhage.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive stabilization, oxygen therapy, and urgent anticoagulation. - Supporting evidence: Anticoagulation with heparin reduces clot propagation and improves outcomes in pulmonary embolism; supportive care essential for life-threatening events. - Patient-specific considerations: Postpartum state increases bleeding risk; vigilant monitoring needed. - Contraindications or cautions: Bleeding risk, especially if recent delivery or surgical interventions.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Intravenous unfractionated heparin, with dosing based on weight and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring. - Rationale for selection: Rapid onset, easily titratable, short half-life, reversible if bleeding occurs. - Expected timeline for improvement: Hemodynamic stabilization can be seen within hours; oxygenation improvement within minutes to hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin), or in some cases, thrombolytics if contraindications exist and patient is unstable.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Bed rest with elevation of lower extremities if DVT is suspected; oxygen supplementation. - Patient education priorities: Signs of bleeding, importance of medication adherence, recognition of worsening symptoms. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid prolonged immobility; educate on postpartum activity restrictions. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, reassurance, involvement of mental health support if anxiety persists.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess within 24-48 hours; outpatient follow-up within 1 week. - Monitoring parameters: Vital signs, oxygen saturation, aPTT levels (for heparin therapy), signs of bleeding, and symptom resolution. - Red flag symptoms: Increased chest pain, bleeding, sudden worsening dyspnea, neurological changes. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in respiratory status, stabilization of vital signs, and normalization of laboratory parameters.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, factual explanation emphasizing the urgent nature of treatment and safety measures. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the effectiveness of treatment and monitor for side effects; address fears regarding postpartum recovery. - Adherence strategies: Involve the patient actively in understanding the rationale for medications; discuss importance of follow-up. - Family involvement: Encourage including family members in care discussions for support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Pulmonology and hematology consults; possibly cardiology if cardiac compromise persists. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for continuous monitoring; physiotherapy for mobility post-stabilization. - Community resources: Postpartum support groups, mental health services if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medication access; discuss coverage for outpatient monitoring.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate initiation of intravenous unfractionated heparin to anticoagulate, supplemented by oxygen therapy and supportive stabilization measures. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and signs of bleeding is essential. Supportive care involves bed rest, patient education on medication adherence and symptom monitoring, and lifestyle advice to prevent further thromboembolic events. Follow-up within 24-48 hours for reassessment and adjustment of therapy is crucial, along with coordinated care involving specialists such as pulmonology and hematology. This approach aims to stabilize the patient, prevent further embolic events, and facilitate recovery while minimizing risks associated with anticoagulation in the postpartum period. Key points for the patient include adherence to medication, recognition of bleeding or worsening symptoms, and timely follow-up.",
