The immediate priority is stabilization and definitive treatment of cardiac tamponade through pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage, coordinated with cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery teams. Supportive measures include positioning the patient upright to alleviate symptoms and careful hemodynamic monitoring. Pharmacologic management is primarily supportive during acute stabilization, with vasopressors used if necessary.\nLong-term management involves closely monitoring for recurrence or residual autonomic dysfunction, and addressing underlying causes once stabilized. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs, the importance of prompt reporting, and avoiding strenuous activities until cleared. Follow-up assessments will include clinical examinations, echocardiography, and possible outpatient autonomic testing if indicated.\nThis integrated approach aims to promptly resolve the life-threatening condition, alleviate symptoms, and prevent future episodes, all while ensuring safety and clear communication tailored to the patient\u2019s stoic minimizer personality.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent transfer for echocardiography and cardiology consultation for suspected tamponade; stabilize hemodynamically.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete definitive drainage; monitor recovery; assess for residual autonomic symptoms and educate patient.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm resolution; evaluate autonomic function; implement lifestyle modifications and follow-up care.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgency of symptoms, treatment steps, and importance of follow-up.",
