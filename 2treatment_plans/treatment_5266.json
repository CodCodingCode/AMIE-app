    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation of developmental delays including lack of speech or typical social engagement, limited eye contact, atypical play behaviors, sensory sensitivities (to loud noises and textures), repetitive behaviors (hand-flapping), and difficulty with social interactions strongly suggest ASD. The inconsistent response to her name and difficulty following instructions are common in children with ASD. Her sensitivities and emotional responses, such as becoming upset with new people and when overwhelmed, further support this diagnosis. Given the clustering of these developmental, social, and behavioral features, ASD is the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a comprehensive, individualized approach is essential to support the child's developmental and behavioral needs. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as early behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis), speech therapy to improve communication skills, and occupational therapy to address sensory sensitivities and improve daily functioning, are foundational and should be initiated promptly. Additionally, structured routines, visual supports, and social skills training can enhance understanding and engagement. Pharmacological treatments may be considered if there are significant associated symptoms, such as severe hyperactivity, aggression, or anxiety, that interfere with therapy or daily functioning; in such cases, medications like risperidone or aripiprazole might be appropriate. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists, educators, and family support is vital, with regular follow-up to assess progress and adapt interventions accordingly.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this child with ASD should begin with establishing access to early intervention services, including speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral therapy (such as ABA), to target communication, social skills, and sensory challenges. Implement a structured daily routine with visual supports to promote predictability and comfort. Encourage parental education and training on strategies for managing behaviors and supporting development at home. If the child's behaviors or emotional regulation significantly interfere with participation in therapy or daily activities, consider a trial of pharmacotherapy, such as risperidone or aripiprazole, under specialist guidance, to manage irritability or severe behavioral outbursts. Regular clinical follow-up is essential to monitor progress, adjust therapies, and coordinate care with developmental specialists."
