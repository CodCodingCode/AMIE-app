    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is consistent with a rapidly enlarging soft tissue mass over two weeks. - Severity classification: Moderate; the rapid growth and mild discomfort warrant prompt evaluation but not immediate life-threatening urgency. - Urgency level: Urgent; the quick growth and symptom progression suggest need for prompt diagnostic evaluation, including imaging and possible biopsy. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other soft tissue tumors (e.g., fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma), benign aggressive lesions, or infectious processes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Complete surgical excision with clear margins. - Supporting evidence: Surgical removal is standard for localized soft tissue sarcomas, including AFH, with the goal of minimizing recurrence. - Patient-specific considerations: Given her stoic_minimizer nature, it\u2019s important to communicate the necessity of definitive diagnosis and treatment candidly but empathetically. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid biopsy delay; do not assume benignity based solely on appearance. Monitor for potential nerve or vascular involvement during excision.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Not typically indicated pre-operatively; if needed for pain, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen 400-600 mg TID. - Rationale for selection: NSAIDs provide analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects with a favorable safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Relief within days. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal discomfort, bleeding risk. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Acetaminophen or short course of opioids if severe pain persists.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Encourage rest and avoid undue pressure on the mass. - Patient education priorities: Emphasize the importance of prompt diagnostic evaluation and the need for surgical treatment. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain normal activity levels as tolerated; avoid trauma. - Behavioral interventions: Address underlying anxiety by providing reassurance and clear explanations.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Next visit in 1 week for diagnostic results and discussion of surgical plan. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, signs of local invasion, wound healing post-surgery. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid increase in size, severe pain, neurological deficits, systemic symptoms (fever, malaise). - Treatment response assessment: Resolution of symptoms post-excision, histopathology confirmation.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language; acknowledge her resilience but emphasize the importance of thorough evaluation. - Addressing patient concerns: Talk openly about fears of malignancy and reassure through information and support. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, involve her in decision-making, and provide written summaries. - Family involvement: If appropriate, discuss with family members for support and shared understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncology or orthopedic oncology for biopsy and definitive management, ideally within one week. - Other healthcare team members: Radiology (for imaging), nursing support for wound care, mental health if anxiety impacts care. - Community resources: Patient support groups, informational websites. - Insurance/cost considerations: Coordinate insurance approval for diagnostics and surgery; explore financial assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt diagnostic imaging (MRI) and core needle biopsy to confirm the lesion\u2019s nature, followed by surgical excision with clear margins as the definitive treatment. Initial management emphasizes reassurance and pain control with NSAIDs, along with detailed patient education about the importance of timely intervention and diagnostic confirmation.  Follow-up will occur within one week to review pathology results and plan definitive surgery. Postoperative monitoring will focus on wound healing and any signs of recurrence or complication. Throughout, open, empathetic communication tailored to her stoic_minimizer style will help address anxieties, reinforce adherence, and facilitate shared decision-making. This approach aims to achieve complete tumor removal, minimize recurrence risk, and ensure her understanding and active participation in her care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange MRI imaging of the lesion, schedule biopsy, and coordinate with surgical oncology. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete biopsy, review pathology, and perform surgical excision. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete healing, monitor for recurrence, and provide education for any necessary adjuvant care. - Patient handout summary: Key points include the importance of diagnosis confirmation, surgical removal as the main treatment, pain management strategies, and the need for follow-up appointments.",
