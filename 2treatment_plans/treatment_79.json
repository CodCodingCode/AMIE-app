    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpetic gingivostomatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptom management, antiviral therapy, and supportive care tailored to this child's needs. The plan includes initiating oral acyclovir promptly to reduce severity, providing age-appropriate analgesics such as acetaminophen for pain, and emphasizing hydration and nutritional support with soft, bland foods. Close monitoring of hydration status and symptom progression is essential, with follow-up in 48-72 hours. Education for caregivers on maintaining oral hygiene, recognizing warning signs of dehydration or secondary infection, and ensuring medication adherence will promote recovery. The goal is to reduce discomfort, prevent dehydration, and speed lesion healing while preventing complications. This approach balances evidence-based interventions with child-specific considerations to achieve optimal outcomes.",
