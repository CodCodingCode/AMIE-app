The initial management should focus on performing a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion to confirm diagnosis histopathologically and prevent recurrence. This procedure should be scheduled promptly, with appropriate bleeding control measures and postoperative wound care instructions.\nPost-surgical care will include keeping the area clean, avoiding trauma, and monitoring for signs of infection or recurrence. Follow-up should be arranged at 1-2 weeks to assess healing and ensure no signs of regrowth. Necessary patient education will cover lesion nature, wound care, and when to seek immediate help, such as persistent bleeding or signs of infection.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule excisional biopsy, educate patient on wound care, and provide instructions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete healing of the incision, monitor for recurrence, reinforce wound care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure stable healing with no recurrence, educate on avoiding trauma, and monitor for any new lesions.\nPatient handout summarizing key points on lesion nature, post-op care, warning signs, and follow-up plan.",
