    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to develop a treatment plan for hemorrhagic stroke.  \nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given acute neurological s\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines acute neurocritical management with supportive care and long-term rehabilitation planning. The treatment plan includes immediate blood pressure control with IV antihypertensives, close neurological monitoring, and prompt neurosurgical consultation to evaluate the need for surgical intervention if indicated. Supportive measures such as elevating the head of bed, maintaining airway and respiratory stability, and avoiding anticoagulants are crucial. Long-term, the focus will be on blood pressure management, preventing re-bleeding, and neuro-rehabilitation as needed. Follow-up will involve repeated imaging, neurological assessments, and coordination with specialists. Clear communication, involving family, and addressing patient anxieties will enhance adherence and understanding. This multi-faceted approach aims to optimize neurological outcomes, minimize complications, and support recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antihypertensives to maintain BP targets, perform urgent neuroimaging (CT or MRI), and consult neurosurgery.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize neurological status, prevent re-bleeding, and evaluate surgical options; initiate supportive therapies.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve optimal BP control, coordinate rehabilitation services, and monitor for complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of blood pressure management, attending follow-up visits, recognizing worsening symptoms, and lifestyle modifications to prevent recurrence.",
