    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of sarcoidosis with neurosarcoidosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroids, specifically prednisone at approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day, to control systemic and CNS inflammation, along with adjunct therapies such as physical and occupational therapy to restore mobility. Close monitoring of neurological status, skin lesions, and potential steroid side effects will be essential, with follow-up evaluations scheduled within 2-4 weeks. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognizing warning signs of neurological deterioration, and lifestyle modifications to support overall health. Coordination with specialists\u2014including neurology, rheumatology, and dermatology\u2014is vital for optimal care. This approach aims for neurological symptom stabilization or improvement, reduction of skin lesions, and minimization of long-term complications, ensuring a tailored, multidisciplinary effort in managing this complex condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange for neurological and dermatological assessments; start prednisone therapy under supervision; educate patient and family.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess response to corticosteroid therapy; monitor for side effects; initiate supportive therapies.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Taper steroids as appropriate; evaluate disease remission or progression; consider additional immunosuppressive agents if needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain sarcoidosis and neurosarcoidosis, treatment plan, medication adherence importance, signs to watch for, and scheduled follow-up appointments.",
