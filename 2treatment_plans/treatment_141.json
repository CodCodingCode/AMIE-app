    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on pathology confirming papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate, as non-invasive papillary tumor without evidence of invasion or metastasis. - Urgency level: Urgent, given hematuria, systemic symptoms (weight loss, fatigue), and persistent back pain, which warrant prompt evaluation and treatment planning. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Consider potential for progression to invasive disease or metastasis; monitor for new or worsening symptoms.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for local control, followed by intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy as indicated. - Supporting evidence: TURBT is standard for non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, with intravesical therapies reducing recurrence risk. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient age and comorbidities, potential anxiety, and readiness for procedure. - Contraindications or cautions: Bleeding risks during TURBT; allergies or contraindications to intravesical agents.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Immediately, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy after TURBT. If not feasible, consider intravesical mitomycin C. - Rationale for selection: BCG reduces recurrence and progression in non-invasive high-grade tumors. - Expected timeline for improvement: Typically, initial response seen after 6 weeks of therapy. - Key side effects to monitor: Local bladder irritation, flu-like symptoms, rare systemic BCG infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Repeat TURBT, procedural options, or consider systemic chemotherapy if invasive disease develops.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Smoking cessation support, given the strong link with urothelial carcinoma. - Patient education priorities: Disease nature, treatment options, importance of follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Hydration, healthy diet, avoiding irritants. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, counseling to address anxiety.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Cystoscopy at 3, 6 months post-treatment, then annually. - Monitoring parameters: Hematuria resolution, cystoscopy findings, urinary symptoms, systemic symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing hematuria, new pain, weight loss, signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Visual inspection during cystoscopy, urine cytology.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Provide clear, empathetic explanations emphasizing the rationale and importance of each step. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about treatment safety, effectiveness, and that many patients have successful outcomes. - Adherence strategies: Encouragement, setting expectations, involving patient in decision-making. - Family involvement: With patient consent, include family members for support and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Urologist for TURBT and intravesical therapy; possibly medical oncologist if invasive features develop. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for procedural care, patient education; mental health support if anxiety is significant. - Community resources: Support groups for bladder cancer patients. - Insurance/cost considerations: Clarify coverage for procedures, therapies, and follow-ups.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes performing a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove visible tumors and confirm diagnosis. Following TURBT, intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy should be initiated to reduce recurrence risk. Additional supportive measures involve smoking cessation, hydration, and patient education on disease nature and follow-up importance. Initial management focuses on the TURBT procedure and timely initiation of intravesical therapy, while establishing ongoing surveillance with cystoscopy every 3 to 6 months initially, then annually. Follow-up assessments will include cystoscopic examination, urine cytology, and monitoring for symptom recurrence. This approach aims to maximize tumor control, prevent progression, and address patient anxiety through thorough communication and support. Care coordination with urology, oncology, and supportive services will ensure comprehensive care, with close follow-up to promptly detect any recurrence or progression.",
