    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Cerebral Palsy (spastic quadriplegia type)\nJustification: The child's presentation of early-onset limb stiffness, decreased and abnormal movements, episodes of increased tone (stiffness worsening when upset), decreased alertness, and fussy feeding, combined with a history suggestive of perinatal stress (difficult labor, decreased fetal movements), aligns with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, particularly spastic quadriplegia. The progression over days to weeks and persistent neurological signs without seizure activity also support this. The absence of abnormal eye movements or jerky movements reduces likelihood of other hyperkinetic movement disorders, while the early onset and worsening pattern point toward a hypoxic-ischemic injury or other perinatal injury affecting the brain, leading to motor deficits characteristic of cerebral palsy.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCerebral Palsy (spastic quadriplegia)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia, the primary goals are to optimize the child's functional abilities, prevent secondary complications, and improve comfort. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy and occupational therapy are essential to promote motor development, reduce muscle contractures, and prevent deformities. Speech therapy may be necessary if feeding or communication issues arise. The presentation of increased muscle tone and spasticity suggests that pharmacological intervention may be warranted to control severe spasticity and improve mobility and comfort. Baclofen, dantrolene, or tizanidine are commonly used medications to reduce spasticity, with baclofen being often first-line. It is important to monitor for side effects like sedation, hypotonia, or gastrointestinal issues.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include initiating a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. Begin with regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy to improve range of motion, prevent contractures, and support developmental needs. Consultation with a neurologist or physiatrist is advised to consider pharmacological management of spasticity, with oral baclofen as a first-line option, starting at a low dose and titrating gradually while monitoring for side effects. If oral medications are insufficient or poorly tolerated, botulinum toxin injections can be considered for targeted spasticity management in specific muscle groups. Nutritional support should be evaluated to ensure adequate caloric intake, especially if feeding difficulties persist, with involvement of a speech or feeding therapist if necessary. Additionally, screening for and managing any associated complications such as seizures, orthopedic issues, and aspiration risk should be part of ongoing care. Regular follow-up is essential to assess therapeutic effectiveness and adjust the plan accordingly."
