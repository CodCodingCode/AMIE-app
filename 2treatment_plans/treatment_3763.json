    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) / Pseudotumor Cerebri\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of worsening intermittent headaches aggravated by bending or straining, along with associated dizziness, fainting, morning confusion, fogginess, fuzzy vision when standing quickly, and nausea suggest increased intracranial pressure. The absence of head trauma, weight changes, or other neurological deficits directs focus towards a condition characterized by raised intracranial pressure without mass lesions. Although IIH is more common in women of childbearing age, it can occur in men as well, often associated with obesity or other risk factors, which are not specified here but the presentation remains consistent. The positional worsening and visual disturbances are characteristic features. No mention of focal neurological deficits or signs of mass lesions makes other causes like tumors less likely at this stage.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nFurther diagnostic evaluation, including neuroimaging (preferably MRI with MRV to rule out other causes, and possibly a lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure and analyze cerebrospinal fluid), is necessary before confirming the diagnosis definitively. The current clinical picture strongly suggests IIH, but confirmation is essential.  \nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the clinical presentation suggestive of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), the primary goals are to confirm the diagnosis and reduce intracranial pressure to prevent visual loss and alleviate symptoms. While neuroimaging, specifically MRI with MRV, is necessary to exclude other causes such as venous sinus thrombosis or mass lesions, this can often be coordinated with urgent referral or imaging ordering through the primary care provider or psychiatrist, depending on access. A lumbar puncture should be performed to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure; an elevated opening pressure with normal CSF composition confirms the diagnosis of IIH. As initial management, weight loss is a key non-pharmacological intervention if obesity is present, as it has been shown to significantly reduce intracranial pressure. Pharmacologically, acetazolamide is the first-line medication to decrease CSF production and lower intracranial pressure. Patient education regarding symptom monitoring, maintaining head elevation, and avoiding activities that exacerbate symptoms should be provided. Close follow-up is essential to monitor visual function and treatment response, with adjustments made as needed. If symptoms persist or worsen despite medical therapy, further interventions such as serial lumbar punctures or surgical options may be considered, but these are beyond initial management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves coordinating urgent neuroimaging (MRI with MRV) to rule out secondary causes of increased intracranial pressure. Concurrently, arrange for a lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure and analyze CSF. Initiate medical therapy with acetazolamide to reduce CSF production and consider recommending weight loss if applicable, alongside advising the patient to elevate the head of their bed, avoid straining, and monitor their symptoms closely. Educate the patient about the importance of regular follow-up to monitor visual function. If visual symptoms or headache severity worsen despite medical management, consult a neurologist or neuro-ophthalmologist for further evaluation and possible interventions."
