    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of actinic keratosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical 5-fluorouracil 5% cream applied twice daily over the affected areas for 2-4 weeks, complemented by strict sun protection measures such as broad-spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing. Short-term follow-up should occur in 4-6 weeks to assess treatment response and manage any local skin reactions. Education on early detection of new or changing lesions and ongoing sun safety is essential. If lesions do not resolve or if atypical features arise, a dermatology referral for further evaluation or alternative therapies (e.g., cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy) will be arranged. This approach aims to eradicate pre-cancerous lesions, prevent progression, and reduce future skin cancer risk, while minimizing adverse effects and encouraging long-term sun protective behaviors.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on lesion nature and sun protection; provide instructions for topical treatment\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete topical therapy, monitor for side effects, and assess initial response\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Continued sun safety, regular skin self-exams, and periodic professional skin assessments\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about actinic keratosis, treatment regimen, sun protection importance, and follow-up plan",
