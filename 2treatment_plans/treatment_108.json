    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Kleine-Levin syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptomatic management with supportive interventions tailored to the patient's clinical presentation and personal needs. The plan includes initiating wake-promoting agents such as amantadine or modafinil, alongside establishing regular sleep hygiene and behavioral strategies. Close monitoring over the next 2-4 weeks will evaluate medication efficacy and side effects, with ongoing assessment of symptom frequency and severity. Education will focus on recognizing episodes, adhering to sleep routines, and managing expectations. Follow-up with neurology and psychiatry specialists will ensure coordinated care, aiming to reduce episode impact and improve overall functioning. This approach balances immediate symptom control with long-term management, emphasizing patient engagement and safety.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient and family about the condition, start medication (e.g., amantadine or modafinil), and establish sleep hygiene routines\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor response to medication, adjust dosage as needed, reinforce behavioral strategies\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduction in episode severity/duration, establish stable sleep patterns, and address any emerging mood or behavioral concerns\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding Kleine-Levin syndrome, importance of sleep routines, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care",
