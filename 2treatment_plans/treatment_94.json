    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of cerebellar ataxi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy cerebellar type (MSA-C), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based symptomatic management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes regular physiotherapy and occupational therapy to improve gait and safety, bladder management techniques, and cautious pharmacologic interventions as needed for specific symptoms. Initial management focuses on optimizing mobility, safety, and quality of life, with close monitoring of neurological status, urinary symptoms, and cognitive changes. Follow-up visits every 3-6 months will help assess disease progression, medication effects, and caregiver support needs. Patient education emphasizes symptom recognition, safety precautions, and the importance of reporting new or worsening issues. Involving family members and coordinating care with neurologists, therapists, and community resources aims to provide holistic support. This approach is designed to stabilize functional ability, reduce fall risk, and enhance overall well-being, while minimizing medication side effects and ensuring sustainable long-term management.",
