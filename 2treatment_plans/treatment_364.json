    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes administering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days as the first-line therapy, along with close respiratory monitoring and supportive care. Early physical therapy should be initiated to maintain mobility, and nutritional support should be ensured. The patient requires urgent evaluation of respiratory function, including spirometry and oxygen saturation assessment, with immediate escalation if signs of respiratory failure develop. Follow-up should occur within one week, with ongoing assessment of neurological and respiratory status over the next several months. Patient education will focus on recognizing worsening weakness and breathing difficulty. Family members will be involved in care and observation. Long-term goals include recovery of strength and prevention of complications. The overall approach aims to reduce disease severity, facilitate recovery, and prevent respiratory failure while minimizing treatment risks.",
