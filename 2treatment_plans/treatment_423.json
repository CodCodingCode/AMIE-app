The initial management focuses on securing the airway, stabilizing hemodynamics with IV fluids and blood transfusions, and arranging immediate transfer to a specialized center for definitive vascular repair. Concurrently, continuous monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and respiratory status is essential. Patient education should emphasize the gravity of his condition, the need for prompt intervention, and honest symptom reporting. This plan aims to control active bleeding, prevent hypovolemic shock, and reduce mortality, while addressing the patient's minimalizing behavior to ensure full cooperation and adherence. Follow-up will involve post-procedure imaging and outpatient evaluations to prevent recurrence and monitor recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent transfer to a tertiary hospital with vascular surgical capabilities; initiate IV fluids and crossmatched blood products; provide oxygen therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stability, complete definitive aneurysm repair, and monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular imaging follow-up, manage any vascular or pulmonary sequelae, and provide patient education on symptom monitoring.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Your urgent condition requires prompt treatment. You will receive stabilization with fluids and blood, followed by a procedure to repair the ruptured artery. Report any worsening symptoms immediately, and attend all follow-up appointments.\"",
