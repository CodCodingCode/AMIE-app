    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient's presentation of episodic headaches with a tight, pressing feeling in the forehead, along with visual disturbances such as flashes and odd shapes provoked by certain lights, strongly suggests migraine with aura. The headache can occur suddenly or gradually, and the associated visual phenomena (flashes, shapes) are characteristic features of aura. Her absence of neurological deficits, recent systemic illnesses, trauma, or other alarming symptoms, along with the lack of weight changes or systemic signs, further supports a primary headache disorder like migraine rather than secondary causes. The unsteady feeling and feeling of imbalance are also common migraine symptoms and do not indicate a neurological infarct or other serious pathology at this point.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMigraine with aura END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of migraine with aura, the primary goal is to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and improve the patient's quality of life. Non-pharmacological interventions such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, managing stress, avoiding known migraine triggers, staying hydrated, and engaging in regular physical activity are foundational and can significantly decrease attack frequency. Pharmacological treatment options include acute abortive therapies like NSAIDs or specific migraine medications such as triptans for immediate symptom relief. For preventive management, if attacks are frequent or disabling, a medication such as a beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol), a calcium channel blocker (e.g., flunarizine, if available), or an antiepileptic drug (e.g., topiramate) can be considered to reduce attack frequency. Educating the patient on recognizing aura symptoms and when to seek medical attention is also essential.\n\nANSWER: I recommend initiating a comprehensive approach starting with patient education about migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a consistent sleep routine, stress management, hydration, and avoidance of known triggers. For acute relief during attacks, NSAIDs or triptans can be used. If the patient experiences frequent or severely disabling migraines, consider starting a preventive medication such as propranolol or topiramate after evaluating contraindications. Regular follow-up should be arranged to assess effectiveness, adherence, and any side effects, with adjustments made as needed."
