    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high \u2014 the patient has ocular trauma symptoms following recent physical activity consistent with subconjunctival hemorrhage or eyelid hematoma. - Severity classification: Moderate \u2014 swelling and pain are notable, and recent vision disturbance suggests some concern, but no mention of vision loss or globe rupture. - Urgency level: Urgent \u2014 requires prompt examination to rule out serious ocular injury, foreign body, or other complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, intraocular foreign body, orbital fracture, or infection.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Conservative management with symptomatic relief, eye protection, and observation. - Supporting evidence: Most subconjunctival hemorrhages and eyelid hematomas resolve spontaneously; intervention is usually supportive unless complications arise. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's anxiety requires clear reassurance; monitor for worsening symptoms or signs of ocular compromise. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary eye pressure or eye rubbing; do not prescribe steroids or topical medications unless indicated after examination.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical lubricating eye drops (e.g., preservative-free artificial tears), as needed for comfort. - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive, safe, helps with tearing and discomfort. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within a few days; swelling should gradually decrease. - Key side effects to monitor: Any worsening redness, pain, or signs of secondary infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines if allergic conjunctivitis develops, or antibiotics if signs of infection appear.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest; avoid rubbing the eyes; protect the eye with sunglasses if exposed to bright light. - Patient education priorities: Importance of avoiding trauma, recognizing signs of worsening, and adhering to follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Caution during activity to prevent recurrence; gentle eye hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Anxiety management techniques; reassure about prognosis to reduce worry.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Vision clarity, swelling, pain, redness, any new symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increasing pain, signs of worsening hemorrhage, or signs of infection (discharge, fever). - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or stabilization; no worsening signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language; provide reassurance; explain that most ocular trauma heals with minimal intervention. - Addressing patient concerns: Acknowledge anxiety, clarify which symptoms require immediate care, and emphasize safety. - Adherence strategies: Encourage adherence with follow-up, provide written instructions, and reinforce understanding. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family or caregivers to support reassurance and adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen, vision changes, or no improvement in 1-2 days. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care follow-up, possibly mental health support if anxiety persists. - Community resources: Patient education materials on ocular trauma; anxiety management resources if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure availability of medications, affordable follow-up, and access to specialists if referrals are needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ocular trauma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with artificial tears and eye protection, with close observation for any signs of deterioration. Initial management focuses on reassurance, protective measures, and prompt follow-up within 24-48 hours to assess progress. The patient will be educated on recognizing warning signs like vision loss, increasing pain, or signs of infection, and instructed to seek urgent care if these occur. Follow-up will monitor symptom resolution and ensure no progression to more severe injury. This approach aims to promote natural healing, minimize complications, and reduce patient anxiety through clear communication and reassurance. Implementation involves immediate steps today such as patient education, provision of lubricants, and scheduling follow-up; short-term goals include symptom improvement within days; and long-term objectives focus on complete healing and addressing any residual concerns or anxiety.",
