    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of sudden unilateral vision loss suggests an ischemic event affecting the retina or optic nerve. The associated symptoms\u2014headache localized around the temples, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and systemic symptoms such as feverishness, malaise, weight loss, and musculoskeletal aches\u2014are characteristic features of GCA. The presence of visual symptoms combined with these constitutional and cranial vascular signs strongly points toward giant cell arteritis. The patient's age (though not explicitly provided, this presentation is typical in older adults) further supports this diagnosis, as GCA primarily affects individuals over 50. The absence of rashes, neck stiffness, neurological deficits, or infectious signs lessens the likelihood of alternative diagnoses like infectious or autoimmune causes unrelated to large-vessel vasculitis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nGiant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with classic signs of giant cell arteritis, including sudden unilateral vision loss, temporal headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and systemic symptoms, which strongly suggest active inflammation of large cranial arteries. Immediate intervention is critical to prevent irreversible visual loss and reduce systemic complications. The mainstay of treatment is high-dose corticosteroids to rapidly suppress vascular inflammation, ideally initiated promptly even before biopsy confirmation; delay can lead to permanent blindness. Non-pharmacological measures include patient education about medication adherence, monitoring for steroid side effects, and management of associated risk factors. Given the urgency and potential for severe complications, aggressive pharmacotherapy is prioritized.\n\nANSWER: The patient should be started on high-dose corticosteroids immediately\u2014typically, oral prednisone 40-60 mg daily\u2014without waiting for biopsy results. Tapering should be guided by clinical response and laboratory markers such as ESR and CRP, with a plan to gradually reduce the dose over several months to minimize steroid-related side effects. In parallel, a temporal artery biopsy should be scheduled within 1-2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, consider prophylactic measures against osteoporosis if long-term steroids are anticipated, including calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and regularly monitor blood pressure, blood glucose, and screening for infections. Patient education on symptom monitoring and reporting any new visual changes or side effects is essential. Collaboration with ophthalmology and rheumatology may be beneficial for comprehensive management."
