    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient is a young adult presenting with progressive numbness, burning sensations, and weakness in the legs and feet, along with increased stumble and unsteadiness. Symptoms are worse in the morning, at night, and after prolonged activity, with some improvement with rest, and are exacerbated by heat and stress. These features are characteristic of demyelinating CNS disorders, particularly MS, which commonly presents with sensory disturbances, motor weakness, and gait instability. The pattern of symptoms worsening with heat (Uhthoff's phenomenon) and stress further supports MS. The absence of bladder or bowel symptoms and lack of recent illness reduces some differential diagnoses but does not exclude MS.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) based on the clinical presentation of progressive sensory disturbances, motor weakness, gait instability, and symptom exacerbation with heat and stress, it is appropriate to initiate an early, comprehensive management plan. While disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are essential for altering disease progression, they are typically prescribed by neurologists. However, primary care physicians or psychiatrists can ensure symptomatic relief and support. Non-pharmacological strategies such as patient education, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications can help improve function and quality of life. Pharmacological interventions for symptom management include agents like amantadine or modafinil for fatigue, baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity, and physical therapy to address gait and strength issues. It is important to refer the patient to a neurologist for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of DMTs, but initial supportive measures and symptom control can be managed in primary care.\n\nANSWER: I would recommend that the patient be referred promptly to a neurologist for confirmation of the MS diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, the primary care physician or psychiatrist should advise symptomatic management by starting physical therapy focused on gait and strength, providing education about heat sensitivity and avoiding heat exposure, and counseling on stress management techniques. Pharmacological management of symptoms such as fatigue or spasticity can be considered; for example, prescribing amantadine or modafinil for fatigue, and baclofen or tizanidine if spasticity becomes problematic. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor symptom progression, support adherence to therapy, and coordinate ongoing care with neurology."
