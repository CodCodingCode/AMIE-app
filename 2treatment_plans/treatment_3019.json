    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)\nJustification: The patient's age, the presence of morning seizures, jerking movements involving the whole or parts of the body, sensory phenomena such as eyelid twitching, and episodes occurring with tiredness or excitement align well with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The episodes of uncontrolled jerking, sometimes involving staring or blanking out, along with the post-ictal fatigue and poor memory, support a diagnosis of a generalized epilepsy syndrome. Her lack of prior EEG and neurological testing is notable, but the clinical features strongly suggest JME, which typically presents in adolescents with myoclonic jerks, especially in the morning, and can have generalized tonic-clonic features.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional testing like EEG would help confirm the diagnosis)\n- No further clarification needed: No (ordering an EEG and possibly neuroimaging would be appropriate)\n\nANSWER:\nJuvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) is a benign, idiopathic generalized epilepsy that typically presents in adolescence with myoclonic jerks, often occurring in the morning and triggered by fatigue or emotional stress. The mainstay of management involves selecting an appropriate antiepileptic medication to reduce seizure frequency and prevent injury, with valproic acid being highly effective but with considerations regarding side effects, especially in females. Lamotrigine or levetiracetam are alternative options with favorable side effect profiles. Non-pharmacological strategies include patient education on trigger avoidance (e.g., sleep deprivation, stress), safety precautions during seizures, and ensuring regular sleep patterns. Confirming diagnosis with an EEG and neuroimaging, though not immediately critical to start treatment, is advisable to support clinical management.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should initiate pharmacological treatment with a broad-spectrum antiepileptic, such as levetiracetam or lamotrigine, considering individual patient factors. Starting with a low dose and titrating gradually is recommended to minimize side effects. Adjunctively, the patient should receive education on seizure safety, including avoiding activities that pose risk during episodes, establishing a consistent sleep routine, and reducing stress. It is also essential to arrange for an EEG to confirm the diagnosis and aid in future management. Follow-up should focus on assessing seizure control, medication tolerability, and adherence, with possible adjustments as needed."
