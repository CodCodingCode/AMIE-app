    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Turner syndrome (45,X or related monosomy/X chromosomal abnormality)\nJustification: The patient has not begun pubertal development, lacks secondary sexual characteristics, and has physical features such as a wide chest\u2014common in Turner syndrome. Her reported smaller stature and physical differences in arms and fingers also align with typical features. The absence of other signs such as webbed neck, cystic hygroma, or low posterior hairline does not exclude Turner syndrome, as phenotypic variability exists. Importantly, there is no family history of similar issues, and she displays features consistent with a monosomy X syndrome that often results in growth failure and delayed puberty.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nTurner syndrome END",
    "output": "THINKING: Turner syndrome is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis resulting in estrogen deficiency, leading to delayed or absent pubertal development and short stature. Management should address these core issues through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to induce and maintain puberty and promote secondary sexual characteristic development, as well as growth assessments and interventions if indicated. Non-pharmacological strategies include psychological support to address emotional and social challenges related to body image and developmental delays, as well as regular monitoring for associated health concerns such as cardiovascular anomalies and skeletal health. A primary care physician or psychiatrist can initiate HRT after appropriate assessment, ensuring collaboration with endocrinology for specialized management, if needed.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating low-dose estrogen therapy to induce pubertal development and support secondary sexual characteristic formation, with gradual dose escalation under endocrine guidance. Additionally, growth monitoring should be conducted, and growth hormone therapy may be considered if the patient\u2019s growth potential indicates benefit. Psychological support or counseling is recommended to address emotional, social, and developmental concerns. Regular screening for associated health issues typical of Turner syndrome, including cardiovascular anomalies, hearing issues, and osteoporosis, should be implemented. The primary care physician or psychiatrist should coordinate care with pediatric endocrinology to ensure comprehensive, individualized management."
