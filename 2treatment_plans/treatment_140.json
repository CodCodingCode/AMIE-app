    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Secondary Psychosis and Cognitive Decline, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an antiepileptic medication such as levetiracetam to control seizures, while evaluating for autoimmune or paraneoplastic causes that may warrant immunotherapy. Psychosocial support and cognitive rehabilitation are integral to address hallucinations and cognitive deficits. I will closely monitor seizure frequency, side effects, and neurocognitive status with regular follow-ups, adjusting treatment as necessary. Patient education focuses on seizure safety, medication adherence, and recognizing warning signs. Family involvement and multidisciplinary coordination ensure holistic management aimed at reducing seizure burden, improving cognitive function, and supporting emotional well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Begin levetiracetam 500 mg BID after confirming no contraindications, provide patient education on medication use and seizure safety, and schedule follow-up within 2 weeks.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve seizure control, monitor for side effects, and assess adherence; initiate neuropsychological evaluation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize seizure frequency, improve cognitive and psychological symptoms, and identify underlying autoimmune process if present.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points about medication, seizure safety, signs to watch for, and importance of follow-up.",
