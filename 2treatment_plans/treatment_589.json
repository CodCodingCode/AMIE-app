    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High certainty of ischemic priapism given duration (>4 hours), painful and tender presentation without trauma. - Severity classification: Severe, since duration exceeds 4 hours, painful, and exhibits rigidity, indicating significant ischemia risk. - Urgency level: Immediate intervention required to prevent tissue necrosis and preserve erectile function. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Sickle cell disease, medication side effects, hematologic disorders, systemic vascular conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Aspiration of corpora cavernosa plus intracavernosal injection of sympathomimetic agents (e.g., phenylephrine). - Supporting evidence: These interventions effectively relieve ischemic priapism and prevent lasting damage. - Patient-specific considerations: No prior episodes or medications indicated; limited communication suggests need for straightforward instructions. - Contraindications or cautions: Cardiovascular disease may necessitate cautious use of phenylephrine; ensure hemodynamic stability.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Intracavernosal phenylephrine, 100-500 mcg every 3-5 minutes, titrated to effect. - Rationale for selection: Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-adrenergic agonist with rapid onset and proven efficacy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Immediate with aspiration; pharmacologic response typically within 10-15 minutes. - Key side effects to monitor: Hypertension, reflex bradycardia, headache; monitor blood pressure during administration. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Other sympathomimetics or surgical shunt procedures.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Ensuring prompt initial management; patient education on avoiding precipitating factors. - Patient education priorities: Importance of timely treatment, risks of delayed intervention, and need for follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoidance of known vasoactive substances (e.g., cocaine, certain medications). - Behavioral interventions: Not primary but consider counseling if underlying conditions (e.g., sickle cell) are identified later.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment within 24-48 hours post-treatment; longer-term assessment at 1-2 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Resolution of erection, vascular status, potential complications, and any recurrence. - Red flag symptoms: Persistent or recurrent erections, signs of tissue necrosis, pain worsening, systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Complete detumescence, symptom relief, and absence of adverse effects.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use direct, clear, and concise language emphasizing the urgency and importance of immediate treatment. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety and effectiveness; acknowledge stoicism but stress seriousness. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize need for prompt follow-up; provide written instructions and emphasize adherence. - Family involvement: Not necessary unless patient desires or with consent.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Urology urgent consultation; hematology if systemic underlying causes are suspected. - Other healthcare team members: Nurses for monitoring, possibly interventional radiology if surgical intervention needed. - Community resources: Education materials on priapism and vascular health. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for procedures and medications; consider outpatient management feasibility.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ischemic priapism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt aspiration of the corpora cavernosa followed by intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine to induce vascular constriction and resolve the erection. This immediate intervention aims to prevent tissue ischemia and preserve erectile function. The patient will be closely monitored during and after treatment for blood pressure changes and symptom resolution.  Initial management prioritizes urgent urological intervention within the first few hours of presentation. Follow-up will include reassessment within 24-48 hours to evaluate for recurrence or complications. Patient education will emphasize the importance of seeking timely care if symptoms reoccur and avoiding vasoactive substances. Long-term management may involve investigation for underlying systemic conditions such as sickle cell disease or vascular disorders.  Implementation guidance: - Immediate actions (today): Perform penile aspiration and administer phenylephrine intracavernosally in the clinic or emergency setting. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm resolution, educate the patient about warning signs, and evaluate for underlying causes. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through management of any underlying risk factors, and restore patient confidence in sexual health. - Patient handout summary: Explain priapism, the importance of urgent treatment, the procedures performed, and when to seek help again.  This approach aims to effectively resolve the current episode and prevent future occurrences, ensuring the best possible functional and psychological outcome for the patient.",
