    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear associated with impingement syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating physical therapy focused on rotator cuff strengthening and activity modification, along with short-term NSAID therapy (such as ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 8 hours as needed) to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. Patient education will emphasize the importance of adherence to prescribed exercises, activity adjustments, and realistic expectations for recovery timelines.\nInitial management should be carried out promptly, with a follow-up scheduled within 2-4 weeks to monitor symptom progression, functional improvement, and medication tolerability. During follow-up, we will reassess the need for further interventions such as imaging or referral to an orthopedic specialist if no significant improvement or signs of tear progression occur. Throughout treatment, the patient's concerns about sleep disturbance and functional impairment will be prioritized via clear communication and family involvement if appropriate. This approach aims to restore shoulder function, reduce pain, and prevent further injury, all while minimizing risks from unnecessary interventions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about the condition, start NSAID therapy, and refer for physical therapy assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain reduction, improve range of motion, and adherence to physical therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete rehabilitation, restore full shoulder function, and prevent recurrence.\n- Patient handout summary: Explanation of rotator cuff tendinopathy, importance of physical therapy, medication use, activity modification, and signs to watch for that require urgent reassessment.",
