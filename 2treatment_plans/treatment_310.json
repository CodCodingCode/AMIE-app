    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cellulitis with systemic involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate hospitalization with IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (such as vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) to address suspected serious infection, alongside supportive care measures like limb elevation and wound hygiene. Considering the patient's neonatal status and confusion, clear, simple communication with caregivers is crucial, emphasizing the importance of adherence and monitoring for deterioration. Close inpatient monitoring of vital signs, wound status, and laboratory markers will guide ongoing management. Once stabilized, transitioning to oral antibiotics and outpatient follow-up within 48-72 hours, along with wound care education, will help ensure complete recovery. This approach aims to effectively treat the infection, prevent progression, and promote healing while minimizing risks of complications like necrotizing fasciitis or systemic sepsis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit the patient to hospital, start IV antibiotics as outlined, assess vital signs and wound status.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve infection control, wound healing, and resolution of systemic symptoms; adjust antibiotics based on culture results.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete treatment, monitor for recurrence, and implement skin infection prevention strategies.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the importance of antibiotics, signs to watch for, wound care tips, and follow-up appointments to ensure recovery.",
