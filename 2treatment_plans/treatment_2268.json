    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's progressive bilateral weakness, sensory disturbances (numbness and tingling in the feet and hands), unsteadiness, and sensation of shocks align with demyelination of the central nervous system, characteristic of MS. The gradual progression over a year without bladder or bowel involvement or visual symptoms suggests a slowly evolving form of MS, possibly secondary progressive. The absence of recent infections, stressors, or episodic fluctuation points toward a chronic demyelinating process rather than an acute or infectious cause. The symptoms' distribution and nature are classic for MS, especially with sensory disturbances and gait instability.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly with a progressive course characterized by bilateral weakness, sensory disturbances, and gait instability, the treatment approach should focus on slowing disease progression, managing symptoms, and improving quality of life. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can help reduce the frequency of relapses and delay progression, especially if the diagnosis aligns with a pattern where these are beneficial. Non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapy and occupational therapy are essential for maintaining mobility, strength, and functional independence. Symptom-specific treatments, such as pain management and addressing gait instability, can improve daily functioning. Since this appears to be a gradually progressive form of MS, intervention should be comprehensive but tailored to the patient's current symptoms and overall health status.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should refer the patient to a neurologist specializing in MS for prompt initiation of disease-modifying therapy, such as a first-line agent like interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or an oral DMT like dimethyl fumarate, depending on individual factors and tolerability. Symptomatic management should include physical therapy to enhance strength, balance, and gait, and occupational therapy for assistance with daily activities. Consider prescribing symptomatic treatments for specific issues\u2014such as gabapentin or amitriptyline for neuropathic sensations and medications or assistive devices for gait instability. Regular monitoring for disease progression, screening for side effects of therapies, and providing patient education about MS are also key. Engaging a multidisciplinary team, including neurology, physical therapy, and mental health support, will help optimize management and quality of life."
