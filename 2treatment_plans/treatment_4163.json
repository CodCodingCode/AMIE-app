    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Likely Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  \nJustification: The patient presents with a constellation of neurological symptoms including intermittent visual disturbances (blurry vision), sensory disturbances (strange feelings in the leg), balance issues (wobbliness), cognitive fog, and fatigue, which are characteristic of demyelinating episodes seen in MS. The intermittent, relapsing-remitting pattern, exacerbation with fatigue or stress, and absence of systemic signs like rashes or recent infections further support this diagnosis. The symptoms do not align with more common alternative diagnoses such as infections, metabolic issues, or psychiatric causes, as the neurological symptoms are persistent and episodic. The lack of systemic signs and exposure history makes infectious or systemic inflammatory causes less likely.  \n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional testing like MRI and lumbar puncture are needed for confirmation)  \n- No further clarification needed: No (additional diagnostic work-up is required to confirm MS and rule out differential diagnoses)  \n\nANSWER:  \nMultiple Sclerosis  \nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the clinical presentation suggestive of multiple sclerosis, the primary goals are to initiate disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to reduce relapse frequency and severity, manage symptoms, and ensure appropriate support for neurological health. While definitive diagnosis awaits confirmation with MRI and lumbar puncture, early intervention can improve long-term outcomes. Non-pharmacological approaches such as patient education, lifestyle modifications including regular exercise, stress management, and fatigue reduction are essential adjuncts. Pharmacologically, starting a first-line DMT (e.g., interferon beta or glatiramer acetate) should be considered to modify the disease course. Symptomatic treatments, like gabapentin or amantadine for sensory disturbances or fatigue management strategies, can be added based on specific patient needs. Coordination with neurology is important for ongoing assessment and confirmation of diagnosis.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a disease-modifying therapy such as interferon beta or glatiramer acetate to reduce relapse rates once diagnosis is confirmed. The patient should receive comprehensive education about MS, including symptom management and lifestyle adjustments to minimize fatigue and stress. Symptomatic treatments can be considered as needed: for sensory disturbances, medications like gabapentin may be helpful; for fatigue, energy conservation techniques and possibly amantadine could be employed. The patient should be referred to neurology for definitive diagnostic testing (MRI and possibly lumbar puncture) and ongoing management, and should be monitored regularly for treatment efficacy and side effects. Supportive care, including physical therapy and counseling, may be added to improve quality of life."
