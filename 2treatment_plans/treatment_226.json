    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based immunosuppression with patient-centered care strategies. The initial management includes high-dose corticosteroids combined with rituximab administered weekly for four doses, given the severity and multi-organ involvement, with close monitoring of symptoms, labs, and potential side effects. This approach aims to induce remission and prevent further organ damage while minimizing corticosteroid exposure. Long-term management will involve tapering steroids cautiously and transitioning to maintenance immunosuppressants like azathioprine or methotrexate, guided by disease activity and tolerance. Patient education on medication adherence, infection prevention, and prompt recognition of worsening symptoms is paramount. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 4-6 weeks initially, with adjustments based on clinical response. The plan emphasizes clear communication, involvement of a rheumatology specialist, and coordination with other healthcare providers to optimize outcomes and maintain safety.",
