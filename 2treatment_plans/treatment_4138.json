    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Hemiplegic migraine.  \nJustification: The patient's episodic symptoms of confusion, heaviness, weakness on one side, and feeling fuzzy are characteristic of neurological aura phenomena seen in migraines, particularly hemiplegic migraine. The absence of other neurological deficits such as vision changes or blackouts, along with no evidence of vascular risk factors or persistent neurological signs, supports a migraine with aura rather than a cerebrovascular event. His age and lack of significant comorbidities reduce the likelihood of stroke, but the episodic nature and neurological symptoms align well with migraine aura manifestations. The episodes are brief and recurrent, which is typical for migraine with aura, especially hemiplegic type.  \nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:  \nHemiplegic migraine END",
    "output": "THINKING: Hemiplegic migraine is a rare but distinct subtype of migraine with aura characterized by unilateral weakness or paralysis that mimics stroke. Management focuses on preventing future attacks and minimizing neurological symptoms, while ensuring that acute symptoms are addressed appropriately. Given the episodic nature and absent signs of a life-threatening process, non-pharmacological strategies such as identifying and avoiding potential triggers (e.g., stress, certain foods, sleep disturbances) are essential. Pharmacologically, preventive treatment options include calcium channel blockers like verapamil, which have shown benefit in reducing attack frequency. Certain anti-epileptic drugs, such as topiramate or valproate, may also be considered if attacks are frequent or disabling. Acute attacks often do not require pharmacologic intervention unless the symptoms are severe; in such cases, standard migraine abortives like triptans are generally avoided in hemiplegic migraine due to the risk of stroke, unless carefully monitored. Overall, a cautious approach emphasizing prevention and trigger control is appropriate, with medication choices tailored to the patient's history and response.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a prophylactic treatment such as verapamil 2.5-5 mg three times daily, titrated gradually based on response and tolerability, to reduce the frequency and severity of hemiplegic migraine episodes. Counsel the patient on identifying and avoiding potential triggers, including stress, sleep deprivation, and certain foods. Educate about the importance of avoiding vasoconstrictive agents or medications that could potentially exacerbate symptoms. Reserve the use of acute pain medications for symptom management if necessary, but avoid triptans or ergotamines unless under specialist supervision. Regular follow-up should be arranged to assess treatment efficacy and safety, and the patient should be advised to seek urgent medical attention if new or worsening neurological deficits occur."
