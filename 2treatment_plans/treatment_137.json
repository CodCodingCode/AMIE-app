    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the recent onset of floaters, flashe\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Posterior Vitreous Detachment with Suspected Retinal Tear, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with patient-centered education and follow-up coordination. The immediate priority is to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist within 24 hours for a dilated fundus examination to confirm the diagnosis and assess for retinal tear or detachment. Should a retinal tear be confirmed, laser retinopexy or cryopexy will be performed to prevent progression. In the meantime, advise the patient to avoid strenuous activity, eye rubbing, or sudden head movements, and educate her about warning signs of worsening such as new or increasing flashes, floaters, or visual loss. Schedule close follow-up with the ophthalmology team post-evaluation, with instructions to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen. This approach aims to preserve vision by prompt diagnosis and intervention, minimize risks associated with retinal detachment, and ensure her understanding and compliance with the plan.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Urge patient to seek urgent ophthalmologic assessment today or within 24 hours.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete ophthalmologist evaluation; initiate laser or other treatment if indicated; educate patient on symptom monitoring.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure resolution or stabilization of symptoms; monitor for recurrence or new issues; reinforce protective eye habits.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of eye evaluation, recognize warning symptoms, and adhere to follow-up appointments.",
