The treatment plan includes urgent referral for pacemaker implantation, as it is the definitive therapy to improve symptoms and prevent progression. In the interim, supportive measures such as hydration and monitoring will be employed. Patient education about the condition and the importance of device placement will be emphasized, addressing anxiety proactively. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks will ensure proper support and adjustment. Monitoring will include symptom assessment, regular rhythm checks, and device function testing once implanted. This approach aims to improve symptoms, prevent adverse events, and enhance quality of life while addressing the patient\u2019s emotional well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent cardiology/electrophysiology consultation for pacemaker evaluation; counsel patient about the need for procedure.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete pacemaker placement; manage anxiety; educate patient thoroughly; establish follow-up schedule.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure pacemaker functionality, symptom resolution, and patient's adaptation.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain AV block, need for pacemaker, symptoms to watch for, and importance of follow-up care.",
