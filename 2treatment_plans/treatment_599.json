    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, my confidence that this is a malignant soft tissue tumor, likely sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, is high. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, due to the rapid progression of symptoms, fixed mass, neurological involvement, and potential for metastasis. - Urgency level: Urgent; prompt diagnostic confirmation and intervention are necessary to prevent further progression and address potential metastatic disease. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: benign soft tissue tumor, peripheral nerveentrapment, or other soft tissue infections or inflammatory processes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with wide margins, possibly combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on staging and histology. - Supporting evidence: Complete surgical resection offers the best chance for local control; adjunct therapies improve survival and reduce recurrence in malignant soft tissue tumors. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's neurological symptoms and emotional distress require multidisciplinary approach including oncologic, surgical, and psychological support. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in definitive treatment; monitor for metastasis, and consider patient's overall health status and comorbidities when planning surgery.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not typically indicated as primary treatment; however, for symptom control, NSAIDs or opioids may be used cautiously. - Rationale for selection: To manage pain temporarily while planning definitive therapy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pain relief within days to weeks following medication initiation. - Key side effects to monitor: NSAID-related gastrointestinal or renal issues; opioid-related sedation or dependency. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Adjuncts like anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin) for neuropathic pain.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Physical therapy to preserve function, psychological support for emotional distress. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of diagnosis, planned interventions, importance of timely treatment, and prognosis. - Lifestyle modifications: Activity modifications to avoid exacerbating symptoms; nutritional support for recovery. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy to address catastrophizing and emotional distress.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-assessment in 1-2 weeks for diagnostic confirmation, then immediate scheduling for definitive treatment planning. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, neurological deficits, imaging results, and psychological well-being. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of neurological deficits, signs of systemic illness, or new metastatic symptoms demanding urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Post-surgical histopathology results, functional status, and imaging to evaluate for recurrence or metastasis.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, and stepwise explanation tailored to her baseline emotional state. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure regarding the multidisciplinary approach and prognosis while honestly discussing risks. - Adherence strategies: Engage her in decision-making, provide written summaries, and ensure understanding. - Family involvement: With her consent, include family for support and assistance with care coordination.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncologist and musculoskeletal tumor specialist within the next few days. - Other healthcare team members: Oncology, radiology, pathology, physical therapy, mental health services. - Community resources: Support groups for sarcoma patients, educational materials on rare cancers. - Insurance/cost considerations: Social work consultation to assist with coverage, referrals, and financial aid options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of a malignant soft tissue tumor, likely sarcoma or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based oncologic management with patient-centered support strategies. The initial priority is to confirm the diagnosis with biopsy and staging studies, followed by surgical excision with wide margins to achieve local control. Adjunct radiotherapy or chemotherapy should be considered based on tumor staging and histology. Pain management with NSAIDs or opioids can provide symptomatic relief, alongside psychological support to address distress. The treatment plan includes multidisciplinary coordination among surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiology, and mental health professionals. Close follow-up with periodic imaging and neurological assessment will ensure timely detection of recurrence or metastasis. Patient education will focus on the importance of treatment adherence, understanding prognosis, and recognizing warning signs for urgent care. The overarching goal is maximal tumor control with preservation of function and quality of life, while proactively managing side effects and emotional wellbeing.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent biopsy and staging imaging; initiate pain management; provide psychological support. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic evaluation; plan and schedule definitive surgical treatment; continue supportive care. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve local tumor control; monitor for recurrence; provide rehabilitative and psychological support. - Patient handout summary: Key points include their diagnosis, treatment plan, importance of multidisciplinary approach, warning signs requiring urgent attention, and available support resources.",
