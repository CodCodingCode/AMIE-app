    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; the patient reports visual discomfort and a recent ocular injury, but no visible signs of severe trauma. - Severity classification: Mild, as there is no pain, visible injury or functional impairment, but subjective symptoms warrant caution. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; initial assessment and conservative management are appropriate, with prompt follow-up if symptoms worsen. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion or conjunctivitis, subtle traumatic lens dislocation, or mild intraocular inflammation.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Expectant management with artificial tears and ocular rest. - Supporting evidence: Conservative measures are effective for mild corneal or conjunctival injuries, promoting healing while minimizing risks. - Patient-specific considerations: Adolescent athlete, likely active, so counseling on activity restriction and monitoring for worsening symptoms is important. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical antibiotics unless evidence of infection; monitor for signs of increased intraocular pressure or vision change.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prescribe preservative-free artificial tears, 1-2 drops every 2 hours during the day. - Rationale for selection: To lubricate and promote healing, reduce discomfort. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 48-72 hours; persistent or worsening symptoms require reassessment. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; watch for allergy to eye drops or signs of irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical NSAID drops or low-dose corticosteroid if inflammation persists, under specialist supervision.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Advise wearing eye protection during sports and avoiding rubbing or scratching the eye. - Patient education priorities: Importance of preserving eye safety, recognizing worsening symptoms (pain, vision loss), and adhering to treatment. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit strenuous activities until symptoms resolve; maintain good hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Use of eye patches is not indicated unless warranted; counseling on activity modifications.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, symptom progression, signs of infection or worsening trauma. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, worsening vision, photophobia, floaters, or signs of ocular penetration\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in discomfort and visual function, stability or resolution of symptoms.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear explanations with visual aids or analogies; invite questions to ensure understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the mild nature of injury, explain signs that require prompt follow-up, and discuss activity restrictions. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize the importance of regular artificial tear use, follow-up appointments, and protecting the eye during activities. - Family involvement: Encourage family to monitor for worsening symptoms and aid in medication adherence and activity restrictions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed\uff1f - Specialist referrals needed: Consult ophthalmology if symptoms persist beyond 1 week, worsen, or if initial exam reveals any complications. - Other healthcare team members: No immediate needs, but ensure coordination with primary care for ongoing systemic assessment. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye safety, injury prevention, and signs of ocular emergencies. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to prescribed eye drops and follow-up appointments; discuss coverage if necessary.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of mild ocular trauma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines conservative, evidence-based measures with patient-centered education. The treatment plan includes prescribing preservative-free artificial tears to promote corneal and conjunctival healing, advising activity restrictions to prevent further injury, and emphasizing eye protection during sports and daily activities. Regular follow-up in 48-72 hours is essential to assess improvement and detect any progression. The patient should be educated on warning signs that necessitate prompt medical attention, such as increased pain, vision changes, or signs of infection. This plan aims to facilitate safe healing, minimize the risk of complications, and promote eye health through vigilant monitoring and patient engagement.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Provide the prescription for artificial tears, counsel on activity restrictions, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Ensure symptom resolution, prevent complications, and monitor for any worsening. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm complete healing, restore normal visual comfort, and reinforce eye safety education. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions on eye drop use, activity precautions, warning signs, and follow-up schedule to promote understanding and adherence.",
