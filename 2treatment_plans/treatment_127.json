    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on symptoms sugges\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of heart failure, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating guideline-directed medications such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, implementing lifestyle modifications like salt restriction, and educating the patient about symptom recognition and medication adherence. Immediate priority is to optimize pharmacotherapy and monitor renal function and electrolytes closely. Follow-up is scheduled within two weeks for medication titration and assessment, with ongoing monitoring of symptoms, weight, and labs. The plan also involves referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation, including potential device therapy, and engaging the patient\u2019s support system. This integrated approach aims to improve functional status, reduce hospitalization risk, and enhance quality of life while carefully managing potential medication side effects and ensuring long-term adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain baseline labs (renal function, electrolytes), start low-dose ACE inhibitor, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Titrate medications to target doses, monitor for side effects, educate patient.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve symptom control, optimize medication therapy, evaluate for device therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication purpose, lifestyle changes, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.",
