    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating atypical antipsychotic medication\u2014specifically risperidone 2 mg daily, titrated as tolerated\u2014along with psychoeducation and supportive therapy. Early management targets symptom reduction and stabilization, with close monitoring for side effects, adherence, and functional improvement.\nInitial management focuses on starting medication and establishing a therapeutic alliance through clear communication, considering the patient's potential cognitive challenges. Follow-up should occur within 2-4 weeks to assess response and tolerability, with ongoing evaluation of symptoms, side effects, and functional status. The plan also emphasizes lifestyle modifications, sleep hygiene, and behavioral interventions like CBT for psychosis, aiming to improve overall prognosis.\nThis approach is designed to achieve symptom control, support recovery, and prevent escalation or complications, while minimizing risks associated with medication side effects. Collaboration with psychiatry specialists and engaging family or support systems are critical for sustainable management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule psychiatric evaluation, initiate risperidone at 2 mg daily, provide psychoeducation, and connect the patient with psychosocial resources.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess medication tolerability, monitor for side effects, evaluate symptom improvement, and reinforce psychoeducation.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve symptom stabilization, functional improvement, and adherence; consider medication adjustment and ongoing therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication use, importance of follow-up, lifestyle tips, and available support resources.",
