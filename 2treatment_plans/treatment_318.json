    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of periosteal fibrosarcoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with adjunct therapies and supportive care. The initial step involves prompt surgical excision with wide margins to achieve local control of the tumor. Postoperative pathology will inform the need for adjuvant chemotherapy\u2014commonly with agents like ifosfamide and doxorubicin\u2014and potential radiation therapy if surgical margins are close or positive.\nConcurrently, supportive measures include physical therapy to maintain limb function, effective pain management, and patient education about signs of recurrence or complications. Regular follow-up with imaging every 3 months for the first 2 years, focusing on MRI or CT scans, will enable early detection of recurrence. The care team should include surgical oncology, medical oncology, rehabilitation specialists, and mental health professionals if needed.\nPatient-specific considerations such as his age, neurological symptoms, and the tumor's behavior shape this plan. Clear communication tailored to his confusion tendency involves simple, repeated explanations, possibly with visual aids, and involving family members for support. The goal is to maximize tumor control and functional preservation while minimizing treatment-related risks, with ongoing monitoring and supportive care to optimize long-term outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging (MRI) for accurate tumor assessment; schedule biopsy if not already done; begin discussions with a multidisciplinary sarcoma team.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical planning; initiate preoperative assessments; provide patient education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve tumor resection; commence adjuvant therapy as indicated; establish a follow-up schedule.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of surgery, follow-up imaging, signs of recurrence, limb care, and the role of multidisciplinary management.",
