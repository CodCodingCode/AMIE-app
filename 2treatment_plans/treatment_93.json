The treatment plan includes symptom management, rehabilitation, risk factor control, and patient education, with careful attention to the patient's neurological and functional status. Initial management focuses on stabilizing symptoms, providing physical therapy, and monitoring disease progression, while establishing long-term support and risk reduction measures. Follow-up care will include neurologic assessment every 3-6 months, with specific attention to gait stability, cognitive function, and vascular health, and patients will be advised on recognizing urgent symptoms. This approach aims to improve functional ability, reduce complication risks, and enhance quality of life while minimizing potential side effects and promoting sustainable management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule baseline neurologic assessment, initiate fall risk precautions, and engage physical therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin targeted physical and cognitive therapies, optimize vascular risk factors, and educate the patient about disease course.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stabilization of symptoms, improve mobility and cognition as possible, and establish a coordinated follow-up plan.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on symptom monitoring, safety advice, importance of adherence to therapy, and when to seek urgent care.",
