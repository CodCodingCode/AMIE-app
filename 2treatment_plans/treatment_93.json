    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate certainty; presentation with eye redness, swelling, tearing following trauma suggests traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, but need to rule out more serious ocular trauma or rupture. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are localized, and there is no mention of vision loss or significant pain, but recent trauma warrants caution. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to evaluate eye integrity and rule out more severe injury such as globe rupture or retinal detachment. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible globe injury, corneal abrasion, or intraocular trauma if symptoms worsen or visual acuity changes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with conservative observation; avoid complicated interventions unless needed. - Supporting evidence: Most subconjunctival hemorrhages and minor conjunctivitis resolve spontaneously within days to a couple of weeks. - Patient-specific considerations: Given trauma history, careful examination is necessary before initiating any treatment; avoid unnecessary eye drops or medications until injury is fully assessed. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid applying pressure or medications that might obscure diagnosis; monitor for worsening symptoms.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: None initially; artificial tears can be used for symptomatic relief. - Rationale for selection: To reduce discomfort and maintain eye moisture without risking further injury. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms may improve within a few days; however, trauma must be monitored closely. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions to eye drops if used; worsening redness, pain, or visual decline indicating need for urgent reassessment. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Prescribe lubricating eye ointments or consider topical corticosteroids only if inflammation persists and after specialist evaluation.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid rubbing eyes, protect the eye from further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Explain that most subconjunctival hemorrhages are benign and resolve spontaneously, but warning signs require prompt attention. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit strenuous activity temporarily; avoid trauma or irritants. - Behavioral interventions: Use of eye protection during sports or activities with risk of injury; reassurance and education about eye health.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, signs of increasing pain, or new visual disturbances. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, intense pain, persistent or worsening redness, signs of globe rupture. - Treatment response assessment: Resolution of redness and swelling, absence of new symptoms, patient-reported comfort.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; repeat key points; confirm understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that trauma-related eye issues are common and usually resolve, but any worsening should prompt immediate care. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize importance of follow-up, avoiding eye rubbing, and protective measures. - Family involvement: Encourage family to assist in monitoring symptoms if needed, especially given patient's behavioral style that may cause confusion or memory issues.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent ophthalmology consultation if suspicion of globe injury, vision change, or if symptoms do not improve in 48 hours. - Other healthcare team members: Consider involving primary care nurse for education and follow-up planning. - Community resources: Traumatic eye injury educational materials; sports safety information. - Insurance/cost considerations: Screen for insurance coverage for specialist visits; provide low-cost or free educational resources if available.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes observation with supportive symptomatic care, such as artificial tears to alleviate discomfort, and emphasizes the importance of protective measures and activity modification. Immediate management focuses on careful eye evaluation to exclude more serious injury, followed by close follow-up within 24-48 hours. The plan involves educating the patient about symptom monitoring, warning signs requiring urgent reassessment, and preventive strategies for future trauma. Long-term management aims for complete resolution without complications, with ongoing monitoring for any changes in vision or symptom severity. This approach minimizes unnecessary medication use, ensures prompt detection of complications, and promotes patient understanding and adherence to safety measures.",
