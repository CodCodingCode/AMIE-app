    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on presentation of redness, swelling, tearing starting 2 days ago after playing soccer, consistent with viral conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms are recent and without vision changes or significant discomfort. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, as there are no signs of vision impairment or corneal involvement. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis or other causes like allergic conjunctivitis, especially if symptoms worsen or do not improve in 7-14 days.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, good hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; supportive management reduces discomfort and prevents secondary infections. - Patient-specific considerations: Soccer player, to prevent eye rubbing and secondary infections, emphasizing hygiene is important. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection is suspected; avoid touching or sharing towels.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: None routinely; topical antivirals are not standard. If secondary bacterial infection develops, consider topical antibiotics. - Rationale for selection: Viral etiology is self-limiting; avoid unnecessary medication. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often resolve within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: If antibiotics used, watch for allergic reactions or contact dermatitis. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antibiotics like erythromycin ointment if bacterial superinfection occurs.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent handwashing, avoiding eye rubbing, using clean tissues to wipe tears. - Patient education priorities: Preventing spread, recognizing worsening signs, avoiding contact lens use. - Lifestyle modifications: Keep bedding and towels clean, avoid sharing personal items. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce hygiene practices, limit touching eyes, and educate on when to seek care.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate if symptoms worsen after 3-5 days or not improving in 7-10 days. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, presence of discharge, vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Decreased vision, severe pain, photophobia, or signs of corneal involvement require immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or significant improvement within 1-2 weeks.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple explanations, emphasizing reassurance and the self-limited nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain that it's viral, clarify that antibiotics are not necessary, and that recovery is expected. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, validate concerns, encourage questions. - Family involvement: Encourage informing close contacts about hygiene measures to prevent spread.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: None routinely; refer to ophthalmology if complications arise. - Other healthcare team members: Reinforce education, possibly involve nurse for patient teaching. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about viral conjunctivitis and hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Emphasize cost-effective supportive care measures and avoid unnecessary medications.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes emphasizing hygiene, symptom relief with artificial tears and cold compresses, and careful monitoring. Immediate management involves educating the patient on prevention and signs of worsening. Over the short term, symptoms should improve within 1-2 weeks, with follow-up to ensure resolution and identify any complications. Long-term goals include preventing recurrence and transmission, maintaining eye health, and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. The complete approach strives to achieve symptom relief, prevent secondary infections, and promote patient understanding and adherence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reinforce hygiene, advise on symptom management, provide patient education material. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom progression, ensure improvement, educate on signs warranting urgent care. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, uphold eye health, avoid unnecessary medication. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize hand hygiene, avoid eye touching, do not share towels, and watch for worsening symptoms needing prompt evaluation.",
