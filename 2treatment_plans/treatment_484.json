    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute hypoxemic crisis potentially due to a diaphragmatic hernia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent stabilization with definitive surgical correction, anchored by evidence-based interventions. The plan emphasizes immediate oxygen supplementation and airway management to correct hypoxia, with vigilant monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular status. Once stabilized, prompt surgical consultation for diaphragmatic repair will be prioritized. Patient education will focus on symptom recognition and the importance of follow-up care, supported by multidisciplinary collaboration with surgeons and respiratory specialists. This integrated approach aims to optimize oxygenation, prevent deterioration, and address the underlying anatomical defect to achieve sustained resolution.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer high-flow supplemental oxygen, prepare for potential airway support or intubation, notify surgical team urgently.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stable oxygenation, transport for definitive surgical repair once stabilized, monitor for re-expansion of herniated organs.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgical repair, ensure full respiratory function recovery, schedule follow-up assessments to evaluate for complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding the condition, recognizing warning signs, importance of timely treatment, and follow-up visits.",
