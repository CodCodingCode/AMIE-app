    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that involves urgent diagnostic colonoscopy for confirmation, followed by staging and multidisciplinary assessment including surgical consultation. Initial management includes addressing anemia with iron supplementation if indicated, optimizing bowel health through diet and hydration, and providing patient education about symptoms and upcoming procedures. The plan emphasizes prompt evaluation to determine the extent of disease, with subsequent interventions such as surgical resection tailored to tumor staging. Follow-up will involve regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels, symptom review, and communication of pathology results. This strategy aims to achieve early tumor management, minimize complications, and support the patient through diagnosis and treatment with clear, empathetic communication.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent colonoscopy, order baseline labs including CBC, iron studies, and tumor markers as indicated.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic workup, initiate iron therapy if anemia confirmed, and discuss surgical options upon diagnosis.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgical resection if feasible, plan adjuvant therapy based on staging, and monitor for recurrence.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the need for colonoscopy, possible surgery, importance of follow-up, dietary advice, and warning signs to watch for.",
