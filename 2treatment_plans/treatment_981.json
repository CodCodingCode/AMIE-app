    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; subconjunctival hemorrhage is a clinical diagnosis supported by history of trauma and typical appearance. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; involving localized redness without pain, vision change, or signs of globe rupture. - Urgency level: Routine care; no immediate threat to vision or eye integrity. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, scleritis, allergic conjunctivitis, or other ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation, reassurance, and symptom management. - Supporting evidence: Most subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve spontaneously within 1-2 weeks without intervention. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient played soccer; likely trauma. No ongoing bleeding or pain suggests mild severity. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary eye medications unless secondary infection or other pathology considered.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: None routinely indicated; artificial tears for comfort if needed; avoid steroids or antibiotics unless secondary issues. - Rationale for selection: Symptom relief; no evidence of infection or inflammation needing pharmacologic intervention. - Expected timeline for improvement: Visible resolution expected in 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: None specific; ensure no new symptoms develop. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None typically required; consider ophthalmology evaluation if no resolution.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid rubbing eyes, and protect eyes from further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Explain the benign nature, typical duration, and signs of complications. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activities, including contact sports, until fully healed. - Behavioral interventions: No specific techniques needed, but advise caution during physical activity.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reevaluate in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Resolution of hemorrhage, absence of new symptoms, visual acuity. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, vision changes, recurrent bleeding, or signs of globe injury. - Treatment response assessment: Visual inspection and patient report of symptom resolution.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, factual explanation of benign nature and expected course. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure, explain the safety and prognosis to reduce anxiety. - Adherence strategies: Encourage follow-up, avoid unnecessary eye touching or strenuous activity. - Family involvement: Inform family if patient prefers; involve them in monitoring signs of worsening if appropriate.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology referral if no improvement in 2 weeks or if symptoms worsen. - Other healthcare team members: Not typically needed unless complicating findings. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye trauma and recovery. - Insurance/cost considerations: Usually minimal; emphasize routine follow-up and reassurance.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines reassurance, observation, and patient education. The primary management involves explaining the benign and self-limiting nature of the condition, advising rest and eye protection, and monitoring for signs of complications. Symptomatic relief can be provided with artificial tears as needed. Attention should be given to avoiding strenuous activities and trauma during healing.  Initial management focuses on reassurance and monitoring, with a follow-up planned in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. The patient should be educated on warning signs such as increasing pain, vision changes, recurrent bleeding, or signs of eye injury, prompting urgent evaluation. If no improvement by 2 weeks or if symptoms worsen, referral to ophthalmology is indicated. This plan aims to ensure safe recovery, minimize anxiety, and prevent further ocular trauma or complications.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reassure patient, advise eye rest, avoid rubbing eyes, and provide educational material on injury care. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Expect resolution within 1-2 weeks; reassess if visible hemorrhage persists. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution; prevent recurrence by avoiding trauma. - Patient handout summary: Reassure that subconjunctival hemorrhages are common, generally resolve on their own, and that no specific treatment is usually necessary unless symptoms change. Encourage protecting the eye from further injury and follow-up as scheduled.",
