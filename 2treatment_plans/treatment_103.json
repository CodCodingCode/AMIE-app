    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  \nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical presentation of hyperglycemi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and correction of electrolyte imbalances, prioritizing rapid stabilization to prevent complications. Given his inconsistent insulin use and substance use history, ongoing education, behavioral support, and close monitoring are crucial. Initial management focuses on rehydration, insulin administration, and electrolyte correction, with continuous reassessment to ensure improvement. Long-term management involves establishing a consistent insulin regimen, addressing substance use, and regular follow-up with endocrinology. Patient education emphasizes recognizing symptoms, adherence to treatment, and lifestyle modifications. This integrated approach aims to rapidly stabilize his condition while setting the foundation for sustainable diabetes management, minimizing risks of recurrent DKA and ensuring overall health stability.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV fluids with isotonic saline, start insulin infusion per protocol, monitor vital signs and labs intensively, and correct electrolytes.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve metabolic stability, educate about diabetes management and substance use, and establish follow-up care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain glycemic control, prevent recurrent DKA episodes, and address behavioral health factors.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about insulin importance, recognizing early DKA signs, hydration, and seeking prompt care if symptoms recur.",
