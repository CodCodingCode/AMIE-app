    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the patient's history of worsening\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of congestive heart failure secondary to mitral atresia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating diuretics to relieve volume overload and ACE inhibitors to improve cardiac remodeling, while emphasizing lifestyle modifications such as sodium restriction and activity pacing. Immediate management involves symptom stabilization with medications, with close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and clinical status. Follow-up care will include regular assessments of symptoms, weight, and vital signs, along with patient education on recognizing worsening signs. The goal is to improve functional capacity, reduce hospitalizations, and optimize quality of life, all while minimizing potential side effects and ensuring sustainable management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Evaluate baseline labs (renal function, electrolytes), start listed medications cautiously, and educate the patient about symptom monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom relief, monitor medication tolerability and side effects, and adjust doses as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize symptoms, improve functional status, and evaluate for advanced therapies if condition progresses.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, dietary restrictions, symptom recognition, and when to seek urgent care.",
