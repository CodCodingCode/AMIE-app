    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary diagnosis of stable angina pectoris is highly probable given symptoms of exertional chest heaviness, with possible associated dizziness and sweating suggesting ischemic episodes. Severity appears to be moderate, as symptoms are worsening over weeks and involve typical activities; however, the patient reports no rest angina at this time. Urgency level is routine, but close monitoring is warranted given the possible progression. Differential considerations include atypical angina, vasospastic (Prinzmetal's) angina, or non-cardiac causes, but current features strongly support coronary ischemia.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment per guidelines includes antianginal medications combined with risk factor modification. Evidence supports the use of beta-blockers as initial therapy, alongside lifestyle changes and control of comorbidities. Supporting data demonstrate improved exercise tolerance and reduced anginal episodes. Patient-specific factors such as possible minimization tendencies necessitate clear communication about symptom importance. No contraindications are apparent presently, but cautious assessment is needed before initiating some agents.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary medication choice is a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, starting at 25-50 mg daily, titrated based on response and tolerability. Rationale: beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand, alleviating anginal symptoms and improving prognosis. Expect partial symptomatic relief within 1-2 weeks. Monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory symptoms, especially if asthma or COPD is present. If beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated, alternatives include calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) or nitrates.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Recommend smoking cessation if applicable, engaging in supervised cardiac rehabilitation, and adopting a heart-healthy diet (DASH or Mediterranean style). Stress management techniques and weight reduction should be emphasized. Educate about the importance of adhering to medication and lifestyle changes. Encourage gradual increase in physical activity within tolerable limits and stress reduction practices.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up in 4-6 weeks to assess symptom control, medication tolerance, and risk factor management. Track anginal frequency, severity, and any new symptoms such as rest pain or those suggestive of unstable angina or adverse effects. Advise patient to seek immediate care if experiencing rest angina, new or worsening symptoms, dizziness, or signs of heart failure.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Use a straightforward, empathetic approach that recognizes her stoic/minimizer style by explicitly emphasizing the importance of reporting all symptoms, even if mild. Clearly explain the rationale for medications and lifestyle changes, and validate her efforts. Encourage involvement of family members for support. Provide written summaries and reinforce that managing symptoms effectively improves quality of life and prevents progression.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Refer for a cardiology consultation within 1-2 weeks to consider further testing (e.g., stress testing, imaging) or possible revascularization if symptoms persist or worsen. Collaborate with primary care and cardiac rehab programs. Consider referral to a dietitian or physiotherapist as appropriate. Ensure all care details are communicated with the patient\u2019s consent, considering potential cost or insurance barriers.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of stable angina pectoris, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a beta-blocker such as metoprolol to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, alongside lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation, heart-healthy diet, stress management, and gradual physical activity. Close follow-up in four to six weeks will be scheduled to assess symptom control and medication tolerance. Education will focus on recognizing worsening symptoms like rest angina or new dizziness, stressing the importance of prompt medical attention if these occur, especially given her stoic/minimizer tendencies. A cardiology referral will be arranged within 1-2 weeks for further assessment and potential advanced interventions. This approach aims to stabilize symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent disease progression while minimizing risks. - Immediate actions (today): Initiate discussion about starting beta-blocker therapy and lifestyle changes, and arrange cardiology referral. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom control, assess medication tolerability, and reinforce lifestyle modifications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain symptom stability, improve risk factor profile, and monitor for potential progression. - Patient handout summary: Key points include medication importance, activity modifications, warning signs requiring immediate care, and follow-up plan.",
