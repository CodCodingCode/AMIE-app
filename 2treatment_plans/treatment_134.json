    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of posterior vitreous detachment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines vigilant observation with patient education and timely specialist assessment. The initial management emphasizes confirming the diagnosis with a dilated retinal examination, ruling out retinal tears or detachment, and providing reassurance. Symptomatic relief may be offered with lubricants if dryness or grit sensation persists. The patient should be instructed to monitor for increasing shadows, persistent flashes, or sudden vision changes. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist should occur within one week to reassess retinal status and ensure no progression. The plan aims to facilitate early detection of complications while minimizing unnecessary interventions. Patient understanding of warning signs and adherence to follow-up are critical to successful management and preservation of vision.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule urgent outpatient retinal examination; educate patient on symptoms to watch for.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm stable retinal status, reassure patient, and ensure no progression.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular eye exams as indicated, monitor for new symptoms, and address any emergent pathology.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include recognizing signs of retinal detachment, importance of prompt follow-up, and reassurance about the benign nature of typical PVD.",
