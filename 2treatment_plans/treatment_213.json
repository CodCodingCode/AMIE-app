Initial management focuses on confirming the diagnosis rapidly through imaging, starting anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin to reduce clot progression, and providing oxygen and analgesia to stabilize her condition. Long-term management includes transitioning to oral anticoagulants, addressing her sickle cell disease proactively, and ensuring adequate follow-up to monitor for complications or recurrence. Patient education will emphasize medication adherence, recognition of warning signs, and lifestyle modifications to minimize risks. Coordination with hematology and pulmonology specialists will optimize her ongoing care, aiming to reduce morbidity and improve her overall prognosis. Immediate actions entail hospital admission for stabilization, with short-term goals of symptom control and diagnostic confirmation, and long-term plans for anticoagulation duration and sickle cell management to ensure sustained health improvements.",
