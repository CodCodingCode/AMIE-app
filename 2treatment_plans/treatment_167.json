    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation and rece\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of dehydration-induced orthostatic hypotension, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt rehydration with isotonic fluids and oral electrolyte solutions, emphasizing increased fluid and salt intake tailored to the patient's recent diarrhea. Initial management focuses on restoring intravascular volume to alleviate dizziness and fatigue, with close monitoring of blood pressure and hydration status. Over the short term, reassessment ensures symptom resolution, while long-term goals include maintaining adequate hydration, recognizing dehydration signs early, and avoiding precipitants. Follow-up in 24-48 hours will monitor clinical response, with adjustments made as necessary. Patient education will stress hydration importance, gradual position changes, and prompt reporting of worsening symptoms. This approach aims to effectively reverse hypovolemia, prevent recurrence, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks related to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Encourage increased oral fluid intake, including electrolyte solutions; educate on postural changes.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution and normalize blood pressure responses; stabilize hydration status.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain hydration, monitor for recurrent episodes, and educate on dehydration prevention.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of hydration, recognizing dehydration signs, gradual postural adjustments, and when to seek medical care.",
