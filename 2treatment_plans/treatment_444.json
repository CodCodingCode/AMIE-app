    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the detailed presentation with notable compulsive behaviors, insight, and home behavior, I am quite confi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on exposure and response prevention, along with pharmacotherapy using an SSRI such as sertraline at 50 mg daily, with monitoring for side effects and efficacy. The patient should be engaged in stress management techniques and lifestyle modifications to reduce overall anxiety and facilitate therapy. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 4-8 weeks to assess symptom reduction, medication tolerability, and functional improvement. Patient education will emphasize the nature of OCD, expected treatment timeline, and importance of adherence, with possible family involvement to support recovery. This integrated approach aims to reduce compulsive behaviors, improve social functioning, and sustain long-term management while minimizing side effects and barriers to care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Discuss treatment plan, start sertraline or arrange referral for CBT, provide psychoeducation materials.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Adjust medication dosage as needed, initiate CBT sessions, monitor side effects and initial response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve significant reduction in compulsive rituals, improve social and occupational functioning, and sustain medication and therapy adherence.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about OCD, treatment options, importance of consistency, and when to seek urgent care.",
