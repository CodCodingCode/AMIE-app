    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the lesion description\u2014pigmented linea\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of subungual melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt referral for nail biopsy by a dermatologist or surgical oncologist, which is essential for definitive diagnosis and staging. Patient education will focus on explaining the urgency and necessity of the biopsy in clear, reassuring language, given communication barriers. Initial management emphasizes immediate specialist consultation within one week, with emphasis on monitoring for symptoms suggestive of progression or metastasis.\nFollow-up care will involve reviewing biopsy results and planning further treatment if melanoma is confirmed, which may include surgical excision with clear margins and staging workup. Throughout this process, the patient\u2019s understanding and compliance will be supported through simple explanations, emotional reassurance, and involving family members if appropriate. Coordination with healthcare providers ensures timely diagnostics and appropriate management pathways.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Contact dermatology or surgical oncology for urgent appointment; explain the need for biopsy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Obtain biopsy results, determine staging, and initiate appropriate surgical treatment if confirmed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete excision, monitor for recurrence, and provide ongoing skin surveillance.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of timely diagnosis, biopsy procedure, follow-up steps, and early detection of symptoms indicating changes or metastasis.",
