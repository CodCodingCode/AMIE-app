    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis of acute alcoholic pancreatitis, evaluate severity, and plan treatment accordingly. The presentation with sudden severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, vomiting, jaundice, and recent increased alcohol intake strongly suggests acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol use. Severity assessment is essential to guide intervention\u2014mild, moderate, or severe\u2014based on systemic indicators like organ failure or necrosis. Immediate care involves hydration, pain control, and alcohol withdrawal management, with careful monitoring. Laboratory and imaging studies will confirm the diagnosis and severity. Long-term management focuses on abstinence, nutritional support, and addressing alcohol dependence.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute alcoholic pancreatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initial aggressive hydration, pain control, alcohol cessation support, and monitoring for complications, with careful attention to the patient\u2019s alcohol use and potential for deterioration. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient's condition through IV fluids, analgesics, and supportive care while confirming diagnosis and severity through labs and imaging. Long-term management emphasizes alcohol abstinence, nutritional support, and counseling for alcohol dependence. Follow-up care will include regular clinical assessments, repeat labs, and potential referrals to specialists such as gastroenterology and addiction services to ensure sustained recovery. This approach aims to reduce morbidity, prevent complications, and support long-term health maintenance, while minimizing risks such as volume overload, medication side effects, or missed deterioration signs.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV fluid resuscitation, administer analgesics (e.g., IV opioids), monitor vitals, and assess for jaundice or other physical findings. Consider starting antiemetics if vomiting persists. Arrange for laboratory tests (amylase, lipase, liver function tests, CBC, electrolytes) and abdominal imaging (ultrasound or CT scan). - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain control, maintain adequate hydration, begin alcohol withdrawal management, and prevent complications such as necrosis or infection. Educate patient on alcohol abstinence and nutrition. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Support sustained alcohol abstinence, nutritional rehabilitation, and address possible underlying liver disease or biliary issues. Schedule regular follow-up and monitor for signs of recurrent pancreatitis or liver dysfunction. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of hydration, pain management, alcohol cessation, recognizing warning signs, and attending follow-up appointments for ongoing assessment.",
