    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, as symptoms align with panic disorder with cannabis-induced anxiety likely contributing. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, given frequent episodes and potential underreporting, impacting functioning. - Urgency level: Routine care, but monitor for escalation to severe symptoms or safety concerns. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory conditions, substance withdrawal, or other anxiety disorders.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy if indicated. - Supporting evidence: CBT has robust evidence for reducing panic symptoms; medications like SSRIs are effective when therapy alone is insufficient. - Patient-specific considerations: Patients with stoic-minimizer style may underreport symptoms; addressing perception and engagement is key. - Contraindications or cautions: Caution with benzodiazepines due to dependency risk, especially in patients minimizing symptoms.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily, titrated as tolerated. - Rationale for selection: SSRIs are first-line for panic disorder, with favorable safety profiles; suitable given patient profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom reduction often seen in 4-6 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: GI symptoms, sexual side effects, sleep disturbances; monitor mood and suicidality. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Venlafaxine (SNRI), or augmentation with buspirone, or considering referral to psychiatry for other options.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Initiate CBT focusing on panic management, stress reduction, and addressing cannabis-related anxiety. - Patient education priorities: Explain the nature of panic attacks, the role of substance use, and importance of lifestyle changes. - Lifestyle modifications: Encourage regular exercise, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Breathing retraining, exposure techniques, possibly referral to behavioral therapist.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 4 weeks to evaluate medication tolerability and symptom progression. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom frequency/intensity, medication side effects, substance use patterns. - Red flag symptoms: Suicidality, severe depression, worsening anxiety, or any physical symptoms suggesting alternative diagnoses\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Use standardized scales (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7) and patient reports.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Given stoic-minimizer, emphasize a non-judgmental, collaborative approach; validate their experiences. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss stigma, fears about medications, encourage open dialogue. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimen, set clear expectations, involve patient in goal setting. - Family involvement: Educate family members if appropriate, especially to support lifestyle changes and monitor changes.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Consider referral to psychiatrist if pharmacotherapy is not tolerated or if symptoms persist beyond initial treatment. - Other healthcare team members: Behavioral health therapist for CBT, possibly a substance use counselor. - Community resources: Support groups for anxiety or substance use, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify medication coverage, discuss affordable options, consider generic medications.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of panic disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an SSRI such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily, combined with engaging the patient in cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on panic management and cannabis-related anxiety. Initial management emphasizes symptomatic relief and lifestyle modifications, with close monitoring over the next 4 weeks for medication tolerability and symptom improvement. Follow-up will involve reassessment of symptoms, side effects, and substance use patterns, with adjustments as needed. Education will be tailored to the patient's stoic-minimizer style, emphasizing the importance of open communication and adherence. Coordination with behavioral health specialists and consideration of additional psychiatric support will be key for long-term stability. This approach aims to reduce episode frequency, improve functional impact, and address underlying contributing factors while minimizing medication side effects and fostering patient engagement.",
