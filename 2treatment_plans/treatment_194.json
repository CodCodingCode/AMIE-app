Immediate actions include hospital admission for hydration with isotonic IV fluids, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and close monitoring. Once stabilized, the patient should undergo pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt procedure), which is the gold standard and usually curative. Postoperatively, gradual refeeding should be initiated, with ongoing assessment of hydration, feeding tolerance, and incision site healing. Follow-up should occur within 24-48 hours post-surgery for initial recovery assessment, then at one week to monitor longer-term outcomes. Education should focus on explaining the condition, the safety and effectiveness of surgery, and alerting caregivers to red flag symptoms such as recurrent vomiting or signs of infection. Coordination with pediatric surgery and nursing staff is essential from the outset\u2019s planning. The overall goal is prompt diagnosis, surgical correction, and careful postoperative care to ensure rapid recovery and normal growth.",
