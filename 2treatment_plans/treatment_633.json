    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing, onset after playing soccer, consistent with viral conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, given symptoms started 2 days ago with no mention of significant vision impairment or pain. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, as viral conjunctivitis is usually self-limited but requires symptomatic management. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis (would likely have purulent discharge), allergic conjunctivitis, and possibility of more serious eye or systemic issues if symptoms worsen or fail to resolve.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, hygiene measures. - Supporting evidence: As viral conjunctivitis is viral in etiology, antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial superinfection develops. Supportive care alleviates symptoms and protects ocular comfort. - Patient-specific considerations: No mention of contact lens use or immunocompromised state, so standard management applies. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection is suspected; monitor for worsening.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (prefer preservative-free), used as needed. - Rationale for selection: Provides symptomatic relief, lubricates eyes, and is safe. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; ensure eye drops are preservative-free to prevent irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines or vasoconstrictors for symptom relief if allergic component suspected.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand hygiene, avoid touching eyes, do not share towels or pillows. - Patient education priorities: The contagious nature of viral conjunctivitis; importance of hygiene. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, avoid rubbing eyes, avoid contact with others\u2019 eye fluids. - Behavioral interventions: Proper eye hygiene, discard or clean contaminated items.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: If no improvement by 5-7 days or if symptoms worsen, reevaluate. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity, visual changes, signs of secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision loss, photophobia, increasing redness, or purulent discharge\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or persistence.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing symptom expectations and hygiene. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about self-limiting nature, importance of hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Encourage routine eye hygiene and medication use as directed. - Family involvement: Educate family or caregivers about transmission prevention.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Only if symptoms worsen or complicated by other ocular pathology. - Other healthcare team members: None required at this point. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on viral conjunctivitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Cost-effective symptomatic care, no unnecessary prescriptions.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive, non-pharmacological care with patient education. The primary interventions include the use of preservative-free artificial tears for symptomatic relief, strict eye hygiene, frequent hand washing, and avoidance of eye contact and shared items. The focus is on symptomatic management with reassurance, monitoring for signs of secondary infection or deterioration, and patient education on transmission prevention. This plan aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent spread, and ensure uncomplicated recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): counsel the patient on hygiene measures, provide artificial tears, and educate about symptom monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): symptom resolution within a week, prevented transmission, and no progression to bacterial superinfection. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): complete resolution and restore normal ocular comfort, ensuring no residual complications. - Patient handout summary: importance of hygiene, use of artificial tears, watch for worsening symptoms, and confirm follow-up if no improvement in 5-7 days.",
