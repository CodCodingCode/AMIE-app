    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excision with preventative skin care and vigilant follow-up. The initial management involves arranging an urgent excisional biopsy with appropriate margins to confirm diagnosis and assess tumor depth. Postoperative counseling will focus on sun protection and regular skin self-examination. Follow-up includes wound assessment within weeks and periodic skin exams every 3-6 months for the first several years to detect recurrence or new lesions. The plan emphasizes patient education, lifestyle modifications, and early referral to specialized surgical or oncology services if needed. This strategy aims to achieve complete removal of the lesion, minimize recurrence risk, and promote long-term skin health and surveillance.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule surgical excision for lesion; educate patient on sun protection; provide skin monitoring advice.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete histopathological diagnosis; ensure proper wound healing; reinforce preventive measures.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence; maintain routine skin exams; adapt preventive strategies as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the importance of timely removal, sun safety, follow-up schedule, and recognizing suspicious changes.",
