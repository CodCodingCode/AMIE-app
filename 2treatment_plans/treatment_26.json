    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of verrucous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and presenting features suggesting oral cavity involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical management with patient education and close follow-up. The initial step involves obtaining diagnostic biopsy to confirm the malignant nature and margins. If confirmed, surgical excision with clear margins is the definitive treatment, aiming to preserve function and achieve complete removal. Adjunctive radiotherapy may be considered if surgical margins are inadequate or if surgery is contraindicated.\nAlongside surgical treatment, I advise lifestyle modifications including cessation of tobacco and alcohol, which are significant risk factors for recurrence and new lesions. Symptomatic management with NSAIDs can be used cautiously for pain if needed. Patient education will focus on the importance of follow-up, recognizing recurrence symptoms, and avoiding risk factors. Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled at 1-2 weeks post-operation and then every 3 months during the first year to monitor healing, functionality, and detect early signs of recurrence.\nCoordination involves referring the patient promptly to an oral/maxillofacial surgeon or ENT specialist for definitive intervention, and involving supportive services such as speech and nutrition therapy as needed. Clear communication tailored to the patient's stoic-minimizer personality involves respectful reassurance, emphasizing the importance of treatment adherence for optimal outcomes.\nImplementation:\n- Immediate actions: Arrange biopsy, and if confirmed, schedule surgical consultation.\n- Short-term goals: Complete surgical excision, achieve clear margins, and educate the patient.\n- Long-term objectives: Monitor for recurrence, maintain optimal oral health, and support lifestyle changes.\n- Patient handout: Summarize diagnosis, treatment plan, the significance of follow-up, and lifestyle modifications to support healing and reduce recurrence risk.",
