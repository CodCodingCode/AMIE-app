    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant melanoma with ulceration, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines definitive surgical management with staging and follow-up care. The primary intervention is wide local excision of the lesion with appropriate margins, along with sentinel lymph node biopsy to assess regional metastasis. Adjunctive considerations include detailed pathological review to guide further treatment options. Post-operative follow-up should be scheduled within 2-4 weeks to assess wound healing and plan further management. Long-term surveillance involves regular skin examinations every 3-6 months during the first two years, with patient education on sun protection, self-examination, and prompt reporting of new symptoms. In cases of advanced or unresectable disease, referral to medical oncology for immunotherapy or targeted therapy will be necessary. This plan aims to achieve optimal local control, accurate staging, and early detection of recurrence, while addressing patient understanding and involvement for better adherence and outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange surgical consultation for wide local excision and biopsy; provide patient with educational handouts on melanoma.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision and pathology review; initiate follow-up plan.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm no evidence of recurrence or metastasis; continue regular surveillance.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of follow-up, sun protection, awareness of new or changing lesions, and adherence to scheduled visits.",
