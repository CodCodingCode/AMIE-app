    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High confidence; the clinical presenta\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiation of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to improve nutrient absorption, along with dietary modifications emphasizing low-fat, high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods. Nutritional supplementation and possible multivitamins should address deficiencies. Immediate management focuses on symptom control, nutritional stabilization, and hydration. Long-term management will involve regular monitoring of weight, symptoms, and labs, with adjustments to therapy as needed. Patient education will emphasize correct enzyme use, dietary adherence, and recognition of warning signs requiring urgent care. Coordination with specialists such as gastroenterologists and dietitians will optimize outcomes while minimizing side effects and ensuring sustainable long-term management of this condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, provide dietary counseling, and baseline labs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom relief, stabilize or gain weight, correct nutritional deficiencies, and ensure medication adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain nutritional health, prevent complications, and optimize quality of life with ongoing follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Clear instructions on enzyme dosing, dietary modifications, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.",
