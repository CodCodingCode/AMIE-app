The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1g IV daily for 3 days), plasmapheresis sessions to remove pathogenic antibodies, and immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. This combined approach has been shown to reduce mortality and control active bleeding.\nInitial management prioritizes stabilizing respiratory function, monitoring hemoptysis, and assessing renal involvement. Close inpatient monitoring should be maintained with daily clinical assessments, labs (CBC, renal function, antibody titers), and oxygen support as needed. Educate the patient about the importance of adherence, symptom awareness, and potential side effects of medications. Arrange outpatient follow-up in 1-2 weeks, with ongoing evaluation of treatment response and adjustment.\nImplementation guidance includes immediate actions today: initiating plasmapheresis if feasible, administering corticosteroids, ensuring respiratory support, and obtaining necessary labs. Short-term goals (1-4 weeks) focus on controlling bleeding, reducing antibody levels, and stabilizing pulmonary and renal function. Long-term objectives (3-6 months) involve tapering immunosuppressants, monitoring for relapse, and addressing any organ damage.\nThis approach aims to achieve remission, prevent disease progression, and ensure patient safety, with ongoing monitoring and multidisciplinary involvement.",
