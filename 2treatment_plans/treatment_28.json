    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Testicular Torsion\nJustification: The sudden onset of a swollen, tender, and high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex are classic signs of testicular torsion, a surgical emergency caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, leading to ischemia. The patient's associated systemic symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, and a feeling of sickness support the severity of acute torsion. The absence of redness, warmth, or skin discoloration suggests that inflammation (e.g., epididymitis) is less likely at this stage. The lack of recent trauma also points toward torsion rather than injury. The rapid progression and characteristic clinical findings strongly indicate testicular torsion.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nTesticular Torsion END",
    "output": "THINKING: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that requires urgent intervention to prevent irreversible ischemic damage to the testis. Timely surgical detorsion and fixation are the definitive treatments. Since the diagnosis has been established based on characteristic clinical findings, prompt action to reduce the torsion is crucial. Non-pharmacological measures include immediate referral to urology or emergency surgery for manual detorsion or orchiopexy. Pharmacologically, analgesics such as IV opioids can be administered to manage severe pain, and antiemetics may be used to control nausea and vomiting. It is vital to avoid delay in definitive surgical management, as testicular viability diminishes rapidly with time.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves immediate referral to urology or emergency surgical services for prompt surgical exploration and detorsion of the testicle, with bilateral orchiopexy to prevent recurrence. Parallel to this, administer IV analgesics (e.g., opioids like morphine or hydromorphone) to manage pain and consider antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea. While these measures are supportive, they do not replace the urgency of surgical intervention. It is essential to educate the patient and caregivers about the urgency of the situation and arrange for rapid transportation to a facility capable of performing definitive surgical management without delay."
