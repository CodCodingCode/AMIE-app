    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Infantile Epilepsy (Potentially West Syndrome or focal seizures)\nJustification: The infant displays recurrent stereotyped episodes characterized by sudden generalized stiffening lasting 1-2 minutes, sometimes with concurrent sounds, followed by a post-ictal state where the child appears dazed, less responsive, and fatigued. The episodes are unpredictable, not associated with triggers, and there is no family history of neurological disorders. The symptoms observed are consistent with seizure activity, particularly seizure types involving tonic stiffening. Developmental delays and weakness could be part of a broader epileptic encephalopathy or underlying neurological condition. The absence of a family history does not exclude primary epilepsy but suggests a possible structural or developmental origin.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nInfantile Epilepsy (possibly West Syndrome or focal seizures)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The infant's episodes are characteristic of seizure activity, potentially indicating Infantile Epilepsy such as West Syndrome or focal seizures. Given the recurrent, stereotyped nature of the episodes with tonic stiffening and post-ictal changes, prompt initiation of appropriate treatment is essential to reduce seizure frequency and prevent further developmental impact. West Syndrome is often associated with hypsarrhythmia on EEG; however, this diagnosis cannot be confirmed without EEG. First-line treatment typically includes initiating a medication that has proven efficacy in controlling infantile seizures, such as vigabatrin, especially if West Syndrome is suspected, or levetiracetam as a broader option. Non-pharmacological strategies include ensuring a safe environment to prevent injury during episodes and discussing developmental support as needed. It is also crucial to refer the infant promptly for an EEG and neuroimaging to confirm the diagnosis, identify any structural abnormalities, and guide further management. Close follow-up is necessary to monitor treatment response and adjust therapy accordingly.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should initiate treatment with an antiepileptic medication, such as levetiracetam, due to its favorable side effect profile and ease of use in infants. Concurrently, the infant should be referred for urgent EEG to characterize the seizure activity and confirm the diagnosis further. If West Syndrome is suspected based on EEG findings (hypsarrhythmia), consider starting vigabatrin, particularly if tuberous sclerosis is identified or strongly suspected, while monitoring for potential adverse effects. During this period, ensure a safe environment to prevent injury during seizures, educate the caregivers about seizure management and warning signs, and coordinate with a pediatric neurologist for ongoing evaluation and treatment adjustments. If neuroimaging has not yet been performed, arrange for brain MRI to identify structural abnormalities contributing to seizure activity. Regular follow-up visits should assess seizure control, development, and medication tolerance."
