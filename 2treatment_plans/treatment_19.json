    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder with Dissociative Features, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines antipsychotic medication with psychotherapy and supportive care. The initial management includes starting risperidone 2-4 mg daily, coupled with psychoeducation, stress reduction, and behavioral interventions such as CBT tailored for psychosis. The plan emphasizes close follow-up in 2 weeks to evaluate medication efficacy and side effects, with ongoing monitoring every month thereafter. Key educational points focus on medication adherence, symptom recognition, and safety. Support from family or caregivers should be incorporated with the patient's consent to enhance adherence and safety. Coordination with psychiatry, mental health therapists, and community resources will facilitate sustained recovery and functional improvement while minimizing side effects and ensuring comprehensive care.",
