    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Testicular Tumor (most likely germ cell tumor, such as seminoma or non-seminomatous germ cell tumor)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of a gradually enlarging, firm, non-transilluminant, and non-tender testicular swelling over a month, without systemic symptoms or signs of infection, raises concern for a neoplastic process. The absence of transillumination suggests a solid mass rather than fluid. The patient's age (35) aligns with the common age range for testicular tumors. The lack of systemic symptoms lowers suspicion for infectious or inflammatory causes, and the stable size with position suggests a solid lesion rather than a hydrocele or varicocele. The recommended ultrasound will help confirm the presence of a mass, its characteristics, and involvement of surrounding structures, guiding further diagnosis and management.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nTesticular Tumor\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The primary step in managing a suspected testicular tumor is prompt diagnostic confirmation via testicular ultrasound, which provides details about the size, composition, and local extent of the mass. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the standard of care involves referral to a urologist for surgical management, typically a radical inguinal orchiectomy, which serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It is crucial to avoid biopsy because of risks of tumor seeding and to ensure accurate histopathological diagnosis. Given the suspicion of a germ cell tumor, further staging with serum tumor markers (AFP, \u03b2-hCG, LDH) is essential to inform prognosis and additional treatment needs, if indicated. The patient should also be counseled about the importance of tumor staging, and appropriate follow-up should be planned. Psychosocial support and reassurance are important, as the diagnosis can be distressing. Pharmacological treatments are not initiated until pathological diagnosis and staging are complete, but in cases of metastatic disease, chemotherapy may be required later.\n\nANSWER: The initial management should involve urgent referral to a urologist for prompt scrotal ultrasound to confirm the presence and characteristics of the testicular mass. Concurrently, order serum tumor markers (AFP, \u03b2-hCG, LDH) to assist in staging and prognosis. Advise the patient to avoid any manipulation of the testicle and to seek urgent urological consultation within the next few days. Prepare the patient for potential surgical intervention (radical inguinal orchiectomy), which is both diagnostic and curative for localized germ cell tumors. Provide reassurance and discuss the likely course of management, emphasizing the importance of definitive treatment and subsequent staging investigations (such as CT scans for metastasis) to guide further therapy. If metastasis is confirmed, coordinate with oncology for appropriate chemotherapy protocols. Throughout, offer psychological support and ensure the patient understands the need for timely specialist consultation."
