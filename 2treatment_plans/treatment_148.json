    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on presentation of eye redness, swelling, tearing following trauma, consistent with traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage; confirm if any visual acuity changes or pain are present. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; traumatic conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage are typically self-limited, but severity depends on extent of hemorrhage, swelling, and any associated pain. - Urgency level: Routine care needed unless vision is affected or signs of orbital trauma or globe rupture. - Differential considerations: Corneal abrasion, orbital fracture, intraocular injury, more serious ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment: Conservative management with observation, artificial tears, and cold compresses. - Supporting evidence: Most traumatic conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage resolve spontaneously; symptomatic treatment alleviates discomfort. - Patient-specific considerations: Given recent trauma, monitor for worsening symptoms or other ocular injuries. - Contraindications/cautions: Avoid NSAIDs or systemic anticoagulants unless indicated for other reasons, as they may prolong hemorrhage.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (e.g., preservative-free lubricating eye drops), used as needed for comfort. - Rationale: Non-invasive, effective for symptomatic relief of irritation and tearing. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within days; hemorrhage resolves within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Eye irritation or allergy to drops. - Alternatives if needed: Topical antihistamines if allergic conjunctivitis complicates presentation, though less likely here.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary interventions: Protective eye shielding, rest, avoiding strenuous activity that could exacerbate hemorrhage. - Patient education: Inform about signs of worsening (vision changes, increasing pain, recurrence), avoid rubbing eye. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and activity modification until healing ensues. - Behavioral interventions: Educate about injury prevention in sports; advise on eye safety in future activities.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, visual acuity, absence of increasing swelling or pain. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, worsening pain, increasing swelling, signs of orbital involvement \u2014 seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief and visible reduction in hemorrhage or conjunctivitis signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation tailored to baseline patient, emphasizing reassurance and early warning signs. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss prognosis, importance of follow-up, and injury prevention. - Adherence strategies: Encourage adherence by explaining the benefits of symptom management and safety precautions. - Family involvement: If appropriate, inform family members about warning signs for prompt intervention.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals: Refer to ophthalmology if symptoms worsen or do not improve in 1-2 weeks, or if there are signs of intraocular injury. - Healthcare team members: Primary care follow-up; consider optometrist consultation if needed. - Community resources: Eye safety education, sports safety programs. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to prescribed drops and follow-up appointments covered or affordable.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes conservative symptom relief with artificial tears, cold compresses, eye protection, and activity modification, ensuring close monitoring for any signs of worsening or underlying ocular injury. Initial management focuses on symptomatic relief and observation, with scheduled follow-up within one week and prompt escalation if symptoms progress. Patient education emphasizes injury prevention, signs warranting urgent care, and adherence to safety measures. This approach aims to promote natural healing, minimize complications, and ensure safe recovery of ocular integrity.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer cold compresses, initiate artificial tears, advise patient to avoid strenuous activity and eye rubbing, and provide safety education. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom resolution, reassess eye status at follow-up, and ensure no development of complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full recovery with no residual effects, reinforced eye safety habits for future sports activities. - Patient handout summary: Key points include activity modification, symptom monitoring, signs of worsening, and when to seek urgent care.",
