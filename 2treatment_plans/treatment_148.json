    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiation of a disease-modifying therapy such as interferon beta-1a or ocrelizumab to reduce relapse risk and slow disease progression, supported by regular imaging and laboratory monitoring. Non-pharmacological interventions focus on physical therapy to maintain mobility and symptom management. Patient education will emphasize medication adherence, awareness of relapse signs, and lifestyle modifications including exercise and stress reduction. Follow-up should occur every 3 months initially, with neurologic assessments and MRI scans annually, while remaining vigilant for worsening symptoms. Clear communication will involve empathetic discussion of treatment benefits and side effects, addressing patient concerns proactively. Coordination with neurologists, ophthalmologists, therapists, and support groups ensures comprehensive care. This integrated approach aims to stabilize neurological function, improve quality of life, and minimize disease impact long-term while carefully monitoring for potential adverse effects and adjusting the plan as needed.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with MRI and labs, discuss treatment options with the patient, and initiate appropriate education.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin DMT, schedule follow-up appointments, and start physical therapy if indicated.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease stabilization, assess for side effects, and adjust therapy if necessary.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about MS, treatment rationale, importance of adherence, symptom monitoring, and follow-up schedule.",
