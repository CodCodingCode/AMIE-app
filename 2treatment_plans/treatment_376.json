    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given the history of rheuma\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rheumatic aortitis with neurovascular inflammatory involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone intravenous pulses followed by oral prednisone with a gradual taper, along with close monitoring of neurological and systemic symptoms. The goals are to rapidly suppress inflammation, prevent vascular and neurological damage, and establish long-term immunosuppressive therapy as needed. Short-term management also involves patient education on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and recognizing adverse effects. Follow-up will occur within 1-2 weeks with ongoing laboratory and clinical assessments. Coordination with rheumatology, neurology, and possibly cardiology is essential for optimal outcomes. This approach aims to stabilize the inflammatory process, preserve neurological function, and improve overall prognosis, while minimizing treatment-related risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit for pulse corticosteroid therapy, perform baseline labs, and initiate neurological and cardiovascular assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe response to corticosteroids, monitor inflammatory markers, adjust immunosuppressants as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission with stable neurological and cardiovascular status, and establish maintenance therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication importance, warning signs to report immediately, appointment schedule, and lifestyle recommendations.",
