    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of a meniscal tear, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initial activity modification, use of NSAIDs for pain relief, and a tailored physical therapy program focusing on strengthening and proprioception. This approach emphasizes conservative management given the patient's age and symptom profile, with close monitoring for symptom progression. The follow-up will occur within 2-4 weeks to assess progress, with specific attention to pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms. Patient education will focus on symptom awareness, activity adjustments, and adherence to therapy. If symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative measures, or if instability or significant locking develops, referral to orthopedics will be considered for further evaluation, including possible imaging or surgical options. This strategy aims to optimize functional recovery while minimizing risks and supporting long-term joint health.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily), advise rest and ice application, schedule follow-up in 2 weeks.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduction of pain and swelling, improved joint function, initiation of physical therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Return to normal activity levels, resolution of locking episodes, sustained joint stability.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Use NSAIDs as directed, avoid activities that worsen knee pain, apply ice to reduce swelling, participate in physical therapy, and report any worsening symptoms or new concerns promptly.\"",
