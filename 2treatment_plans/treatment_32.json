    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating supplemental oxygen therapy, administering inhaled nitric oxide or sildenafil as indicated for pulmonary hypertension, and preparing for early surgical assessment. Immediate priorities are stabilization of oxygenation, monitoring for signs of heart failure, and avoiding hypoxia or hypotension. Long-term management involves regular outpatient follow-up with pediatric cardiology, ongoing monitoring of oxygen saturation and pulmonary pressures, and family education to recognize worsening symptoms. This approach aims to improve oxygenation, reduce pulmonary hypertension, and optimize surgical outcomes while minimizing risks. Care coordination with specialists and supporting services will be essential for comprehensive care and family support.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Stabilize patient with oxygen, monitor vital signs, prepare for echocardiogram, and notify pediatric cardiology.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete definitive imaging, initiate medical therapy, monitor clinical response, and plan surgical intervention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve surgical correction if indicated, ensure growth and development, and establish ongoing pulmonary hypertension management.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of oxygen therapy, medication adherence, recognition of danger signs, scheduled follow-up, and caregiver involvement.",
