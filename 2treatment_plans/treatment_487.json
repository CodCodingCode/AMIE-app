    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Prim\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Influenza, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care measures such as hydration, rest, and symptomatic relief with analgesics and antipyretics. If the patient presents within 48 hours of symptom onset, initiating antiviral therapy with oseltamivir is advised to reduce symptom duration and prevent complications. Given the mild to moderate severity and the patient's overall health, outpatient management with close monitoring is appropriate.\nInitial management focuses on symptomatic relief, hydration, and strict observation for signs of worsening or complications. The patient should be educated on the importance of hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and staying home to prevent transmission. Follow-up is recommended in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen, particularly signs of respiratory distress or secondary infection. Communicate clearly with the patient, emphasizing monitoring and early reporting of concerning symptoms, tailored to his stoic minimizer personality to ensure compliance.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions: Prescribe antivirals if within 48 hours, advise supportive care, and provide education.\n- Short-term goals: Symptom improvement within 3-5 days, continuity in hydration and rest.\n- Long-term objectives: Complete recovery, prevention of complications, and continued good hygiene practices.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, symptom monitoring, hygiene, and when to seek urgent care.\nThis approach aims to minimize symptoms, prevent complications, and promote patient understanding and adherence for optimal recovery.",
