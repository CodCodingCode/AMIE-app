    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; postpartum bleeding with large clots and symptoms indicative of postpartum hemorrhage. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe, given large blood clots and symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, which suggest significant blood loss. - Urgency level: Immediate; requires prompt intervention to prevent shock. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Hemodynamic instability, uterine atony, retained placental tissue, vaginal or cervical lacerations.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Uterine massage and administration of uterotonics (e.g., oxytocin). - Supporting evidence: Uterotonics are proven to reduce bleeding by promoting uterine contraction; uterine massage enhances effectiveness. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient reports a soft uterine tone, which could indicate uterine atony as the cause. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor for allergic reactions; avoid extraneous uterotonics if bleeding is due to trauma or lacerations.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Intravenous oxytocin 10 units administered slowly, following initial uterine massage. - Rationale for selection: Oxytocin is the first-line, safe, effective agent for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. - Expected timeline for improvement: Bleeding should decrease within minutes to hours; if not, further steps needed. - Key side effects to monitor: Hypotension, tachycardia, water retention with high doses. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Misoprostol, ergometrine, or carboprost, depending on response and contraindications.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Uterine massage, removing clots if present, elevating legs. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing signs of ongoing bleeding, dizziness, or lightheadedness. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, adequate hydration once stable. - Behavioral interventions: Calm reassurance, involve family in support and understanding.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess vital signs and bleeding every 15-30 minutes initially, then hourly. - Monitoring parameters: Blood pressure, pulse, uterine firmness, bleeding volume, signs of shock. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing bleeding, hypotension, chest pain, severe dizziness. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in bleeding, stable vital signs, improved uterine tone.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple explanations with empathetic language; incorporate storytelling or relatable analogies. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about treatment safety, acknowledge emotional distress. - Adherence strategies: Reiterate importance of follow-up, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Educate family members on warning signs and supportive care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Obstetrician/gynecologist urgently for ongoing management and possible surgical intervention. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for continuous monitoring, possibly a social worker for emotional support. - Community resources: Postpartum support groups, counseling services if needed. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss costs of medications and tests; arrange follow-up appointments.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate administration of uterotonics (such as IV oxytocin), uterine massage, and continuous monitoring of vital signs and bleeding. Given her report of a soft uterus, careful assessment is needed to confirm uterine tone and identify bleeding sources. Supportive measures like elevating legs and reassurance are key. Close observation in the hospital setting is essential, with plans for rapid escalation if bleeding worsens or signs of shock develop. Follow-up involves reassessment within the next hour, with ongoing stabilization, laboratory evaluation (CBC), and eventual referral to an obstetrician for further management. Education will focus on recognizing warning signs and ensuring emotional support. This approach aims to control bleeding, stabilize hemodynamics, and prevent progression to severe shock, while addressing her physical and emotional needs.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV access, administer oxytocin, perform uterine massage, monitor vital signs closely. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize hemostasis, complete relevant labs, and evaluate for possible surgical intervention if needed. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure recovery, provide postpartum support, and address any complications or anemia. - Patient handout summary: Key points include signs of ongoing bleeding, importance of monitoring symptoms, reassurance about treatment, and when to seek urgent care.",
