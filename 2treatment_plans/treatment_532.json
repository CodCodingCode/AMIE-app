    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach for nodular melanoma. First, confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and urgency; then select evidence-based treatments, including surgical excision as the standard of care. Consider the need for staging and possible adjuvant therapy based on Breslow thickness and lymph node involvement. Incorporate patient-specific factors like lesion location and communication style into patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. Ensure coordination with specialists such as dermatologic surgeons and oncologists. The overall goal is to excise the tumor completely, stage appropriately, and plan for long-term surveillance with patient understanding.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision of the lesion with appropriate margins based on Breslow thickness, staging workup including sentinel lymph node biopsy if indicated, and subsequent management tailored to tumor staging. Initial management focuses on complete removal to prevent local progression and metastasis, while establishing an ongoing surveillance plan. Follow-up care will include regular skin examinations, imaging as indicated, and patient education regarding skin self-examination and signs of recurrence. This approach is designed to achieve complete tumor removal, minimize recurrence risk, and support long-term health while minimizing surgical and treatment-related risks.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange for wide local excision biopsy with margins per guidelines; initiate staging workup if indicated. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm pathology results; discuss further treatment (e.g., sentinel lymph node biopsy); plan follow-up appointments. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete staging, initiate regular surveillance and patient education; evaluate for adjuvant therapy if high-risk features are present. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of complete surgical removal, regular skin checks, notifying healthcare providers of any new or changing lesions, and understanding staged treatment and follow-up plans.",
