    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's clinical presentation of progressive weakness, unsteady gait, difficulty with fine motor tasks, dysarthria, and visual disturbances are consistent with demyelinating neurological conditions such as MS. The exacerbation with fatigue, ongoing symptoms over time, and absence of episodic loss of consciousness or convulsions further support this. Although initially rare in adolescents, MS is the most probable diagnosis given the constellation of neurological signs and symptoms, especially considering the progressive course and multifocal nature.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in this patient, the treatment plan should aim to modify the disease course, manage symptoms, and support functional abilities. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, or newer agents should be considered to reduce relapse frequency and slow progression, tailored to the patient's age, disease activity, and comorbidities. Symptomatic treatment for fatigue (e.g., amantadine or modafinil), spasticity (e.g., baclofen or tizanidine), and gait assistance (physical therapy, assistive devices) should also be incorporated. Additionally, education about disease management, lifestyle modifications such as regular gentle exercise, adequate rest, and stress reduction are essential. Monitoring for medication side effects and ensuring immunizations are up to date (with caution due to immunomodulatory drugs) should be part of ongoing care. Collaboration with neurology for consideration of advanced therapies and regular follow-up is important, but initial management can be initiated by the primary care physician or psychiatrist with appropriate patient education and support.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating disease-modifying therapy, such as interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, after consulting with a neurologist, to reduce relapse frequency and disease progression. Symptomatic management should include prescribing medications for fatigue (like amantadine or modafinil), spasticity (baclofen or tizanidine), and facilitating gait and balance through physical therapy and possibly assistive devices. Educate the patient on energy conservation techniques, stress management, and the importance of regular, moderate exercise. Encourage routine follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy and side effects, and ensure immunizations are current, avoiding live vaccines if immunomodulators are used. Collaboration with neurology and multidisciplinary support services is recommended for comprehensive care."
