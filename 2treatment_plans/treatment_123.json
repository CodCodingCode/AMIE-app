    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of gastric ulcer with active bleeding, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent stabilization with IV fluids and proton pump inhibitors, urgent endoscopic evaluation for definitive bleeding control, and close monitoring of vitals and hemoglobin levels. Initial management focuses on hemodynamic stabilization, acid suppression, and preparing for definitive endoscopic treatment, while planning outpatient follow-up for ulcer healing and underlying cause management. Follow-up care will include serial assessments, patient education on recognizing rebleeding signs, and coordination with gastroenterology and surgical teams as needed. This approach aims to control bleeding effectively, promote ulcer healing, and prevent recurrence, while addressing patient and family concerns to ensure adherence and understanding.",
