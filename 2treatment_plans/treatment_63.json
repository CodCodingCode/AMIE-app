    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with anterior cerebral artery syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines rapid, evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The plan includes urgent administration of intravenous thrombolytics (tPA) if within the treatment window and no contraindications, followed by close neurological monitoring and early initiation of rehabilitative therapies. This is supported by current stroke guidelines aimed at minimizing brain injury and optimizing functional recovery. Long-term management emphasizes control of vascular risk factors\u2014such as hypertension, diabetes, and lipid abnormalities\u2014through lifestyle modifications, medication adherence, and regular follow-up. Patient education will focus on understanding stroke, recognizing symptoms of recurrence, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Engagement with multidisciplinary teams\u2014including neurology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and social services\u2014will ensure coordinated care. Immediate actions involve confirming eligibility for thrombolysis, arranging neuroimaging, and stabilizing the patient. Short-term goals are to monitor neurological improvement, manage complications, and initiate rehabilitation. Long-term objectives include preventing recurrence and maximizing functional independence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain brain imaging (CT or MRI) to confirm ischemia and rule out hemorrhage; assess contraindications for thrombolysis; prepare for possible tPA administration if eligible.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate physical and occupational therapy; monitor neurological status and blood pressure; adjust secondary prevention medications; educate patient and family.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve optimal control of vascular risk factors; maintain adherence to medications; promote social and psychological recovery; reassess for further rehabilitation needs.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain stroke, emphasize the importance of timely treatment, outline lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and signs warranting urgent reassessment.",
