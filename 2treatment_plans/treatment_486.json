    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lung carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent diagnostic confirmation via biopsy and staging, stabilization of hemoptysis, symptom management, and initiation of oncologic therapy tailored to staging. Immediate priorities involve controlling bleeding, relieving symptoms, and ensuring adequate oxygenation. Long-term management will focus on definitive cancer treatment, supportive care, and monitoring for disease progression or treatment-related side effects. Follow-up will include regular clinical assessments, imaging, and lab evaluations, with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs requiring immediate medical attention. This approach aims to optimize survival outcomes, improve quality of life, and provide holistic support while minimizing treatment-related risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Stabilize airway, evaluate severity of hemoptysis, get urgent imaging (CT chest), consult oncology and thoracic surgery teams.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis histologically, initiate tumor staging, address bleeding control, and start appropriate oncologic treatment.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete initial oncologic therapy, assess treatment response, and plan ongoing palliative or curative strategies accordingly.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of early diagnosis, treatment options, symptom monitoring, and when to seek emergency care.",
