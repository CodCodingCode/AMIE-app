The treatment plan includes immediate referral for a dilated retinal examination, with consideration for laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy if a tear is confirmed. Observation and symptom monitoring are essential, alongside strict diabetic control to minimize retinal progression. Initial management focuses on urgent assessment within 24-48 hours to prevent progression to retinal detachment, and ongoing follow-up will assess for symptom stabilization or escalation. Patient education will emphasize symptom recognition, activity modifications, and the importance of adherence to follow-up appointments. This approach aims to preserve vision, minimize complications, and ensure coordinated care with ophthalmology, while also addressing underlying diabetic retinopathy.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Ensure rapid appointment with ophthalmology; instruct patient to avoid strenuous activity and report any new symptoms\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete retinal examination; implement any procedural treatments; optimize diabetic management\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular ophthalmic follow-up; control of diabetic retinopathy; monitor for retinal health stability\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize urgent symptoms; understand the importance of prompt eye exam; adhere to diabetic treatment plan; follow ophthalmologist recommendations",
