    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Parkinson's Disease\nJustification: The patient's presentation of a progressive unsteady gait with frequent falls, difficulty with small movements (bradykinesia), mild rigidity in the legs, facial masking, decreased arm swing, and speech changes are characteristic features of Parkinson's disease. Autonomic symptoms such as dry mouth and orthostatic dizziness further support this diagnosis. The absence of cognitive decline and eye movement abnormalities makes other neurodegenerative conditions less likely at this stage.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nParkinson's Disease END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the primary goal is to improve motor symptoms, enhance quality of life, and minimize disability. Early pharmacological treatment typically involves initiating a dopamine replacement therapy, with levodopa being the most effective option. Adjunctive medications such as dopamine agonists or MAO-B inhibitors can be considered based on patient age, comorbidities, and symptom severity. Non-pharmacological interventions, including physical therapy to improve gait and balance, occupational therapy for activities of daily living, and speech therapy to address speech changes, are integral to comprehensive care. Education about disease progression, fall prevention strategies, and regular follow-up are essential for optimal management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating levodopa therapy to address motor symptoms, with dosing tailored to the patient's weight, age, and severity of symptoms. Consider adding a dopamine agonist or MAO-B inhibitor if appropriate to potentially reduce levodopa requirements and delay motor fluctuations. Non-pharmacological interventions should include referral to physical therapy for gait and balance training, occupational therapy for daily activities, and speech therapy if speech impairment develops. The patient should also be educated about fall prevention, lifestyle modifications, and the importance of adherence to therapy. Regular follow-up to monitor effectiveness, side effects, and disease progression is essential, with adjustments to medication regimens as needed."
