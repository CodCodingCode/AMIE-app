    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (dry form)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of gradually worsening central vision with blurriness, difficulty reading small print, and a dull, washed-out visual appearance points toward a central macular pathology. The absence of flashes, floaters, peripheral vision loss, ocular redness, pain, or trauma makes retinal detachment or inflammatory causes less likely. The lack of systemic risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension does not exclude age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), especially the dry form, which is common in older adults. The duration (approximately six weeks) and the pattern of progression further support a diagnosis of early or intermediate dry ARMD, which typically presents as gradual deterioration of central vision.\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (dry form) END",
    "output": "THINKING: In managing dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the primary goal is to slow disease progression and preserve residual vision. Currently, there is no proven pharmacological treatment to reverse or significantly improve dry AMD, unlike the wet form which may benefit from anti-VEGF injections. The mainstay of management involves lifestyle modifications and nutritional support. Evidence supports the use of AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) 2 supplements\u2014comprising antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, zinc, copper, lutein, and zeaxanthin\u2014to reduce the risk of progression from intermediate to advanced AMD. Additionally, patient education about visual aids, safety measures, and regular ophthalmic follow-up is essential. Encouraging a diet high in leafy green vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids, along with smoking cessation and UV protection, are important non-pharmacologic interventions. While no pharmacological treatment can repair existing damage, these strategies can help slow the progression and maintain quality of life. \n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this patient with dry age-related macular degeneration should focus on implementing nutritional supplementation with an AREDS2 formula to help slow disease progression. The patient should be counseled on the importance of dietary modifications, including increasing intake of leafy greens and omega-3 fatty acids, and advised to avoid smoking and excessive sun exposure. Regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist is essential for ongoing assessment of disease progression and visual function. Additionally, referral to low vision services and education on adaptive devices can help maximize remaining vision and improve daily functioning. Currently, no pharmacologic treatment exists to reverse dry AMD, but close monitoring and lifestyle optimization can help manage the condition effectively."
