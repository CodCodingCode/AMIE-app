    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary d\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious mastitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines empiric antibiotic therapy with supportive care measures. The plan includes initiating oral antibiotics such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin for 10-14 days, along with warm compresses, nipple hygiene, and adequate rest. Close follow-up within 48-72 hours is essential to assess clinical response, with ongoing evaluation until symptoms resolve. Educate the patient on medication adherence, signs of worsening infection, and importance of follow-up. Reinforce supportive measures such as hydration and stress management. In case of lack of improvement or worsening symptoms, re-evaluate promptly for possible abscess formation or alternative diagnoses, and consider specialist referral if needed. This integrated approach aims to resolve the infection effectively while minimizing complications.",
