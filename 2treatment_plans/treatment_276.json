    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent activation of revascularization procedures such as PCI or thrombolytic therapy, initiation of vasopressors like norepinephrine to stabilize blood pressure, and administration of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications to prevent further thrombus formation. Supportive care involves continuous hemodynamic monitoring, oxygen supplementation, and management of arrhythmias.\nInitial management focuses on immediate stabilization with hemodynamic support, rapid revascularization, and close monitoring of vital parameters. Long-term management will include cardiac rehab, lifestyle modifications, and addressing any underlying risk factors. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled within the first 24-48 hours for inpatient assessment and then outpatient cardiology care within 1-2 weeks.\nPatient education will emphasize recognition of symptoms, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes. Family members will be engaged to support the patient's recovery process, especially given the patient's confusion. Care coordination involves cardiology transfer, ICU management, and referral to cardiac rehab services.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Activate emergency response system for PCI or thrombolytics, begin vasopressors and antiplatelet therapy, secure airway, provide oxygen, and prepare for ICU transfer.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve hemodynamic stabilization, complete revascularization, control symptoms, and initiate early cardiac rehab.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Optimize cardiac function, implement lifestyle changes, prevent recurrence, and monitor for heart failure or arrhythmias.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding MI and shock, importance of medications, follow-up schedule, and lifestyle advice for heart health.",
