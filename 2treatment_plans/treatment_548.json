    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; the presentation of conjunctival redness, swelling, tearing, and recent onset after activity suggests viral conjunctivitis, but initial eye pain or vision changes could indicate other issues. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; symptoms involve conjunctival redness, tearing, and swelling without signs of corneal involvement or vision impairment. - Urgency level: Routine care unless worsening symptoms or severe pain develops. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, ophthalmic foreign body, or more serious ocular conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive management with artificial tears, cold compresses, and good eyelid hygiene. - Supporting evidence: These measures alleviate symptoms and promote recovery in viral conjunctivitis, which is self-limited. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety may require reassurance and clear education to prevent unnecessary concern. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed; prevent touching or rubbing eyes.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: No antiviral or antibiotic drops are routinely recommended for viral conjunctivitis; if severe or bacterial suspicion arises, consider ophthalmology consultation before antibiotics. - Rationale for selection: Viral conjunctivitis resolves spontaneously; antibiotics do not shorten course and may contribute to resistance. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 7-14 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions to any topical agents if used. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Supportive care continues; consider antibiotic drops if bacterial etiology is confirmed.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent handwashing, avoiding eye touching, using clean towels and pillows. - Patient education priorities: Emphasize contagiousness, hygiene practices, and avoid sharing personal items. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and hydration; avoid contact sports until symptoms resolve. - Behavioral interventions: Reassurance about expected recovery; stress reduction techniques if anxiety is prominent.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, pain severity, vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Persisting or worsening pain, decreased vision, photophobia, or eyelid swelling spreading. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom reduction, decreased redness, and tears.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, reassuring language emphasizing the self-limited nature, and address concerns promptly. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain contagiousness and preventive measures to ease anxiety. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, set expectations about symptom duration. - Family involvement: Encourage family education to support hygiene and reduce transmission.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology if symptoms worsen or if diagnosis uncertain. - Other healthcare team members: No immediate need, unless comorbid ocular conditions. - Community resources: Educational materials on eye hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Recommend over-the-counter symptom remedies; avoid unnecessary prescriptions.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive management with patient education and reassurance. The plan entails encouraging frequent handwashing, using artificial tears and cold compresses for symptom relief, and maintaining good eyelid hygiene. No antibiotics are indicated unless bacterial infection is suspected, and antiviral medications are generally unnecessary. Follow-up in 3-5 days is advised to monitor symptom progression. Educate the patient about the contagious nature of the condition and preventive measures to avoid transmission, especially given their anxiety profile. If symptoms worsen or do not improve by 2 weeks, or if warning signs such as vision changes or severe pain develop, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is necessary. This approach aims to promote symptom resolution while minimizing unnecessary medication use and addressing patient concerns effectively.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about viral conjunctivitis, advise symptomatic measures, and emphasize hygiene. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, prevent transmission, and reassurance about recovery timeframe. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain ocular health, prevent future infections, and manage anxiety related to eye health. - Patient handout summary: Key points include hygiene practices, symptom expectations, when to seek urgent care, and reassurance about recovery.",
