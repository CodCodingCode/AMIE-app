    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Congenital facial nerve palsy, likely due to congenital facial nerve agenesis or hypoplasia (e.g., Moebius syndrome or isolated facial nerve paralysis)\nJustification: The patient's longstanding, stable facial asymmetry since infancy indicates a congenital origin. The absence of progression, associated skin changes, swelling, or recent symptom worsening suggests this is not an acquired process. Occasional abnormal sensations during facial movements could reflect aberrant nerve development or sensory nerve involvement, which can be transient or mild in congenital anomalies. The lack of other neurological, developmental, or syndromic features reduces the likelihood of a broader neurogenic or syndromic condition. The stability over time, absence of active inflammation or acute changes, supports a congenital, static etiology.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCongenital facial nerve palsy due to nerve agenesis or hypoplasia (such as Moebius syndrome or isolated facial paralysis)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given that the diagnosis indicates congenital facial nerve palsy due to agenesis or hypoplasia, the condition is static and non-progressive. Since there is no evidence of active inflammation, infection, or secondary causes, the main goals are to improve facial symmetry, enhance functional abilities such as speech and eating, and address psychological or social concerns related to facial asymmetry. Non-pharmacological interventions like facial physiotherapy and surgical options can be considered, but these are typically planned with specialists. Pharmacological treatment is not indicated, unless there are secondary issues such as depression or social anxiety that may require respective management. As a primary care physician or psychiatrist, initial management should focus on supportive measures and referral to specialists, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this patient with congenital facial nerve palsy involves educating the patient about the nature of their condition and reassuring them about its stability. Initiate referral to a facial plastic or reconstructive surgeon for assessment of surgical options such as nerve transfer, muscle transposition, or static procedures (e.g., smile reanimation procedures) if the patient desires cosmetic or functional improvement. Incorporate facial physiotherapy aimed at maintaining muscle tone and preventing contractures. Address any psychosocial concerns through counseling or support groups, and consider psychiatric evaluation if there are signs of depression or social anxiety. Pharmacological therapy is generally not indicated solely for congenital facial palsy but can be addressed if secondary psychological issues are identified. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach with specialist input will optimize functional and aesthetic outcomes."
