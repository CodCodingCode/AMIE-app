    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), likely a form of a familial, inherited progressive spastic gait disorder.\n\nJustification: The patient's presentation of gradually worsening numbness, tingling, and significant weakness in the lower limbs, with increasing falls and difficulty walking, points towards a motor weakness affecting the lower extremities. The absence of bladder, bowel, or visual symptoms suggests the pathology is primarily localized to the corticospinal tracts without significant anterior horn or sensory system involvement. The family history, particularly an affected uncle, supports an inherited pattern, commonly seen in HSP, which often manifests in early adulthood with progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. The lack of upper motor neuron signs such as hyperreflexia and spasticity has not been explicitly confirmed, but the described gait issues and symptom progression are characteristic of HSP. Given the progressive nature, familial pattern, and clinical features, HSP is the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia END",
    "output": "THINKING: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by lower limb spasticity and weakness, often with a familial pattern. Since there is currently no cure for HSP, treatment focuses on symptom management and maintaining functional independence. Non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy and regular exercise aim to improve mobility, reduce spasticity, and prevent contractures. Assistive devices like walking aids can enhance safety and mobility as weakness progresses. Pharmacological options, such as muscle relaxants like baclofen or tizanidine, may be considered to alleviate spasticity and improve ease of movement, especially if spasticity causes significant discomfort or impairs gait. Since this is a primary care or psychiatric setting, a realistic plan would involve initiating physical therapy and considering medication if spasticity is bothersome, while also monitoring for potential side effects.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating referral to physical and occupational therapy focused on stretching, strengthening, and mobility training to address spasticity and functional decline. If spasticity is significantly impacting gait or comfort, consider starting a low-dose muscle relaxant such as baclofen or tizanidine, with careful monitoring for side effects. Encourage the use of assistive devices (e.g., cane, walker) as needed to improve safety. Regular follow-up to reassess neurological status, spasticity severity, and functional ability is essential. Patient education about the progressive nature of HSP and the importance of ongoing supportive therapies should also be provided."
