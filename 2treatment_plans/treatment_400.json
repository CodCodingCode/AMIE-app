First, confirm the diagnosis and assess severity: hypertensive encephalopathy is a hypertensive emergency with neurological symptoms, likely sev\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypertensive encephalopathy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt blood pressure reduction with intravenous antihypertensive agents, close neurological monitoring, and patient education on blood pressure control. Initial management focuses on reducing systolic blood pressure by approximately 25% within the first hour, then gradually normalizing over subsequent hours to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion. Long-term management emphasizes strict blood pressure control through oral antihypertensive medications, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up. Follow-up care will include frequent blood pressure monitoring, neurological assessments, and evaluation of underlying causes of hypertension. This approach aims to reverse neurological symptoms, minimize risk of recurrent hypertensive crises, and prevent future end-organ damage, while carefully avoiding rapid BP drops that could worsen cerebral ischemia.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IV antihypertensive (e.g., nicardipine infusion) to lower BP cautiously; assess neurological status; prepare for continuous monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stabilized BP within target ranges; resolve neurological symptoms; start oral antihypertensive therapy; educate patient about hypertension.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain controlled BP; prevent recurrence; monitor for organ damage; reinforce lifestyle changes.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of blood pressure control, adherence to medication, recognizing symptoms of hypertensive crisis, and lifestyle modifications.\nSTOP HERE.",
