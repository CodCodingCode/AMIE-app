    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of venous insufficiency with venous ulcers, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating compression therapy with appropriately fitted compression stockings, combined with regular wound cleaning and dressing changes using suitable wound dressings to promote healing. Pain management should be tailored, primarily using analgesics as needed, with close monitoring for signs of infection warranting antibiotics. Patient education should focus on leg elevation, skin hygiene, activity modification, and recognizing signs of wound infection or worsening symptoms. Compression therapy should be carefully monitored, especially in the context of any arterial disease, and adjusted accordingly. Follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks are essential to evaluate wound progress, edema reduction, and patient adherence.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Assess wound size and exudate; initiate compression with proper fit; educate the patient on wound care and leg elevation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in ulcer size and exudate; improve edema; ensure patient understands and adheres to compression and hygiene practices.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete ulcer healing, maintain skin integrity, and prevent recurrence through ongoing compression and lifestyle modifications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of compression therapy, wound hygiene, activity adjustments, and early signs of complications requiring prompt medical attention.\nThis integrated approach aims to optimize ulcer healing, alleviate symptoms, and prevent recurrence while ensuring patient safety and engagement.",
