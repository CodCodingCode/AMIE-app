    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral pneumonia caused by Influenza A H5N2 with zoonotic implications, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based antiviral therapy with supportive care and vigilant monitoring. The primary intervention is initiating oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, to reduce disease severity. Supportive measures include rest, hydration, humidified air, and sleep position optimization. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognition of worsening symptoms such as increasing shortness of breath, chest pain, or altered mental status, and strict infection control precautions. Close follow-up is planned within 48-72 hours to assess response and detect any deterioration. Additional care involves assessing sleep-disordered breathing, possibly involving sleep specialists if nocturnal symptoms persist or worsen. Coordination with pulmonology or infectious disease specialists will be initiated if needed. Family involvement and education are essential to support adherence and early detection of complications. This integrated plan aims to minimize disease progression, optimize recovery, and address zoonotic transmission risks.",
