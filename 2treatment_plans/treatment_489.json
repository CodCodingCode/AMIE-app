    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of port-wine stain with secondary vascular and inflammatory changes, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines careful observation, diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate follow-up. Initially, I suggest detailed dermoscopic examination and consideration of biopsy by a dermatologist to accurately distinguish between benign vascular lesions and potential amelanotic melanoma. If confirmed benign, management will focus on monitoring the lesion\u2019s stability, with patient education on skin self-examination and sun protection. In case of suspicious features or confirmed malignancy, surgical excision or other definitive treatments will be pursued.\nInitial management includes arranging specialized dermatology evaluation within two weeks, with clear instructions on observing for changes. Follow-up will be scheduled every 3-6 months to assess for lesion stability. Patient education will emphasize the importance of monitoring and understanding warning signs such as growth, bleeding, or color change. The plan aims to ensure early detection if malignant transformation occurs while minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Provide skin self-examination tips; schedule dermatology referral.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete dermoscopic evaluation and biopsy if indicated.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm benign nature or initiate appropriate treatment if there's progression.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of monitoring lesion changes, sun safety, scheduled follow-up, and when to seek urgent care.",
