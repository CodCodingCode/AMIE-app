    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the hallmark positional vertig\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes performing canalith repositioning maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver, to relocate displaced otoliths and resolve vertigo episodes. Supportive care with vestibular suppressants like meclizine may be used temporarily if symptoms are severe, but the primary focus is on physical maneuvers. Patient education emphasizes safety measures, symptom expectations, and the benign nature of the condition. Follow-up in 1\u20132 weeks will assess symptom resolution and balance improvement. Additional referral to vestibular therapy or specialist consultation is warranted if symptoms persist. This approach aims to restore balance, reduce fall risk, and improve quality of life while monitoring for potential central causes given the recent worsening of symptoms and the patient's underlying polycythaemia.",
