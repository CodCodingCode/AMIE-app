    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Infiltrating basal cell carcinoma, NOS is \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infiltrating basal cell carcinoma, NOS, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient-centered strategies. The primary intervention is complete surgical excision, preferably Mohs micrographic surgery if available, to ensure maximal tissue preservation and highest cure rates. Postoperative wound care and sun protection education are essential to prevent recurrence. In cases where surgery is contraindicated or incomplete, consideration of systemic hedgehog inhibitors such as vismodegib can be made. Regular follow-up at 2-4 weeks post-procedure and subsequently every 6-12 months is critical to monitor healing and detect any recurrence early. Throughout, clear communication about treatment expectations, wound care, sun safety, and the importance of adherence will support optimal outcomes. The plan aims to achieve complete tumor removal, minimize aesthetic and functional morbidity, and prevent future skin cancers.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange for surgical excision with appropriate margins and pathology review. Provide patient education on sun protection and wound care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm complete wound healing, monitor for complications, and deliver ongoing sun safety counseling.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure no recurrence, monitor skin regularly, and reinforce sun protection habits.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of surgical removal, wound care, follow-up visits, and sun safety measures to prevent future skin cancers.",
