    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Very confident; traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage following recent trauma (soccer injury) aligns with clinical presentation. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; localized redness, swelling, tearing without signs of globe injury or vision loss. - Urgency level: Routine care, but with instructions for immediate follow-up if worsening occurs. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, intraocular injury, angle recession, other ocular trauma complications.  Now I'll select evidence-based treatments. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Conservative management with reassurance, artificial tears, and avoiding further trauma. - Supporting evidence: Most subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, and traumatic conjunctivitis often improves with symptomatic care. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety may amplify concern; reassurance and clear communication are essential. No contraindications for standard topical treatments in uncomplicated cases. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for signs of increasing ocular pressure, vision changes, or signs of intraocular injury.  Pharmacological interventions: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (lubricating eye drops) as needed for comfort. - Rationale for selection: Safe, non-invasive, effective for soothing conjunctival irritation. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within several days; expect resolution in 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; ensure no ocular surface trauma or allergy. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider anti-inflammatory drops if signs of significant inflammation, but typically unnecessary initially.  Non-pharmacological interventions: - Primary non-drug interventions: Protect eye from further trauma, avoid rubbing, and limit screen time. - Patient education priorities: Explain that subconjunctival hemorrhage and conjunctivitis usually resolve spontaneously, and emphasize the importance of avoiding further injury. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, eye protection during activities, stress reduction techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Practice eye safety; reassurance to reduce anxiety; if needed, referral to counseling for ongoing anxiety.  Monitoring & follow-up strategy: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, appearance of eye, vision changes, signs of increased intraocular pressure. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, increasing redness, discharge, or signs of intraocular injury. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in redness, tearing, and swelling; patient comfort level; resolution of hemorrhage.  Patient communication strategy: - Communication approach: Use calm, reassuring language emphasizing typical recovery; clarify any uncertainties. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss that symptoms are common after trauma, reassure about prognosis, and explain warning signs. - Adherence strategies: Encourage follow-up, prescribe artificial tears regularly, and reassure about the benign nature of the condition. - Family involvement: Invite family support if needed for reassurance and observation, especially considering patient's anxiety.  Coordination & referrals: - Specialist referrals needed: None urgently; refer to ophthalmology if persistent symptoms, visual changes, or signs of intraocular injury. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care follow-up; consider mental health support if anxiety persists. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about eye trauma and reassurance handouts. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure prescriptions are affordable; discuss no-cost or low-cost options for eye drops.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes reassurance, symptomatic relief with artificial tears, eye protection, and careful observation. Initial management focuses on symptom alleviation and avoiding further trauma while educating the patient about the typical course of healing. Follow-up care will include re-evaluation in approximately one week to monitor for symptom resolution or progression, with instructions for immediate care if warning signs like vision changes or increasing redness occur. This approach aims to promote natural healing, reduce anxiety through clear communication, and prevent complications. It also emphasizes the importance of eye safety and mental health support if needed.",
