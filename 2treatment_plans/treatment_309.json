    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of spontaneous tension pneumothorax, I recommend immediate emergent intervention with needle decompression followed by chest tube placement to relieve intrathoracic pressure and stabilize the patient. Supplemental oxygen should be administered promptly to improve oxygenation. The patient should be monitored continuously for respiratory and hemodynamic stability, with plans for definitive surgical consultation within the next 24-48 hours. Education on recognizing symptoms of recurrence and lifestyle modifications, especially smoking cessation, are essential for long-term management. Follow-up should include clinical reassessment within 24-48 hours, with ongoing outpatient care for lung re-expansion and prevention of recurrence. Family members should be involved in education to support the patient's recovery and adherence to medical advice. This comprehensive approach aims to prompt stabilization, ensure definitive treatment, and promote prevention of future episodes.",
