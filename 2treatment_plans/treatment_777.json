    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome (likely exogenous or endogenous cortisol excess)\nJustification: The patient's clinical presentation includes persistent hunger, rapid weight gain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, a round face, and subjective muscle weakness\u2014all features compatible with cortisol excess. The absence of physical signs such as purple striae, easy bruising, or excessive hair suggests early or mild cortisol excess, or a form of Cushing's syndrome without overt physical features. Notably, there is no history of medication use like corticosteroids, indicating possible endogenous Cushing's syndrome (e.g., adrenal or pituitary origin). The subtle facial rounding and fatigue are common early manifestations. Further testing (e.g., cortisol levels, dexamethasone suppression test) would typically follow, but based on current data, cortisol excess remains the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nCushing's Syndrome\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome, the primary goals are to confirm diagnosis through appropriate testing and to initiate treatment after diagnosis is established. Before starting pharmacologic therapy, it's essential to differentiate between endogenous causes (such as pituitary adenomas or adrenal tumors) and exogenous sources. Initial steps include ordering measurements of serum cortisol (e.g., 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test) to confirm hypercortisolism. Once confirmed, identifying the underlying etiology typically requires further imaging (such as pituitary MRI or adrenal imaging). In the meantime, supportive care should be provided, including advising on measures to manage weight, blood glucose, and blood pressure if elevated. Non-pharmacological interventions involve patient education about the condition and the importance of follow-up testing. Pharmacological therapy can be considered once the etiology is clarified. If surgery (e.g., transsphenoidal resection for pituitary causes or adrenalectomy for adrenal tumors) is appropriate and feasible, it remains the definitive treatment. If surgery is delayed or contraindicated, or if the cause is ectopic or unknown, medications such as steroidogenesis inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, metyrapone) may be used to control cortisol levels. Throughout, close coordination with an endocrinologist is advised to optimize management and timing of definitive treatment.\n\nANSWER: The initial treatment plan involves confirming the diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome through outpatient testing, including serum late-night salivary cortisol, 24-hour urinary free cortisol, and low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Once confirmation is achieved, further imaging studies (pituitary MRI, abdominal CT or MRI) should be pursued to determine the underlying cause. Supportive measures include counseling on lifestyle modifications, monitoring and managing potential metabolic complications such as hypertension and hyperglycemia, and educating the patient about the condition. If the etiology points to a resectable tumor (pituitary or adrenal), referral to an endocrinologist for surgical evaluation is essential. In cases where surgery is delayed or contraindicated, the use of steroidogenesis inhibitors like ketoconazole or metyrapone may be initiated under specialist supervision to mitigate cortisol excess. Throughout, ongoing monitoring of clinical status and biochemical parameters should guide further management, with coordination to endocrinology specialists for definitive treatment planning."
