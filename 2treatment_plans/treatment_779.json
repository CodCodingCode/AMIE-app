The key intervention is the administration of intramuscular ceftriaxone 25-50 mg/kg (maximum 125 mg) as a single dose to effectively treat gonococcal infection. Supportive care includes gentle eye irrigation, maintaining eye hygiene, and close monitoring for symptom improvement. Immediate follow-up within 24-48 hours is essential to assess response and identify any complications. Clear communication and reassurance tailored to the parent\u2019s concerns are critical to ensure adherence and alleviate anxiety. The plan aims to prevent serious ocular complications, promote rapid recovery, and ensure safe, effective management through multidisciplinary coordination.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer intramuscular ceftriaxone, perform ocular assessment, educate parent on signs of worsening - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm symptom resolution, monitor for any side effects, ensure completion of care plan - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence or complications, provide education on infection prevention - Patient handout summary: Importance of prompt antibiotic treatment, eye hygiene measures, recognition of warning signs, follow-up schedule",
