    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) with possible concomitant imbalance issues\nJustification: The patient's history of gradually worsening vision, particularly in low-light conditions, suggests a degenerative retinal process such as AMD, which impairs central vision and can lead to difficulty seeing in dim environments. The increased fall risk, unsteadiness, and dizziness worse when standing or in bright/busy outdoor environments point toward balance impairments, potentially from visual input deficits exacerbating vestibular or proprioceptive issues. The relief with holding onto objects and use of a cane indicates reliance on external support to compensate for visual and balance difficulties. The progression over time and the combination of visual and balance symptoms align with age-related degenerative changes impacting both visual and postural stability.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (further evaluation needed to distinguish other contributory factors such as vestibular dysfunction or neurological conditions)\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) with balance impairment\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's diagnosis of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) accounts for their worsening vision in low-light conditions, which can impair depth perception and spatial awareness, subsequently increasing fall risk. The presence of balance issues and unsteadiness suggests that visual impairment may be compounded by or contributing to vestibular or proprioceptive deficits. Management should therefore focus on both visual rehabilitation to optimize remaining sight and fall prevention measures. Pharmacological options for AMD are limited, but supplement therapy with some evidence of benefit, as well as addressing comorbidities, may be beneficial. Non-pharmacological measures are crucial to improve safety, stability, and quality of life.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with a comprehensive referral to an ophthalmologist for detailed assessment and management of AMD, including screening for eligibility for intravitreal anti-VEGF injections if neovascular AMD is identified. Initiate high-dose antioxidant vitamins and mineral supplements (such as AREDS2 formula), which have been shown to slow progression in intermediate or advanced AMD. Emphasize low-vision rehabilitation services, including assistive devices, magnifiers, and adaptive lighting to optimize remaining vision in daily activities. For balance and fall prevention, recommend physical therapy focusing on balance training and strength exercises, as well as home safety modifications such as removing tripping hazards, installing grab bars, and ensuring adequate lighting. Educate the patient about proper use of assistive devices like canes and reinforce safety strategies. Regular follow-up with ophthalmology and primary care to monitor disease progression and address any new symptoms is essential. Addressing other comorbidities contributing to balance issues, such as managing hypertension or diabetes, should also be part of holistic care."
