    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Symmetric Peripheral Neuropathy, likely sensorimotor in nature, possibly due to a non-metabolic, idiopathic cause given the absence of common risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol use, or nutritional deficiencies.  \n\nJustification:  \nThe patient presents with long-standing, bilateral numbness and tingling in hands and feet, described as pins and needles, persistent and worsened with fatigue or injury. The lack of systemic or metabolic risk factors (diabetes, alcohol, vitamin deficiency, autoimmune, recent infections) reduces likelihood of secondary causes. He denies weakness and significant systemic symptoms, indicating primarily sensory involvement. His description of \u201coff\u201d feelings and feeling \u201cwobbly\u201d suggests some level of proprioceptive sensory disturbance, which can be seen in peripheral neuropathy affecting large fibers. The chronicity and absence of other neurological deficits make a primary idiopathic or possibly hereditary underlying neuropathy plausible, though less common.\n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes, based on the clinical picture and exclusion of common causes.  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes, the history provides sufficient information to support diagnosis without further testing at this stage.  \n\nANSWER:  \nSymmetric Peripheral Neuropathy, likely idiopathic sensorimotor type END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of symmetric sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy likely of idiopathic origin, the primary goal is to alleviate symptoms, improve functional quality of life, and prevent further progression. Since common secondary causes have been reasonably excluded based on clinical history and examination, the focus should be on symptomatic management rather than extensive further testing at this stage. Pharmacological options are available for neuropathic pain, which appears to be a prominent feature, and non-pharmacological strategies can help with symptom control and overall well-being. Educating the patient about the condition, emphasizing foot and limb safety, and encouraging lifestyle modifications such as regular low-impact exercise, good foot care, and avoidance of alcohol or neurotoxic agents are important adjuncts.\n\nANSWER: I recommend initiating treatment with a trial of a neuropathic pain agent such as gabapentin or pregabalin, starting at a low dose and titrating slowly to minimize side effects. Concurrently, advise the patient on non-pharmacological measures including physical therapy focusing on sensory integration and balance exercises to address \"wobbly\" sensations, as well as instruction on proper foot care and injury prevention. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding alcohol and neurotoxic medications, maintaining good glycemic control if applicable in the future, and engaging in low-impact aerobic activity, should be encouraged. Regular follow-up is important to assess symptom control, medication tolerability, and to consider additional investigations if the clinical picture changes or worsens."
