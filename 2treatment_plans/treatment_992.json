    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the clinical features and biopsy confirmation. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering lesion size, recent changes, and signs of active progression (bleeding, crusting). - Urgency level: Urgent, to prevent further local invasion or metastasis. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible poorly differentiated SCC, potential for invasion into underlying tissues, or regional lymph node involvement.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Complete surgical excision with histopathological margins. - Supporting evidence: Surgery remains the gold standard for cutaneous SCC, with high cure rates when margins are clear. - Patient-specific considerations: Behavior history suggests possible confusion; procedures should include clear explanations and support. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid incomplete excision; consider patient anesthesia risk if necessary.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not typically indicated unless for post-surgical adjuncts. For now, focus on surgical management. - Rationale for medication: Surgery alone is first-line; adjuvant therapies reserved for high-risk cases not amenable to surgery. - Expected timeline for improvement: Complete removal expected within days; histopathology results in 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Postoperative infection, wound healing complications. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Mohs micrographic surgery for tissue-sparing, high-risk lesions.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Sun protection measures, smoking cessation if applicable. - Patient education priorities: Importance of lesion removal, sun exposure risks, wound care. - Lifestyle modifications: Minimize sun exposure, use broad-spectrum sunscreen, wear protective clothing. - Behavioral interventions: Gentle wound care, routine skin self-examinations, regular dermatologist check-ups.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: 2-4 weeks post-surgery for wound assessment; periodic monitoring every 3-6 months. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, signs of recurrence or new lesions, lymphadenopathy. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid lesion growth, new ulceration, pain, lymph node swelling, systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Complete lesion excision with clear margins and absence of recurrence.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language with visual aids if possible; repeat key points for understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify the nature of SCC and treatment rationale; reassure about the curative potential with appropriate management. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, schedule follow-ups promptly, involve family or caregivers if available. - Family involvement: Encourage support from family members to assist with wound care and follow-up adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical excision with a dermatologist or surgical oncologist; consider referral to Mohs surgeon if margins are uncertain or lesion is high-risk. - Other healthcare team members: Wound care nurses, primary care for follow-up. - Community resources: Skin cancer support groups, educational materials on sun safety. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for biopsies, surgery, and follow-up care; provide resources for assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excision with patient-centered care strategies. The primary intervention involves complete surgical removal of the lesion with clear histological margins, ideally performed by a dermatologist or surgical oncologist to ensure optimal outcomes. Postoperative wound care will be directed towards preventing infection and promoting healing, with follow-up scheduled within 2-4 weeks to assess wound status.  Long-term management includes frequent skin examinations every 3-6 months to monitor for recurrence or new lesions, emphasizing sun protection measures and avoidance of additional UV exposure. Patient education will focus on understanding the importance of early detection, wound care, and sun safety, tailored to accommodate the patient's behavioral confusions by providing clear instructions and written summaries.  Involving family members or caregivers can enhance adherence, and referrals to specialists (e.g., Mohs surgeon if lesion margins are uncertain or at high risk) are appropriate. Additional support through community resources and educational materials will facilitate ongoing engagement. This treatment plan aims to achieve complete lesion removal, reduce recurrence risk, and minimize complications, ensuring sustainable long-term management of this condition.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule surgical excision, provide patient education, and discuss sun safety. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete excision, wound healing, and initial follow-up assessment. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular skin surveillance, reinforce sun protection, and monitor for recurrence. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize lesion removal, wound care instructions, sun avoidance, and follow-up schedule.",
