    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach. First, confirm the diagnosis and assess severity and urgency, noting the patient's complex nasal history, including crusting, dryness, bleeding, and facial fullness, which suggest significant mucosal inflammation and structural issues possibly exacerbated by nasal polyps or vascular fragility. The primary diagnosis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps seems inconsistent with the initial context, which emphasizes crusting, bleeding, and a perforated septum, but is given as final, so I proceed with that as the main focus. Next, select evidence-based treatments aligned with current guidelines, considering the severity and patient's specific factors. Pharmacologic options are chosen for efficacy and safety, alongside non-pharmacologic interventions. Careful follow-up to monitor symptoms and avoid complications like significant bleeding or infection is critical. Clear communication tailored to the patient's baseline behavioral profile ensures understanding and adherence. Coordination with specialists may be necessary, especially for structural issues or recurrent bleeding.\nANSWER: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on avoiding nasal trauma, using a humidifier, and beginning nasal saline irrigations. Prescribe intranasal corticosteroid spray (e.g., fluticasone propionate, 2 sprays per nostril once daily).  - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess symptomatic improvement, adherence, and side effects; monitor bleeding frequency and severity. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained reduction in polyp size, inflammation, and symptom burden; consider nasal endoscopy to evaluate mucosal status. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize regular use of nasal corticosteroids, saline irrigations, avoiding nasal trauma, and recognizing signs that warrant immediate medical attention such as increased bleeding or facial pain.
