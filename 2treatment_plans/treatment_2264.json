    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive worsening of leg weakness and balance disturbance, with symptoms exacerbated by activity and fatigue, along with episodes lasting over days, is characteristic of an episodic neurological disorder affecting the central nervous system. The absence of other systemic or cranial nerve involvement suggests a demyelinating process rather than peripheral nerve or muscular pathology. MS commonly presents with relapsing-remitting episodes of neurological deficits that gradually worsen over time. The lack of sensory loss or other systemic signs makes alternative diagnoses like peripheral neuropathies or muscular disorders less likely. The symptom pattern, progression, and episodic nature align strongly with MS.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suggests a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by episodic neurological deficits which can progressively worsen. The primary goals of management are to modify the disease course, reduce relapse frequency and severity, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. Since the diagnosis has been firmly established, initiating disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is essential to slow progression and reduce relapses. Additionally, symptomatic treatments for fatigue, spasticity, and gait disturbances should be considered. Patient education on recognizing symptom exacerbation and lifestyle modifications contribute to overall management. Non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapy and support services are important adjuncts. The plan should be practical for a primary care or psychiatric setting, emphasizing initiation of appropriate DMTs, symptom management, and patient engagement.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT), such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, or another agent appropriate for the patient\u2019s disease severity and profile, after consulting with a neurologist if possible. Educate the patient on recognizing new or worsening symptoms and the importance of adherence to therapy. Symptomatic treatments should include physical therapy for gait and balance issues, occupational therapy as needed, and pharmacologic options for spasticity (e.g., baclofen or tizanidine) and fatigue (e.g., amantadine). Encourage regular follow-up to monitor treatment response, side effects, and disease progression. Additionally, advocate for lifestyle modifications like regular exercise, balanced nutrition, smoking cessation, and vitamin D supplementation. Psychiatric support may be valuable if mood disturbances or cognitive issues arise, and support groups can assist with coping strategies."
