    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, as features strongly suggest unstable angina with episodic chest pain at rest and increasing severity. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, given increasing frequency, severity, and occurrence at rest, suggesting higher ischemic risk. - Urgency level: Urgent, as unstable angina requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent progression to myocardial infarction. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Acute coronary syndrome, vasospastic exertional angina, or microvascular disease.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiation of anti-ischemic therapy, including beta-blockers, and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin). - Supporting evidence: Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand; aspirin decreases thrombotic events; nitrates alleviate ischemia during episodes. - Patient-specific considerations: Potential for vasospastic disease warrants consideration of calcium channel blockers. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid medications that may cause hypotension or bradycardia; assess for drug allergies.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Aspirin 81 mg once daily, oral; Metoprolol tartrate 25-50 mg twice daily. - Rationale for selection: Aspirin for antiplatelet effect, beta-blocker for reducing myocardial oxygen demand. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within days to weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Bleeding for aspirin; bradycardia, fatigue, hypotension for beta-blockers. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated; calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) for vasospasm.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Smoking cessation, dietary modifications, weight management. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing anginal symptoms, importance of medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular moderate exercise, stress reduction techniques, omega-3 fatty acids. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management counseling, possibly involving a mental health professional if emotional factors are significant.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks after initiation of therapy; more frequent if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom frequency/severity, blood pressure, heart rate, adherence, side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing chest pain, signs of heart failure, syncope, or signs of overdose. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom diary, patient-reported improvement, and possible stress testing if stable.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, direct language emphasizing the seriousness of symptoms and need for adherence; encourage open dialogue. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that symptoms are manageable and that prompt treatment reduces risks. - Adherence strategies: Use motivational interviewing techniques; provide written materials; consider involving family. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve trusted family members to support adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiology consultation within 1 week for further assessment and potential coronary angiography. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care nurse for education and follow-up. - Community resources: Cardiac rehabilitation programs; support groups for cardiac patients. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medication access (generic options); discuss coverage for specialist visits.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of unstable angina, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and beta-blockers to reduce ischemic risk, considering calcium channel blockers for vasospastic components, along with lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, dietary changes, and stress reduction. Immediate management focuses on symptom control and stabilizing the patient, while long-term management emphasizes adherence, risk factor modification, and regular monitoring. Follow-up will include reassessment of symptoms, medication tolerability, and coordination with cardiology for definitive diagnostics. Patient education will address symptom recognition and importance of compliance, provided in a clear, empathetic manner to engage the patient actively in their care. This approach aims to prevent progression, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Prescribe aspirin 81 mg daily, initiate metoprolol 25-50 mg twice daily; schedule cardiology referral; educate on symptom reporting. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization; ensure medication adherence; reinforce lifestyle changes. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for symptom recurrence, optimize medical therapy, and consider further cardiac evaluation. - Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, symptom importance, lifestyle changes, and when to seek urgent care.",
