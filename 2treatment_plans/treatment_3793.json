    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's long-standing progressive gait difficulties, leg weakness, abnormal sensations like tingling and numbness, and hand weakness indicate a chronic, evolving neurological process affecting both the upper and lower extremities. The exacerbation of symptoms with activity, fatigue, and heat (Uhthoff's phenomenon) is characteristic of MS. The absence of sudden episodes, vision changes, and systemic symptoms reduces the likelihood of other neurological conditions such as stroke or peripheral neuropathy secondary to systemic diseases. MS commonly presents with a relapsing-remitting or progressive course with these features, especially in young to middle-aged adults.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) highlights the need for both symptom management and disease-modifying strategies to slow disease progression. As a primary care physician or psychiatrist, starting with non-pharmacological measures such as patient education on activity adjustments, heat avoidance, energy conservation techniques, and physical therapy can help improve functional status and quality of life. Pharmacologically, initiating disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) like interferons, glatiramer acetate, or newer oral agents (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod) can reduce relapse rates and lesion accumulation, provided that the patient is evaluated for contraindications. Symptomatic treatments for spasticity, fatigue, and neuropathic pain, such as muscle relaxants, amantadine, or gabapentin, may also be indicated. Regular monitoring for side effects, adherence, and disease activity is essential, and coordinating with neurology for ongoing management will optimize outcomes.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a disease-modifying therapy appropriate for MS after discussing options with the patient and considering potential contraindications. Non-pharmacological measures should include patient education on heat and activity management, energy conservation, and engaging in tailored physical and occupational therapy. Symptomatic management of specific issues such as spasticity or neuropathic pain with medications like baclofen, gabapentin, or amantadine can be considered based on symptom severity. Regular follow-up to monitor disease progression, medication adherence, and side effects is essential, along with coordination with neurology specialists to ensure comprehensive care."
