    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of focal structural brain lesion (gangliocytoma), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with medical therapy and supportive care. The primary intervention is expedited surgical evaluation and planning for maximal safe resection to control tumor growth and seizures. Initiation of antiepileptic medication, such as levetiracetam, should be started early to manage seizure activity and improve neurological stability. Non-pharmacological support includes patient education on seizure safety, lifestyle modifications, and mental health support as needed. Follow-up will include close neurological monitoring, repeat imaging, and adjustments in medication if necessary. Coordination with neurosurgery, neurology, and rehabilitation services will optimize functional outcomes. The goal is to achieve seizure control, stabilize neurological deficits, and improve quality of life while minimizing surgical and medication risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent neuroimaging review, refer promptly to neurosurgery for surgical assessment, start antiepileptic therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical evaluation, plan for resection, monitor seizure frequency, and manage medication side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve seizure freedom or significant reduction, monitor for tumor recurrence, and restore neurological function.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of adhering to medications, safety precautions, attending follow-up appointments, and notifying providers of new or worsening symptoms.",
