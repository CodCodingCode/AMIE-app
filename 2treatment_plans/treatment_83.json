    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAID therapy (e.g., naproxen 500 mg BID), combined with physical therapy focusing on nerve gliding, core strengthening, and activity modifications. Close follow-up within 2-4 weeks is essential to monitor symptom progression and neurological status. Patient education should emphasize understanding radiculopathy, activity adjustments, and warning signs requiring urgent reassessment, communicated in simple, clear language due to the patient\u2019s behavioral style. Consider involving family members for additional support and adherence. If neurological deficits worsen or do not improve, timely referrals to neurology or spine surgery are indicated. The overall goal is to reduce pain, prevent neurological deterioration, and restore function, while minimizing medication risks. Implement reassurance and support throughout the process, ensuring the patient understands each step and knows when to seek urgent care.",
