    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical features and suspicion\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency likely related to thymic defects such as SCID, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that includes urgent infection management with broad-spectrum antibiotics, prophylactic antimicrobials, IV immunoglobulin therapy, and preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as the definitive cure. Supportive care will focus on nutritional optimization, infection prevention, and caregiver education. Initial management emphasizes controlling active infections and stabilizing the patient, with long-term plans aiming for transplantation once stabilizing conditions are met. Follow-up will involve regular clinical assessments, laboratory monitoring, and prompt attention to any early signs of deterioration. Clear communication with the family about the severity, treatment steps, and importance of adherence is essential, along with coordinated care from specialized teams to ensure the best possible outcomes.",
