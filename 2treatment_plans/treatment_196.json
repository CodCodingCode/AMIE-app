    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given classic symptoms of anterior uveitis with recent onset, ocular findings, and clinical presentation. - Severity classification: Moderate, based on symptom intensity like pain, photophobia, floaters, and blurred vision, which indicate active inflammation but no mention of sight-threatening complications such as hypopyon or increased intraocular pressure. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to prevent permanent vision damage, given recent onset and significant symptoms. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible infectious causes (HSV, VZV, syphilis), autoimmune systemic conditions, and potential masquerade syndromes; close follow-up to rule these out.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Topical corticosteroids to reduce intraocular inflammation. - Supporting evidence: Topical steroids are first-line for anterior uveitis, proven to rapidly control inflammation and prevent complications. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient's anxiety and possible overestimation of symptoms necessitate reassurance and clear communication. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) as steroids may induce glaucoma; assess for infections before steroid initiation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension, one drop every 2 hours initially, tapering based on response. - Rationale for selection: Prednisolone is widely studied, effective, and accessible for topical therapy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 24-72 hours; inflammation should resolve over 1-2 weeks with adherence. - Key side effects to monitor: Elevated IOP, cataract formation if used long-term, and potential for secondary infections. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Dexamethasone drops, subconjunctival steroid injections, or systemic corticosteroids in severe cases.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions. - Primary non-drug interventions: Encourage protection of the eye from further injury; use sunglasses for photophobia. - Patient education priorities: Importance of adherence, potential side effects, warning signs of worsening (e.g., increasing pain, vision loss). - Lifestyle modifications: Stress management techniques, adequate rest, avoid eye rubbing. - Behavioral interventions: Address anxiety possibly with reassurance, discuss symptom expectations, consider referral for counseling if anxiety impairs management.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 48-72 hours to assess response; then weekly until inflammation subsides. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, anterior chamber reaction, IOP, symptoms severity. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, new floaters, pain worsening, halos around lights\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in pain, photophobia, flare grade, and stable/increasing visual acuity.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), communication should be reassuring and transparent. - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language; explain the nature of uveitis and expected course. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that prompt treatment typically prevents complications; acknowledge her distress and validate her feelings. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions; emphasize importance of medication schedule; involve her in understanding the treatment plan. - Family involvement: With her permission, include family members for support and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Additional care coordination. - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation within 24-48 hours\u2014urgent to confirm diagnosis, monitor for complications. - Other healthcare team members: Consider involving a rheumatologist if systemic autoimmune disorder becomes a concern. - Community resources: Provide patient education materials; suggest support groups for autoimmune or ocular conditions. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication affordability; assist with access to medications and appointments.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary anterior uveitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-frequency topical corticosteroids such as prednisolone acetate 1%, with close monitoring of intraocular pressure and symptom response. I also advise using protective eyewear and providing thorough patient education about medication adherence and warning signs indicating worsening condition. An urgent ophthalmology consultation is essential within the next 48 hours for confirmation and close follow-up. The plan emphasizes reassurance, clear communication tailored to her anxiety, and involvement of support systems. Follow-up will focus on clinical response, symptom resolution, and prevention of complications, with adjustments made based on her progress. This approach aims to resolve inflammation effectively, preserve vision, and address her emotional well-being.",
