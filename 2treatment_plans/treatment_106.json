    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the clinical presentation with lymphade\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiation of first-line ABVD chemotherapy regimens, with close supportive care to manage side effects and prevent complications. Initial management focuses on confirming diagnosis, baseline evaluation, and prompt initiation of therapy, while establishing ongoing monitoring through scheduled imaging and labs. Long-term management involves response assessment, potential adjustment of therapy, and supportive measures such as psychological support and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up care will include regular clinical reviews, imaging, and symptom monitoring with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs indicating complications. This approach aims to maximize cure rates, ensure tolerability, and address the patient's holistic needs to support optimal outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with biopsy, perform baseline labs and imaging, assess cardiac and pulmonary function, initiate discussion of treatment plan with the patient, and arrange for starting chemotherapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete initial cycles of chemotherapy, monitor for adverse effects, provide supportive care, and reevaluate response with interim PET/CT.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission, manage post-treatment surveillance, and address any late effects or psychosocial needs.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of treatment adherence, attending regular follow-ups, recognizing signs of infection or toxicity, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle during and after therapy.",
