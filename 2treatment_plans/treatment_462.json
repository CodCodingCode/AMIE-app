    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate severity, and determine urgency. Given the episodic nature of symptoms triggered mainly by social interactions, and the absence of concernin\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder with panic attack features, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which is the first-line intervention for social anxiety disorder, to help the patient develop coping skills and challenge maladaptive thoughts. Supportive psychoeducation about the condition and relaxation techniques should be provided to empower the patient.\nIf symptoms remain significant after adequate CBT (typically 8-12 sessions), consider adding pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as sertraline 50 mg daily, titrated as needed. The combination of therapy and medication often yields better outcomes, especially in moderate cases. Medications usually take 4-6 weeks to show benefits, so ongoing assessment is essential. Monitor for side effects like GI upset, insomnia, or sexual dysfunction, and adjust accordingly.\nLifestyle and behavioral interventions include stress management, avoiding caffeine or stimulants that can exacerbate symptoms, and encouraging regular exercise, adequate sleep, and mindfulness practices. Patient education should focus on explaining the nature of social anxiety, emphasizing that treatment is effective, and encouraging participation in social or support groups if comfortable.\nFollow-up should occur in 4-6 weeks to assess symptom improvement, adherence, and side effects. Patients should be advised to seek immediate care if experiencing worsening symptoms, suicidal ideation, or new chest discomfort.\nIn terms of communication, present the treatment plan collaboratively, addressing concerns about medication side effects and emphasizing the value of therapy. Reinforce that improvement is gradual and that consistent engagement is key.\nReferrals to mental health specialists (psychologists or psychiatrists) should be arranged if not already in place, and consider involving family or close contacts for support if appropriate.\nImmediate actions today include providing education, discussing therapy options, and setting the date for initial therapy. Short-term goals (1-4 weeks) focus on initiating therapy and establishing medication if needed, while long-term management aims for symptom reduction and improved social functioning over 3-6 months.\nSTOP HERE.",
