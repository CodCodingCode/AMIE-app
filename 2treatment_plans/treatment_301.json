    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: The diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the femur\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the femur, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting likely pathogens, coupled with prompt surgical consultation for debridement if indicated. The management emphasizes close monitoring of clinical response, laboratory markers, and imaging, with adjustments as necessary. Additionally, immobilization and activity modification will support healing, while thorough patient education and follow-up ensure adherence. Care coordination with infectious disease and orthopedic specialists, alongside support for the patient's systemic symptoms, aims to optimize outcomes while minimizing potential complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain blood cultures, start empiric IV antibiotics, arrange surgical consultation, perform initial imaging (MRI or bone scan), and assess baseline labs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical improvement, monitor laboratory markers, and evaluate the need for surgical intervention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antibiotic course, restore limb function, and confirm resolution with follow-up imaging.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, activity restrictions, signs of worsening infection, scheduled follow-ups, and maintaining good nutrition.\nSTOP HERE.",
