    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy)\nJustification: The patient presents with a progressive, symmetrical distal weakness and sensory loss in the lower limbs, with numbness and tingling that has worsened over years. The symptoms are worse in the evenings, consistent with demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. The positive family history of similar issues suggests a hereditary pattern, characteristic of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The involvement of both motor and sensory fibers, along with a chronic and progressive course, supports this diagnosis. No bladder, bowel, or significant systemic symptoms are present to suggest alternative etiologies like multiple sclerosis or other central causes.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth Disease END",
    "output": "THINKING: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive distal weakness and sensory loss, primarily affecting the lower limbs. Since there is currently no cure for CMT, management focuses on symptomatic relief, maintaining function, preventing complications, and improving quality of life. Pharmacological options are limited, but certain medications may help alleviate specific symptoms such as neuropathic pain. Non-pharmacological strategies, including physical therapy, orthotic support, and patient education, are essential components to preserve mobility, muscle strength, and prevent deformities. Given the progressive nature of CMT, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended, centered around symptom management and functional support. Regular follow-up is important to monitor progression and address emerging issues.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with symptomatic management targeted at improving the patient's quality of life. This includes prescribing neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin if pain symptoms are present, as these can help reduce discomfort. Non-pharmacological interventions should include referral to physical and occupational therapy for tailored exercises to maintain muscle strength and flexibility, as well as to develop strategies for gait improvement and prevent contractures. The use of custom orthotic devices or braces can provide additional support and prevent foot deformities. Patient education about disease progression, activity modification, and safety measures is crucial. Regular follow-up with a neurologist or physiatrist should be scheduled to monitor symptom progression, adjust treatments as needed, and evaluate for any new complications. Genetic counseling might be considered for the patient and family members to discuss inheritance patterns and future planning."
