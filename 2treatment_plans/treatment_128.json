    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt diagnostic confirmation with early initiation of lymphoma-specific therapy. The plan includes urgent biopsy for definitive subtype identification, initiation of corticosteroids to manage symptoms, and alignment with hematology-oncology for chemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP regimen). Supportive care measures such as hydration, symptom control, and infection prevention are essential. Monitoring will focus on clinical response, laboratory parameters, and imaging, with close follow-up every few weeks. Communication should be tailored to the patient's confusion; thus, explanations should be clear, simple, and involve family members if appropriate. Coordination with specialists and supportive services will optimize outcomes and mitigate risks, aiming for symptom resolution, disease control, and improved quality of life.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent biopsy, \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 supportive care (corticosteroids if airway concern), monitor for respiratory compromise.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, start chemotherapy, closely monitor for adverse effects, manage symptoms.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission, provide ongoing supportive care, monitor for relapse.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of rapid diagnosis, adherence to treatment, recognize warning signs, and attend scheduled appointments.",
