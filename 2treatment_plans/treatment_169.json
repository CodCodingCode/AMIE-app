The treatment plan includes initiating intranasal corticosteroids (such as fluticasone) to control nasal inflammation, supplemented by antihistamines if needed. Emphasis on allergen avoidance, sleep hygiene, and parental education is vital to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue. Regular follow-up within 2-4 weeks will assess treatment efficacy and adjust as necessary. Early involvement of specialists may be needed if symptoms persist or worsen. This approach aims to improve the child's quality of life by alleviating nasal symptoms, enhancing sleep, and preventing escalation of airway issues, while closely monitoring for medication side effects and ensuring long-term allergy management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient and caregivers about allergy triggers and correct nasal spray use, initiate intranasal corticosteroid therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe for symptom improvement, reinforce allergen avoidance measures, reassess adherence and side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained symptom control, evaluate for possible allergy testing, and consider additional interventions if needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points on medication use, allergy avoidance, sleep hygiene, and when to seek urgent care.",
