    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating low-dose testosterone therapy to induce pubertal development, alongside psychological support for emotional well-being and education about the condition. Initial management focuses on starting hormone therapy within the next few weeks, with concurrent counseling to address anxiety and self-esteem concerns. Follow-up care will involve regular endocrine assessments, monitoring of treatment response, and ongoing psychosocial support to ensure physical and emotional growth. This approach aims to promote appropriate pubertal progression, improve quality of life, and empower the patient through education, while minimizing side effects and addressing the psychosocial impact of the condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange for physical examination to confirm pubertal status and order baseline labs (testosterone, LH, FSH, liver function, hematocrit). Initiate counseling about diagnosis and treatment plan.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin testosterone therapy, schedule regular follow-up appointments, and provide educational materials.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve pubertal secondary sexual characteristics, assess psychosocial adaptation, and reinforce ongoing management.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about Kallmann syndrome, hormone therapy purpose, importance of adherence, and scheduled follow-ups.",
