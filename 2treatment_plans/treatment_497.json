    "output": "THINKING: The primary diagnosis is traumatic conjunctivitis, which is usually a mild inflammatory condition caused by injury or irritation. The patient's symptoms of redness, swelling, and tearing following soccer align with traumatic conjunctivitis. Since the injury occurred only 2 days ago and symptoms are localized and without mention of vision changes or intense pain, this suggests a mild to moderate severity. Immediate concern for worsening or secondary infection warrants routine follow-up. Differential considerations include other ocular surface injuries, corneal abrasions, or infectious conjunctivitis, but the trauma history supports my confidence in this diagnosis.  Evidenced-based treatment involves symptomatic relief and protective measures. Topical lubricants and cold compresses are first-line to reduce inflammation and discomfort. Antibiotics or steroids are generally reserved for more severe or complicated cases, which does not appear to be the case here. Patient education about avoiding eye rubbing and monitoring for worsening symptoms is essential. Follow-up should be scheduled in 1 week unless symptoms worsen.  Given the patient's anxious amplification, communication must be reassuring, clear, and empathetic to reduce unease and improve adherence.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with regular use of preservative-free artificial tears, cold compress application to reduce swelling, and careful eye protection. Key interventions involve educating the patient on avoiding eye rubbing, proper eye hygiene, and monitoring for signs of infection or worsening symptoms. Initial management focuses on symptom control and prevention of secondary infection while establishing a follow-up plan for symptom reassessment. Follow-up care will include a scheduled review in one week, with instructions for immediate evaluation if vision changes, significant pain, increasing redness, or discharge occur. This approach aims to promote healing, minimize discomfort, and prevent complications, while addressing patient concerns and reducing anxiety.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to start using preservative-free artificial tears every 2 hours during the day, apply cold compresses as needed, and avoid touching or rubbing the eyes. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom improvement, reduction of redness and swelling, and patient reassurance with no secondary complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete resolution of symptoms, prevent recurrence, and reinforce protective eye habits. - Patient handout summary: \"For traumatic conjunctivitis, use preservative-free artificial tears regularly, apply cold compresses for swelling, avoid rubbing your eyes, and watch for any worsening signs such as increased redness, pain, or vision changes. Schedule a follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen.\"",
