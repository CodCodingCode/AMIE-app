    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment plan for postpartum hemorrhage complicated by hypovolemic shock.  \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nLet me first confi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage with hypovolemic shock, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate stabilization with intravenous fluids and uterotonics, predominantly oxytocin infusion, to control ongoing bleeding. Surgical consultation and intervention are prioritized if bleeding persists or source control is needed due to uterine rupture. Supportive care involves continuous vital sign monitoring, laboratory assessments, and ensuring patient safety. Clear, compassionate communication tailored to her information-withholder style is essential to inform her of each step and involve her in decision-making within her comfort level. Follow-up includes close monitoring in a hospital setting until stable, with arrangements for outpatient care, family involvement, and support systems. This approach aims to stabilize her hemodynamics, prevent further blood loss, and address underlying causes, minimizing complications and promoting recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV fluid resuscitation, administer uterotonics (oxytocin), prepare for surgical consultation, monitor vital signs closely, and ensure blood products are available if needed.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve bleeding control, stabilize hemodynamics, correct anemia with transfusions if necessary, and monitor for signs of uterine integrity or surgical repair.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure recovery, monitor for postpartum complications, and provide emotional support.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on recognizing postpartum bleeding severity, importance of immediate treatment, and when to seek urgent care.",
