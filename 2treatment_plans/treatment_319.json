The primary intervention is surgical excision with wide margins to achieve local control. If indicated, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide may be administered to reduce tumor burden and address microscopic spread. This should be complemented by vigilant postoperative monitoring with regular imaging and physical exams to detect recurrence early.\nPatient education will focus on the importance of timely intervention, potential risks, and adhering to follow-up schedules. Non-pharmacological measures include activity modification, nutritional support, and psychological counseling if needed. Close collaboration with orthopedic oncology specialists, radiologists, and oncologists is essential for optimal outcomes. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 3 months initially, to assess for recurrence and manage treatment-related side effects.\nImmediate actions today include coordinating biopsy scheduling and consulting with oncology and surgical teams. Short-term goals are to confirm diagnosis and initiate treatment planning within the next 2-4 weeks. Long-term objectives include achieving complete tumor removal, maintaining function, and monitoring for recurrence over the subsequent years. A patient handout emphasizing key points about diagnosis, treatment plan, follow-up, and warning signs will support adherence and understanding.",
