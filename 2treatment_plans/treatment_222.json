The plan includes urgent blood pressure stabilization with IV antihypertensives, prompt neuroimaging to confirm ischemia, and close neurological monitoring. Once stabilized, the focus will shift to optimizing cerebrovascular health through antihypertensive therapy, lifestyle modifications, and patient education. Follow-up will involve early neurologic assessment, rehabilitation planning if needed, and involving multidisciplinary teams for recovery and secondary prevention. This approach aims to maximize neurologic recovery, prevent recurrence, and support the patient through targeted education and ongoing care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antihypertensive therapy, order emergent neuroimaging, monitor vital signs and neurological status continuously.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve blood pressure control within target range, confirm diagnosis with imaging, begin stroke-specific rehabilitation if indicated.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish sustained blood pressure management, implement lifestyle changes, monitor for stroke recurrence, and improve functional outcomes.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of blood pressure control, stroke warning signs, medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications to prevent future events.",
