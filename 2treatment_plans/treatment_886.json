    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of dissociative episodes with non-epileptic seizures, blackouts, involuntary movements, and dissociative sensations, confidence in dissociative neurological symptom disorder is high, especially with corroborative clinical features. Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering the frequent, unpredictable episodes that significantly impair functioning and the patient's distress. The spontaneous blackout episodes with involuntary movements are concerning. Urgency level: Routine care but with attention to safety, as episodes could lead to injury. Differential considerations: Monitor for possible comorbid epileptic activity or neurological conditions, although EEG findings are likely negative; also watch for malingering or factitious disorder due to minimization.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment per guidelines: Psychotherapy, specifically trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques. Supporting evidence: Strong evidence supports psychotherapy as primary treatment in dissociative disorders, especially in trauma-related cases, to address underlying psychological trauma and improve symptom management. Patient-specific considerations: The patient's stoic/minimizer personality may reduce engagement; establishing trust is critical. Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary medication unless comorbid conditions warrant.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary medication choice: None specifically targeted at dissociative symptoms; however, if comorbid depression or anxiety exists, SSRIs such as sertraline 50-100 mg daily may be considered. Rationale for selection: To address comorbid mood or anxiety symptoms potentially exacerbating dissociative episodes. Expected timeline for improvement: 4-6 weeks for mood/anxiety symptoms, which may indirectly reduce dissociation. Key side effects to monitor: GI upset, sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, serotonin syndrome. Alternative medications: Other SSRIs or SNRIs as needed; avoid benzodiazepines due to dependence risk.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary non-drug interventions: Engagement in trauma-informed psychotherapy, stress management techniques, grounding strategies during dissociative episodes. Patient education priorities: Importance of therapy, safety planning, recognizing early warning signs, normalizing dissociative symptoms. Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep schedule, stress reduction activities, healthy diet, physical activity. Behavioral interventions: Mindfulness, grounding exercises, establishing routines; consider referral to trauma specialists.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up timeline: Reassessment in 4 weeks to evaluate psychotherapy engagement, symptom frequency, and safety; then regular every 3 months. Monitoring parameters: Frequency and severity of episodes, psychological symptoms, safety, and medication side effects if meds are used. Red flag symptoms: Increasing frequency/severity, suicidal ideation or behaviors, injuries during episodes, new neurological deficits. Treatment response assessment: Symptom diaries, patient self-report, clinician observation, functional status.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-confrontational language; validate experiences without minimizing; emphasize collaborative treatment goals. Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the legitimacy of symptoms, clarify the role of psychotherapy, address minimization tendencies. Adherence strategies: Build trust, set small achievable goals, involve patient actively, foster motivation. Family involvement: With patient consent, include family or support system to provide understanding and support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Specialist referrals needed: Psychologist or psychiatrist with expertise in dissociative disorders and trauma. Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for general health monitoring. Community resources: Support groups for dissociative or trauma-related disorders. Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for psychotherapy sessions, consider sliding scale options if cost barriers exist.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom disorder with non-epileptic seizures, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based psychotherapy with supportive pharmacotherapy for comorbid conditions, alongside safety and lifestyle interventions. The primary focus is on trauma-informed psychotherapy tailored to the individual's needs, with careful attention to building rapport given the patient's stoic/minimizer personality. Pharmacotherapy may be utilized selectively for mood or anxiety symptoms. Safety measures, psychoeducation, grounding techniques, and lifestyle modifications will support symptom management. Regular follow-up and multidisciplinary coordination are essential to monitor progress, adjust interventions, and ensure long-term stability.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Confirm the patient's engagement, ensure safety, and schedule an initial psychotherapy appointment. Provide education on grounding techniques. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Establish therapeutic rapport, initiate trauma-focused therapy, monitor episode frequency, and evaluate need for pharmacotherapy. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reduce episode frequency and severity, improve psychological resilience, and enhance functioning. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of therapy, safety, grounding, and follow-up, ensuring the patient understands their role in management.",
