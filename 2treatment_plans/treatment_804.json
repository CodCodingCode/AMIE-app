    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: I am quite certain of postpartum hemorrhage related to coagulation defects, given the ongoing heavy bleeding and associated symptoms. Severity appears moderate to severe based on the duration and volume of bleeding, along with symptomatic dizziness and fatigue, which suggest significant blood loss. Urgency is immediate since ongoing bleeding with systemic symptoms, even if not overtly hypotensive now, can rapidly deteriorate and requires prompt intervention. Differential considerations include uterine atony, retained placenta, or other bleeding disorders, but coagulation defect remains the leading cause here.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment includes stabilization with volume resuscitation, administration of uterotonics, and correction of coagulation deficits. Supporting evidence indicates that prompt fluid replacement and coagulation management reduce morbidity and mortality. Patient-specific factors including recent delivery, ongoing bleeding, and coagulation status influence treatment choices. Cautions include monitoring for fluid overload, awareness of potential transfusion reactions, and avoiding unnecessary delay in hemorrhage control.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Administer IV fluids for volume resuscitation (crystalloids), and if bleeding persists or shows signs of hypovolemia, initiate transfusion of blood products\u2014packed RBCs, plasma, platelets as indicated. Use uterotonics such as oxytocin to promote uterine contraction. In cases of coagulation defects, administer specific blood products like fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate based on lab results, especially if deficiency in clotting factors is confirmed. Timeline: expect initial stabilization within hours; ongoing correction over 24-48 hours. Monitor for transfusion reactions, signs of volume overload, and coagulation parameters. If bleeding continues despite initial measures, consider recombinant factor VIIa or other hemostatic agents as per specialist guidance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Ensure immediate uterine massage and assess for retained products or uterine atony. Provide oxygen therapy if hypoxia develops. Patient education on recognizing worsening symptoms and the importance of timely reporting. Counseling on postpartum expectations and recovery process. Stress management and reassurance given her active involvement.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Repeat labs including hemoglobin, hematocrit, coagulation profile, and platelet count every 6-12 hours until stable. Assess vital signs frequently and monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding or hypovolemic shock. Follow-up in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. Flag symptoms: increased bleeding, dizziness, fainting, chest pain, new abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. Evaluate effectiveness of interventions and adjust accordingly.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Present the treatment plan clearly and empathetically, emphasizing the urgency and importance of ongoing care. Address concerns about blood transfusions or medications with reassurance about safety and necessity. Encourage questions and active participation in decision-making to improve adherence. Involve family members if the patient is comfortable, providing them with key information.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Consult hematology for specific coagulation disorder management if indicated. Coordinate with obstetrics for postpartum follow-up and any future pregnancy planning. Engage nursing staff for ongoing monitoring and patient education. Provide educational materials about postpartum hemorrhage and signs of deterioration. Ensure coverage and cost-related concerns are discussed with social work if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage related to coagulation defects, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt volume resuscitation with IV fluids and blood products, administration of uterotonics such as oxytocin, and correction of coagulation deficits with plasma and cryoprecipitate guided by laboratory results. Immediate stabilization involves continuous monitoring of vital signs, labs, and bleeding status, with escalation to transfusions or hemostatic agents as needed. Non-pharmacological measures include uterine massage and supportive care. Follow-up will focus on serial labs, symptom assessment, and ensuring hemodynamic stability. Patient education will emphasize recognizing warning signs and understanding treatment rationale, with family involvement as appropriate. This approach aims to control bleeding rapidly, restore hemodynamic stability, and prevent further complications, while addressing patient concerns and coordinating multidisciplinary care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): initiate IV access, start fluid resuscitation, administer uterotonics, and obtain baseline labs including CBC and coagulation profile. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): achieve hemodynamic stability, correct coagulation abnormalities, and monitor for rebleeding. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): ensure complete recovery, address underlying coagulation defects with specialist follow-up, and provide postpartum and future pregnancy counseling. - Patient handout summary: key points about postpartum hemorrhage management, signs to watch for, importance of follow-up, and contact information for emergencies.",
