    "output": "THINKING: Step 1: The diagnosis of descending aorta dissection with rupture is confirmed by the clinical context and imaging. The presentation is severe and emergent, indicating a high-risk, life-threatening co\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of descending aorta dissection with rupture, I recommend an urgent, multidisciplinary treatment approach involving immediate stabilization with blood pressure control via intravenous beta-blockers (e.g., esmolol) to reduce shear stress on the aortic wall. Emergency surgical repair is indicated to address the rupture and prevent exsanguination. Supportive care includes intensive monitoring of vital signs, neurological status, and signs of ongoing bleeding. Postoperative management will involve surveillance imaging, blood pressure optimization, and lifestyle modifications to address risk factors such as hypertension. Clear patient and family communication about the severity and urgent need for surgery is essential, ensuring understanding and addressing concerns. Coordination with cardiothoracic surgery, ICU, and rehabilitation teams will facilitate comprehensive care. This plan aims to stabilize the patient acutely, repair the rupture, and establish long-term management to prevent recurrence or further complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IV antihypertensive therapy (e.g., esmolol) to reduce blood pressure and cardiac stress; prepare for emergency surgical consultation; provide IV analgesics for pain control; confirm imaging findings.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair; monitor postoperative recovery; optimize blood pressure; begin patient education on risk factor control.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stable blood pressure; conduct follow-up imaging to monitor for residual dissection or aneurysm formation; implement lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation).\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the nature of aortic dissection and rupture, the need for urgent surgery, importance of blood pressure control, and lifestyle changes to prevent future events.",
