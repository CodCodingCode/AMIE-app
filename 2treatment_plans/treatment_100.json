    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation of thoracoa\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with signs of impending rupture, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent medical stabilization with definitive surgical repair. Immediate management involves blood pressure control with IV beta-blockers to reduce shear stress on the aortic wall, along with urgent transfer to a vascular or cardiothoracic surgical center for evaluation and intervention. During this period, close hemodynamic monitoring, patient reassurance, and preparation for possible emergent surgery are essential. The plan emphasizes rapid stabilization, prompt surgical consultation, and detailed patient education about the severity of the condition and necessary interventions. Follow-up after repair will focus on postoperative recovery, risk factor modification, and long-term surveillance to prevent recurrence or complications. This strategy aims to minimize the risk of rupture, ensure patient safety, and optimize long-term outcomes through coordinated multidisciplinary care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit to hospital, start IV antihypertensive (e.g., esmolol infusion), arrange urgent imaging (CT angiography), notify surgical team.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete preoperative assessment, perform definitive surgical repair, monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Postoperative recovery, risk factor management, lifestyle modifications, routine surveillance imaging.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of urgent surgical repair, blood pressure control, symptom monitoring, and follow-up plans.",
