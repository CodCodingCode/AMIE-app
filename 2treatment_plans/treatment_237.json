    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of angioedema, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate airway stabilization with epinephrine, supportive medications like corticosteroids and antihistamines as adjuncts, and vigilant airway monitoring. Long-term, the patient should undergo detailed evaluation to determine etiology, with referrals to specialists such as an allergist or immunologist. Education on trigger avoidance, early recognition of symptoms, and emergency response are essential. Close follow-up within 24-48 hours post-episode will help assess recovery and plan ongoing management. The approach is designed to rapidly address the acute threat while establishing a sustainable plan to prevent future episodes, minimize risks, and improve quality of life.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IM epinephrine, ensure airway equipment availability, notify emergency services if airway compromise worsens.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, initiate education, evaluate for hereditary factors, develop emergency action plan.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish trigger management, consider prophylactic therapy if recurrent, and coordinate specialist care.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize angioedema symptoms, when to seek urgent care, medication use, and contact information for emergencies.",
