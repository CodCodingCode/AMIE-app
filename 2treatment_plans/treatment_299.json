The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen 600-800 mg every 8 hours for pain and inflammation, along with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily for three months to reduce recurrence risk. This pharmacologic combination is supported by guidelines for optimal symptom control and prevention of relapse.\nConcurrent measures should include encouraging rest until symptoms improve, with close follow-up in one week to monitor response, side effects, and any signs of complication. Patients should be educated about recognizing worsening symptoms like increased chest pain, faintness, or signs of tamponade, and instructed to seek immediate care if these occur.\nGiven the patient's anxiety and emotional distress, I've emphasized empathetic communication, reassurance, and involving family members for support. Stress management techniques and mental health support may be considered if anxiety persists. Referrals to cardiology are planned if symptoms escalate or complications arise.\nThis approach aims to achieve symptom resolution, prevent recurrence, and support the patient\u2019s overall recovery, while minimizing medication risks and addressing emotional wellbeing.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start NSAID therapy, provide patient education, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom improvement, tolerable medication adherence, and absence of complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete colchicine course, monitor for recurrence, and ensure functional recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: Include medication instructions, warning signs, activity recommendations, and follow-up schedule.",
