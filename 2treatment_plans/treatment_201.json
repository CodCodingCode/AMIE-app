    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day) and considering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion to rapidly increase platelet counts, particularly given active bleeding manifestations. Immediate management focuses on controlling bleeding and preventing hemorrhagic complications while establishing ongoing monitoring of platelet counts and clinical status.\nLong-term management involves regular follow-up with hematology, reassessment of treatment response, and careful observation for signs of underlying pathology (such as leukemia). Educating the patient and family about bleeding risks, medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care is essential, especially considering the patient's age and behavioral profile. Lifestyle modifications include avoiding activities that risk trauma.\nThis approach aims to stabilize platelet levels, prevent complications, and prepare for potential further interventions if initial treatments prove insufficient, always considering the possible underlying or concurrent serious diagnoses like leukemia.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit for initial assessment, start corticosteroids, and administer IVIG if bleeding is significant; obtain baseline labs including CBC, peripheral smear, and coagulation studies.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stable platelet counts, control bleeding symptoms, and clarify diagnosis with further testing.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained remission if ITP; monitor for relapse; ensure comprehensive evaluation for underlying causes such as leukemia.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the nature of ITP, the purpose of medications, signs of bleeding to watch for, activity restrictions, and importance of follow-up care.",
