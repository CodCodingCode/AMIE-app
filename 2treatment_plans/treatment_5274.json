    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Functional (psychogenic) movement disorder (functional movement disorder)\nJustification: The patient reports intermittent involuntary jerky movements that are generally uncontrolled and occur randomly, worsening with attention or focus, and are associated with anxiety. Notably, she states these movements do not bother her during routine activities but cause stress, and attempts to suppress them often lead to frustration, suggesting they are inconsistent with a typical neurological disorder. The movements are also contextually influenced by psychological factors such as anxiety and focus, which align with features commonly seen in functional movement disorder. Her lack of history of similar childhood symptoms and the absence of neurological findings point towards a functional etiology rather than a primary neurological disorder such as dystonia or chorea.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nFunctional (psychogenic) movement disorder END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of a functional (psychogenic) movement disorder, the primary goal is to address the psychological and behavioral factors contributing to the movements. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as patient education about the nature of functional disorders and reassurance, are essential because they help reduce anxiety and relieve misconceptions about a neurological disease. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy in helping patients develop coping strategies, reduce attention to the movements, and manage underlying stress or anxiety that may exacerbate symptoms. Additionally, stress reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, relaxation exercises, or biofeedback, can be beneficial. Pharmacological options are generally not first-line but may be considered if comorbid anxiety or depression significantly impacts functioning; in such cases, low-dose antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be useful. Overall, the emphasis should be on reassurance, education, and psychological therapy, with pharmacotherapy reserved for concurrent mood or anxiety symptoms if present.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should start with patient education and reassurance to destigmatize the symptoms and explain their functional nature. Encourage engagement in cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on coping strategies, stress management, and reducing attentional focus on the movements. Incorporate relaxation techniques like mindfulness meditation or deep breathing exercises to decrease anxiety. If the patient exhibits significant anxiety or depression, consider a trial of an SSRI, such as sertraline or escitalopram, while monitoring for response and side effects. Regular follow-up should be maintained to support therapy, reinforce progress, and adjust interventions as needed, emphasizing that improvement may take time and consistent practice."
