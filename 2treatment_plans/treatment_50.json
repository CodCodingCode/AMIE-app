    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Type I leprosy reaction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy with Prednisone at 40-60 mg daily, gradually tapering over 3-6 months, to reduce nerve inflammation and skin lesions. Close neurological and dermatological monitoring is essential, with follow-up appointments scheduled every 2 weeks initially. Adjunct measures involve wound care, physical therapy, and patient education on recognizing worsening symptoms. Lifestyle modifications and psychosocial support should be integrated to improve adherence and address emotional well-being. Coordination with dermatology and neurology specialists is vital for ongoing management. The goal is to prevent permanent nerve damage, control skin lesions, and support the patient's functional recovery while minimizing medication side effects and promoting adherence through clear communication and family involvement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with clinical examination; start Prednisone 40 mg daily; educate patient about medication side effects and warning signs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe clinical improvement in neurological symptoms; monitor blood glucose and blood pressure; adjust steroids accordingly.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve symptom stabilization, reduce steroid dose safely, prevent nerve impairment, and ensure skin lesion resolution.\n- Patient handout summary: \"You are being treated for a nerve reaction caused by leprosy with steroids to reduce nerve inflammation. Take your medication as prescribed, watch for side effects or new symptoms, and attend follow-up visits regularly for assessment and support.\"",
