    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Synthetic cathinone-induced psychotic disorder with delusions, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antipsychotic medication\u2014starting risperidone 1-2 mg daily\u2014alongside supportive care such as ensuring a safe environment, hydration, and sleep hygiene.

Long-term care involves ongoing psychiatric follow-up, substance use counseling, and psychoeducation emphasizing substance abstinence. Regular reassessment within 24-72 hours and weekly thereafter will guide medication adjustments and evaluate symptom resolution. Engaging the patient with empathetic communication, involving family or support persons when appropriate, and coordinating with psychiatric and substance use specialists are essential. This integrated approach aims to reduce symptoms swiftly, prevent complications, and promote recovery with minimal risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate risperidone, monitor vital signs and mental status, ensure patient safety.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization, monitor medication tolerability, and promote abstinence from substances.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Sustain remission of psychosis, support substance abstinence, and address underlying issues.\n- Patient handout summary:\n- \"Your current psychotic symptoms are related to recent substance use, but they can improve with treatment.\n- Take your medication as prescribed, attend follow-up appointments, and avoid substances.\n- A safe environment helps your recovery.\n- Support is available for substance use and mental health.\n- Please seek immediate help if symptoms worsen or safety becomes a concern.\"",
