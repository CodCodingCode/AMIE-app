    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome)\nJustification: The patient's lifelong insensitivity to pain and temperature, episodes of hot flashes, decreased sweating, and dizziness are characteristic features of autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The childhood onset of these symptoms, coupled with episodic thermoregulatory disturbances and family history (uncle affected), strongly suggests a hereditary autonomic neuropathy like familial dysautonomia. Additionally, occasional abnormal sensations without weakness or other neurological deficits align with autonomic fiber involvement. The clinical picture matches the typical presentation of a congenital autosomal recessive disorder affecting autonomic and sensory neurons.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nFamilial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day Syndrome) is a hereditary disorder affecting autonomic and sensory neurons, leading to symptoms such as insensitivity to pain and temperature, dysregulation of thermoregulation, blood pressure instability, and episodic dizziness. Management focuses on symptom control and preventing complications since there is no cure for the genetic defect. Non-pharmacological strategies include educating the patient and family on avoiding extreme temperatures, injury prevention due to insensitivity to pain, and maintaining adequate hydration. Pharmacologically, medications may be used to stabilize blood pressure, manage episodes of autonomic dysregulation, and address specific symptoms like gastroparesis or orthostatic hypotension. Regular monitoring of autonomic function and supportive therapies such as physical therapy and counseling can improve quality of life and safety.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves educating the patient and family about temperature regulation, injury prevention, and the importance of prompt medical attention for autonomic crises. Encourage maintaining adequate hydration and a balanced diet to support autonomic stability. Pharmacological management may include vasoconstrictors such as midodrine for orthostatic hypotension and medications like clonidine or benzodiazepines for episodic dysautonomia if episodes are severe. Regular follow-up with a neurologist or specialist familiar with familial dysautonomia is recommended to monitor autonomic function and address complications. Consider referral to supportive therapies like physical or occupational therapy, and provide psychological support to help cope with chronic symptoms."
