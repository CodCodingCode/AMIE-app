    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: The patient's presentation with systemic B symptoms\u2014unintentional weight loss, night sweats, fatigue\u2014coupled with the presence of firm, movable lymph nodes near the neck suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The history of lymph nodes becoming firmer over time without tenderness points toward a process involving lymphatic malignancies. The prior chest imaging indicating abnormality, along with constitutional symptoms, further supports this suspicion. The absence of infectious exposures, significant respiratory symptoms (e.g., hemoptysis or severe dyspnea), and lack of immune compromise reduce the likelihood of infectious causes. The clinical picture is characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, which often manifests with painless lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHodgkin lymphoma END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, the primary goals are to confirm the diagnosis with histopathological evidence and to initiate appropriate staging to guide treatment. Since the patient likely has systemic B symptoms and lymphadenopathy, prompt referral to an oncologist or hematologist for definitive diagnosis through excisional lymph node biopsy is essential. Once confirmed, staging with PET-CT scans and bone marrow biopsy will inform the treatment plan. Pharmacological therapy typically involves combination chemotherapy (e.g., ABVD regimen: doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Non-pharmacological interventions include supportive care such as analgesia for lymph node discomfort, addressing systemic symptoms with medications as appropriate, nutritional support, and counseling to manage emotional stress. Given the systemic symptoms, it is also important to monitor for complications and provide palliative care measures if needed. Close follow-up and coordination with specialists are vital for comprehensive management.\n\nANSWER: The initial management should include urgent referral to an oncology or hematology specialist for confirmatory lymph node biopsy and staging with PET-CT imaging. Once diagnosis is confirmed, initiate standard chemotherapy regimen (such as ABVD) under specialist supervision. Supportive care measures should include analgesics for symptomatic lymphadenopathy, antiemetics, nutritional support, and counseling as needed. Regular monitoring for treatment response and potential toxicities is essential. Throughout, the primary care physician or psychiatrist can provide ongoing emotional support and coordinate care, ensuring that the patient receives comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment."
