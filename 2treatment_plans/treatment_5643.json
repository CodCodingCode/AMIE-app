    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), likely Type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease)\nJustification: The infant presents with diffuse hypotonia (\"floppy limbs\"), weak and irregular breathing, poor feeding, increased tiredness, and decreased responsiveness\u2014all characteristic signs of severe lower motor neuron dysfunction. The presence of twitching and darting eye movements can be associated with neuromuscular impairment affecting cranial nerves, yet no seizures or abnormal eye movements beyond twitching are observed. The gradual worsening, along with early onset symptoms since birth, points toward a genetic neuromuscular disorder. The absence of cardiac defects or infection signs shifts suspicion away from metabolic or infectious causes. SMA, particularly Type I, often presents with these features, including weakness, absent developmental milestones, and respiratory compromise early in life.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy (Type I) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (Type I) is a severe, genetically inherited neuromuscular disorder requiring a comprehensive approach. While disease-specific pharmacologic options like nusinersen, risdiplam, or onasemnogene abeparvovec are available and indicated, their initiation often depends on specialized consultation and testing. In the primary care or psychiatric setting, immediate priorities include ensuring respiratory stability, addressing feeding difficulties, and providing supportive care. Non-pharmacological measures such as positioning, respiratory support, and nutritional management are critical to improve quality of life. Early involvement of multidisciplinary teams\u2014including neurology, pulmonology, nutrition, and physical therapy\u2014is essential. Pharmacologically, if accessible, initiating disease-modifying therapy should be considered, ideally in collaboration with a specialist, once diagnosis is confirmed. Symptomatic treatments like gentle physiotherapy and ensuring adequate oxygenation and hydration are crucial interim measures. Documentation of family counseling regarding prognosis and genetic implications is also important at this stage.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves coordinating with neurology and pediatric specialists to confirm diagnosis and facilitate access to disease-specific therapies such as nusinersen, risdiplam, or gene therapy, if available. Initiate supportive measures including respiratory stabilization (monitor oxygenation, use blink reflex or assisted ventilation as needed), feeding support (consider nasogastric or gastrostomy tube placement if oral intake is insufficient), and physical therapy to maintain joint and muscle mobility. Provide family education on the nature of SMA, prognosis, and the importance of early intervention. Regular monitoring of respiratory function and nutritional status should be established, alongside supportive counseling and psychosocial support for the family. Early referral to pediatric neurology and multidisciplinary SMA centers is recommended to optimize management and access to novel therapies."
