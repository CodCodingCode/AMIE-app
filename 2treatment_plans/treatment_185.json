    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antiviral therapy with valacyclovir 1 g twice daily for 7-10 days to reduce lesion duration and viral shedding. Supportive measures include maintaining vulvar hygiene, wearing loose clothing, and avoiding irritants. Patient education should cover transmission risks, lesion management, and safe sexual practices. Follow-up is scheduled in 1-2 weeks to assess healing and adherence, with instructions to seek immediate care if systemic symptoms or worsening lesions develop. Communication with the stoic patient should be clear and empathetic, emphasizing treatment benefits and addressing possible concerns about stigma or recurrence. Additional care coordination with gynecology may be considered if lesions persist or recur frequently, and support resources should be provided. This approach aims to promote healing, minimize transmission, and support the patient's psychological well-being.",
