    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Usher syndrome (likely Type II)\nJustification: The patient presents with progressive night vision difficulty and blurriness affecting both eyes, typical of retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa, which is characteristic of Usher syndrome. The associated features include diagnosis at age 14 with worsening visual symptoms, along with balance difficulties and poor coordination, suggestive of vestibular involvement seen in some Usher syndrome types. The presence of extra toes is not directly characteristic but could be incidental or suggest syndromic features. The normal early motor milestones and absence of other neurological deficits help narrow the diagnosis. The lack of family history does not exclude it, given the possibility of recessive inheritance. The constellation of visual decline, balance problems, and delayed or abnormal visual function indicates a syndromic process involving the retina and the vestibular system, consistent with Usher syndrome.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nUsher syndrome (likely Type II) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Usher syndrome, particularly Type II, is characterized by retinitis pigmentosa leading to progressive vision loss and congenital sensorineural hearing loss. While no cure currently exists for the retinal degeneration or hearing impairment, management focuses on maximizing function, providing supportive resources, and addressing associated symptoms. Non-pharmacological strategies include visual and hearing rehabilitation, such as low vision services, orientation and mobility training, and hearing assistive devices like hearing aids. Monitoring for progression of visual and auditory deficits is essential. Although pharmacological treatments are limited, patients may benefit from vitamin A supplementation under specialist supervision, as some evidence suggests it could slow retinal degeneration, but this must be carefully considered due to potential toxicity. Regular follow-up with ophthalmology and audiology is crucial to monitor disease progression and implement appropriate interventions. Psychological support and counseling can also help patients adapt to progressive sensory loss, and genetic counseling should be offered for family planning considerations.\n\nANSWER: Initiate comprehensive low vision assessment and refer to an ophthalmologist experienced in retinal degenerations for ongoing management, including consideration of nutritional supplementation such as vitamin A (with specialist input) to potentially slow degeneration. Arrange for audiology evaluation and fitting of appropriate hearing aids to optimize hearing capacity. Provide referrals to orientation and mobility training, and connect the patient with support groups for Usher syndrome to facilitate coping and adaptation. Educate the patient about the progressive nature of the condition and encourage routine follow-up with ophthalmology, audiology, and genetics services. Consider involving a multidisciplinary team for ongoing support and management."
