    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Since the patient has a gold standard diagnosis of Type I leprosy reaction, which is an immune-mediated reaction often requiring prompt management, I am fairly certain of this diagnosis. - Severity classification: The presentation with widespread skin inflammation, facial and limb involvement, recent progression, persistent nerve pain, systemic symptoms such as fatigue and fever suggests a moderate to severe reaction, especially given nerve involvement and systemic features. - Urgency level: Immediate to urgent care is warranted to prevent nerve damage and systemic deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: secondary bacterial infection, other inflammatory or infectious processes, or a misdiagnosed dermatologic condition.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiation or optimization of multi-drug therapy for leprosy plus corticosteroids to manage reaction. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are the mainstay for Type I reactions due to their anti-inflammatory effects, especially in nerve involvement; proper antimicrobial therapy is essential to treat leprosy itself. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient reports non-adherence, emotional distress, and stoic-minimizer behavior, which may impact compliance; systemic symptoms suggest need for aggressive management. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor for corticosteroid side effects, especially immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and osteoporosis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prednisone, start with 40-60 mg daily, taper based on response. - Rationale for selection: Corticosteroids are effective in reducing inflammation and nerve edema associated with Type I leprosy reactions. - Expected timeline for improvement: Signs of reduction in inflammation and nerve pain typically within 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood glucose, blood pressure, signs of infections, mood changes, weight gain. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Mycophenolate mofetil or thalidomide (noting teratogenicity) as secondary options, generally under specialist supervision.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Proper skin and nerve care, nutritional support. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, recognition of worsening symptoms, avoiding trauma. - Lifestyle modifications: Nutritional support for immune health, adequate rest, stress management techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling or psychological support to address emotional distress, enhancing treatment adherence.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 2 weeks to assess response; then every 4-6 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, nerve pain, skin inflammation, adherence, side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision changes, worsening weakness, signs of infection, uncontrolled systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical improvement in skin lesions, nerve function tests, patient-reported pain levels.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language emphasizing the importance of adherence and early reporting of worsening symptoms; involve the patient in shared decision-making. - Addressing patient concerns: Acknowledge stoicism and minimization tendencies, validate their experience, and emphasize that timely management prevents long-term disability. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication schedules, employ motivational interviewing, set achievable goals, and consider involving family if appropriate. - Family involvement: With consent, include family members to support adherence and monitor for adverse effects.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurologist for nerve assessment if deficits progress; infectious disease specialist or dermatologist for leprosy management. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for skin and nerve care education; mental health professional if emotional distress persists. - Community resources: Support groups for leprosy, educational materials, social services to reduce stigma. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to medications, subsidize costs, and coordinate with pharmacy for consistent supply.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of autoimmune connective tissue disease with neurocutaneous involvement, specifically a Type I leprosy reaction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating or optimizing corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisone 40-60 mg daily with gradual taper based on response) alongside ongoing antimicrobial therapy for leprosy per current guidelines. Supportive measures such as skin and nerve care, nutritional support, and patient education on adherence are essential. Immediate management aims to reduce inflammation and prevent nerve damage, while long-term strategies focus on sustained medication adherence, monitoring for adverse effects, and psychosocial support. Follow-up will involve close clinical reassessment every 2-6 weeks, with vigilant monitoring for worsening symptoms or side effects. Clear communication tailored to the patient's stoic behavior will promote understanding and compliance. Additional referrals to specialists and community resources will facilitate comprehensive care, aiming for resolution of inflammation, nerve preservation, and overall improved quality of life.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Confirm medication adherence, initiate or adjust corticosteroids, and schedule close follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Clinical improvement of skin inflammation and nerve pain, adherence reinforcement, and side effect monitoring. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Disease stabilization, nerve function preservation, and integration of support services. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication importance, symptom monitoring, skin and nerve care tips, and when to seek urgent care.",
