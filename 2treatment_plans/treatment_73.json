    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical presentation strongly suggest\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of venom-induced anaphylaxis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent, evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes administering IM epinephrine promptly to reverse severe allergic symptoms, supporting airway and circulatory stability with oxygen and IV fluids, and providing antihistamines and corticosteroids to mitigate ongoing or delayed reactions. Immediate priorities are airway support, symptom reversal, and stabilization. Long-term management involves patient education on allergen avoidance, carrying and properly using epinephrine auto-injectors, and scheduling allergy specialist consultations for venom immunotherapy assessment. Follow-up will monitor for biphasic reactions and reinforce education, with caution to recognize warning signs requiring urgent care. This approach aims to ensure rapid symptom resolution, reduce recurrence risk, and empower the patient to manage future exposures effectively.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IM epinephrine, provide supplemental oxygen, position patient appropriately, establish IV access, begin vital sign monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm allergy diagnosis via specialist testing, initiate venom immunotherapy if indicated, and train the patient in auto-injector use.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve allergy control, ensure auto-injector accessibility, and implement avoidance strategies.\n- Patient handout summary: Include emergency response steps, auto-injector instruction, allergy avoidance tips, and follow-up plan.",
