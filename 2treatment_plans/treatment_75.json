    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive, palliative care with caregiver and environmental support. The key interventions include symptomatic management through supportive care, safety precautions, and caregiver guidance, as well as regular monitoring of neurological status and complications. This plan emphasizes maintaining patient comfort and dignity, engaging family involvement, and coordinating with specialized teams such as palliative care and neurology. Initial focus should be on establishing baseline function and safety, with ongoing reassessment to adapt care as needed. Follow-up will include frequent symptom review, safety surveillance, and addressing evolving needs. Education will be tailored to the patient's communication capacity, with family participation and support resources actively incorporated.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate safety assessments, arrange neurology and palliative care consultations, discuss goals of care with family.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Establish supportive home environment, train caregivers, monitor for complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain patient comfort, provide psychosocial support, and plan for advanced care needs.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize disease prognosis, safety precautions, importance of supportive care, and caregiver involvement.",
