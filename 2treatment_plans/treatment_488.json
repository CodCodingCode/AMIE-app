    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous herpes simplex infection complicating other skin diseases, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate antiviral therapy, supportive care, and patient-centered education. The initial management involves hospitalization with intravenous acyclovir at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, ensuring renal function is closely monitored. Supportive measures include maintaining hydration, pain control, skin wound care, and hygiene. The patient should be counseled about the importance of adherence to therapy, potential side effects, and signs of worsening illness. Follow-up will include daily clinical assessments during hospitalization and outpatient monitoring within 48-72 hours after discharge to evaluate response and prevent complications. This plan aims to control the HSV dissemination, minimize systemic complications, and promote skin healing while supporting the patient's understanding and cooperation in their care.",
