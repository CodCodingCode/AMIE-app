    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; ocular trauma with intraocular hemorrhage confirmed by clinical exam and possibly imaging. - Severity classification: Severe, given the intraocular hemorrhage, ocular discomfort, and potential risk for vision loss. - Urgency level: Immediate ophthalmologic emergency requiring prompt assessment and management to prevent permanent damage. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Open-globe injury, retinal detachment, other intraocular injuries, underlying coagulopathies.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Urgent ophthalmology consultation for comprehensive evaluation and management. - Supporting evidence: Rapid intervention reduces risk of permanent visual impairment; management may include surgical and medical approaches based on injury severity. - Patient-specific considerations: Recent ocular trauma, systemic bleeding concerns, patient report minimization. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid any action that may increase intraocular pressure or cause further injury until definitive assessment.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Topical corticosteroids to reduce intraocular inflammation and pain; possible analgesics for discomfort; avoid anticoagulants unless justified for other conditions. - Rationale for selection: To control inflammation and prevent secondary damage. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within days; definitive resolution depends on injury severity. - Key side effects to monitor: Increased intraocular pressure, steroid-related ocular side effects. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Oral corticosteroids or enzyme inhibitors if significant inflammation persists under ophthalmology guidance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Eye rest, avoid activities that increase intraocular pressure, protective measures (e.g., eye shield). - Patient education priorities: Symptoms of worsening condition (e.g., sudden vision loss, increased pain), importance of prompt follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity, ensure safe environment to prevent further injury. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, adherence to activity restrictions.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Urgent ophthalmology evaluation within 24-48 hours; ongoing assessment based on response. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, ocular appearance, symptom progression. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increasing pain, new floaters, flashing lights, signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in visual symptoms, reduction in ocular discomfort, stability in intraocular findings.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, straightforward; explain severity and urgency to motivate compliance. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify the importance of urgent assessment, possible outcomes, and reassure about the comprehensive care plan. - Adherence strategies: Reinforce need for follow-up, provide written instructions, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Engage family members in monitoring symptoms and supporting activity restrictions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent ophthalmology consultation within 24 hours. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for systemic health monitoring, possibly hematology if coagulopathy suspected. - Community resources: Patient education materials about ocular trauma, emotional support if anxiety present. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with scheduling, facilitate referral processes, inform about potential urgent care costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ocular trauma with intraocular hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent ophthalmology consultation for detailed evaluation and management, administration of topical corticosteroids and pain relief as needed, eye rest, and activity restrictions to prevent further injury. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the ocular condition and preventing secondary complications, with long-term follow-up to monitor healing and visual recovery. Follow-up care will include regular assessments of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and symptom progression, with clear instructions for seeking immediate care if red-flag symptoms occur. This approach aims to preserve visual function, minimize complications, and ensure patient understanding and adherence through effective communication. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology consultation; advise eye rest and activity restriction; provide pain management if appropriate. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete detailed ocular assessment; monitor intraocular pressure and inflammation; prevent infection. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve healing with minimal visual impairment; monitor for secondary complications such as retinal detachment. - Patient handout summary: Importance of urgent eye evaluation, activity restrictions, symptom monitoring, medication adherence, and follow-up plans.",
