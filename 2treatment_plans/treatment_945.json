    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on recent onset of symptoms consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, especially with signs of pulmonary edema, orthopnea, hemoptysis, and bilateral lower extremity swelling. - Severity classification: Likely severe, given rapid symptom progression, orthopnea, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis, and signs requiring urgent intervention. - Urgency level: Immediate care needed to stabilize respiratory and circulatory status. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, worsening cardiac function due to other causes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Stabilize with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators if tolerated. - Supporting evidence: Diuretics reduce preload and pulmonary congestion; oxygen improves hypoxia; vasodilators decrease afterload\u2014standard in acute heart failure management. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, recent postpartum status, and potential contraindications to certain medications. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid excessive fluid removal to prevent hypotension and renal hypoperfusion; monitor blood pressure and electrolytes.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Intravenous loop diuretic\u2014Furosemide 40 mg IV bolus, repeat every 2 hours as needed. - Rationale for selection: Rapid onset, effective relief of pulmonary congestion; easy titration. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within hours; diuresis observed within 1-2 hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, dehydration, renal function. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Tolvaptan for hyponatremia, but typically used after diuretics; in refractory cases, consider inotropic support if cardiogenic shock develops.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Bed elevation to 30-45\u00b0, sodium restriction (<2 g/day), fluid restriction if hyponatremic. - Patient education priorities: Recognize worsening symptoms, medication adherence, dietary restrictions. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit salt intake, avoid excessive fluid intake, moderate activity as tolerated. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, caregiver support, possibly refer to heart failure education programs.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 24-48 hours inpatient; outpatient follow-up in 1 week. - Monitoring parameters: Vital signs, daily weights, input/output, oxygen saturation, renal function, electrolytes, symptom progression. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing dyspnea, hypotension, chest pain, new arrhythmias, syncope, persistent hemoptysis. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in breathing, reduction in edema, stable renal function, and symptom stabilization.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clearly explain the severity of her condition, necessary interventions, and expected outcomes in calm, factual language. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety of treatments, address anxiety, and explain the importance of adherence. - Adherence strategies: Involve her in decision-making, provide written instructions, and schedule prompt follow-up. - Family involvement: Engage family members for support and to assist with medication adherence and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiology consultation within 24-48 hours for long-term management. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for ongoing monitoring, dietitian for sodium/fluid counseling. - Community resources: Heart failure clinics, patient education materials, support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs, follow-up appointment logistics to ensure compliance.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute decompensated congestive heart failure, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate stabilization with oxygen, intravenous loop diuretics (Furosemide 40 mg IV every 2 hours as needed), and careful monitoring of vital signs, renal function, and electrolytes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as bed elevation, sodium and fluid restriction, and patient education on symptom recognition are essential. Follow-up should occur within 24-48 hours during hospitalization and outpatient within one week, with ongoing assessment of clinical status and laboratory parameters. Clear communication emphasizing the importance of adherence, early recognition of deterioration, and coordinated care with cardiology and nursing teams will optimize outcomes. This approach aims to reduce pulmonary congestion, improve breathing, prevent rehospitalization, and support long-term cardiac health while minimizing risks such as renal impairment and electrolyte disturbances.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Administer oxygen as needed, start IV Furosemide 40 mg, monitor vitals, and establish IV access. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve euvolemia, stabilize symptoms, optimize medications, and educate patient. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Improve cardiac function, prevent recurrent hospitalization, and manage underlying cause. - Patient handout summary: Include key points on medication adherence, dietary restrictions, recognizing worsening symptoms, and follow-up plans.",
