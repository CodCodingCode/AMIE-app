First, confirm the di\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypertensive heart failure with volume overload and orthostatic hypotension due to secondary hyperaldosteronism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes careful volume management with appropriate diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, antihypertensive agents tailored to avoid worsening hypotension, and addressing hyperaldosteronism directly. Initial management focuses on controlling volume overload and blood pressure while minimizing orthostatic symptoms. Long-term strategies involve hormone modulation and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up will include regular clinical assessments, laboratory monitoring of electrolytes and renal function, and treatment adjustment based on symptom progression and side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate low-dose antihypertensive therapy balancing blood pressure control with orthostatic tolerability; educate the patient on symptom monitoring and safety precautions when standing.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve improved volume status and blood pressure targets; reassess orthostatic symptoms; optimize medication doses.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain controlled hypertension and volume status; prevent hospitalizations; monitor for adverse effects from therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, lifestyle changes such as salt restriction and gradual standing movements, and importance of follow-up appointments.\nSTOP HERE.",
