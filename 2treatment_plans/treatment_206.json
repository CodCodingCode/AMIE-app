    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nThe diagnosis of hypertensive emergency with hypertensive nephropathy is highly certain given the patient's clinical presentation\u2014severe hypert\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency with hypertensive nephropathy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate intravenous antihypertensive therapy\u2014starting with IV labetalol and titrating carefully to reduce BP gradually\u2014alongside supportive management such as bed rest and fluid management. We will conduct frequent monitoring of BP, renal function, and neurological status to guide ongoing treatment adjustments. Patient education will focus on understanding her condition, recognizing warning signs, and adherence to medications and follow-up appointments. Long-term management will involve optimizing antihypertensive therapy, addressing risk factors, and coordinating with nephrology and obstetric teams if pregnancy is ongoing. This approach aims to prevent further organ damage, stabilize her condition, and establish a foundation for sustained blood pressure control.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV labetalol infusion, monitor vitals closely in ICU setting, and obtain baseline labs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve target BP control, normalize renal function, and educate the patient about symptom management.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish stable antihypertensive regimen, monitor renal function, and prevent recurrence of hypertensive crises.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of BP control, medication adherence, recognizing warning signs, avoiding substances that elevate BP, and schedule for regular follow-up.",
