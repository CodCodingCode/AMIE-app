    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n  \nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given typical symptoms of an asthm\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating inhaled albuterol for quick symptom relief and starting a short course of oral corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation. I will educate the patient and family on proper inhaler techniques, trigger avoidance, and symptom monitoring. Immediate steps involve administering rescue medication and reassessing in 48-72 hours. Short-term goals are symptom resolution and ensuring medication adherence, while long-term management will focus on preventing future attacks through inhaler use, trigger control, and possibly an asthma action plan. Regular follow-up will help track progress and adjust treatment as needed, with emergency instructions emphasized for worsening symptoms. This approach aims to stabilize the current exacerbation, minimize risks, and support sustainable asthma control.",
