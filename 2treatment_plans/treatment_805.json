    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning: confirm the diagnosis, evaluate severity, assess urgency, and consider differential diagnoses. Given the history of recent eye redness, swelling, tearing after trauma during soccer, and the diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage, I am quite confident in this diagnosis. Severity appears mild to moderate, as there\u2019s no mention of vision loss or pain. Urgency is routine, since subconjunctival hemorrhages are usually benign but need observation, especially with the context of postpartum coagulation defects, which could complicate bleeding risks. Differential considerations include other ocular trauma, intraocular injuries, or infectious conjunctivitis, but these are less likely given the trauma history and presentation severity.  Select evidence-based treatment: reassurance and monitoring are primary because subconjunctival hemorrhages typically resolve spontaneously. Strict eye protection and avoiding trauma are important. Pharmacologically, artificial tears may alleviate tearing; topical steroids or antibiotics are not generally indicated unless there's evidence of other injury or infection. Considering the patient's anxiety, clear explanation and reassurance are crucial.  Pharmacological interventions: no specific medications are necessary for typical subconjunctival hemorrhage, unless complications arise.  Non-pharmacological interventions: advise on eye protection and avoiding rubbing or further trauma, educate about the benign nature, and encourage patience as it resolves. Managing anxiety with reassurance and clear information is also key.  Monitoring & follow-up: schedule a follow-up in 1-2 weeks to ensure resolution and address any new symptoms. Advise immediate medical attention if vision changes, severe pain, recurrent bleeding, or signs of infection develop.  Communication: Given the anxious amplifier, I will emphasize reassurance, clear explanations about the benign nature, and address concerns proactively to reduce anxiety.  Referrals: if coagulation defects are significant or bleeding persists, involve hematology; otherwise, routine ophthalmology follow-up suffices.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctival injury/subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based management with patient-centered communication. The treatment plan includes reassurance about the benign and self-limiting nature of the hemorrhage, advice to protect the eyes from further trauma, and monitoring for any signs of complications. No pharmacological treatment is typically required, but artificial tears can help with tearing discomfort. The patient should avoid rubbing the eyes and strenuous activity until the hemorrhage resolves. Follow-up in 1-2 weeks is appropriate to confirm resolution, with instructions to seek immediate care if vision changes, pain, recurrent bleeding, or signs of infection occur. Given the postpartum coagulation defects, careful monitoring for bleeding tendencies is important, and coordination with hematology may be considered if bleeding persists or worsens. Clear, reassuring communication tailored to the patient's anxiety will help foster compliance and reduce distress. This approach aims for complete resolution while minimizing risks and addressing patient concerns comprehensively.",
