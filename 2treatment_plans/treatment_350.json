    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical features strongly sug\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excisional biopsy with clear patient education and follow-up planning. The immediate priority is to schedule an excisional biopsy of the lesion with appropriate margins to confirm diagnosis and determine the extent of invasion. Post-biopsy, results will guide further management, including possible referral to a surgical oncologist for staging and treatment. Throughout this process, providing the patient with thorough information about melanoma, sun protection strategies, and signs warranting urgent care is essential. The plan aims to facilitate early diagnosis, tailored treatment, and supportive care while minimizing patient anxiety. Follow-up will include review of pathology results, further surgical or oncologic interventions if necessary, and ongoing skin monitoring. Key to success is compassionate communication, ensuring adherence, and coordinating multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes.",
