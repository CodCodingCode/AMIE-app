The treatment plan includes initiating empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftriaxone to target E. coli, providing supportive care with rest and hydration, and closely monitoring clinical progress. Immediate actions involve arranging for outpatient or inpatient evaluation, including oxygen saturation measurement and further diagnostic assessment if indicated. Short-term goals focus on symptom resolution within 48-72 hours and preventing complication development, while long-term management emphasizes completing antibiotic therapy, avoiding cold exposure, and scheduling follow-up evaluations. Ongoing monitoring will track symptom progression, oxygenation, and any adverse effects, with prompt escalation if red flag symptoms emerge. Communication will be clear, empathetic, and tailored to the patient's stoic personality, emphasizing the importance of reporting worsening symptoms and adhering to treatment. This holistic plan aims to improve recovery, minimize risks, and ensure a safe and effective course of care.",
