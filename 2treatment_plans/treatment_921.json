    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm diagnosis, assess severity, and select evidence-based treatment with consideration of patient-specific factors. Since the final diagnosis is traumatic ocular injury presenting with redness, swelling, and tearing shortly after soccer, I need to evaluate whether this is an emergent concern such as globe rupture, corneal abrasion, or hyphema, or a milder conjunctival or eyelid trauma. The presence of swelling and tearing suggests superficial injury, but I must consider the risk of more severe injuries. The outlined plan will address initial assessment, appropriate treatment, and follow-up.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic ocular injury, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initial ophthalmologic examination, symptomatic relief, and protective measures, with careful attention to the severity of injury and patient-specific factors. Immediate management focuses on preventing further damage, reducing discomfort, and ensuring proper healing, while establishing a long-term monitoring plan. Follow-up care will include scheduled assessments for healing progress with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs. This approach aims to promote optimal recovery, minimize complications, and facilitate safe return to activity.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Perform a thorough ocular examination, including visual acuity testing, inspection for foreign bodies, corneal integrity (fluorescein dye if indicated), and intraocular pressure measurement if feasible. Initiate eye protection with an eye shield and advise the patient to avoid rubbing or pressure on the eye. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Resolve redness and swelling, ensure no signs of perforation or intraocular injury, and prevent infection. Provide symptomatic relief with appropriate eye drops if indicated. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete healing, restore visual function, and monitor for any late complications such as scarring or ocular surface damage. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of protecting the eye, observing for worsening symptoms (increased pain, vision changes, persistent redness, or swelling), and attending scheduled follow-up appointments.  Note: For any signs of severe injury (e.g., penetrating injury, significant visual loss, intense pain), immediate referral to ophthalmology or emergency care is essential.",
