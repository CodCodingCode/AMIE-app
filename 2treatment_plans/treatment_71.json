    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment: The patient has a definitive diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome caused by an adrenal cortical adenoma, which explains her rapid onset of symptoms \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenal cortical adenoma in this 16-year-old female, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines definitive surgical management with supportive care strategies. The primary intervention is an adrenalectomy to remove the adenoma, which aims to normalize cortisol levels and resolve her symptoms. Pre-operative pharmacological therapy with agents like ketoconazole may be considered to control cortisol excess and reduce surgical risk. Post-surgery, close monitoring of cortisol levels, adrenal function, and symptoms will be essential to assess remission and detect any adrenal insufficiency.\nInitial management should include patient education regarding the nature of her condition and the importance of surgical intervention. She should be referred promptly to pediatric endocrine surgery and endocrinology specialists. Supportive measures such as nutritional counseling, sleep hygiene, and psychological support should be discussed to address lifestyle and emotional health.\nFollow-up care will involve scheduled visits at 1 to 2 weeks post-operatively, then every 4-6 weeks initially, with lab assessments of cortisol and ACTH levels, and imaging if indicated. She should be advised to seek immediate care if she experiences worsening weakness, severe headache, signs of adrenal insufficiency (nausea, vomiting, hypotension), or any new neurological symptoms.\nThis integrated approach aims for effective disease resolution, symptom improvement, and minimization of steroid withdrawal or replacement issues, ensuring her long-term health and well-being.",
