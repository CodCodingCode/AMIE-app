    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nPrimary diagnosis confidence is high given the classic presentation of radial styloid tenosynovitis with swelling, tenderness, warmth, redness,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immobilization with a thumb spica splint, NSAID therapy (ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 8 hours with food), activity modification, and ice application to reduce swelling. Patient education emphasizing activity avoidance, splint use, and symptom monitoring is essential, especially considering her anxiety. Follow-up in 2-3 weeks will evaluate her response to treatment and adjust as necessary. This approach aims to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, restore function, and prevent recurrence while addressing her concerns and promoting adherence. The plan minimizes risks and provides clear pathways for escalation if symptoms persist.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Provide the patient with a thumb spica splint, prescribe NSAIDs with instructions, and educate on activity modification and splint use.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom reduction, ensure proper splint compliance, and reassess pain and swelling.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete symptom resolution, prevent recurrence, and address any underlying activity or ergonomic factors.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about her condition, treatment steps, activity precautions, signs of worsening, and follow-up schedule.",
