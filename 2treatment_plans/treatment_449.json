    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical features consistent with lentigo maligna melanoma confirmed by biopsy. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe; lesion has enlarged, darkened, irregular borders, indicating invasive potential and need for prompt intervention. - Urgency level: Urgent; melanoma requires timely definitive treatment to prevent metastasis. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other pigmented lesions, possible benign atypical nevi, or other melanoma subtypes, but these are less likely given current features.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with appropriate margins (typically 5-10 mm depending on Breslow depth). - Supporting evidence: Complete surgical excision is the standard of care for localized melanoma, with margins reducing recurrence risks. - Patient-specific considerations: Age (68), facial location (cosmetic and functional considerations), no comorbidities reported; ensure informed consent and discuss reconstructive options if necessary. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid narrow margins; careful planning to preserve function and appearance; monitor for signs of regional metastasis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If indicated, pharmacotherapy might be adjunctive or for advanced cases. - Primary medication choice: Not indicated at initial stage; surgical excision is primary. - Rationale for selection: Surgery remains gold standard; systemic therapies reserved for advanced melanoma. - Expected timeline for improvement: Surgical healing in 2-4 weeks; vigilance for wound healing complications. - Key side effects to monitor: Wound infection, cosmetic concerns. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Immunotherapy (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors), targeted therapy if metastatic, but these are not first-line for early-stage lesion.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Sun protection (broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen, protective clothing), skin self-examination. - Patient education priorities: Importance of early detection, sun avoidance, signs of recurrence. - Lifestyle modifications: Minimize sun exposure, avoid tanning beds, maintain healthy skin. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage routine skin checks, provide educational resources.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate at 2-4 weeks post-surgery; then regular skin checks every 6-12 months as per melanoma guidelines. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, new or recurring pigmented lesions, lymph node swelling. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, new pigmented lesions, lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Surgical margins clear, no signs of recurrence or metastasis at follow-up.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language with visual aids; allow time for conversation, guiding back to key points gently. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the effectiveness of treatment, address cosmetic concerns, discuss potential outcomes. - Adherence strategies: Provide written summaries, encourage questions, set follow-up reminders. - Family involvement: With patient consent, include family members in education to support adherence and emotional well-being.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Refer to a surgical oncologist or dermatologist with melanoma expertise within a short timeline. - Other healthcare team members: Potential involvement of plastic surgeons for reconstruction, wound care nurses. - Community resources: Melanoma support groups, patient education materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for surgery, possible reconstructive procedures, and follow-up care.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lentigo maligna melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision with appropriate margins, sun protection measures, and thorough patient education on skin self-examination and sun avoidance. Given the lesion's characteristics, early surgical intervention is prioritized to prevent progression and metastasis. Follow-up will involve scheduled wound assessments, regular skin examinations, and monitoring for signs of recurrence. The plan also emphasizes clear communication tailored to the patient's storytelling style by providing visual aids and written summaries, involving family members if appropriate, and coordinating care with specialists to ensure optimal outcomes. This approach aims for complete lesion removal, minimized cosmetic impact, and sustained skin health.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange biopsy confirmation if not already done; schedule surgical excision appointment; educate patient on sun protection. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgery, monitor wound healing, reinforce skin self-examination routines. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete healing, evaluate for recurrence, and establish ongoing skin surveillance. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of surgical treatment, sun protection, routine skin checks, and follow-up appointments.",
