    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given characteristic panic attack symptoms and social anxiety features. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering episodes involve significant physical symptoms and social avoidance impacting daily functioning; guarded communication may underestimate severity. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but close monitoring advisable due to potential impact on quality of life. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or medical conditions mimicking panic symptoms (e.g., thyroid issues, cardiac arrhythmias).  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) tailored for panic disorder and social anxiety; pharmacotherapy (SSRIs or SNRIs) if warranted. - Supporting evidence: Strong evidence supports CBT to reduce panic and social anxiety symptoms; pharmacotherapy proven effective and often adjunctive. - Patient-specific considerations: Female with guarded communication; may need supportive, patient-centered approach; medication considerations include safety profile. - Contraindications or cautions: Medication side effects; ensure no contraindications to SSRIs/SNRIs.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Sertraline, starting at 25-50 mg daily, titrated as needed. - Rationale for selection: Well-studied SSRI with favorable side effect profile; approved for panic disorder and social anxiety. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some benefits may be observed in 2-4 weeks, with optimal effects in 8-12 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, increased anxiety initially. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine (SNRI), or augmentation strategies.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Initiation of CBT focusing on exposure, cognitive restructuring, and skills training. - Patient education priorities: Understanding panic attacks and social anxiety, normalizing symptoms, reducing self-blame. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular exercise, stress management techniques, sleep hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Referral to CBT therapist skilled in panic and social anxiety; possibly group therapy or social skills training.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-assessment in 4 weeks to evaluate symptom progression, medication tolerability, and response. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity (using standardized scales), side effects, functional impairment. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening depression, suicidal ideation, emergence of physical health issues, increased panic or social avoidance. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in panic attacks, improved social engagement, decreased anxiety scores.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; emphasize support and collaborative decision-making. - Addressing patient concerns: Validate her distress, reassure about treatment options, provide written summaries. - Adherence strategies: Encourage small, manageable steps, regular check-ins, and discuss concerns openly. - Family involvement: With patient permission, involve trusted family members for support and reinforcement.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Consider psychiatric consultation for medication management if needed. - Other healthcare team members: Psychologist/CBT therapist, possibly mental health nurse case manager. - Community resources: Anxiety and support groups, educational materials from reputable organizations. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for therapy and medication; consider low-cost options if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Panic Disorder with Social Anxiety, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily) alongside cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on panic and social anxiety reduction. The patient should be monitored regularly, with follow-up in 4 weeks to assess symptom response, side effects, and medication adherence, and adjustments made as necessary. Education about her condition and involving a trained therapist will be key components. Lifestyle modifications, stress management techniques, and gradual exposure exercises will support her progress. Coordination with mental health specialists and utilization of community support resources will enhance long-term management. This integrated plan aims to reduce her symptom burden, improve social functioning, and promote resilience, while minimizing adverse effects and aligning with her communication style.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Explain the treatment plan, start sertraline at 25 mg, and arrange referral to CBT therapist. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess medication tolerability, provide psychoeducation, and initiate therapy sessions. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve significant reduction in panic and social anxiety symptoms, improve social engagement, and establish sustainable coping strategies. - Patient handout summary: Key points on medication purpose, importance of therapy, symptom monitoring, lifestyle advice, and contact info for follow-up.",
