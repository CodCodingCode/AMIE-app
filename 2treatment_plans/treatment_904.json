    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; clinical presentation after ocular surgery with symptoms suggestive of choroidal detachment, but initial misdiagnosis of retinal detachment necessitates urgent re-evaluation via ophthalmologic examination. - Severity classification: Likely severe, given rapid progression of vision loss, presence of shadows, flashes, pain, and recent surgery, raising concern for serious postoperative intraocular complications requiring prompt intervention. - Urgency level: Urgent; patients with suspected retinal or choroidal detachment symptoms need immediate ophthalmology assessment to prevent permanent vision loss. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Retinal detachment (also possible), intraocular hemorrhage, posterior segment inflammation, or other postoperative complications.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Urgent ophthalmologic evaluation, including detailed dilated fundus examination and ocular imaging (e.g., B-scan ultrasound) to confirm diagnosis and assess extent. - Supporting evidence: Early detection and management of retinal or choroidal detachment are vital to preserve vision; prompt surgical or medical management may be necessary depending on findings. - Patient-specific considerations: Postoperative status increases risk, and her hesitation may delay diagnosis; pain severity and symptom progression warrant urgent action. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in referral; cautious with patient\u2019s communication style, ensure clear explanations and reassurance to facilitate cooperation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not necessarily pharmacologic initially; focus is on urgent ophthalmologic assessment. However, if intraocular pressure is elevated or inflammation is suspected, medications such as topical corticosteroids or appropriate IOP-lowering agents may be considered temporarily under specialist guidance. - Rationale for selection: To control secondary complications while definitive management is arranged. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pharmacologic management may stabilize symptoms in hours to days once instituted; definitive surgical intervention may take place after evaluation. - Key side effects to monitor: Steroids\u2014pressure increase, infection risk; IOP-lowering agents\u2014systemic effects depending on type. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Adjust based on specific findings.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Immediate ocular imaging, rest with head elevation if advised, minimizing eye strain. - Patient education priorities: Symptoms of worsening condition, importance of urgent evaluation, post-surgical care instructions. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity, head positioning as recommended, adhere strictly to postoperative instructions. - Behavioral interventions: Clear communication to reduce anxiety, supportive counseling about procedure recovery.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Urgent ophthalmology review today or within 24 hours; subsequent follow-up based on findings. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, symptom progression, signs of increasing detachment or hemorrhage. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increasing pain, new flashes or shadows, worsening vision\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom stabilization or improvement, imaging follow-up.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic, and reassuring language; explain the need for urgent assessment and possible interventions. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the urgency being standard for postoperative complications; acknowledge her feelings and provide support. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize the importance of follow-up, provide written instructions, and facilitate transportation or support if needed. - Family involvement: With her consent, involve family members to support understanding and adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent referral to ophthalmology (retinal specialist or vitreoretinal surgeon) immediately. - Other healthcare team members: Minimal; primarily ophthalmologic care during acute phase. - Community resources: Visual impairment support, patient education materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss urgent care options and assist with appointment scheduling, possible concerns about costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment (initially suspected but now clarified as choroidal detachment), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with tailored management strategies. The key interventions include immediate referral for detailed ocular examination and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and determine severity. While pharmacologic treatment may be limited initially, controlling intraocular pressure and inflammation as guided by specialists is important. Patient education should focus on symptom recognition and the necessity of prompt follow-up to prevent permanent vision loss. The treatment plan emphasizes urgent care, close monitoring, and clear communication to ensure optimal outcomes. This approach aims to stabilize her condition, facilitate appropriate surgical intervention if needed, and preserve her vision long-term.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with ocular imaging; reassure patient and inform her about the urgency. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, initiate appropriate treatment (medical or surgical), monitor symptoms and signs closely. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve retinal stabilization, restore or preserve visual acuity, and prevent recurrences. - Patient handout summary: Explain symptoms to watch for, the importance of urgent eye care, post-surgical instructions, and follow-up schedule.",
