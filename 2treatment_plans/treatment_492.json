    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of unstable angina, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, vasodilators like nitrates for symptom relief, beta-blockers to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and statins for long-term plaque stabilization. Immediate management involves addressing ongoing chest pain, monitoring vital signs, and preparing for urgent cardiology assessment, ideally within 24-48 hours. Non-pharmacological interventions emphasize lifestyle modifications\u2014smoking cessation, diet, exercise, stress management\u2014and patient education on symptom recognition and emergency signs. Follow-up will be scheduled within one week to evaluate symptom control and medication tolerance and periodically thereafter to adjust treatment and monitor for side effects. The goal is to stabilize her cardiac condition, prevent myocardial infarction, and improve quality of life while considering her anxiety to foster adherence and active engagement in her care.",
