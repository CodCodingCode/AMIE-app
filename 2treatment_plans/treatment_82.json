    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating combination chemotherapy such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone, along with supportive therapies like bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid) to prevent skeletal-related events. The plan emphasizes close monitoring of hematologic parameters, renal function, and symptom control, with regular follow-up visits initially every 2-4 weeks. Pain management, physical therapy, and patient education are integral to care. Given the patient's age and clinical presentation, early referral to a hematologist-oncologist is essential. The aim is to achieve hematologic remission, manage skeletal complications, and maintain quality of life while minimizing treatment side effects. Early coordination with multidisciplinary teams and active patient engagement are critical for successful long-term management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange referral to hematology-oncology, review baseline labs (CBC, renal function, calcium, serum protein electrophoresis), and initiate symptomatic management.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Commence chemotherapy regimen, monitor for adverse effects, implement supportive care measures.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve hematologic response, assess for remission, prevent disease progression, monitor bone health.\n- Patient handout summary: Educate about multiple myeloma, importance of treatment adherence, symptom monitoring, and scheduled follow-ups.",
