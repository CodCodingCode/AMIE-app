    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt diagnostic evaluation with colonoscopy, blood transfusions and iron therapy if anemia is present, nutritional support, and emotional reassurance. Initial management focuses on urgent assessment to confirm diagnosis and evaluate disease extent, while establishing a long-term plan involving potential surgical and oncologic interventions. Follow-up care will include monitoring blood counts and symptoms, with clear instructions for the patient to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen. This approach aims to achieve timely diagnosis, control bleeding, address systemic effects, and support the patient emotionally, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes while minimizing risks and enhancing adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent colonoscopy and blood tests; assess hemoglobin and hemodynamic stability.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis histologically, initiate supportive care, and prepare for definitive treatment planning.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete staging, consider surgical resection, and develop a multimodal oncologic treatment plan.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the urgency of diagnosis, treatment options, importance of follow-up, and seeking help if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear.",
