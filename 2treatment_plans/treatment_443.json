The treatment plan includes supportive care with ocular hygiene, symptomatic relief, and patient education, carefully tailored to her presentation and concerns. Initial management focuses on reassurance, maintaining ocular cleanliness, and symptomatic relief, while establishing close follow-up to monitor recovery and catch any complications early. Follow-up care will include scheduled visits within 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen, with clear instructions for the patient regarding signs of secondary bacterial infection or visual changes. This approach aims to promote recovery, minimize discomfort, prevent transmission, and ensure patient understanding and adherence. Implementation guidance involves immediate actions such as education on hygiene, avoiding eye touching, and using cold compresses, with short-term goals of symptom resolution within one week and long-term objectives of complete recovery with no complications.",
