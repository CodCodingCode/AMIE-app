    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Lumbar Spinal Stenosis\nJustification: The patient's presentation of progressive lower back pain over two months, accompanied by numbness, tingling, heaviness, and a sense of leg weakness or wobbliness, suggests a compressive process affecting nerves in the lumbar spine. The symptoms worsening with prolonged walking or standing but improving with sitting or bending forward\u2014although not definitively established\u2014are characteristic features of lumbar spinal stenosis. No bladder or bowel dysfunction indicates no cauda equina syndrome or more distal nerve involvement. The symptom pattern aligns with neural compression due to degenerative changes, common in older adults or those with degenerative spinal disease. The absence of other neurological deficits, such as weakness in my arms or visual disturbances, further supports a localized spinal pathology rather than systemic neurological or vascular causes.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nLumbar Spinal Stenosis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis and the patient's symptoms of progressive lower back pain, numbness, tingling, and leg heaviness that worsen with prolonged standing or walking and improve with sitting or bending forward, initial management should focus on symptom relief and functional improvement. Conservative, non-pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy aimed at strengthening the core muscles, improving flexibility, and teaching proper body mechanics are first-line treatments. Additionally, encouraging activity modifications to avoid prolonged standing and walking, and weight management if applicable, can help reduce symptoms. Pharmacologically, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for pain relief, provided there are no contraindications. For persistent symptoms despite these measures, a short course of oral corticosteroids or neuropathic agents like gabapentin or pregabalin may be considered under medical supervision. In cases where conservative management fails and the patient\u2019s quality of life is significantly impacted, referral for further evaluation for potential interventions such as epidural steroid injections or surgical consultation may be warranted, but these are not initiated at this stage.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive management plan that includes recommending continued physical therapy focused on strengthening core muscles, improving flexibility, and teaching ergonomic strategies. Advise the patient to modify activities to reduce prolonged standing and walking, especially without sitting breaks or bending forward. Prescribe a trial of NSAIDs for pain control, ensuring no contraindications. Monitor symptoms regularly, and if pain persists or worsens despite these measures, consider a short course of oral corticosteroids or neuropathic pain agents like gabapentin, titrated carefully. Educate the patient about symptoms that warrant urgent evaluation, such as new bowel or bladder dysfunction. Arrange for follow-up in 4-6 weeks to assess response and consider further interventions if necessary."
