    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment: The patient\u2019s presentation with persistent, distressing compulsions involving hand-washing, environmental checking, and secret routines strongl\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an SSRI such as sertraline (start at 25-50 mg daily, titrate as needed) and referring the patient for specialized CBT focusing on exposure and response prevention. Careful monitoring of symptom severity, side effects, and treatment adherence will be conducted every 4 weeks initially, then every 3-6 months long-term. Patient education will cover OCD nature, treatment expectations, and coping strategies. Support from mental health specialists and community resources will be coordinated to optimize outcomes. This integrated approach aims to reduce compulsive behaviors, improve functioning, and enhance overall quality of life while minimizing medication side effects and addressing possible underreported symptoms.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate discussion about medication options, provide psychoeducation, and facilitate referral to a psychologist for CBT.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin medication titration, schedule CBT sessions, and monitor for side effects or adverse reactions.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve significant reduction in compulsions, improve daily functioning, and maintain treatment adherence.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding OCD as a manageable condition, importance of combined therapy, medication adherence, and engaging in CBT with an OCD specialist.",
