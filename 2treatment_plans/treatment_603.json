    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis is traumatic conjunctivitis or minor ocular trauma, which aligns with the patient's symptom onset after playing soccer. The initial step is confirming the severity and urgency; likely mild to moderate, since there's redness, swelling, tearing, and a recent injury without mention of vision loss or corneal abrasion. Urgency is routine care unless symptoms worsen. Differential considerations include foreign body, corneal abrasion, or other ocular surface injuries. Based on current guidelines, treatment emphasizes symptomatic relief and ocular protection. Pharmacologic options should be cautious since topical antibiotics or steroids are not typically first-line unless indicated. Non-pharmacological management includes eye protection and symptom monitoring. Follow-up is essential to ensure resolution and prevent complications. Clear communication tailored to a baseline behavioral patient involves straightforward instructions and reassurance. Referral to an ophthalmologist may be necessary if symptoms worsen or do not improve.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with artificial tears and eye protection, along with patient education on avoiding further trauma. Initial management focuses on reducing discomfort and preventing infection, while establishing a plan for monitoring and follow-up. Follow-up care will include assessing symptom resolution within 24-48 hours and ensuring no signs of corneal abrasion or increasing injury. This approach is designed to promote healing, minimize infection risk, and prevent complications while ensuring the patient understands symptom monitoring and activity restrictions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to avoid eye rubbing, protect the eye with sunglasses or an eye shield if needed, and use preservative-free artificial tears every 1-2 hours as tolerated. Educate about signs of worsening condition requiring urgent care. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom improvement with decreased redness, swelling, tearing; no evidence of persistent trauma or secondary infection. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full recovery of ocular surface; patient able to resume normal activities safely; prevention of recurrent trauma. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize eye rest, avoidance of further injury, use of artificial tears, and warning signs such as increased pain, vision changes, or worsening redness.",
