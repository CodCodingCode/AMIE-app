    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: The diagnosis of eyelid contusion is likely based on recent trauma and characteristic swelling, but further examination is needed to exclude associated ocular injuries. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, depending on the extent of swelling, presence of ecchymosis, tenderness, and absence of signs indicating deeper ocular injury. - Urgency level: Routine care is appropriate unless signs of worsening vision, periorbital or orbital involvement, or suspected foreign body are present. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Orbital fracture, eyelid laceration involving the canaliculi, or intraocular injury, especially if visual disturbances or persistent pain.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Application of cold compresses to reduce swelling, analgesics for pain management, and observation. - Supporting evidence: Cold therapy reduces edema and hematoma formation; analgesics improve comfort. - Patient-specific considerations: Young age, activity level, and family involvement favor conservative management with close observation. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid NSAIDs if bleeding risk is high; monitor for signs of worsening or ocular injury.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 500-1000 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. - Rationale for selection: Effective analgesic with minimal bleeding risk and good safety profile in children. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pain relief expected within hours; swelling may decrease over days. - Key side effects to monitor: Liver function in case of overdose, allergy symptoms. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider topical eye lubricants if foreign body sensation persists, or consult ophthalmology if ocular injury suspected.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, elevate head when resting, avoid rubbing the eye. - Patient education priorities: Importance of avoiding further trauma, recognizing worsening symptoms. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit strenuous activity until swelling subsides. - Behavioral interventions: Reassure the family about the benign nature, advise gentle eye care routines.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 48-72 hours to assess healing and look for complications. - Monitoring parameters: Resolution of swelling, absence of visual changes, no signs of infection. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening pain, visual disturbance, ocular redness, discharge, or eyelid lacerations needing urgent attention. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and physical exam findings signs of resolution.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (worried_family_involved), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, reassuring language, emphasize safety and routine nature of injury. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain that most eyelid contusions recover fully with simple care. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, involve the family in care planning. - Family involvement: Encourage questions, provide contact info for concerns, reassure about monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if visual changes occur or if orbital involvement is suspected. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for wound care or counseling. - Community resources: Educational materials on eye safety and injury prevention. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure cost-effective treatments and follow-up options suitable for the family.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of eyelid contusion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes applying cold compresses, administering acetaminophen for pain relief, and close observation for any signs of worsening or ocular injury, tailored to the patient's level of injury severity. Immediate management focuses on symptom relief and prevention of further trauma, while establishing a follow-up within 48-72 hours to monitor healing. Patient and family education will emphasize symptom monitoring, safety, and recognizing warning signs that require urgent care. This approach aims for complete resolution of symptoms with minimal risk, while maintaining open communication to address family worries and ensure adherence.",
