    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal cancer with anal metastasis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent oncologic management with supportive care strategies. The initial focus includes prompt referral to oncology for staging and systemic chemotherapy, such as FOLFOX, tailored to the patient's functional status. Surgical consultation is also indicated for assessment of resectability or palliative procedures. The treatment plan encompasses systemic therapy to control disease progression, symptom management for bleeding and bowel irregularities, nutritional support, and psychosocial care. Follow-up involves regular clinical and imaging assessments to monitor treatment response and adjust therapies accordingly. Education will be delivered using clear, simple language with written summaries, and involving family members to enhance adherence. Throughout, coordination with multidisciplinary teams, including surgical, radiation, nutritional, and palliative specialists, will optimize patient outcomes, aiming to improve quality of life and disease control while vigilantly monitoring for complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm staging with imaging, initiate referral to oncology, and provide symptom management support.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Begin systemic chemotherapy, assess patient tolerance, and address nutritional and supportive needs.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Evaluate treatment response, consider surgical or palliative interventions, and manage ongoing symptoms.\n- Patient handout summary: Outline disease nature, treatment options, importance of follow-up, and contact information for support services.",
