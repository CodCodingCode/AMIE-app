    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes definitive diagnostic imaging (contrast-enhanced CT or MRI) and tissue biopsy to confirm malignancy staging. Symptom management involves pain control with opioids, nutritional support with pancreatic enzyme replacement, and lifestyle modifications such as alcohol abstinence and dietary adjustments. The patient will receive detailed education about the disease, treatment options, and prognosis, with empathetic communication tailored to reduce anxiety.\nInitial management priorities are confirming diagnosis, controlling pain, and addressing malabsorption. Long-term strategies include multidisciplinary coordination with oncology for chemoradiation or surgery assessment, ongoing symptom monitoring, and supportive care. Follow-up will entail regular clinical evaluations, labs, and imaging as indicated, with attention to red flags like worsening pain or jaundice.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging and biopsy, initiate pain management, and begin nutritional consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, establish pain control and nutritional support, and discuss treatment options.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Initiate oncologic therapy if appropriate, provide psychosocial support, and monitor disease progression.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of diagnostic tests, symptom management, lifestyle changes, and follow-up appointments to optimize care and quality of life.",
