The treatment plan includes initiating an antiepileptic drug such as levetiracetam with close follow-up to assess seizure control and side effects, alongside education about seizure safety and lifestyle modifications. Immediate priorities involve starting medication and arranging neurology and neurosurgery consultations for tumor evaluation and potential treatment. Long-term management will focus on neurological stability, tumor monitoring via imaging, and considering surgical options if indicated. Follow-up care will include regular assessments of seizure frequency, medication adherence, and neurological status, with clear instructions provided to the patient regarding warning signs requiring urgent care. This approach aims to minimize seizure recurrence, prevent complications, and optimize quality of life while coordinating multidisciplinary care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about seizure safety, initiate levetiracetam 500 mg BID, and coordinate neurology and neurosurgery referrals.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve medication tolerability, monitor for side effects, and track seizure activity.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Assess seizure control, evaluate for possible tumor resection, and adjust treatment accordingly.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, safety precautions, importance of follow-up, and recognizing signs of seizure worsening or tumor progression.",
