    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on chronicity, consistency wit\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of anxiety-related somatic symptom disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based psychotherapy with pharmacological support and lifestyle modifications. The initial focus is on initiating CBT tailored for health anxiety and somatic symptom management, along with starting an SSRI such as sertraline 50 mg daily, with close monitoring for side effects. Patient education will emphasize understanding that her symptoms are common manifestations of anxiety and stress, and stress reduction techniques will be incorporated. Follow-up is planned at 4-6 weeks to assess response and adjust the plan as needed. Engagement of family members in psychoeducation can enhance adherence and support. Coordination with mental health professionals is recommended to optimize care. This plan aims to reduce her symptom burden, improve insight, and promote long-term resilience while minimizing unnecessary medical investigations.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Explain the treatment plan, initiate sertraline, and refer for CBT. Provide educational handouts about anxiety and somatic symptoms.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Patient to start therapy sessions, monitor medication tolerability, and practice stress reduction techniques.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduction in symptom severity, improved insight, and better coping skills.\n- Patient handout summary: Understanding your symptoms, treatment options, medication use, importance of therapy, lifestyle changes, and when to seek urgent help.",
