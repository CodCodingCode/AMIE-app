    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation and hist\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of venous stasis dermatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes implementing consistent compression therapy, skin care with emollients, and topical anti-inflammatory medications such as mild corticosteroids. Initial management focuses on reducing inflammation, controlling edema, and preventing secondary infections, considering her age and possible confusion. Long-term strategies involve leg elevation, lifestyle modifications, and monitoring for infection or worsening symptoms. Follow-up will be scheduled in 2\u20134 weeks to assess skin healing and symptom improvement, with urgent re-evaluation if signs of infection or significant worsening occur. Patient education will emphasize adherence to compression, hygiene, and recognizing complications, possibly involving family support. Coordination with a vascular specialist and wound care team will be arranged if necessary. This approach aims to relieve symptoms, promote skin healing, prevent complications, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks associated with treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on leg elevation and skin care, provide compression stockings, and prescribe topical corticosteroids.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce inflammation, decrease edema, improve skin condition, and ensure patient understands and adheres to therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained skin integrity, control swelling, and prevent recurrence with ongoing use of compression and lifestyle adjustments.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include daily skin care, consistent use of compression stockings, leg elevation, recognizing signs of infection, and scheduling follow-up visits.",
