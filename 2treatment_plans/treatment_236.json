    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary gouty arthritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs (such as naproxen or indomethacin) for rapid symptom relief, with colchicine as an alternative if NSAIDs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated. Non-pharmacologic measures include joint rest, elevation, cold therapy, and patient education on lifestyle modifications like avoiding purine-rich foods and alcohol, maintaining hydration, and weight management. Regular follow-up within 1-2 weeks will monitor symptom resolution, medication tolerance, and renal function, with prompts to seek urgent care if systemic symptoms or worsening signs develop. Further long-term management involves controlling hyperuricemia to prevent recurrent attacks, possibly with urate-lowering therapy under rheumatology guidance. Clear communication tailored to the patient's baseline approach will foster adherence, and coordination with specialists and community resources will support sustained management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe NSAIDs after confirming no contraindications, educate the patient on joint care, and discuss warning signs.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve significant pain reduction, prevent complications, and reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain serum uric acid below target levels, prevent future flares, and address underlying risk factors.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication use, lifestyle changes, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.",
