    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; the presentation of a sudden, worsening headache with neck stiffness and recent head trauma raises concern for mild TBI or concussion. - Severity classification: Likely mild, considering symptoms are initially manageable but with signs (headache, neck stiffness, dizziness) that warrant close monitoring. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed, given the recent head trauma, worsening symptoms, and potential for secondary injury or deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Subconcussion signs, intracranial pathology, cervical spine injury, or ocular injury.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Rest with gradual return to activity, symptomatic management for headache. - Supporting evidence: Rest, avoidance of strenuous activity, analgesics, and neurological monitoring are recommended for mild TBI. - Patient-specific considerations: Signs of neck stiffness, eye swelling, and possible head injury increase the need for careful observation. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid overexertion early; use caution with medications that might mask symptoms.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Acetaminophen 650-1000 mg every 6 hours as needed for headache. - Rationale for selection: Effective analgesic for mild to moderate headache with minimal side effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Within 24-48 hours, headache should decrease; if persistent, reassess. - Key side effects to monitor: Liver function (if high doses), allergic reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: NSAIDs like ibuprofen, if not contraindicated (considering GI or bleeding risks).  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest in a quiet, dim environment; avoid screens and strenuous activity. - Patient education priorities: Recognize worsening symptoms, importance of avoiding high-risk activities, and when to seek urgent care. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, good sleep hygiene, gradual return to activity as tolerated. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive rest; possibly referral to neuropsychology if lingering cognitive symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate within 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Headache severity, neurological status, neck stiffness, signs of increased intracranial pressure. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening headache, confusion, vomiting, seizures, weakness, or deteriorating consciousness. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, functional status, and neurological exam findings.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (chronology_confused), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; repeat key points; provide written summaries. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety, clarify cumulative injury risks, and explain warning signs. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, involve family members if appropriate, and set specific follow-up plans. - Family involvement: Educate family on monitoring for deterioration and supporting gradual activity resumption.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurotrauma or neurology consult if symptoms persist or worsen; ophthalmology for eye swelling if eye injury suspected. - Other healthcare team members: Physical therapy, neuropsychology for cognitive recovery. - Community resources: Brain injury support groups, educational websites. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with scheduling, clarify coverage for follow-up services.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (suspected concussion/mild TBI), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptomatic management with careful monitoring and patient education. The plan includes initiating rest and gradual activity resumption, administering acetaminophen for headache, and observing for signs of neurological deterioration. Given her recent head trauma and presenting symptoms, urgent evaluation and close follow-up are essential. Patient education emphasizes symptom recognition and safety precautions, with involvement of family members to support monitoring. Follow-up should occur within 24-48 hours to assess symptom progression and ensure recovery. Additional referrals to neurology or ophthalmology are warranted if symptoms change or persist. This approach aims to optimize recovery, minimize risks, and ensure timely intervention if complications arise.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise rest, provide symptom management with acetaminophen, and arrange for urgent follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom resolution, prevent complications, and gradually resume activities under guidance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve full recovery, re-establish baseline activities, and address any persistent cognitive or physical deficits. - Patient handout summary: Key points about head injury, warning signs needing urgent care, medication use, activity restrictions, and follow-up plan.",
