    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care with analgesics (acetaminophen or NSAIDs), adequate rest, hydration, and activity modifications. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor recovery and identify any complications promptly. Patient education should emphasize the importance of rest, avoidance of contact sports, and recognition of warning signs such as worsening abdominal pain or jaundice. No antiviral medications are indicated unless complications develop. The plan aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and promote full recovery while minimizing risks and respecting the patient\u2019s communication style. This approach is designed to promote sustained health improvement, reduce potential risks like splenic rupture, and support the patient\u2019s engagement in her care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate patient about resting, symptom management, and activity restrictions; prescribe acetaminophen or NSAIDs as needed.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution; monitor for complications; maintain activity restrictions.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery; return to normal activities; prevent complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include rest, hydration, medication use, recognizing warning signs, and follow-up schedule.",
