    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines definitive surgical excision with rigorous follow-up and patient education. The initial management involves prompt referral to a dermatologist or surgical oncologist for excision with appropriate margins, guided by Breslow thickness once pathology is available. Postoperative care includes wound management and monitoring for early signs of recurrence. Simultaneously, I advise implementing sun protection measures\u2014using broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing, and avoiding UV exposure\u2014to prevent additional skin damage. Patient education will focus on recognizing new or changing skin lesions and adhering to scheduled skin examinations. Follow-up will be scheduled in 2-4 weeks to assess wound healing and review pathology results. Long-term management involves routine skin surveillance, lifestyle modifications, and potential systemic therapies if staged as high risk or advanced. This multidisciplinary approach aims to achieve optimal oncologic outcomes while minimizing risks and empowering the patient in their ongoing skin health.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule biopsy/excision appointment; provide patient education on sun protection and skin self-exam.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical removal; review pathology results; ensure wound healing.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish routine skin cancer surveillance; reinforce sun-safe behaviors; plan further oncologic assessment if indicated.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of early treatment, sun protection, regular skin checks, and adherence to follow-up appointments.",
