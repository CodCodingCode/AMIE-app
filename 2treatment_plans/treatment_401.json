    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan based on the diagnosis of an acute descending thoracic aortic dissection with cerebral involvement. Confirm the urgency of the conditio\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute descending thoracic aortic dissection with cerebral involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate blood pressure control with IV beta-blockers to reduce shear stress, urgent surgical consultation for potential repair, and continuous neurological and hemodynamic monitoring. This is followed by supportive care emphasizing bed rest, patient education about the seriousness of the condition, and lifestyle modifications to address hypertension and reduce future risk. Close follow-up will involve multidisciplinary coordination, vigilant symptom monitoring, and timely surgical intervention as indicated. This approach aims to stabilize the patient, prevent dissection progression or rupture, and optimize neurological outcomes while minimizing treatment-related risks.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV beta-blocker infusion, monitor vital signs continuously, prepare for urgent surgical evaluation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve blood pressure targets, confirm diagnosis with imaging, execute surgical repair if indicated, and manage neurological deficits.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Implement strict blood pressure control, lifestyle modifications, and regular imaging surveillance to detect recurrence or progression.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of blood pressure management, symptoms to watch for, need for urgent surgery, and lifestyle changes to prevent future dissection.\nSTOP HERE.",
