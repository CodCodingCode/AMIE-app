    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient presents with a subacute and progressively worsening constellation of neurological symptoms involving bilateral leg weakness, gait instability, heaviness, tingling sensations, increased frequency of urination, and additional arm clumsiness. The progression over time, coupled with widespread neurological involvement including motor, sensory, cerebellar, and bladder symptoms, is characteristic of a demyelinating process such as MS. The absence of systemic illness or infectious symptoms supports a central nervous system demyelinating disease rather than infectious or systemic causes. The simultaneous involvement of multiple neurologic domains and the pattern of symptom progression point toward MS as the most probable diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the primary goals are to reduce disease activity, prevent new relapses, manage symptoms, and support the patient's overall quality of life. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are essential to alter the course of the disease, typically initiated by a neurologist but possibly coordinated with the primary care physician. Symptomatic treatments can help address issues such as bladder dysfunction, gait instability, and sensory disturbances. Non-pharmacological strategies, including physical therapy and patient education, are important to maintain mobility and function, as well as to provide psychological support. Because MS is a chronic condition with varied manifestations, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is advisable, with close follow-up to monitor disease activity and medication side effects.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include initiating disease-modifying therapy (such as interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, or other agents appropriate based on patient-specific factors and neurologist consultation) to reduce relapse frequency and slow progression. Symptom management should involve referral to physical and occupational therapy to improve gait stability and limb strength, as well as to address sensory symptoms. For bladder symptoms, a trial of behavioral techniques and possibly anticholinergic medications can be considered. Education about recognizing relapse signs and the importance of chronic treatment adherence is essential. The patient should also be advised on lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise within tolerance, adequate hydration, and smoking cessation if applicable. Coordination with a neurologist specializing in MS is recommended to tailor immunomodulatory treatment and to consider additional therapies, such as corticosteroids during exacerbations, if needed. Regular follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy and side effects, along with psychological support for coping with a chronic illness, should be part of ongoing care."
