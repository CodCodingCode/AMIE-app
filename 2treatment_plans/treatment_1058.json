    "output": "THINKING: The final diagnosis is viral conjunctivitis, which is typically caused by adenoviruses and is highly contagious. The patient's recent onset of redness, swelling, tearing, and the history of activity (playing soccer) suggests an infectious conjunctivitis. The mention of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis in the patient context appears inconsistent with the eye symptoms; since the diagnosis provided is viral conjunctivitis, I will proceed accordingly, ignoring the unrelated context. The severity seems mild at this stage, with no signs of corneal involvement or vision compromise; urgency is routine unless symptoms worsen. Treatment focuses on symptom relief and preventing transmission, with no antibiotics indicated unless secondary bacterial infection develops.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive eye care and hygiene measures with careful attention to infection control. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and preventing contagion while establishing follow-up to monitor for progression. Follow-up care will include regular reassessment of symptoms with clear instructions for the patient regarding hygiene and activity restrictions. This approach is designed to reduce discomfort, limit transmission, and promote recovery while minimizing potential risks like secondary bacterial infection.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, perform frequent hand hygiene, and discontinue contact activities such as playing soccer. Recommend lubricant eye drops for comfort. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Resolve symptoms, prevent spread to others, and monitor for signs of secondary infection. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery of eye appearance and function, and educate on appropriate hygiene to prevent recurrence. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize symptom management with artificial tears, hygiene practices, avoiding contact with others, and recognizing signs of worsening (persistent pain, vision changes, purulent discharge) warranting prompt medical attention.",
