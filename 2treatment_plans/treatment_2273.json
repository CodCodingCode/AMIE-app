    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's two-year history of progressive weakness, increased falls, balance problems, and sensory disturbances (tingling, stiffness, fatigue) suggests a neurological etiology affecting multiple systems. The visual symptoms of blurry or foggy vision, along with eye discomfort and light sensitivity, are characteristic of optic neuritis or other visual pathway involvement common in MS. The presence of eye heaviness and soreness that improves with rest points towards an inflammatory process rather than primary eye disease. MS is a demyelinating disorder that frequently presents with such a spectrum of motor, sensory, and visual symptoms, often evolving over time with relapsing or progressive courses. The absence of double vision does not exclude MS, as certain visual symptoms may predominate early or be variable. The overall presentation aligns well with MS as the most plausible diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is supported by a constellation of symptoms including progressive weakness, increased falls, balance issues, sensory disturbances, and visual problems characteristic of demyelination and neuroinflammation. Given the chronic and potentially disabling nature of MS, early initiation of treatment is crucial to modify disease progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. Pharmacological therapy will focus on disease-modifying agents to reduce relapse frequency and delay progression, while symptomatic treatments can address specific issues like spasticity, fatigue, and pain. Non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and patient education can improve mobility, maintain function, and promote adaptive strategies to manage daily activities. Regular monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimal management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating disease-modifying therapy such as interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or another FDA-approved agent appropriate for the patient's disease course, considering side-effect profiles and patient preferences. Symptomatic management should include medications for spasticity (e.g., baclofen or tizanidine), fatigue (e.g., amantadine or modafinil if suitable), and neuropathic pain (e.g., gabapentin or pregabalin). Referral to a neurologist specialized in MS is recommended for further management and coordination of treatment. Additionally, the patient should be engaged in physical and occupational therapy to address mobility and daily functioning, provided with educational resources about MS, and advised on lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, stress reduction, and smoking cessation if applicable. Regular follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy and side effects is essential, along with screening for comorbid conditions."
