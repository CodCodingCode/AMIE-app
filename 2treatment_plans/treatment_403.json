The treatment plan includes immediate resuscitation with IV fluids and blood transfusions as needed, rapid surgical assessment for possible detorsion or resection, and supportive care such as NG decompression. Early surgical consultation is critical to prevent bowel necrosis and systemic complications. During hospitalization, close monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and abdominal findings will be essential to guide ongoing management. Once stabilized, patient education should focus on the nature of their condition, the importance of early intervention, and signs warranting urgent care in the future. Follow-up will involve postoperative assessment, nutritional support, and addressing underlying risk factors to prevent recurrence. This approach aims to optimize outcomes, minimize complications, and facilitate recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV fluids, secure IV access, notify surgical team, and start blood transfusions if indicated. Insert NG tube if vomiting persists.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical intervention, monitor for complications, and stabilize patient\u2019s condition.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Assess bowel function, ensure recovery progress, and evaluate for any additional interventions or lifestyle adjustments.\n- Patient handout summary: \"You have a serious condition called volvulus, requiring urgent surgery to untwist or remove affected bowel. We will give you fluids and monitor you closely. It\u2019s important to follow medical advice and seek care immediately if symptoms worsen.\"",
