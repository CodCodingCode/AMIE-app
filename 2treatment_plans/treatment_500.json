    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: I am fairly confident this is an acute corneal abrasion or conjunctival injury based on recent trauma, symptoms, and presentation. - Severity classification: Moderate, because redness, tearing, and swelling suggest tissue injury but no signs of perforation or vision loss. - Urgency level: Urgent; eye trauma requires prompt assessment to prevent complications such as infection or persistent damage. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Intraocular foreign body, corneal laceration, or chemical injury if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Prescribe topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin or polymyxin B/trimethoprim) to prevent infection and advise artificial tears for lubrication. - Supporting evidence: Standard care involves prophylactic antibiotics and lubrication to promote healing and reduce infection risk. - Patient-specific considerations: Active sports activity increases risk for further injury; advise protective measures. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical corticosteroids initially unless inflammation is severe and after proper ophthalmology consultation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, 1 cm strip applied to affected eye(s) every 12 hours. - Rationale for selection: Broad-spectrum coverage, minimal systemic absorption, safe for self-administration. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 24-48 hours; complete healing in 3-5 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Corneal ulceration (rare), allergic reactions, worsening redness or pain. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Polymyxin B/trimethoprim drops, or consider ophthalmologist review if no improvement.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Advise the patient to avoid rubbing the eye, wear protective eyewear during sports, and keep eye protected from further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Importance of adherence to medication, recognizing signs of worsening (pain, vision changes), and avoiding contamination. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest the eye, avoid eye makeup or contact lenses until fully healed. - Behavioral interventions: Stress adherence and injury prevention strategies; consider educational materials about eye safety.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, absence of increasing redness, pain, or vision deterioration. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, decreased vision, photophobia, or signs of infection\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom reduction, resolution of redness and tearing.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain the diagnosis, treatment importance, and self-care instructions in simple language. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about healing process, explain safety measures for activity restrictions. - Adherence strategies: Use written instructions, set clear expectations, and encourage questions. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for medication administration and protective measures, especially since the patient plays sports.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if symptoms do not improve in 48 hours, or if signs of corneal laceration or foreign body are suspected. - Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff or caregivers for medication application. - Community resources: Provide information on eye safety and injury prevention. - Insurance/cost considerations: Offer generic medication options; ensure medication cost is manageable.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute ocular trauma likely due to corneal abrasion or conjunctival injury, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prescribing topical erythromycin ointment to prevent infection, using artificial tears for lubrication, and educating the patient on protective eye measures and symptom monitoring. Immediate management focusses on preventing infection and minimizing further injury while establishing clear follow-up to assess healing. Follow-up care will involve re-evaluation within 24-48 hours, monitoring for signs of worsening or complications, and arranging specialist consultation if there is no improvement or if additional concerns arise. This approach aims to promote rapid healing, prevent infection, and mitigate long-term complications, while addressing patient concerns and ensuring compliance through education and supportive communication.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Apply first dose of erythromycin ointment, educate patient on eye protection, and advise avoidance of rubbing or further trauma. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, healing of corneal epithelium, and infection prevention. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery, prevention of recurrent injury, and patient education on eye safety. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions for medication use, follow-up schedule, warning signs requiring urgent care, and protective tips during sports.",
