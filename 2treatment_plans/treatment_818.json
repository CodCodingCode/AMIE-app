    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given the clinical presentation and imaging indicating a pituitary macroadenoma or sellar/suprasellar mass lesion. However, definitive diagnosis requires histopathology, especially considering the initial \"embryonal tumors\" mention, which may suggest differential diagnoses like intracranial embryonal tumors that can mimic adenomas. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, as the patient exhibits signs of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting), visual disturbances, and possible hormonal effects, necessitating urgent attention. - Urgency level: Urgent, due to neurological symptoms and potential for rapid progression leading to optic chiasm compression or pituitary apoplexy. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other sellar masses (e.g., craniopharyngioma, meningioma), intracranial germ cell tumors, or metastatic lesions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical resection via transsphenoidal approach is standard to decompress the tumor and obtain tissue for diagnosis. - Supporting evidence: Surgery rapidly alleviates mass effect symptoms, allows definitive diagnosis, and can improve visual deficits. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety and possible hormonal imbalances need to be managed pre-, intra-, and post-operatively. - Contraindications or cautions: Careful assessment of bleeding risk, hormonal status, and proximity of the mass to critical structures.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Preoperative management may include corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4-10 mg IV or PO as needed) to manage edema and prevent adrenal insufficiency. - Rationale for selection: Corticosteroids reduce cerebral edema and stabilize the patient pre-surgery. - Expected timeline for improvement: Rapid improvement over hours to days after initiation. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood glucose, infection risk, and mood changes. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Hormonal replacements if deficiencies are identified; dopamine agonists (e.g., cabergoline) if a prolactinoma, but less relevant here given the presentation.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Patient reassurance, head elevation to reduce intracranial pressure, and counseling to address anxiety. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of the diagnosis, surgical steps, and potential outcomes. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate sleep, stress reduction techniques, and avoidance of strenuous activity until cleared. - Behavioral interventions: Referral to mental health support or counseling if anxiety impacts overall well-being.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess within 24-72 hours post-admission (pre-op), then at 1-2 weeks, and regularly thereafter based on recovery. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity and fields, hormonal levels (ACTH, TSH, prolactin, GH, cortisol), and tumor size via imaging. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of headache, new visual deficits, altered consciousness, or signs of CSF leak. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in symptoms, stable or decreasing tumor size on MRI, and hormonal normalization.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language emphasizing the urgency but also the treatability of the condition. Address anxieties directly, providing reassurance. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify the surgical procedure, potential risks, and expected outcomes to reduce anxiety. - Adherence strategies: Involve patient in decision-making, provide written information, and schedule timely follow-up. - Family involvement: With patient consent, include family members for support and to facilitate understanding and adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurosurgeon for surgical planning, endocrinologist for hormonal assessment and management, and ophthalmologist for visual assessment. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing team for perioperative care, mental health professionals if anxiety is significant, and physical therapists for postoperative rehabilitation. - Community resources: Support groups for brain tumors or endocrine disorders, educational materials from reputable sources. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for surgical procedures, labs, and follow-up testing; assist patient with scheduling.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical intervention with supportive medical management and patient-centered care strategies. The initial focus is on urgent surgical resection via transsphenoidal surgery to decompress the tumor, improve symptoms, and establish diagnosis. Preoperative management includes corticosteroids to reduce edema and mitigate neurological complications. Postoperative follow-up will involve close monitoring of visual function, hormonal levels, and repeat imaging to assess for residual or recurrent tumor. The plan incorporates patient education to address anxiety, with psychological support as needed. Long-term management includes endocrine evaluation and treatment of hormonal deficiencies, as well as regular imaging surveillance. Collaboration with neurosurgery, endocrinology, ophthalmology, and mental health specialists is essential to ensure optimal outcomes. This multidisciplinary approach aims to relieve symptoms, preserve neurological and visual function, and maintain hormonal balance.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate corticosteroids as indicated, arrange urgent neurosurgical consultation, conduct baseline visual assessment, and start patient education about the procedure and prognosis. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical resection, monitor for complications, and establish hormonal replacements if needed. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve tumor stability or reduction on imaging, normalize hormonal levels, and support psychological well-being. - Patient handout summary: Key points about diagnosis, surgical plan, importance of follow-up, and recognizing symptoms requiring urgent attention.",
