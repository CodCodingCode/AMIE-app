    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rheumatic aortitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 40-60 mg daily) to control vascular inflammation, with careful monitoring for side effects and symptom resolution. Long-term management involves gradual tapering of steroids, introduction of steroid-sparing agents if necessary, and regular follow-up with inflammatory marker assessment, imaging, and ophthalmologic evaluations. Immediate actions include starting corticosteroids today, arranging follow-up within two weeks, and scheduling imaging studies to monitor disease activity. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognizing warning symptoms such as vision changes or chest pain worsening, and lifestyle modifications like smoking cessation and healthy diet. The goal is to reduce inflammation, prevent vascular complications, and preserve visual function, while minimizing treatment risks through vigilant monitoring. This integrated approach aims to achieve sustained remission, prevent serious complications, and support overall patient well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe corticosteroids, schedule follow-up appointment, arrange ophthalmologic assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess symptom improvement, monitor inflammatory markers, adjust medication dose as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission, taper corticosteroids safely, and monitor for relapse or side effects.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication importance, warning signs requiring urgent care, lifestyle tips, and follow-up plans.",
