    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; presentation with severe chest heaviness radiating to neck and arm and new/worsening symptoms suggest acute coronary syndrome, likely unstable angina or NSTEMI. - Severity classification: Severe and urgent; symptoms are acute, persistent, and caused significant discomfort, indicating high risk. - Urgency level: Immediate referral and hospital evaluation required; this is an emergency until stabilized. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, esophageal rupture, but current presentation strongly points to ACS.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Hospital admission with continuous cardiac monitoring, oxygen therapy if hypoxic, administration of antiplatelet therapy, nitroglycerin for pain, and anticoagulation. - Supporting evidence: These interventions reduce ischemic injury, prevent thrombus progression, and are standard for acute management. - Patient-specific considerations: No contraindications mentioned; monitor for hypotension or allergy. - Contraindications or cautions: Bleeding risk with anticoagulants; ensure no active bleeding or contraindicating conditions.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Aspirin 325 mg orally immediately, with continuation as per hospital protocol. - Rationale for selection: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation; proven benefit in ACS. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pain relief within minutes; stabilization over hours; serial markers and ECG to guide further therapy. - Key side effects to monitor: Bleeding, gastrointestinal upset, hypersensitivity reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel) in addition, if aspirin contraindicated, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in hospital setting.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Strict bed rest initially; oxygen therapy if indicated; arrange for early cardiac imaging. - Patient education priorities: Explain severity, need for urgent hospital care, importance of medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Once stabilized, promote a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation if applicable, and physical activity based on cardiology guidance. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction techniques, smoking avoidance, adherence counseling.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in hospital daily; repeat ECGs and cardiac enzymes; outpatient cardiology follow-up within 1 week. - Monitoring parameters: Chest pain resolution, ECG changes, cardiac biomarker levels, signs of bleeding or hemodynamic instability. - Red flag symptoms: Recurrent chest pain, sudden worsening, syncope, signs of bleeding or arrhythmias. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief, stabilization on medications, and laboratory/imaging results.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, and informative; explain urgency, what to expect, and importance of treatment adherence. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the effectiveness of treatments; discuss risks and benefits transparently. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimen, provide written instructions, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Educate family members about recognizing symptoms and supporting recovery.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiology consult for inpatient management and long-term plan. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for monitoring; physiotherapy for post-stabilization; dietitian for lifestyle counseling. - Community resources: Cardiac rehab programs, smoking cessation services. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with coverage options for medications and follow-up testing; provide patient education on navigating healthcare resources.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, specifically unstable angina, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent hospitalization with continuous cardiac monitoring, administration of aspirin and other antithrombotic agents, nitrates for pain relief, and anticoagulation, all aligned with current guidelines. Immediate actions focus on stabilizing the patient, preventing thrombotic progression, and performing diagnostic assessments such as ECG and cardiac enzymes. Long-term management will involve cardiology follow-up, lifestyle modifications, and risk factor control to reduce recurrence. Monitoring will include tracking symptom resolution, ECG changes, and lab markers, along with patient education on recognizing warning signs. This approach aims to stabilize the patient acutely while establishing a foundation for long-term cardiovascular health, minimizing risks, and supporting adherence.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Admit to hospital, administer aspirin, start continuous ECG monitoring, provide supplemental oxygen if hypoxic, and prepare for further stabilization procedures. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization, complete diagnostic workup, initiate secondary prevention measures, and educate the patient. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Implement comprehensive risk factor modification, ensure medication adherence, and schedule routine follow-up with cardiology. - Patient handout summary: Highlight symptoms to watch for, medication instructions, lifestyle advice, and when to seek emergency care.",
