    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate certainty that this is a subconjunctival hemorrhage or eyelid contusion given recent trauma; however, need to rule out other ocular injuries or more serious injuries. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; primarily localized eye redness and swelling after trauma with tearing, without signs of globe rupture or visual acuity impairment. - Urgency level: Routine care with prompt evaluation to confirm diagnosis and rule out serious ocular injury; urgent outpatient assessment recommended. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Orbital fractures, globe rupture, ocular laceration, other orbital injuries.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with cold compresses and observation. - Supporting evidence: Cold compresses reduce swelling and blood vessel dilation; most subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve spontaneously. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient engaging in sports, need for activity restrictions until resolution. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid further trauma; monitor for worsening or associated symptoms.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears or lubricating eye drops as needed for tearing; analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for discomfort. - Rationale for selection: To comfort the eye and manage minor pain without contraindications. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 1-2 weeks; complete resolution typically in 2-3 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions or irritation from drops; overuse of analgesics regarding liver function. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None typically necessary for hemorrhage; if underlying infection suspected, consider antibiotics.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, avoid rubbing the eye, limit strenuous activity temporarily. - Patient education priorities: Educate about signs of worsening, such as vision loss, increasing pain, or additional bleeding. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid further trauma, wear eye protection during sports. - Behavioral interventions: Stress cautious activity and adherence to follow-up.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1 week to assess resolution and rule out complications. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, any new symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision changes, increasing pain, signs of globe rupture. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or decrease in swelling and redness.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain that subconjunctival hemorrhage is benign and usually self-limited. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about prognosis, dispel fears of more serious injury. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize symptom monitoring and follow-up appointments. - Family involvement: Encourage family to assist in activity restrictions and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if symptoms worsen, visual acuity changes, or if unsure about diagnosis. - Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff for follow-up support. - Community resources: Provide informational materials about eye safety and trauma. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure coverage for specialist consults, and advise on cost-effective over-the-counter remedies.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of subconjunctival hemorrhage or eyelid contusion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with cold compresses, artificial tears, and analgesics, along with activity modifications and eye protection during sports. Initial management focuses on reassurance, symptomatic care, and conservative observation to allow spontaneous resolution, while ensuring prompt follow-up to monitor for any signs of deterioration. Follow-up in approximately one week will assess recovery and rule out complications. Patient education emphasizes avoiding further trauma, recognizing warning signs such as vision changes or increasing pain, and adhering to activity restrictions. This approach aims for complete resolution with minimal complications, while addressing the patient's needs and ensuring safe recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate patient on injury, advise cold compress application, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom improvement, ensure no development of complication, and confirm resolution. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm complete healing, prevent future trauma, and reinforce eye safety. - Patient handout summary: Explain that most subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve on their own, advise on symptom monitoring, activity restrictions, and follow-up plans.",
