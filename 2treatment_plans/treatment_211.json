    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of floppy eyelid syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes regular eyelid hygiene, use of preservative-free artificial tears, and gentle eyelid taping as initial measures, along with education on eyelid laxity and symptom monitoring. The patient will be followed in 4-6 weeks to evaluate symptom progression and eyelid status, with prompt referral to ophthalmology if needed. This approach aims to reduce eyelid irritation and improve eyelid position, minimizing discomfort while avoiding unnecessary interventions. Clear communication will be employed to address the patient's anxiety, emphasizing gradual improvement and active involvement in care. Long-term management will be tailored based on response, with attention to behavioral factors influencing adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate patient about eyelid hygiene, recommend preservative-free artificial tears, and instruct on gentle eyelid taping if comfortable.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom relief, improved eyelid comfort, and adherence to hygiene and taping.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilization or improvement of eyelid position, prevention of complications, and evaluation for potential surgical management if conservative measures suffice.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points\u2014eyelid hygiene practices, importance of lubrication, gentle eyelid support, follow-up schedule, and signs warranting urgent care.",
