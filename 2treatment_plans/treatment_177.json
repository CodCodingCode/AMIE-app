    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of localized swelli\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cellulitis of the anterior chest, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating oral antibiotics\u2014specifically cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 7-10 days\u2014to effectively target common pathogens. Rest, elevation, and hygiene are important adjuncts. The patient should be educated on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and recognizing warning signs of systemic infection. Follow-up should occur within 48-72 hours to assess clinical response; signs of worsening infection necessitate immediate reevaluation. Deepening communication will emphasize clarity and reassurance to promote adherence and early reporting of complications. Close monitoring and timely adjustments will help ensure resolution while minimizing risks. This approach aims for symptom resolution, prevention of recurrence, and avoiding complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe cephalexin, provide patient education, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antibiotics course, monitor for resolution, and reassess if symptoms persist.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, educate about skin care, and monitor for any underlying issues.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication use, signs of worsening, hygiene tips, and follow-up instructions.",
