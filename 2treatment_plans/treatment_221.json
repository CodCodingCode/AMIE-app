    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the severity and urgency of acute cholangitis, which, given the patient's systemic symptoms (fever, chills, vomiting) and signs of possible biliary obstruction (dar\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute cholangitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating prompt intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover common biliary pathogens, maintaining supportive measures such as IV fluids for hydration, and closely monitoring for progression of systemic infection or signs of perforation. Urgent evaluation with abdominal ultrasound is indicated to assess for biliary duct dilation, stones, or perforation, and an urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be arranged for biliary decompression if evidence suggests biliary obstruction or if the patient\u2019s condition worsens. Initial stabilization aims to control infection, relieve biliary obstruction, and prevent perforation. Long-term management will involve addressing underlying causes, such as gallstone disease, and planning for elective cholecystectomy once the acute illness resolves. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs of deterioration, adherence to antibiotics, and follow-up plans for definitive treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain blood cultures and liver function tests; initiate IV fluids and empiric IV antibiotics (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole); perform abdominal ultrasound; monitor vitals closely.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve clinical stability, monitor for infection resolution, perform ERCP for biliary drainage if indicated, and start planning definitive gallbladder management.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete cholecystectomy if feasible; monitor for recurrence or complications; educate patient on biliary disease and prevention.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of completing antibiotics, recognizing worsening symptoms like increasing pain, fever, or jaundice, and attending scheduled follow-up appointments.\nSTOP HERE.",
