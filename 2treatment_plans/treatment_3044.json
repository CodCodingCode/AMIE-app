    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri\nJustification: The patient presents with chronic headaches that worsen in the mornings, associated with nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances (blurry lights, halos, double vision, difficulty focusing), gait wobbliness, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. These features strongly suggest elevated intracranial pressure without an identifiable mass lesion. IIH commonly occurs in overweight women of reproductive age, and symptoms typically include morning headaches, visual disturbances due to papilledema, and possible sixth nerve palsy causing double vision. The constellation of symptoms and presence of visual disturbances indicates increased intracranial pressure affecting optic nerve function.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nIdiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), the primary goals are to reduce intracranial pressure to prevent vision loss and alleviate symptoms. Weight management is a crucial non-pharmacological intervention as obesity is a significant risk factor for IIH. Patients should be counseled on a gradual, sustained weight loss strategy with dietary modifications and regular physical activity. Pharmacologically, acetazolamide is the first-line treatment to decrease cerebrospinal fluid production and reduce intracranial pressure. In cases where acetazolamide is contraindicated or poorly tolerated, other options like topiramate may be considered. Regular ophthalmologic monitoring, including visual field testing and fundoscopy, is necessary to detect and manage any visual deficits early. If symptoms persist or worsen despite medical therapy, surgical options such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or ventriculoperitoneal shunting may be considered, but these are typically managed by specialists. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach involving patient education, weight management, and medical therapy is essential for optimal management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with initiating acetazolamide therapy at an appropriate dose to lower intracranial pressure, while monitoring for side effects such as electrolyte disturbances. The patient should be advised on gradual weight loss through dietary counseling and increased physical activity, aiming for sustained weight reduction, which can significantly improve symptoms. Regular follow-up with ophthalmology is necessary to assess visual function and detect early signs of optic nerve compromise. Symptomatic treatment for headaches, such as over-the-counter analgesics, can be used as needed. If there is no improvement or if the patient\u2019s vision deteriorates despite medical management, referral to a neurologist or neurosurgeon for consideration of surgical interventions may be necessary."
