    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the presentation with headache, visual disturbances, and recent falls suggest intracranial mass effect. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe\u2014symptoms like increased intracranial pressure signs (head heaviness, vomiting, potential visual impairment), recent falls indicate neurological impairment. - Urgency level: Urgent\u2014requires immediate neuroimaging and rapid assessment to prevent deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Brain tumor progression, hydrocephalus, other intracranial masses.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Emergency neuroimaging (MRI preferred; CT if MRI unavailable) to confirm presence and extent of mass or increased intracranial pressure. - Supporting evidence: Imaging is critical for diagnosis, surgical planning, and management. - Patient-specific considerations: Young adult; may benefit from rapid intervention. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in imaging; monitor for signs of herniation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If intracranial pressure is elevated or patient shows signs of deterioration: - Primary medication choice: Dexamethasone 4-10 mg IV initially, then dose taper as needed. - Rationale for selection: Steroid reduces cerebral edema associated with tumors. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptomatic relief within 24-48 hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood sugar, infection risk, gastric irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Mannitol (if severe edema), hypertonic saline.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Urgent neurosurgical consultation for potential resection, biopsy, or drainage. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of urgency, procedure risks, symptom monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, head elevation, avoiding activities increasing intracranial pressure. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management; counseling to address emotional distress.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Neurosurgical consultation within 24-48 hours, then outpatient follow-up post-intervention. - Monitoring parameters: Neurological status (GCS, pupil size, motor/sensory function), symptom progression. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening headache, new neurological deficits, vomiting, altered mental status\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical improvement, reduction in headache severity, stabilization of neurological signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, straightforward; emphasize urgency and importance of rapid evaluation. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the need for urgent diagnostics and possible interventions. - Adherence strategies: Engage patient in shared decision-making, explain treatment benefits and risks. - Family involvement: Involve family members or support persons to aid understanding and compliance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent neurosurgery and neuro-oncology team within 24 hours. - Other healthcare team members: Radiology for imaging, nursing for monitoring, possibly neurology consult. - Community resources: Patient support groups for brain tumor patients, mental health counseling. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for emergent imaging, surgical care, and ongoing therapies.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of intracranial mass lesion or increased intracranial pressure syndrome potentially due to embryonal tumor of the brain, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent diagnostic imaging, medical management with corticosteroids, timely surgical consultation, and supportive care. Immediate actions include arranging emergent MRI or CT imaging to confirm diagnosis and assess severity, followed by prompt neurosurgical evaluation for potential resection or biopsy. Pharmacologically, initiating dexamethasone to reduce cerebral edema is appropriate, with careful monitoring of glucose levels and signs of infection. Supportive measures include head elevation, sedation if necessary, and close neurological monitoring. Clear communication emphasizing the urgency of the situation is essential to facilitate cooperation, alongside involving family members for additional support. Long-term management involves coordinated oncology care, possible adjunct therapies, and psychosocial support. Follow-up should be scheduled within 24-48 hours post-initial intervention, with ongoing assessment of neurological status and symptom control. This integrated plan aims to stabilize the patient, confirm diagnosis, and facilitate definitive treatment, minimizing risks of deterioration and improving prognosis.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent neuroimaging, consult neurosurgery, and administer dexamethasone. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic work-up, perform surgical intervention if indicated, and initiate appropriate oncological therapies. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for tumor response, manage complications, and provide supportive and rehabilitative care. - Patient handout summary: Explain the need for quick diagnostic testing, potential surgical treatment, medication use, symptom monitoring, and importance of follow-up.",
