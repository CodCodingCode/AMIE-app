    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of genital herpes, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based antiviral therapy with patient-centered education and lifestyle modifications. Initiating valacyclovir 1 gram orally twice daily for 7-10 days is the first-line pharmacologic intervention, as it effectively reduces lesion duration and viral shedding. Emphasize gentle vulvar hygiene, avoid irritants, and educate the patient about transmission, symptom management, and safe sex practices. Schedule follow-up in 1-2 weeks to monitor healing, adherence, and side effects. Counsel the patient about recognizing worsening symptoms, and consider referrals to specialists if lesions recur or complicate. Provide educational resources and support, ensuring clear communication tailored to her storytelling style to promote understanding and compliance. The plan aims to promote rapid symptom resolution, reduce transmission risk, and support emotional well-being with careful follow-up and education.",
