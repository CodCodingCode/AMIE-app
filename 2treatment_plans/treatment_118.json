    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high based on imaging and init\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ossifying fibroma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes definitive surgical excision to remove the lesion, careful preoperative planning with appropriate imaging, and postoperative follow-up to monitor for recurrence. Initial management focuses on surgical removal and wound care, with long-term follow-up scheduled to detect any signs of recurrence early. Patient education will emphasize understanding the lesion, the surgical process, and the importance of follow-up, considering the patient's stoic minimizing tendencies. This approach aims to achieve complete lesion removal, restore function and aesthetics, minimize complications, and ensure sustainable long-term management. Implementation includes immediate surgical planning, counseling, and follow-up, with coordination of care among specialists and support resources to optimize outcomes.",
