    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on ocular symptoms following activity and systemic signs suggestive of hepatobiliary involvement in the context of calcific pancreatitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate ocular surface irritation; systemic signs (jaundice, dark urine) suggest underlying hepatobiliary pathology needing evaluation. - Urgency level: Urgent; ocular symptoms require prompt assessment to exclude progression, and systemic signs necessitate timely investigation. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Conjunctivitis etiology (viral, bacterial, allergic), trauma to eye, other hepatobiliary ocular syndromes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: For conjunctivitis or superficial ocular irritation, supportive care is standard; systemic hepatobiliary disease management depends on further workup. - Supporting evidence: Supportive eye care (artificial tears, hygiene) effectively relieves mild conjunctivitis; addressing hepatobiliary pathology involves targeted diagnostics and potential interventions. - Patient-specific considerations: History of systemic disease (calcific pancreatitis), recent activity (soccer), possible jaundice, minimizing ocular irritation, comprehensive systemic assessment. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid topical corticosteroids unless ophthalmologic consultation confirms necessity; caution with systemic medications pending further evaluation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tear solutions for ocular surface comfort; if redness/inflammation persist, consider ophthalmology referral for topical anti-inflammatory agents under supervision. - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive, supportive, minimal side effects; systemic treatment depends on hepatobiliary workup. - Expected timeline for improvement: Mild conjunctivitis symptoms often improve within 3-7 days with supportive care. - Key side effects to monitor: None with artificial tears; systemic medications if initiated later. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antibiotics if bacterial conjunctivitis suspected or confirmed.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Advise frequent eye hygiene, avoiding irritants, and limiting eye rubbing. - Patient education priorities: Importance of eye protection, recognizing worsening symptoms, and systemic symptom monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity that may exacerbate systemic symptoms; maintain hydration. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage adequate sleep, stress reduction, and adherence to follow-up recommendations.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours for ocular symptoms; systemic signs to be evaluated within a week. - Monitoring parameters: Ocular redness, discomfort, tearing; systemic signs like jaundice, urine color, stool changes. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening vision, severe pain, increasing jaundice, systemic deterioration\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or progression, lab results for hepatobiliary function.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language emphasizing the importance of systemic evaluation and symptom monitoring. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that ocular symptoms are manageable and systemic issues are being investigated. - Adherence strategies: Encourage written follow-up plans, provide educational materials, and stress importance of appointment attendance. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family for support and observation, especially regarding systemic symptoms.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmologist for ocular examination if symptoms persist or worsen; hepatology or gastroenterology for systemic hepatobiliary assessment. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for ongoing management. - Community resources: Educational materials on jaundice and systemic liver disease. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure referrals and diagnostics are appropriately authorized; discuss any cost concerns with patient.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctivitis or superficial ocular surface irritation with underlying systemic hepatobiliary involvement suspected, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive ophthalmic care with urgent systemic evaluation. The immediate focus is to alleviate ocular discomfort with artificial tears, maintain ocular hygiene, and educate the patient on warning signs. Concurrently, prompt assessment of systemic symptoms like jaundice and dark urine is essential, including laboratory tests and hepatobiliary imaging as indicated. The plan involves close follow-up within 48-72 hours to monitor ocular progression and systemic consultation with gastroenterology or hepatology for definitive diagnosis and management of calcific pancreatitis and associated liver pathology. Emphasis on patient education, avoidance of eye irritants, and timely specialist referrals will optimize outcomes. This integrated approach aims to resolve ocular symptoms, identify and treat underlying systemic disease, and prevent complications.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Perform a basic eye examination; prescribe artificial tears; instruct patient on eye hygiene and symptom reporting. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reassess ocular symptoms; conduct systemic workup including liver function tests; arrange ophthalmology and hepatology consultations. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Manage and monitor hepatobiliary disease; control systemic and ocular conditions; prevent recurrences. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of eye care, symptom vigilance, follow-up schedule, and systemic health assessment.",
