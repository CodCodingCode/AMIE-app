    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation aligns closely with criteria for ASD, including challenges with social communication (e.g., avoiding eye contact, limited speech development, difficulty with social interactions), behavioral patterns such as repetitive movements (hand-flapping), and a strong preference for routines and predictability. Sensory sensitivities to noise and lights, behavioral distress when routines are disrupted, and difficulty with transitions are characteristic of ASD. The child's age at first speech, along with concerns about regression or loss of skills, supports a developmental disorder with early onset. No evidence suggests other neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions that better explain this specific constellation of symptoms.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the primary goal is to support the child's developmental and behavioral needs through appropriate interventions that can be initiated in a primary care or psychiatric setting. Non-pharmacological strategies such as behavioral interventions and parent training are foundational, focusing on enhancing social communication, reducing challenging behaviors, and promoting skill development. Early behavioral therapies, including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), are considered first-line interventions, and guiding parents on structured routines, visual supports, and consistent responses can be beneficial. Additionally, addressing sensory sensitivities through environmental modifications and providing psychoeducation to caregivers help foster a supportive environment. Pharmacological treatment should be considered only if specific symptoms such as severe irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, or anxiety significantly impair functioning, in which case medications like risperidone or aripiprazole for irritability, and SSRIs for anxiety, could be appropriate under specialist supervision. Overall, this plan emphasizes a combination of behavioral and environmental strategies, with medication used judiciously when indicated for comorbid symptoms.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive behavioral intervention plan emphasizing structured routines, visual supports, and social skills training, ideally coordinated with a developmental specialist or behavioral therapist. Provide caregiver education on ASD, including strategies to support communication and manage behavioral challenges. Consider referring to early intervention services in the community for intensive behavioral therapy such as ABA. For management of severe irritability, aggression, or hyperactivity, discuss with a psychiatrist about the potential use of medication such as low-dose risperidone or aripiprazole, with close monitoring for side effects. Address sensory sensitivities by advising modifications to the child's environment to minimize noise and light sensitivities. Throughout, monitor development regularly, and involve multidisciplinary teams as appropriate to support the child's overall progress."
