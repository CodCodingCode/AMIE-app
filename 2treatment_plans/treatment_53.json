    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ruptured descending aortic dissection, I recommend an immediate, multidisciplinary approach centered on emergency surgical repair or endovascular intervention combined with aggressive blood pressure management. Initial stabilization includes IV beta-blockers such as Esmolol to reduce shear stress, alongside continuous monitoring of vital signs and neurological status. This approach aims to prevent further rupture or catastrophic bleeding, stabilize hemodynamics, and prepare the patient for definitive surgical treatment. Long-term management will involve strict blood pressure control, lifestyle modifications, and close follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery. Communication with the patient should be clear and reassuring, involving family support due to the patient's communication style. Coordination with surgical teams, critical care, and support services is essential to optimize outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Notify surgical team, initiate IV beta-blocker infusion, establish IV access, and begin continuous monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair, stabilize post-op, and control blood pressure.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve optimal blood pressure management, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up imaging.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency, need for surgery, importance of blood pressure control, and lifestyle adjustments to prevent future events.",
