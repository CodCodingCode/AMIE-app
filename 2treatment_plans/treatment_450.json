    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on clinical presentation align\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the right thumb base and wrist, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs for pain relief, using thumb and wrist splints for joint stabilization, and advising activity modifications to reduce stress on affected joints. Proper patient education will emphasize joint protection, symptom monitoring, and adherence to therapy. Follow-up should occur within 2-4 weeks to assess response, with ongoing evaluation of pain, function, and medication tolerability. This approach aims to alleviate symptoms, improve hand function, and prevent progression while minimizing adverse effects and promoting long-term joint health.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe a short course of NSAIDs after evaluating contraindications; provide splints and instructions on their use; educate the patient on activity modifications.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain reduction, improve grip and wrist function, reinforce use of splint and activity adjustments.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain joint function, prevent functional decline, and consider referral for therapy if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication use, splint application, activity modifications, and when to seek further care.",
