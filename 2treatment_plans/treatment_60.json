    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bilateral genital vascular malformation in this patient with ovotesticular disorder of sex development, I recommend a comprehensive, multidisciplinary management plan that prioritizes detailed imaging assessments (e.g., MRI or Doppler ultrasound) to delineate vascular involvement and guide intervention. Initial treatment should focus on symptom control through protective measures and supportive care, with plans for vascular sclerotherapy or minimally invasive surgical procedures if indicated to curb bleeding and reduce tissue abnormality. Supportive pharmacologic therapy may include analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents as needed, with vigilant monitoring for adverse effects. Patient education emphasizes recognizing signs of worsening bleeding or infection and avoiding trauma. Follow-up involves frequent reassessment initially (weekly) to evaluate bleeding control and tissue status, with adjustments based on response. Coordination with vascular and urologic specialists is essential for definitive management, and involvement of nursing staff for patient support and education will optimize outcomes. This approach aims to reduce bleeding, prevent complications, and improve tissue stability, all tailored to the patient\u2019s complex underlying condition.",
