    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Tetralogy of Fallot\nJustification: The presentation of a baby with cyanosis (bluish lips, face, possibly extremities), ongoing feeding difficulties with choking and coughing, episodes of rapid and noisy breathing, irritability, and fatigue during feeds are characteristic signs of a cyanotic congenital heart defect. The history of multiple hospitalizations for these symptoms further supports a significant structural cardiac abnormality. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease presenting in infancy, typically with those specific signs and symptoms. The episodes of cyanosis that may improve with certain positions or happen during exertion and feeds are consistent with \"tet spells,\" which are transient episodes of hypoxia. The associated findings of difficulty feeding, irritability, and possibly failure to thrive align with delayed or compromised cardiac output from right-to-left shunting due to pulmonary outflow obstruction caused by STVF.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nTetralogy of Fallot\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a cyanotic congenital heart defect that requires definitive surgical correction. However, prior to surgery, it is essential to stabilize the patient and prevent hypoxic episodes, especially during tet spells. Non-pharmacological measures such as calming the child, encouraging knee-chest positioning (if possible in infants) to increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce right-to-left shunting, and providing oxygen therapy can be helpful in managing acute episodes. Pharmacologically, administering vasoconstrictors like morphine can reduce the frequency and severity of tet spells by decreasing right-to-left shunt. In some cases, it may also be appropriate to use propranolol to manage hypercyanotic spells. Since definitive correction will require surgical intervention, the primary care or psychiatric provider should coordinate urgent cardiology consultation, initiate these stabilization measures, and prepare the family and patient for eventual surgical repair.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating stabilization measures including oxygen therapy and positioning the infant in a calm environment, preferably in a knee-chest position if feasible, to temporarily reduce cyanosis. Administer morphine carefully to alleviate acute tet spells and prevent hypoxic episodes. The patient should be promptly referred to pediatric cardiology for comprehensive assessment and definitive surgical repair of Tetralogy of Fallot. While awaiting surgery, closely monitor for signs of hypoxia, failure to thrive, or cardiac decompensation. Education of the caregivers on recognizing tet spells and management strategies is essential. In the interim, ensure supportive care, monitor weight gain, and consider supplemental oxygen if episodes worsen."
