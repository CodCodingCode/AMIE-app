    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypertensive cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating guideline-directed medical therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics, along with strict blood pressure and fluid management. Emphasis is placed on lifestyle modifications such as salt restriction, weight control, and smoking cessation. Regular follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor clinical response, renal function, and electrolyte levels, with ongoing adjustments every 4-6 weeks until stabilization. Education should be tailored to the patient's storytelling style, emphasizing clear communication of medication importance, symptom recognition, and the need for adherence. Coordination with cardiology and nephrology specialists is advised for comprehensive management. The goal is symptom relief, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life, while minimizing risks associated with medications and disease progression.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Review and adjust current medications, order baseline labs (renal function, electrolytes), and educate the patient on symptom monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve blood pressure control, reduce edema, and improve activity tolerance.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize heart function, prevent hospitalizations, and optimize quality of life.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points on medication adherence, dietary restrictions, recognizing warning signs, and scheduled follow-up visits.",
