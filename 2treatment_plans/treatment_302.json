    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to acute promyelocytic leukemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate correction of coagulopathy with targeted leukemia therapy. Key interventions include urgent transfusions of platelets and fresh frozen plasma to manage active bleeding, coupled with prompt initiation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy to address the underlying pathology. Supportive care measures such as strict bleeding precautions, careful monitoring of labs, and vital signs are essential. The initial management aims to stabilize bleeding and coagulation parameters within 24-48 hours, while definitive leukemia treatment proceeds. Follow-up care involves frequent laboratory assessments, vigilant monitoring for signs of hemorrhagic or differentiation syndrome, and coordinated care with hematology specialists. Patient education will focus on recognizing bleeding warning signs, understanding treatment importance, and adhering to safety precautions. This comprehensive approach aims to improve survival, reverse coagulopathy rapidly, and control disease progression, minimizing risks associated with profound bleeding and systemic instability.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate blood product transfusions, start ATRA therapy, and confirm diagnosis with hematology consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stabilization of bleeding, normalization of coagulation labs, and start induction chemotherapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission, monitor for differentiation syndrome, and manage leukemia with ongoing therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the importance of transfusions, early leukemia treatment, bleeding precautions, and prompt reporting of new symptoms.",
