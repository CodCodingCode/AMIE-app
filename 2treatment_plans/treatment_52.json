    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cyanotic congenital heart disease (e.g., univentricular heart), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate stabilization with long-term surgical planning. Initial management includes supplemental oxygen therapy, monitoring oxygen saturation closely, and maintaining ductus arteriosus patency with prostaglandin E1 infusion if indicated. The priority is timely surgical evaluation for potential palliation procedures such as staged univentricular repair. Caregivers should be educated on recognizing cyanosis, signs of deterioration, and emergency measures. Close outpatient follow-up is essential within 48-72 hours, with ongoing assessment of symptoms, growth, and response to interventions. Coordination with pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery teams is vital to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to stabilize the patient, prevent hypoxic episodes, and facilitate definitive surgical correction, while emphasizing caregiver involvement and education to support adherence and early intervention for emerging issues.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate supplemental oxygen, start prostaglandin E1 infusion if duct-dependent, confirm oxygen saturation, and alert surgical team.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Surveil for episodes, optimize nutrition, and prepare for definitive surgical intervention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgical repair, improve oxygenation, and support healthy growth and development.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize cyanosis, seek urgent care if symptoms worsen, importance of medication adherence, and upcoming surgical plans.",
