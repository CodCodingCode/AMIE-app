    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute sialadenitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines antibiotic therapy, supportive measures, and patient education tailored to her clinical presentation and anxiety levels. Immediate management includes initiating empiric antibiotics such as dicloxacillin, along with warm compresses, hydration, and gland massage. The plan emphasizes close follow-up within 48-72 hours to monitor response and adjust treatment if necessary. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, recognition of warning signs, and anxiety reassurance. Long-term management involves addressing underlying contributing factors and ensuring timely assessment if symptoms persist or worsen. The goal is to resolve the infection promptly, prevent complications, and support her overall well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start antibiotics, instruct on supportive care, provide detailed verbal and written instructions, schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom improvement, completion of antibiotics, patient reassurance.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevention of recurrence, management of underlying concerns, and ongoing wellness support.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, signs of complication, hydration importance, and when to seek urgent care.",
