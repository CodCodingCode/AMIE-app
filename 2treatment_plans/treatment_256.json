    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of intra-abdominal malignancy (most likely colorectal or ovarian cancer), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes obtaining a definitive tissue diagnosis through biopsy, followed by staging with imaging studies, tumor marker assessment, and multidisciplinary evaluation. Initial management focuses on confirming the diagnosis and staging to guide tailored treatment, which may include surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and possibly radiation therapy depending on tumor type and extent. Supportive care emphasizes nutritional support, symptom management, and psychological counseling to address systemic effects and improve quality of life. Close follow-up will involve regular assessments of symptoms, tumor markers, and imaging, with prompt attention to any signs of complications or disease progression. Clear patient education regarding diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis will be provided, with involvement of family members when appropriate, to foster adherence and emotional support. This integrated approach aims to optimize oncologic outcomes, enhance patient well-being, and facilitate coordinated multidisciplinary care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent diagnostic procedures including biopsy, order baseline labs, and initiate discussion with oncology and surgical teams.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, complete staging, develop individualized treatment plan, and begin supportive care.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Initiate definitive therapy, monitor response, adjust treatment as needed, and provide ongoing supportive services.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the importance of diagnosis, outline planned investigations and treatment options, emphasize adherence and follow-up, and provide contact info for questions.",
