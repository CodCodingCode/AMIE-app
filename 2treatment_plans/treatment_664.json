    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; amelanotic melanoma is a serious diagnosis confirmed by clinical suspicion and dermoscopic evaluation. - Severity classification: Severe, given the potential for invasive melanoma, which can metastasize if not promptly treated. - Urgency level: Immediate; requires urgent dermatologic assessment and likely biopsy for definitive diagnosis and management. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Ensure no significant changes suggestive of progression, ulceration, or bleeding.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Urgent excisional biopsy with clear margins. - Supporting evidence: Standard of care for suspected melanoma is complete excision for definitive diagnosis and staging. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient\u2019s age, lesion location, and potential cosmetic concerns; ensure complete removal without delay. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid partial excisions or biopsy techniques that could compromise surgical margins; do not delay definitive management.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not applicable; surgical excision is the main intervention. - Rationale for selection: Complete surgical removal provides histopathologic diagnosis and local control. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pathology results typically in 3-7 days; surgical healing within 2-4 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Infection, wound healing complications; instruct patient on wound care. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Not relevant initially; treatment is surgical.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Patient education on skin self-examination and sun protection strategies. - Patient education priorities: Risks of melanoma, importance of follow-up, recognizing suspicious lesions. - Lifestyle modifications: Consistent use of broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing, avoiding tanning beds. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage routine skin checks and prompt reporting of new or changing lesions.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks post-surgery for wound healing; schedule oncology consult if margins are positive. - Monitoring parameters: Wound status, signs of infection, any new or changing skin lesions. - Red flag symptoms: New lesions, rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, lymphadenopathy. - Treatment response assessment: Wound healing, patient understanding of skin surveillance.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language, addressing the patient\u2019s tendency for tangential storytelling by staying focused and asking open-ended questions. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the urgency of diagnosis, explain surgical procedure and importance of treatment. - Adherence strategies: Provide written materials and visual aids; encourage questions and shared decision-making. - Family involvement: Ask if her support system can assist in skin monitoring and attending follow-ups.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent dermatology or surgical oncology consultation for biopsy and management. - Other healthcare team members: Possibly wound care nurse, primary care provider for ongoing surveillance. - Community resources: Patient education materials from skin cancer foundations, support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for biopsy and possible surgical excision; discuss procedures' costs upfront.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical removal with patient-centered education and close follow-up. The key intervention is an urgent excisional biopsy with clear margins to establish definitive diagnosis and staging. Postoperative wound care, patient education on skin surveillance, and sun protection are essential. Immediate follow-up within 1-2 weeks to evaluate wound healing is necessary, with ongoing monitoring for any new skin changes or symptoms. Coordination with dermatology and possibly oncology specialists is critical for comprehensive management. This plan aims to achieve early diagnosis, optimal treatment, and long-term skin health, minimizing risks of progression or metastasis while ensuring the patient understands and adheres to surveillance strategies.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule urgent dermatology consultation for biopsy; instruct the patient on wound care and sun protection. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision, review pathology results, and develop further management based on staging. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ongoing skin surveillance, possible additional treatment if invasive melanoma is confirmed, and patient education reinforcement. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of prompt removal, regular skin checks, sun safety practices, and follow-up appointments.",
