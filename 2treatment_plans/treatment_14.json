    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach: \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. \n- Primar\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy with prednisone (1 mg/kg/day up to 60 mg daily), sodium restriction, and close monitoring of proteinuria, renal function, and electrolytes. Immediate management focuses on establishing diagnostic confirmation, controlling edema, and preventing complications. Long-term management involves regular follow-up assessments, ongoing patient education, and coordination with nephrology specialists. Follow-up care will include labs in 2-4 weeks to assess treatment response, with instructions for her to seek urgent care if she develops worsening symptoms or other red flags. This approach aims to reduce proteinuria, preserve renal function, and improve quality of life while minimizing side effects and supporting adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange laboratory tests (urinalysis, serum albumin, renal function, electrolytes), initiate dietary counseling.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess initial response to steroids, monitor for side effects, maintain dietary adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission of proteinuria, stabilize renal function, and transition to maintenance therapy as appropriate.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the condition, treatment plan, importance of medication adherence, dietary restrictions, and follow-up schedule.",
