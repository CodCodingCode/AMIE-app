    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical intervention with supportive medical management. The initial priority is urgent appendectomy performed promptly in an operative setting, supplemented by intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam to control infection. Supportive measures include IV fluid resuscitation, pain management, and withholding oral intake until surgery.\nPostoperative monitoring should focus on vital signs, signs of ongoing infection, and wound healing, with close follow-up within 24-48 hours post-surgery and outpatient review scheduled in one week. Patient education should emphasize the urgency of surgery, signs of complications, and adherence to postoperative care instructions. Clear communication tailored to the patient's baseline, including reassurance and detailed explanations, will support compliance. Coordination with surgical services and nursing staff is essential to ensure comprehensive perioperative care. The goal is to resolve infection, prevent complications, and facilitate recovery with minimized risks.",
