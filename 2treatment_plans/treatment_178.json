    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary di\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of migraine with aura, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes the use of acute abortive medications, such as sumatriptan and NSAIDs, tailored to attack onset, along with lifestyle modifications emphasizing trigger avoidance, stress management, and sleep hygiene. For patients experiencing frequent or disabling attacks, preventive therapy with medications like propranolol or topiramate should be considered after initial assessment.\nInitial management focuses on prompt relief during attacks and education about symptom recognition and medication use. Long-term strategies involve regular follow-up in 4-6 weeks to evaluate effectiveness, adjust treatment, and monitor for side effects. Patient education will include recognizing warning signs requiring urgent care, importance of adherence, and lifestyle adaptations to reduce attack frequency.\nThis integrated plan aims to reduce attack severity and frequency, improve quality of life, and prevent medication overuse or side effects, while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on patient response.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Provide the patient with written action plans, prescribe initial abortive medications (sumatriptan and NSAID), and educate on trigger avoidance.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess response to initial therapy, ensure understanding of medication use, and implement lifestyle changes.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduction in attack frequency and severity, optimize preventive therapy, and reinforce lifestyle modifications.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, trigger identification, lifestyle tips, and when to seek urgent care.",
