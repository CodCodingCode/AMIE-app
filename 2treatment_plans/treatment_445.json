    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Olfactory Reference Syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention techniques, with an emphasis on psychoeducation and behavioral modification. Pharmacotherapy with an SSRI such as sertraline may be considered if symptoms do not improve within 6-8 weeks or if significant emotional distress arises. The initial focus will be on education, stress reduction, and behavioral interventions to reduce checking behaviors and preoccupations. Follow-up will be scheduled in 4-6 weeks to monitor progress, side effects, and adherence, with adjustments as needed. Clear communication tailored to the patient's stoic and minimizer tendencies will be employed to foster engagement and compliance. Coordination with mental health specialists and providing supportive resources will ensure a multidisciplinary approach aimed at sustained symptom management with minimized side effects.",
