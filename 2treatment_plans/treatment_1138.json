    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes several core features characteristic of ASD: delays in language development, limited speech, difficulty understanding and expressing himself, social communication challenges such as avoiding eye contact and seeming quiet or confused in new environments, repetitive behaviors like lining up toys and watching the same videos, and intense reactions to changes in routines and sensory stimuli (loud noises, bright lights). His tendency to become upset or frustrated easily, sensitivity to sensory input, preference for routines, and difficulty with transitions are also typical of ASD. These symptoms have persisted over time and are impacting his daily functioning at school and home. The combination of communication difficulties, sensory sensitivities, repetitive behaviors, and social challenges strongly supports an ASD diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Treatment for children with ASD primarily involves a combination of behavioral interventions and supportive therapies to enhance communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Early intervention with applied behavior analysis (ABA) or similar therapies can significantly improve outcomes, especially when initiated promptly. Non-pharmacological strategies should focus on sensory integration, structured routines, social skills development, and fostering communication. Given the child's evident language delays, speech therapy is essential. For managing irritability, hyperactivity, or severe behavioral issues that interfere with therapy or daily functioning, pharmacological options such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) or atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone) may be considered, but only after behavioral interventions have been attempted or if symptoms are severe. The primary care physician or psychiatrist should coordinate multidisciplinary care, including speech therapy, occupational therapy for sensory issues, and behavioral therapy, while monitoring for any medication side effects if pharmacotherapy is initiated.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should commence with early initiation of behavioral and developmental interventions, including referral to specialized speech therapy to improve language skills and occupational therapy to address sensory processing and daily living skills. Establishing consistent routines and utilizing visual supports can help the child manage anxiety related to transitions and changes. Consider enrolling the child in evidence-based ASD early intervention programs, ideally involving a multidisciplinary team. Pharmacological intervention can be considered if symptoms such as severe agitation, aggression, or hyperactivity significantly impede participation in therapies or impact safety; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine may be used for irritability, while risperidone or aripiprazole may be reserved for persistent behavioral challenges, with careful monitoring for side effects. Regular follow-up should be arranged to assess progress, adapt therapies as needed, and support the child's developmental trajectory."
