    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of eye redness, swelling, tearing after trauma (soccer), and the differential diagnosis including traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, the likelihood of trauma-related injury is high. Herpes simplex meningitis is noted as the gold standard diagnosis but not directly related to the current eye presentation. The clinical suspicion leans towards traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage as the cause. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms involve redness, tearing, swelling without signs of globe rupture or vision loss. No evidence of penetrating injury or corneal involvement suggests non-severe injury. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but should be evaluated promptly to rule out more serious injury. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible other ocular injuries such as corneal abrasion, angle-involved trauma, or infectious conjunctivitis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation and symptomatic relief for traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage. Usually, these are benign with conservative management. - Supporting evidence: Conservative approach with cold compresses and artificial tears is standard, and subconjunctival hemorrhage often resolves spontaneously. - Patient-specific considerations: As the patient is athletic, avoidance of activities that could worsen injury or delay healing is important. No contraindications to conservative measures. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid rubbings or strenuous activities that might exacerbate injury.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears to soothe the eye; topical antihistamines if allergic component suspected; topical antibiotics only if signs of infection. - Rationale for selection: Symptomatic relief, minimal side effects, safe in the emergency/sub-acute setting. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within a few days; subconjunctival hemorrhage may take 2-3 weeks to resolve fully. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions to eye drops, potential for worsening redness or signs of infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Antibiotic eye drops (e.g., erythromycin ointment) if secondary infection suspected.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, cold compresses applied to the affected eye initially, then warm compresses if needed after 24 hours. - Patient education priorities: Explanation that bruising/hemorrhage often resolve on their own, signs of worsening injury, importance of avoiding rubbing eyes or strenuous activity. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid contact sports or strenuous activity until cleared. - Behavioral interventions: No specific behavioral therapy needed; reassurance and education are key.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-7 days to evaluate healing, especially if symptoms worsen or fail to improve. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, vision changes, increasing redness, or signs of infection. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision loss, increasing swelling, signs of globe rupture or foreign body. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution, reduction in redness/swelling, stability of visual acuity.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation emphasizing that most injuries improve with simple measures and reassurance about prognosis. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify any worries about long-term damage or infection; discuss activity restrictions. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize importance of following activity restrictions, completing follow-up, and avoiding eye rubbing. - Family involvement: Encourage family awareness if patient is a minor or needs assistance with care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if there is any concern for globe injury, persistent symptoms, or suspicion of a more severe injury. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for follow-up if necessary. - Community resources: Provide informational materials on eye trauma care and signs of worsening. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure prescriptions and follow-up are accessible and covered, discuss medication costs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines conservative symptomatic management with patient education and careful monitoring. The key interventions include advising the use of artificial tears and cold compresses for symptom relief, restricting strenuous activity and contact sports until fully healed, and providing thorough education about signs of deterioration or more serious injury. Follow-up should be scheduled within a week to assess healing and to ensure no signs of complication. In cases where symptoms worsen or if there is concern for more severe injury, prompt ophthalmology referral is appropriate. This approach aims to promote natural healing, minimize complications, and reassure the patient through clear communication, ensuring safe recovery and return to activity. - Immediate actions (today): Advise on eye protection, symptom management, and activity restrictions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Resolution or significant improvement of redness, swelling, and discomfort. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete healing with no residual visual impairment or complications. - Patient handout summary: Explanation that most eye injuries after trauma are benign, symptoms can be managed at home now, but seek urgent care if vision changes, severe pain, or increased swelling occurs.",
