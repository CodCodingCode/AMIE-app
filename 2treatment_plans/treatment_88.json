    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given her presentation with severe right lowe\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of peritonitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate initiation of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, alongside supportive care measures like IV fluids and pain control. Prompt surgical consultation is essential to evaluate for potential operative intervention. She should be closely monitored with vital signs, laboratory markers, and clinical assessments, and reassessed frequently within the first 24-48 hours. Effective communication involves explaining her condition clearly, emphasizing the importance of treatment adherence, and keeping her informed about potential surgical or diagnostic procedures. Long-term management will focus on completing antibiotics, monitoring for complications, and scheduling follow-up evaluations. This approach aims to control the infection rapidly, prevent progression to septic shock or complications, and facilitate recovery through coordinated multidisciplinary care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics, provide IV fluids, arrange urgent surgical consultation, confirm diagnosis with blood cultures and imaging.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve infection control, recover bowel function, confirm source resolution, and plan for outpatient follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery, prevent recurrence, and evaluate for any complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain her diagnosis, the importance of antibiotics and possible surgery, signs of worsening condition, and the need for follow-up care.",
