    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on clinical presentation of eye redness, swelling, tearing, brief duration, and recent activity. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; no mention of pain, light sensitivity, or visual disturbance suggests it's not severe. - Urgency level: Routine care needed but should be promptly evaluated to confirm diagnosis and rule out more serious ocular conditions. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Scleritis (more painful, deeper inflammation), conjunctivitis, uveitis, or systemic inflammatory diseases.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Artificial tears and corticosteroid eye drops if inflammation persists or increases. - Supporting evidence: Topical corticosteroids are effective in reducing episcleral inflammation; artificial tears help diminish irritation. - Patient-specific considerations: The guard communication style suggests ensuring clear explanations, and recent activity may suggest a transient trigger. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor for corticosteroid side effects such as increased intraocular pressure; ensure no contraindications like steroid responsiveness or glaucoma.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical prednisolone acetate 1%, one drop four times daily for 5-7 days. - Rationale for selection: Potent anti-inflammatory action suitable for episcleritis, with rapid onset of symptom relief. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 2-3 days; continue for 5-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Increased intraocular pressure, ocular infection signs. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: NSAID eye drops (e.g., bromfenac), oral NSAIDs if inflammation persists or recurs.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest from strenuous activity, avoid eye rubbing, and reduce activities that provoke symptoms. - Patient education priorities: Clarify that episcleritis is usually self-limited, but follow-up is necessary to ensure resolution. - Lifestyle modifications: Use cold compresses if swelling or discomfort; maintain good eyelid hygiene. - Behavioral interventions: Stress the importance of reporting any worsening symptoms promptly.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, signs of increased intraocular pressure, new ocular or systemic symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision changes, progressive redness, nausea/vomiting, or signs of systemic illness\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom reduction (redness, swelling), patient feedback, absence of adverse effects.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; reassure that symptoms are common and manageable; invite questions to ensure understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize that follow-up is critical and that medication side effects are monitored. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions and schedule follow-up appointments proactively. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family members to support adherence and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmologist consultation if symptoms do not improve in a few days or if symptoms worsen. - Other healthcare team members: Optometrist for ongoing eye health monitoring if required. - Community resources: Educational materials about eye health, local support groups if systemic disease is suspected later. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medications are accessible and discuss cost-effective options if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of episcleritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1% four times daily for 5-7 days) to reduce inflammation, along with supportive measures such as artificial tears and cold compresses. Careful monitoring for intraocular pressure and symptom resolution is essential. Patient education will focus on recognizing worsening symptoms and the importance of follow-up. The patient should be re-evaluated within 3-5 days to assess response, and an ophthalmology referral should be made if improvement is not observed or if new symptoms arise. This approach aims for rapid symptom relief, minimizes risks of corticosteroid use, and ensures long-term eye health, especially given the potential systemic associations with underlying spondyloarthritis. Immediate actions involve starting topical therapy today, providing clear instructions, and arranging follow-up. Short-term goals include symptom improvement within a few days and confirming no adverse reactions. Long-term management involves monitoring for recurrence and coordinating with specialists for systemic disease control.",
