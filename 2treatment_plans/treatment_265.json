    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan: \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical presentation aligns strongly w\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute bowel obstruction due to duodenal obstruction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent hospital admission with bowel decompression via nasogastric tube, IV fluids to correct dehydration and electrolytes, and antiemetics such as ondansetron for symptom control. Initial management focuses on stabilization, thorough diagnostic evaluation with imaging (preferably abdominal CT scan), and surgical consultation. The long-term management aims to identify and address the underlying cause, potentially requiring surgical intervention. Follow-up will include close monitoring of symptoms, electrolytes, and vital signs, with clear instructions for signs of deterioration. Education will focus on understanding the severity of the condition, need for urgent care, and adherence to treatment and follow-up plans. This approach is designed to prevent complications, facilitate resolution of the obstruction, and plan definitive therapy while minimizing risks associated with delayed or inappropriate management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospital admission, start IV fluids, place NG tube for decompression, administer antiemetics.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic imaging, surgical assessment, and intervention if indicated; monitor response to initial therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Address underlying pathology (such as tumors or strictures), plan elective interventions or surgeries, and ensure nutritional and functional recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: \"You have a bowel blockage that needs urgent treatment to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. You will receive fluids and medications, undergo diagnostic tests, and may need surgery. Close monitoring and follow-up are essential for your recovery.\"",
