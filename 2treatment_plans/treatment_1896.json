    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's presentation includes a combination of progressive gait disturbance, balance issues, muscle control problems, and episodes of visual disturbances that are transient, which are characteristic features of MS. The age of onset (12 years old) falls within the typical range for pediatric MS. The symptoms of feeling \"off,\" \"wobbly,\" and \"heavy legs\" suggest demyelination affecting motor pathways, while the sudden, episodic visual sensations are consistent with optic neuritis, a common initial presentation in MS. The mood and behavioral symptoms (irritability, worry, feeling down) may be related to the burden of chronic illness or comorbidities but further assessment is needed. Importantly, there are no reports of other neurological deficits such as numbness, weakness in other parts, or persistent vision loss, which supports a demyelinating process rather than other neurodegenerative or structural lesions.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the likely diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), early intervention is important to modify disease progression, manage symptoms, and support the patient's functional status. Although diagnosis should be confirmed via neuroimaging (MRI of the brain and spinal cord with contrast) and, if necessary, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, treatment can often be initiated based on clinical suspicion in conjunction with diagnostic workup. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the cornerstone of MS management, aiming to reduce relapses and delay progression. Symptomatic management for gait and balance issues, such as physical therapy, can improve mobility and quality of life. Addressing mood and behavioral concerns with psychosocial support or counseling may improve overall well-being. Non-pharmacological interventions like physical and occupational therapy are vital for functional support. Pharmacologically, initiating a first-line DMT approved for pediatric MS (such as interferon beta or glatiramer acetate) is appropriate, along with symptomatic treatments like muscle relaxants or anticonvulsants if spasticity or neuropathic pain occurs. It\u2019s also important to educate the patient and family about disease course, emphasize adherence to therapy, and arrange multidisciplinary follow-up with neurology, mental health, and rehabilitation specialists.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should involve confirming the diagnosis with MRI imaging of the brain and spinal cord, followed by initiation of a disease-modifying therapy such as interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, which are approved for pediatric MS and have well-established safety profiles. In addition, refer the patient to physical and occupational therapy to improve gait, balance, and muscle control. Consider early involvement of mental health services to support emotional well-being and address behavioral symptoms. Educate the patient and family about MS, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and regular follow-up. Symptomatic management, including physical therapy for mobility issues and pharmacologic agents for spasticity if necessary, can be added based on ongoing assessment. Regular monitoring for medication efficacy and side effects, along with routine MRI scans to evaluate disease activity, should be established as part of comprehensive care."
