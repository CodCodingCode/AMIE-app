    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the history and description, the diagnosis of capillary haemangioma with inflammatory or proliferative changes is quite certain, although confirmation via physical exam and possibly dermoscopy or imaging may be needed. - Severity classification: Moderately severe due to recent enlargement, erythema, swelling, tenderness, and bleeding, indicating active inflammation and possibly secondary infection. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed because of bleeding and potential infection risk. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Infection (cellulitis, ulceration), secondary trauma complications, or malignant transformation (rare).  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: In cases with acute inflammation and bleeding, topical or intralesional corticosteroids are standard; if secondary infection is suspected, antibiotics may be added. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids reduce proliferative and inflammatory activity. For bleeding and inflammation, topical corticosteroids are effective and minimally invasive. - Patient-specific considerations: Young female, lesion on face, recent trauma\u2014minimize invasive procedures, consider cosmetic impact. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid aggressive interventions that may cause scarring; monitor for steroid side effects especially in facial skin.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Topical high-potency corticosteroid (e.g., clobetasol propionate 0.05%) applied twice daily. - Rationale for selection: Effective anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative agent with localized action, minimizing systemic exposure. - Expected timeline for improvement: Signs of reduced inflammation and bleeding may be seen within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Skin thinning, hypopigmentation, local irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Intralesional corticosteroid injections, or if infection present, topical or oral antibiotics.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Gentle skin hygiene, avoiding trauma and scratching, protective measures. - Patient education priorities: Explain nature of port-wine stain and proliferative changes, importance of avoiding trauma, adherence to topical treatment. - Lifestyle modifications: Gentle skin care, sun protection. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction techniques if emotional distress affects adherence.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks to evaluate response; sooner if bleeding or signs of infection worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Degree of swelling, erythema, bleeding, signs of secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid expansion, increasing pain, signs of systemic infection, or ulceration\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in inflammation, bleeding, tenderness.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language, incorporate visual aids given her tangential storytelling style. - Addressing patient concerns: Validate her worries about lesion progression and bleeding; reassure about treatment plan. - Adherence strategies: Simplify treatment instructions, use visual reminder charts, schedule follow-up. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family for support and adherence reinforcement.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Dermatology consultation for potential biopsy or further management if no improvement. - Other healthcare team members: Possibly ENT or plastic surgery if cosmetic or functional concerns develop. - Community resources: Patient support groups, educational websites. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for topical treatments, specialist visits.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of port-wine stain complicated by inflammatory or proliferative change, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-potency topical corticosteroids (such as clobetasol propionate 0.05%) applied twice daily to reduce inflammation and bleeding, along with gentle skin hygiene and trauma avoidance. Pending improvement, reassessment is planned in 1-2 weeks to gauge response and consider escalation to intralesional corticosteroids if necessary. Concurrent patient education focuses on lesion care, avoiding trauma, and understanding potential course variations. Follow-up will involve close monitoring of lesion size, erythema, bleeding, and signs of infection, with urgent care if symptoms worsen. A dermatology referral is indicated if no significant improvement occurs or if lesion progression warrants further intervention. This approach aims to control inflammation, minimize complications, and support long-term management with an emphasis on cosmetic and functional outcomes.",
