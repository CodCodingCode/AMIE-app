    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Reflex epilepsies, particularly eating-related or \"situational\" epilepsy\nJustification: The patient's episodes are brief, involve loss of awareness with limb and facial jerking, and are specifically triggered during eating or swallowing. The sensation of tension or fluttering in her head prior to episodes, combined with post-episode feelings of shakiness, tiredness, and emotional distress, are consistent with focal seizures. Such episodes occurring reliably during a specific context (feeding) point toward a reflex epilepsy, particularly esophageal or eating-related seizures, which often involve temporal or peri-temporal cortical zones. Brain testing, such as EEG, may reveal epileptiform activity linked to this trigger. The absence of episodes at other times suggests a situational trigger, supporting this diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nReflex epilepsy, specifically eating or swallowing-related seizures END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of reflex epilepsy triggered by eating or swallowing, the primary goal is to control seizure activity while minimizing impact on the patient\u2019s quality of life. Non-pharmacological strategies can include educating the patient about trigger avoidance\u2014such as eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and possibly modifying eating habits to reduce rapid swallowing or stress during meals. Ensuring a calm eating environment may also help. Pharmacologically, anti-epileptic drugs effective for focal seizures, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or lamotrigine, could be initiated to reduce seizure frequency. The choice of medication should consider potential side effects, comorbidities, and patient preferences. As definitive diagnosis may involve EEG to confirm ictal activity and localize seizure focus, referral for outpatient EEG may be considered if not already performed. Overall, a combination of patient education, trigger management, and pharmacotherapy offers the most practical and effective approach for this purposively manageable form of reflex epilepsy.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves educating the patient about avoiding or modifying eating habits to reduce seizure triggers, such as eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and managing stress during meals. Initiate pharmacotherapy with a first-line focal epilepsy medication like lamotrigine or oxcarbazepine, titrated gradually to minimize side effects and assess efficacy. Arrange for outpatient EEG to confirm the diagnosis and guide future management. Follow-up should be scheduled to monitor treatment response, adherence, and any potential adverse effects, with adjustments made as needed."
