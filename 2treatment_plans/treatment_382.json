    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating IV benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam 2 mg every 2 hours as needed), providing supportive care with hydration and nutritional support, and closely monitoring vital signs and mental status for signs of progression or complications. The immediate focus is to stabilize her withdrawal symptoms safely and prevent progression to severe withdrawal. Once stabilized, long-term management will involve psychiatric or addiction specialist referrals, behavioral health support, and patient education on alcohol abstinence and relapse prevention. Clear communication tailored to her information-holding style will help foster understanding and adherence. Follow-up care will include frequent reassessment within 24-48 hours, monitoring for complications, and incorporating community resources to support sustained recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate benzodiazepine protocol, establish IV access, monitor vitals continuously, and assess hydration and electrolyte status.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution, prevent complications, initiate addiction treatment planning, and ensure safe discharge planning.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain abstinence, mitigate relapse risk, provide ongoing mental health and addiction support, and monitor for any sequelae.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding withdrawal symptoms, importance of medication adherence, signs of worsening, and available support resources.",
