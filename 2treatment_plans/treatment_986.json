    "output": "THINKING: The patient's final diagnosis is traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, but their context reveals a separate, more complex primary diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma. This suggests an underlying systemic condition that may influence management decisions. The ocular symptoms stem from trauma, which typically require conservative treatment, but the systemic diagnosis warrants careful consideration to avoid overlooking or complicating bleeding risks or immune vulnerabilities. The treatment plan must balance local eye care with awareness of systemic implications from lymphoma.  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high for traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, confirmed by recent trauma history and typical presentation. Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms are recent and localized without signs of significant globe rupture or visual impairment. Urgency level: Routine care, unless vision changes or worsening symptoms occur. Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible underlying bleeding diatheses related to systemic disease, or other orbital/ocular trauma complications.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation for subconjunctival hemorrhage, using artificial tears for comfort; avoid unnecessary medications. Supporting evidence: Most subconjunctival hemorrhages resolve spontaneously within 2 weeks; trauma management is conservative. Patient-specific considerations: Underlying lymphoma may affect bleeding or immune response; no anticoagulation unless indicated. Contraindications or cautions: Avoid NSAIDs if bleeding risk increased due to systemic condition; monitor for signs of increasing hemorrhage or eye discomfort.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary medication choice: Artificial tears or lubricating eye drops as needed for comfort, no systemic medications typically required. Rationale for selection: Provides symptomatic relief without bleeding risk. Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically resolve in 1-2 weeks. Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; ensure no signs of worsening hemorrhage or infection. Alternative medications if first-line fails: None generally needed; if irritation persists, consider preservative-free artificial tears.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid eye rubbing, strenuous activity, or trauma; use protective eyewear if needed. Patient education priorities: Inform patient about the benign nature of subconjunctival hemorrhage, expected healing time, and signs of complications. Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid activities that increase ocular or systemic bleeding risk. Behavioral interventions: Stress cautious eye handling and adherence to systemic treatment plans for lymphoma.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks or sooner if worsening symptoms develop. Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, appearance of eye, and systemic signs. Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increasing pain, enlarging hemorrhage, or signs of orbital compartment syndrome. Treatment response assessment: Resolution of redness and swelling, stability or improvement in symptoms.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language, avoiding medical jargon, and check understanding by asking questions. Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the benign nature of trauma-related hemorrhage and reassure that systemic condition is monitored separately. Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions and schedules for follow-up; encourage questions. Family involvement: If appropriate, inform family members about eye care and need for follow-up, respecting patient privacy.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if no improvement in 2 weeks or if complications arise; oncologist for ongoing systemic management of lymphoma. Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider to coordinate systemic health, or hematology/oncology as indicated. Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye trauma and lymphoma management support groups. Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm coverage for specialist visits; provide assistance with appointment scheduling if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines conservative ocular management with ongoing attention to the patient's systemic lymphoma. Initial management focuses on observation and symptomatic relief with artificial tears, avoiding unnecessary medications that may increase bleeding risk. The patient should be educated about the benign nature of the hemorrhage, signs of deterioration, and the importance of follow-up. Close monitoring over the next 1-2 weeks will ensure resolution, with referral to ophthalmology if symptoms persist or worsen. Coordination with the patient's oncologist is essential to address systemic treatment considerations. This plan aims for complete resolution of ocular symptoms while respecting systemic health needs and preventing complications.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reassure the patient, prescribe artificial tears, advise on protective eye habits, and schedule follow-up in 1-2 weeks. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Ensure symptom resolution, monitor for any worsening signs, and confirm no secondary complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Continue systemic management of lymphoma, prevent ocular trauma, and reassess eye health periodically. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions on eye care, warning signs to watch for, importance of follow-up, and contact information for urgent concerns.",
