    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes promoting complete alcohol abstinence supported by motivational counseling, nutritional support emphasizing calorie and protein intake, and close clinical monitoring of symptoms and liver function labs. Initial management emphasizes education on the risks of continued alcohol use and the importance of follow-up appointments. Support from addiction services and referral to a hepatologist are advised if the condition worsens or does not improve. Follow-up will occur within 1-2 weeks to assess symptom progression and laboratory results, with ongoing adjustment based on clinical response. This approach aims to prevent progression to liver failure, improve liver function, and establish long-term sobriety while minimizing risks associated with untreated alcoholic hepatitis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Advise complete alcohol abstinence, provide patient education, order baseline labs (LFTs, INR, CBC), and arrange follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor clinical and laboratory response, reinforce abstinence, address nutritional needs, and evaluate for signs of deterioration.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained abstinence, normalize liver function tests, and prevent progression of liver disease.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on alcohol cessation, symptom monitoring, nutrition, follow-up schedule, and when to seek urgent care.",
