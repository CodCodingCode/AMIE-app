    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease with concern for ectopic pregnancy, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intramuscular Ceftriaxone 250 mg once and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14 days, along with symptom monitoring and patient education on medication adherence and STI prevention. Immediate management focuses on reducing infection and preventing complications, while ongoing evaluation will ensure symptom resolution. Follow-up in 48-72 hours is essential to assess response, with readiness to escalate care or refer to gynecology if improvement is not evident. Key patient education points encompass abstinence from sexual activity until treatment completion, recognizing warning signs, and encouraging partner treatment. This approach aims to resolve infection, mitigate risks of ectopic pregnancy, and promote long-term reproductive health while addressing patient concerns and ensuring coordinated care.",
