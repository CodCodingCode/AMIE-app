    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: The diagnosis of panic disorder is supported by characteristic episodes with physical and psychological symptoms, but differential considerations such as autonomic dysregulation or cardiac issues must be monitored. - Severity classification: Moderate, as episodes are multiple daily, impacting functioning, but no mention of life-threatening symptoms. - Urgency level: Routine care can initially be planned; however, ruling out other serious causes warrants evaluation soon. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Cardiac arrhythmias, secondary hypertension, or autonomic disorders.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) paired with pharmacotherapy (preferably SSRIs). - Supporting evidence: CBT has strong evidence for reducing panic attack frequency and severity; SSRIs are effective and have a favorable side effect profile. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's underreporting and information withholding suggest a need for gentle engagement and possibly staged treatment initiation. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for medication side effects; ensure no contraindications to SSRIs.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Sertraline 25-50 mg once daily, titrating gradually. - Rationale for selection: Sertraline is well-studied, generally well-tolerated, and approved for panic disorder. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some benefit may be seen within 2-4 weeks; significant reduction in episodes expected in 6-8 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal disturbances, sleep changes, increased anxiety initially, and hyponatremia in older patients. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Regular breathing exercises, relaxation techniques, and grounding strategies. - Patient education priorities: Understanding panic symptoms, reassurance about benign nature, and importance of adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular exercise, adequate sleep, avoidance of caffeine/stimulants, stress management. - Behavioral interventions: CBT focusing on panic symptom recognition, exposure techniques, and anxiety management skills.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 2-4 weeks after medication initiation; more frequently if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Frequency/severity of panic episodes, medication side effects, adherence, functional impact. - Red flag symptoms: Chest pain, syncope, or worsening dizziness\u2014seek urgent care. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in frequency/intensity of episodes and improvement in quality of life.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; encourage questions; provide written summaries. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that symptoms are common and manageable, normalize seeking help. - Adherence strategies: Establish trust, provide education, and involve the patient in decision-making. - Family involvement: Obtain consent to involve family if appropriate; provide them with basic education about panic disorder.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Consider referral to a mental health professional skilled in CBT if in-house services are limited. - Other healthcare team members: Psychiatrist for medication management if necessary; therapist for CBT. - Community resources: Support groups, educational materials through mental health organizations. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage options, explore low-cost therapy resources if applicable.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of panic disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy alongside starting an SSRI, specifically sertraline 25-50 mg daily, with gradual titration. This approach is supported by evidence for reducing attack frequency and severity. It considers the patient's tendency to underreport symptoms by emphasizing regular follow-up and education.  Initial management focuses on establishing a therapeutic alliance, providing reassurance, and equipping the patient with relaxation and grounding techniques. Pharmacotherapy is expected to show benefits within 2-4 weeks, with significant symptom reduction in 6-8 weeks. Monitoring will include symptom diaries, side effect assessments, and functional impact evaluations. Key education points involve understanding panic symptoms as manageable and the importance of adherence.  Implementation guidance: - Immediate actions (today): Discuss treatment options and set up follow-up plan; provide educational handouts. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor medication tolerance, reinforce CBT strategies, and assess symptom changes. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained reduction in panic episodes, normalization of daily functioning, and continued engagement with therapy. - Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, coping strategies, warning signs requiring urgent attention, and contact information for support.
