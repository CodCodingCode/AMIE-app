The treatment plan includes initiating rivastigmine transdermal patches to improve cognition and hallucinations, coupled with cautious use of levodopa if motor symptoms significantly impair function. Non-pharmacological interventions focus on fall prevention, sleep hygiene, and behavioral strategies for hallucinations. Regular follow-up at 4-6 week intervals will monitor medication efficacy and side effects, adjusting treatment as needed. Education for the patient and family will emphasize safety, medication benefits and risks, and supportive resources. Coordination with neurology, physical therapy, and community programs will support optimal quality of life. This integrated approach aims to stabilize symptoms, reduce fall risk, and enhance overall well-being while carefully managing potential adverse effects.\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate provider consultation for medication prescriptions, conduct a home safety assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve tolerability of medication, reduce hallucination distress, improve balance through therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain cognitive function, reduce fall incidents, support patient safety and caregiver needs.\n- Patient handout summary: \"We are starting a medication to help with memory and hallucinations, with safety precautions in place; fall prevention is key; follow-up visits are essential to monitor progress.\"",
