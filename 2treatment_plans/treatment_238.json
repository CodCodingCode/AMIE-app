The treatment plan includes immediate hospital admission for stabilization, administration of antiplatelet agents (aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor), nitrates, and anticoagulation, along with urgent reperfusion therapy such as PCI. Pharmacological therapy will be tailored based on patient specifics and ongoing assessments, with vigilant monitoring for bleeding and ischemic complications. Long-term management will focus on secondary prevention through lifestyle modifications, cardiac rehabilitation, and regular follow-up with cardiology.\nInitial management should prioritize stabilizing the patient\u2019s condition today with medications and rapid transfer for definitive intervention. Short-term goals include symptom resolution, stabilization of vital signs, and confirmation of reperfusion success. The long-term strategy involves sustained risk factor modification, adherence to prescribed medications, and participation in rehabilitation programs.\nPatient education will emphasize recognition of warning symptoms and importance of compliance, while involving family members when appropriate. Coordination with cardiology, nursing, pharmacy, and community resources will facilitate comprehensive care and improve outcomes. This integrated approach aims to reduce mortality, prevent recurrent events, and promote optimal cardiac health.",
