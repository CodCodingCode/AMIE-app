    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan. First, confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity to prioritize urgency. Since the patient has signs of DVT (calf swelling, warmth,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism (PE), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent initiation of anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban, along with confirmatory imaging and assessment by specialists. Immediate management focuses on stabilizing the embolic event, preventing clot propagation, and minimizing bleeding risks, while establishing a long-term anticoagulation plan and addressing underlying risk factors like protein deficiency. Follow-up will involve regular monitoring of anticoagulation effectiveness, signs of bleeding, and patient understanding. This approach is designed to reduce morbidity and mortality, ensure safe medication use, and promote patient adherence, while proactively managing potential side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Admit the patient urgently, initiate anticoagulation (e.g., LMWH 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), and arrange for imaging (duplex ultrasound, chest CT angiography) as soon as feasible.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, monitor for bleeding or adverse effects, and start patient education on medication use, symptom recognition, and activity restrictions.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete initial anticoagulation course, evaluate for continuation or modification of therapy, and assess underlying protein deficiency management.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, recognize signs of bleeding or recurrent symptoms, avoid prolonged immobility, and schedule follow-up appointments promptly.",
