    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach for a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection presenting with vulvovaginal ulceration. Confirm diagnosis confidence, severity, and urgency; select evidence-based treatments, including antivirals; address supportive care; plan follow-up; and ensure clear communication. Ensure considerations for local irritation from feminine wash and systemic symptoms are incorporated. The plan must focus on symptom relief, outbreak management, and prevention, while accounting for patient understanding and adherence.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes antiviral therapy to reduce symptom duration and viral shedding, supportive care to manage local irritation and discomfort, patient education, and follow-up to monitor progress and reduce recurrence.  Initial management focuses on initiating antiviral medication promptly to control active lesions and reduce transmission risk. Emphasis will be placed on avoiding local irritants such as scented washes. A long-term maintenance plan may be discussed if recurrent episodes occur.  Follow-up care will include reassessment of lesion healing, symptom resolution, and counseling on transmission prevention. Patient education will cover HSV nature, transmission, management, and prevention strategies.  This approach is designed to promote symptom resolution, decrease transmission risk, and improve quality of life while minimizing medication side effects and educating the patient on ongoing management.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with PCR or viral culture, initiate antiviral therapy, advise cessation of scented feminine products, and provide symptomatic relief options. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antiviral course, monitor lesion healing, manage discomfort, and reinforce education about transmission prevention. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrent outbreaks through education and, if recurrent, consider suppressive antiviral therapy. - Patient handout summary: key points include HSV transmission, lesion care, medication adherence, and prevention measures.
