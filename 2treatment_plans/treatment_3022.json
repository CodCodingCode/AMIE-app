    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Vestibular Paroxysmia (likely due to vascular compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve) or a form of episodic vertigo related to positional or vascular triggers, potentially Meni\u00e8re's disease or vestibular migraine.\n\nJustification:  \nThe patient\u2019s episodes involve dizziness, imbalance, visual disturbances, sweating, and shortness of breath, lasting minutes to longer, with triggers such as head movement and physical activity. The history of childhood onset, increased frequency, and no persistent neurological deficits point toward a diagnosis involving episodic vestibular and neurological symptoms. The associated visual changes, limb jerking (which may represent disequilibrium or myoclonus), and autonomic features suggest a central or peripheral mechanism involved in episodic dysfunction. The triggering by head movements suggests a positional component, which can be seen in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular migraine, or vestibular paroxysmia.  \nGiven the involved autonomic symptoms (sweating, shortness of breath) and visual changes, vascular causes such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency or cerebellar ischemia could also be considered, but the episodic, positional nature and early onset favor a benign episodic vestibular disorder. The worsening frequency could indicate a progressive component but still within a benign episodic spectrum.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nA likely diagnosis is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with possible autonomic and visual symptoms, or vestibular migraine. Further diagnostic workup including positional testing (Dix-Hallpike), vestibular assessment, and neuroimaging may be needed to clarify the cause. \n\n<If all checklist items are 'Yes', append 'END' to signify conclusion>",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the episodic nature of the patient's symptoms involving dizziness, imbalance, visual disturbances, sweating, and shortness of breath, with triggers such as head movement and physical activity, the most likely diagnoses include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular migraine, or vestibular paroxysmia. The presence of positional triggers and episodic symptom fluctuation suggests a benign vestibular disorder rather than a chronic neurological deficit. Vascular causes, such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency, are less likely given the episodic, positional pattern and early onset. To confirm BPPV, positional testing like the Dix-Hallpike maneuver can be performed. Non-pharmacological measures such as vestibular rehabilitation can help improve balance and reduce episodes, especially if BPPV is confirmed. Pharmacological treatment may involve vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine) for acute symptom relief if necessary, and migraine prophylaxis if vestibular migraine is suspected. Given the autonomic symptoms like sweating and shortness of breath, ruling out cardiac or other systemic causes is essential, but initial management should focus on symptomatic relief and diagnostic confirmation. If episodic vertigo persists despite conservative measures, further neuroimaging and specialist referral may be appropriate.\n\nANSWER: Initiate symptomatic treatment with vestibular rehabilitation exercises to promote central compensation and improve balance. Consider prescribing meclizine 25-50 mg as needed for acute vertigo episodes, with caution regarding sedation. Advise the patient on positional maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver if BPPV is confirmed or suspected. Recommend a referral for diagnostic evaluation, including a Dix-Hallpike test and vestibular assessment, to clarify the underlying cause. If episodes are frequent or highly disabling, consider trialing a low-dose migraine prophylactic medication (e.g., propranolol or amitriptyline) after ruling out contraindications, especially if symptoms suggest vestibular migraine. Monitor the patient\u2019s symptoms closely, and ensure that any autonomic symptoms are evaluated for systemic causes if they persist or worsen. Additionally, instruct the patient to keep a symptom and trigger diary to aid in diagnosis and management."
