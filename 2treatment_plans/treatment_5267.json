The worsening of behaviors, social withdrawal, and response to routines further support this diagnosis. The absence of current signs of infection or medical illnesses suggests these behaviors are not secondary to an acute medical condition but align with neurodevelopmental etiology.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the child's presentation with clear signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including developmental delays, atypical social behaviors, stereotyped movements, and difficulty with change, an individualized intervention approach is essential. Non-pharmacological strategies such as early behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis) and speech therapy are foundational to improve communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Given the child's irritability and possible hyperactivity, a careful assessment for comorbid conditions like anxiety or attention issues may guide additional supports. Pharmacological intervention can be considered if behavioral interventions are insufficient to manage specific symptoms such as severe irritability, aggression, or hyperactivity. Medications like risperidone or aripiprazole are FDA-approved for irritability associated with ASD, but these should be used cautiously, with monitoring for side effects. Coordination with specialists, early intervention services, and family education are also critical components of comprehensive care.\n\nANSWER: Begin early intervention services immediately, including referral for specialized behavioral therapies such as Applied Behavior Analysis and speech-language therapy tailored to the child's needs. Educate the family about ASD and the importance of consistent routines and structured environments. Monitor the child's irritability and behavioral challenges; if these are severe and interfere significantly with functioning, consider initiating a low dose of risperidone or aripiprazole in consultation with a child psychiatrist, with regular follow-up for side effects and efficacy. Reinforce the importance of consistent routines, visual supports, and social skills training at home and in therapy settings. Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed. If concerns about co-occurring conditions like anxiety or hyperactivity emerge, evaluate and treat these accordingly to optimize the child's overall development and well-being."
