    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Pelvic organ prolapse, likely an anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse (e.g., cystocele or rectocele)\nJustification: The patient reports feelings of fullness, heaviness, and discomfort in the lower abdomen lasting for months, which have become more constant and worse with prolonged sitting or standing. These symptoms are characteristic of pelvic organ prolapse, where the support of the pelvic floor structures has weakened. The sensation of heaviness or dragging is typical, especially as the prolapse becomes more pronounced over time. The absence of pain does not exclude prolapse, and the recent change in menstrual cycles could be related to hormonal shifts impacting pelvic support tissues or other gynecological factors. The irregular bowel habits may be incidental or secondary but do not exclude prolapse, particularly if rectocele is present.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nPelvic organ prolapse, likely cystocele or rectocele\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse, likely cystocele or rectocele, the primary approach should focus on symptomatic relief and conservative management initially, especially since the patient has experienced persistent feelings of fullness and heaviness that worsen with prolonged standing or sitting. Non-pharmacological measures such as pelvic floor strengthening exercises (e.g., Kegel exercises) can improve pelvic support. Behavioral modifications, including weight management, avoiding heavy lifting, and managing constipation to prevent straining, may slow progression and alleviate symptoms. pessary use is an effective, non-invasive option suitable for immediate relief if the patient prefers to delay or avoid surgical intervention. Pharmacological options are limited but may include stool softeners if constipation contributes to discomfort. Surgical intervention can be considered if conservative measures fail or if prolapse worsens significantly.\n\nANSWER: Initiate conservative management by recommending regular pelvic floor muscle training (Kegel exercises) to strengthen pelvic support structures. Educate the patient on lifestyle modifications such as weight management, avoiding heavy lifting, and maintaining bowel regularity with a diet high in fiber and adequate hydration. If symptomatic and manual techniques are insufficient, consider fitting the patient with an appropriate vaginal pessary to provide structural support and improve comfort. Monitor symptoms regularly, and if prolapse persists or worsens despite conservative measures, refer the patient to a gynecologist or urogynecologist for further assessment and discussion of surgical options. Consider trial of stool softeners if bowel habits are contributing to discomfort."
