The initial step involves urgent excisional biopsy with appropriate margins to confirm the diagnosis and determine Breslow thickness. If confirmed as malignant melanoma, a wide local excision with margins tailored to tumor depth will be performed. Further management will depend on staging, including sentinel lymph node biopsy and imaging studies as indicated. Throughout, the focus will be on wound care, sun protection, and vigilant skin surveillance. Educating the patient about the significance of early diagnosis, follow-up, and risk factors is essential. If staging indicates metastasis or high-risk features, systemic therapies such as immunotherapy or targeted agents will be considered by oncology specialists. Regular follow-up will monitor for recurrence or new lesions, with attention to red flags prompting urgent assessment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent biopsy and dermatologist or surgical oncology consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Obtain pathology, perform staging studies if indicated, and complete wide local excision.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish ongoing skin surveillance, initiate adjuvant therapy if needed, and support patient psychological well-being.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of prompt diagnosis, surgical removal, sun safety practices, and routine skin checks.",
