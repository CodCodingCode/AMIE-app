The treatment plan includes abortive medications, primarily a triptan such as sumatriptan, administered at headache onset, complemented by NSAIDs or acetaminophen as needed. Lifestyle modifications focusing on trigger avoidance, sleep hygiene, and stress management are essential. Patient education will emphasize recognizing early warning signs, appropriate medication use, and when to seek urgent care. Close follow-up in 4-6 weeks will monitor attack frequency, treatment efficacy, and side effects, with adjustments as needed. Neurology referral should be considered if attacks persist or worsen. This approach aims to reduce headache severity and frequency, improve quality of life, and prevent medication overuse or adverse effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Explain diagnosis, initiate triptan prescription, advise on trigger avoidance, and provide headache diary instructions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess response to abortive therapy, reinforce lifestyle modifications, and schedule follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Optimize management plan, consider prophylactic options if attack frequency increases, and reassess for secondary causes.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about migraine with aura, medication use, trigger management, and warning signs for urgent care.",
