The treatment plan includes initiating antiseizure medication\u2014preferably lamotrigine\u2014adjusted gradually to minimize side effects, along with lifestyle modifications emphasizing sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and safety precautions. Close follow-up in 2-4 weeks will assess medication efficacy and tolerability, with ongoing monitoring for seizure control, side effects, and emotional well-being. Education will focus on disease understanding, adherence importance, and safety. Coordination with neurology specialists and inclusion of family members when appropriate will support optimal management. This approach aims to reduce seizure frequency, improve quality of life, and address associated anxiety while minimizing adverse effects and supporting long-term stability.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Provide patient education on epilepsy, discuss medication options, and arrange neurology referral.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate lamotrigine titration, monitor for side effects, and assess seizure activity.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve seizure control, maintain medication adherence, and address psychological impacts.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include medication adherence, seizure precautions, recognizing side effects, and scheduling follow-up appointments.",
