    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; the presentation strongly suggests S\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with artificial tears and saliva substitutes, systemic therapy such as pilocarpine if systemic symptoms are significant, and lifestyle modifications to reduce environmental triggers and promote glandular health. Initial management focuses on symptom control and patient education, while establishing long-term monitoring through regular follow-up visits. Follow-up care will include assessment of symptom response, ocular surface health, and systemic activity, with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs necessitating immediate medical attention. This approach aims to improve her quality of life, preserve gland function, and prevent potential systemic complications while minimizing side effects through careful monitoring and patient engagement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on artificial tear use, hydration, and environmental modifications; initiate trial of artificial tears.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess symptom relief, tolerability of medications, and adjust treatment as needed; consider systemic therapy if systemic symptoms persist.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained symptom control, monitor for disease progression, and coordinate multidisciplinary care.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize daily eye and mouth hygiene, medication schedule, importance of follow-up, and recognizing signs that require urgent care.",
