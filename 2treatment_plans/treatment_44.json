    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infectious zoonotic pneumonia (atypical hantavirus disease), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive medical management with patient-centered education and monitoring. The initial focus should be on ensuring adequate oxygenation through supplemental oxygen therapy, careful fluid management to prevent pulmonary edema, and close clinical observation. Given the severity signs, hospitalization for heightened monitoring is advisable. Supportive care will be complemented by patient education on preventing zoonotic exposure, recognizing worsening symptoms, and understanding treatment goals. Follow-up will include regular assessment of respiratory status, oxygen weaning as tolerated, and prompt escalation if deterioration occurs. This approach aims to stabilize the patient, prevent progression, and facilitate recovery while minimizing risks associated with hypoxia and respiratory failure.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate supplemental oxygen, perform pulse oximetry, and monitor vital signs closely. Arrange hospital admission if not already admitted. Obtain relevant labs and imaging (CXR).\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize respiratory function, prevent hypoxia, monitor for complications, and educate the patient.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery, prevent future zoonotic exposures, and provide follow-up for any lingering pulmonary effects.\n- Patient handout summary: Educate about the importance of oxygen therapy, signs of worsening, avoiding rodent exposure, and the necessity of follow-up visits for reassessment.",
