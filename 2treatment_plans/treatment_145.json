    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone 60 mg daily) to prevent further visual loss, along with close monitoring of visual and systemic symptoms. Supportive measures include patient education on medication adherence and side effect monitoring. Follow-up should occur within 24-48 hours to assess vision stability and side effects, with ongoing adjustments based on clinical response and laboratory markers. Coordination with ophthalmology and rheumatology is essential for confirmation and long-term management. This approach aims to preserve remaining vision, control systemic inflammation, and minimize complications, ensuring a rapid and sustained response to this sight-threatening condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start high-dose corticosteroids immediately, notify ophthalmology for urgent assessment, and educate the patient on the importance of prompt treatment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Stabilize systemic symptoms, prevent further vision loss, perform diagnostic biopsy, and start tapering steroids based on response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission, monitor for relapse, and minimize medication side effects through regular follow-up.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of treatment, potential side effects, importance of medication adherence, and when to seek urgent care.",
