    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: The diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis wi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis with nerve root compression, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAIDs for pain relief, structured physical therapy focused on lumbar stabilization and gait improvement, and careful activity modification to reduce fall risk. Initial management also emphasizes patient education about symptom monitoring and safety. Due to her age and underlying osteomalacia, nutritional assessment and supplementation should be coordinated. Short-term goals involve symptom control and mobility improvement within weeks, with ongoing follow-up to evaluate functional gains, monitor for warning signs, and adjust treatment accordingly. This approach aims to enhance her mobility, reduce fall risk, and improve her quality of life while minimizing medication side effects and ensuring safe, sustainable long-term management of her condition.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate NSAID therapy after assessing renal and GI risks, provide education on activity modification and fall prevention, and refer to physical therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve pain reduction, improve gait stability, and increase mobility.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain functional independence, prevent falls, and evaluate for surgical consultation if no significant improvement.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about medication use, activity tips, fall prevention strategies, and signs to watch for warranting urgent care.",
