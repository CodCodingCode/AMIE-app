    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on history of trauma after playing soccer and presentation with redness, swelling, tearing, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; no mention of lens dislocation, orbital fracture, or globe rupture suggests localized ocular contusion with subconjunctival hemorrhage. - Urgency level: Urgent assessment needed to rule out more serious injuries, but immediate emergency care not necessarily indicated unless vision is compromised. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Assess for hyphema, orbital fractures, intraocular injury, or increased intraocular pressure.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic care including cold compresses and observation; avoid NSAIDs initially if intraocular injury suspected. - Supporting evidence: Rest, eye protection, and symptomatic management are standard for minor ocular contusions. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient has baseline epilepsy; ensure no medication interactions or sedative effects influencing alertness. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid pressure on the eye, monitor for signs of intraocular injury or increased intraocular pressure.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prescribe topical lubricants (artificial tears) as needed for tearing; no systemic antibiotics unless signs of infection. - Rationale for selection: Lubricants reduce discomfort and promote healing. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions or irritation from topical agents. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider topical corticosteroids if significant inflammation persists, under ophthalmology consultation.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest eye, avoid strenuous activity, and protect the eye from further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Inform about signs of worsening (vision changes, pain, increasing swelling). - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid activities causing additional trauma; use eye protection during sports. - Behavioral interventions: Stress importance of follow-up and adherence to activity restrictions.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, ocular pain, swelling, and signs of intraocular injury. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, nausea/vomiting, or signs of orbital fracture. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in swelling and tearing; improved or stable vision.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language emphasizing the importance of monitoring and follow-up. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that minor contusions heal well but emphasize vigilance. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions and confirm understanding. - Family involvement: Engage family members if appropriate to support care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation within 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care provider for overall health monitoring. - Community resources: Eye safety education programs or sports safety resources. - Insurance/cost considerations: Inform patient about coverage for specialist visits and necessary tests.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of ocular contusion with subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes symptomatic relief with cold compresses and artificial tears, eye protection, and activity restriction to prevent further trauma, with close monitoring for signs of intraocular injury. Immediate management focuses on symptom relief and observation, while ensuring patient understanding of warning signs requiring urgent evaluation. Follow-up after 48-72 hours with an ophthalmologist is essential to assess healing and rule out complications. Patient education will emphasize protective measures during sports and when to seek emergency care. This approach aims to promote recovery, prevent complications, and ensure patient safety and satisfaction while minimizing risks associated with ocular trauma.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise rest, apply cold compresses, and initiate symptomatic treatment with artificial tears; schedule ophthalmology referral. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor resolution of swelling and tearing; ensure no development of intraocular signs. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full recovery of ocular surface; prevent recurrence with protective measures. - Patient handout summary: Key points on eye protection, symptom vigilance, follow-up schedule, and when to seek urgent care.",
