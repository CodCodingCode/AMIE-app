    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Infantile spasms (West syndrome)  \n\nJustification:  \nThe clinical presentation of abnormal movements\u2014including jerking, spasms, eye deviation, and facial twitching\u2014starting around three months of age, along with poor head control, developmental regression (absence of smiling or laughing), poor sleep, decreased interaction, and variable feeding, strongly suggests a seizure disorder in early infancy. The combination of spasms and developmental regression is characteristic of infantile spasms (West syndrome). Furthermore, the presence of specific seizure features such as brief flexor or extensor spasms, coupled with the described EEG abnormalities (if available), supports this diagnosis. Although other conditions like cerebral palsy or other epileptic syndromes could be considered, the age of onset, seizure types, and developmental regressions are hallmark features of infantile spasms.  \n\nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional investigations like EEG and neuroimaging are needed for confirmation)  \n- No further clarification needed: No (details such as EEG or neuroimaging results are still pending)  \n\nANSWER:  \nInfantile spasms (West syndrome)  \nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Infantile spasms (West syndrome) is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment to prevent further developmental deterioration. The primary goal is to suppress spasms quickly and improve the child's developmental trajectory. First-line pharmacologic therapy typically involves starting adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or high-dose oral corticosteroids, which have shown efficacy in controlling spasms. Vaseline or other skin protection measures should be considered for steroid use to minimize side effects. Vigabatrin is another medication that is particularly effective, especially in children with tuberous sclerosis, and can be used either as initial therapy or in cases where corticosteroids are contraindicated. Non-pharmacological interventions include ensuring adequate nutritional support, proper hydration, and educating caregivers about seizure recognition and safety measures. Neuroimaging (MRI) and an EEG should be confirmed promptly, but treatment should not be delayed once the diagnosis is suspected, to prevent ongoing developmental regression. Coordination with neurology specialists is ideal, but initiating first-line therapy as soon as possible is crucial in a primary care setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should commence with either high-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) injections or oral corticosteroids to rapidly control the spasms. Concurrently, consider starting vigabatrin, especially if tuberous sclerosis is suspected, to increase the likelihood of seizure control. Ensure close monitoring for side effects such as hypertension, infection, or hormonal imbalances. Supportive care includes maintaining adequate nutrition, hydration, and supportive therapies as needed. Arrange urgent neuroimaging (MRI) and EEG to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Educate caregivers about seizure safety and the importance of adherence to medication. Close follow-up with neurology should be arranged to assess response and adjust treatment accordingly."
