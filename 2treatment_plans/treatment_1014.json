    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the patient's trauma history and visual symptoms, clinical suspicion for retinal detachment or tear is high, but definitive diagnosis requires urgent ocular examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy or ocular imaging. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe, considering persistent flashes, shadows, and ongoing visual disturbances after trauma\u2014these symptoms suggest a significant retinal injury risk. - Urgency level: Immediate assessment needed to confirm diagnosis and prevent progression; retinal detachments can rapidly lead to permanent vision loss. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Choroidal hemorrhage or rupture, vitreous hemorrhage, or other trauma-related ocular injuries.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with possible surgical intervention if retinal detachment or tear is confirmed. - Supporting evidence: Early intervention within 24-48 hours improves visual prognosis and prevents retinal detachment progression. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient's anxiety and potential difficulty understanding the severity; reassurance and clear communication essential. - Contraindications or cautions: Delay in assessment could worsen outcome; avoid unnecessary ophthalmic procedures without proper diagnosis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are needed for symptomatic relief or stabilization. - Primary medication choice: NONE; immediate surgical or laser intervention is definitive. - Rationale for selection: Pharmacological treatments are adjuncts; no mainstay medications exist for retinal tears/detachment. - Expected timeline for improvement: Outcomes depend on prompt surgical management. - Key side effects to monitor: Not applicable; focus on timely referral. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Not applicable in this context; intervention is surgical.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions. - Primary non-drug interventions: Patient should rest and avoid strenuous eye activities; avoid increased intraocular pressure situations. - Patient education priorities: Explain the urgency of diagnosis, importance of follow-up, and potential risks of delays. - Lifestyle modifications: Protect the affected eye; avoid rubbing, and sudden head movements. - Behavioral interventions: Address anxiety through reassurance and providing clear information.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish plans for ongoing care. - Follow-up timeline: Urgent referral within 24 hours; post-treatment follow-up as advised by ophthalmology. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, new flashes or shadows, visual acuity changes. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, increased floaters, pain, or worsening shadows requiring immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Visual acuity testing and slit-lamp evaluation after intervention.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given patient's anxiety, communication should be empathetic. - Communication approach: Use clear, reassuring language; explain that prompt evaluation and possible treatment can preserve vision. - Addressing patient concerns: Validate worries, explain the nature of trauma-related injuries, and emphasize the importance of urgent specialist assessment. - Adherence strategies: Offer written instructions, schedule promptly, and involve family if appropriate to support follow-up. - Family involvement: Encourage discussing the condition with trusted persons to reduce anxiety and ensure compliance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Care coordination needs. - Specialist referrals needed: Urgent referral to ophthalmology within 24 hours, ideally to a retina specialist. - Other healthcare team members: Coordinate with primary care for ongoing support. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about ocular trauma and recovery. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist patient with appointment scheduling and possible coverage issues to ensure timely care.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment or tear, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent ophthalmologic evaluation with patient-centered communication and follow-up. The immediate priority is to arrange urgent referral to an ophthalmologist for a thorough ocular examination, including retinal assessment, and potential surgical intervention if a tear or detachment is confirmed. In the interim, instruct the patient to rest, avoid strenuous activities, and protect the affected eye. Educate the patient about the importance of prompt treatment to prevent permanent vision loss, addressing their anxiety through reassurance and clear information. Follow-up includes close monitoring for deterioration and adherence to scheduled ophthalmology appointments. This approach aims to preserve visual function while minimizing risks associated with delayed management.",
