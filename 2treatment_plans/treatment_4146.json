    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)\nJustification: The patient's presentation includes sudden unilateral vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, persistent temporal headaches, and fatigue. These features strongly suggest a vasculitic process affecting large and medium arteries, characteristic of giant cell arteritis. The presence of jaw pain and scalp tenderness when touching her temples supports inflammation of the superficial temporal arteries. The age of the patient (72 years) is typical for this condition. Given the risk of irreversible vision loss, prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation are critical, even before confirmatory biopsy.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nGiant Cell Arteritis\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) and the urgent risk of permanent visual impairment, the primary goal is to promptly initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy to reduce vascular inflammation and prevent vision loss, even before confirmatory biopsy results. Immediate treatment is critical because delays can lead to irreversible damage. Adjunct non-pharmacological measures focus on monitoring and managing potential side effects of steroids, as well as patient education about the importance of adherence and reporting new symptoms. Long-term management may involve tapering steroids cautiously, with consideration for additional immunosuppressive therapy if indicated. \n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should start with high-dose oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (often 60-80 mg daily for most patients), initiated immediately to control inflammation and prevent vision loss. The patient should be referred promptly to a rheumatologist or endocrinologist for further assessment and possible biopsy confirmation, but treatment should not be delayed. It is important to provide patient education on the importance of adherence to therapy and monitoring for side effects such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and increased infection risk. Regular follow-up should include assessment of symptoms, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant parameters. Once symptoms improve and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) decrease, a gradual tapering of corticosteroids can be considered over several months, guided by clinical response and laboratory markers. Depending on the course, adjunct immunosuppressants like methotrexate may be discussed with a specialist if long-term steroid use is problematic."
