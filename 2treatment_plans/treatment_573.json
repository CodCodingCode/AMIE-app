    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY:  \nThe patient's eye symptoms began 2 days ago after playing soccer, with redness, swelling, and tearing\u2014most consistent with viral or mild traumatic conjunctivitis. The certainty level is moderate, given typical presentation and recent activity. Severity appears mild to moderate, since symptoms are limited to local irritation without vision changes or significant pain. Urgency is routine; no immediate danger signs are present. Monitoring for worsening symptoms or signs of more serious conditions (e.g., vision loss, severe pain) is important.\n\nSTEP 2 - TREATMENT SELECTION:  \nStandard of care for viral conjunctivitis is supportive care, as antibiotics are ineffective against VIRAL causes. Patient-specific factors include recent activity, which could involve trauma, but no evidence of corneal abrasion or globe injury. Avoiding unnecessary antibiotics is key to prevent resistance and side effects.\n\nSTEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:  \nSupportive measures such as artificial tears and cold compresses are first-line. Antibiotics are generally not indicated unless bacterial superinfection is suspected, which is less common. If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, topical antibiotics like erythromycin ointment could be considered.\n\nSTEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:  \nAdvise gentle eyelid hygiene, avoidance of rubbing eyes, and maintaining hand hygiene to prevent spread. Educate about proper contact lens hygiene if applicable. Encourage rest and avoiding eye irritants.\n\nSTEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP:  \nFollow-up in 3-5 days if symptoms do not improve or worsen. Patient should seek immediate care if vision changes, pain intensifies, or signs of secondary bacterial infection appear. Improvement typically begins within a week with supportive care.\n\nSTEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION:  \nPresent this plan clearly, emphasizing viral nature, supportive care, and signs requiring prompt re-evaluation. Address concerns about contagion and reassurance about prognosis. Encourage adherence to hygiene measures and follow-up.\n\nSTEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:  \nReferral to ophthalmology is unnecessary unless symptoms worsen or do not improve in a week, or if signs of corneal involvement occur. Coordinate with primary care for ongoing management and patient education.\nANSWER: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:   - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on conjunctivitis nature, hygiene measures, and symptomatic care. Provide artificial tears. Advise on avoidance of eye rubbing and contact lens use if applicable.   - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Expect symptom improvement within 7 days. Monitor for any worsening or new symptoms.   - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete resolution of symptoms, prevent recurrence, and reduce transmission.   - Patient handout summary: Key points include the viral nature of the conjunctivitis, use of artificial tears, hygiene practices, signs toWatch for worsening, and follow-up instructions.",
