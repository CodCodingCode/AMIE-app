    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acquired hematologic bleeding disorder secondary to plasma cell neoplasm, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent stabilization with definitive therapy targeting the underlying malignancy. Initial management involves hospital admission for transfusions to address anemia and thrombocytopenia, corticosteroid therapy to reduce plasma cell proliferation, and supportive care to control bleeding. Concurrently, initiate diagnostic confirmation with hematology consultation and specialized testing. A multidisciplinary team will coordinate chemotherapy or other targeted treatments as indicated. The plan emphasizes close monitoring of blood counts, bleeding symptoms, and neurological status, with follow-up scheduled within 1-2 weeks. Patient and family education will focus on recognizing bleeding signs, medication adherence, and safety measures. This integrated approach aims to stabilize the patient, control bleeding episodes, and improve long-term prognosis while minimizing risks and ensuring supportive care.",
