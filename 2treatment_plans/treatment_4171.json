    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation of social withdrawal (less talkative, more upset and confused, clinginess), abnormal repetitive behaviors such as hand-flapping, developmental delays in speech and motor skills, and the gradual onset over weeks to months are characteristic features of ASD. The presence of irregular sleep patterns, fluctuating appetite, and family history further support a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic or familial predisposition. There is no indication of acute illness, injury, or environmental toxin exposure, which makes a neurodevelopmental etiology more probable.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the primary goals are to support developmental progress, address the child's specific challenges, and improve overall functioning and quality of life. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis), speech therapy, and occupational therapy are foundational and should be initiated promptly to target communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Given the presence of irritability, repetitive behaviors, and possible anxiety, pharmacological options may be considered if these behaviors significantly interfere with daily functioning or pose safety concerns. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) can help reduce repetitive behaviors and irritability, but should be used cautiously with close monitoring. Since this is outlined for primary care or psychiatric management, ongoing assessment and collaboration with specialists in ASD are recommended to tailor interventions and monitor progress.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with engaging multidisciplinary services, including speech, occupational, and behavioral therapies, tailored to the child's developmental needs. A parent training program to implement consistent behavioral strategies can be highly beneficial. Sleep disturbances should be addressed through establishing a consistent bedtime routine and, if necessary, with sleep hygiene education or a trial of melatonin under medical supervision. If behaviors such as severe aggression, self-injury, or significant irritability persist and impair the child's functioning, initiating a trial of medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine) can be considered after discussing potential benefits and side effects with the family. Regular follow-up to monitor developmental progress, behavioral challenges, and the effectiveness of interventions is essential, with referrals to specialists (e.g., developmental pediatricians, behavioral therapists) made as appropriate."
