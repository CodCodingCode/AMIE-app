    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Spinal epidermoid or congenital dermal sinus with secondary infection and possible tethered cord\nJustification: The patient's history of a longstanding congenital bump that has recently enlarged and become erythematous with warmth and soreness suggests an infected dermal sinus tract or epidermoid cyst. The neurological symptoms\u2014progressive leg weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, and bladder issues\u2014are consistent with tethered cord syndrome or spinal cord compression. The episodes of worsening symptoms with activity and relief with rest further support a neurogenic component. The local skin changes combined with neurological deficits point toward an infected spinal dermal sinus tract causing inflammation and secondary neurological impairment.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nSpinal epidermoid cyst or infected dermal sinus tract with associated tethered cord\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of a spinal epidermoid cyst or congenital dermal sinus with secondary infection and possible tethered cord, immediate management must prioritize reducing infection, preventing further neurological deterioration, and planning for definitive care. The patient's clinical presentation of skin changes, signs of local infection, and progressive neurological deficits indicate an urgent need for evaluation and intervention. While surgery is typically the definitive treatment to address the cyst and tethered cord, initial management in a primary care setting or outpatient could focus on stabilizing the infection with antibiotics and coordinating urgent neurosurgical consultation. Pharmacologically, antibiotics targeting common skin flora should be initiated to control the infection, along with symptomatic relief such as analgesics. Non-pharmacologic measures include close neurological monitoring, imaging studies (preferably MRI) to define the lesion, and advising the patient to limit activities that worsen symptoms until surgical intervention can be performed. This approach aims to prevent further neurological damage, reduce infectious burden, and facilitate timely definitive surgical management.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should initiate immediate consultation with a neurosurgeon to evaluate for urgent surgical intervention. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting skin and spinal infections (e.g., ceftriaxone or cefotaxime combined with metronidazole) should be started promptly to address the secondary infection. Pain management with acetaminophen or NSAIDs may be provided as needed. The patient should be advised to rest and avoid activities that exacerbate symptoms. Urgent MRI of the spine should be arranged to delineate the extent of the lesion, infection, and tethered cord. Close neurological monitoring should be maintained, and the patient must be counseled on the importance of prompt surgical management to prevent permanent neurological deficits."
