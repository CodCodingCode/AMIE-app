    "input": "THINKING:  \nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  \nJustification: The patient's developmental profile includes delayed motor milestones, limited speech with no clear words, and difficulties with social interactions such as inconsistent eye contact, limited gestures, and preference for solitary activities. She exhibits behaviors common in ASD, such as hypersensitivity to stimuli (looking at objects with interest but also appearing overwhelmed), difficulty following instructions, and social disengagement. These features align with the core criteria for ASD, which involve deficits in social communication and the presence of restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests. The persistent developmental delays across multiple domains further support this diagnosis.  \nChecklist:  \n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes  \n- No further clarification needed: Yes  \n\nANSWER:  \nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in this patient, the primary goals are to support development in social communication, reduce any distress or maladaptive behaviors, and facilitate integration into daily activities. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early intensive behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis) are foundational and should be initiated to target communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Speech therapy can be beneficial to promote language development, even if speech is limited, along with occupational therapy to address sensory sensitivities and motor delays. Structured routines, visual supports, and environmental modifications can help reduce sensory overload and promote engagement. Pharmacological treatment is not routinely first-line but may be considered if the patient exhibits significant irritability, hyperactivity, aggression, or anxiety that impairs functioning. In such cases, medications like risperidone or aripiprazole may be appropriate under specialist guidance to manage these symptoms. Overall, coordination with specialists such as developmental pediatricians, speech-language pathologists, and occupational therapists is essential to form a comprehensive, individualized care plan.\n\nANSWER: Initiate early intervention with behavioral therapy (e.g., ABA) to target communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors. Engage the patient in speech therapy to support language development, and involve occupational therapy to address sensory sensitivities and motor delays. Implement structured routines and visual supports at home and in educational settings to enhance understanding and reduce anxiety. Regular follow-up to monitor developmental progress and adjust interventions as needed. If behavioral dysregulation or distress becomes significant and impacts daily functioning, consider the cautious use of pharmacologic agents such as risperidone or aripiprazole, under specialist supervision, to manage symptoms like irritability or hyperactivity. Coordinate care with relevant specialists to ensure a multidisciplinary approach aimed at optimizing developmental outcomes."
