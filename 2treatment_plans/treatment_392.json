    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hepatocellular or cholestatic liver disease with decompensation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent hospitalization with supportive care and targeted management of underlying causes. Immediate actions include hospital admission for close monitoring, stabilization of hemodynamics, correction of electrolytes, and initiation of prophylactic antibiotics if infection is suspected. Long-term management involves collaboration with hepatology for etiology assessment, implementing dietary restrictions, and ongoing surveillance of liver function. Patient education will focus on recognizing warning signs, avoiding hepatotoxic substances, and adherence to treatment. Follow-up will be scheduled within 1-2 weeks post-discharge, with frequent laboratory assessments and clinical evaluations to monitor progress, aiming to prevent further decompensation and improve outcomes while minimizing complications.",
