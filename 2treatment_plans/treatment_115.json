    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Congestive Heart Failure with systemic congestion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiation of diuretics for rapid symptom relief, cautious use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs depending on tolerance, and lifestyle modifications such as salt and fluid restriction. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status, renal function, and electrolytes is essential, with follow-up within 48-72 hours to assess response. Education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes is vital, with involvement of family if appropriate. Coordination with cardiology and oncology specialists is necessary to address underlying mesothelioma and optimize overall care. This approach aims to alleviate systemic congestion, improve quality of life, prevent decompensation, and provide ongoing support tailored to the patient's complex medical context.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer IV loop diuretics; assess vital signs, labs, and oxygenation; initiate patient education.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization, optimize medication doses, and monitor for side effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Improve functional capacity, stabilize heart failure symptoms, and integrate oncological care.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include medication purpose and side effects, signs of worsening symptoms requiring immediate medical attention, dietary restrictions, and follow-up schedule.",
