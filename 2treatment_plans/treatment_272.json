The treatment plan includes initiating a topical prostaglandin analog, such as latanoprost 0.005% once nightly, to lower intraocular pressure effectively. Alongside pharmacologic therapy, thorough patient education on glaucoma, adherence importance, and regular follow-up is essential. Monitoring will involve reassessment of IOP, optic nerve health, and visual fields every 4-6 weeks initially, then at intervals of 3-6 months. The plan emphasizes addressing the patient's anxiety through reassurance, clear communication, and involving support systems. Additionally, referral to an ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma is important for ongoing management. This approach aims to preserve visual function, minimize side effects, and support patient well-being in the long term.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule comprehensive eye examination including baseline IOP, optic nerve assessment, and visual fields; initiate topical therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve target IOP reduction; educate patient on medication use and importance; address anxiety.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize IOP; monitor for disease progression; reinforce adherence; adjust treatment if necessary.\n- Patient handout summary: Include information about glaucoma, medication instructions, importance of follow-up, and contact information for questions.",
