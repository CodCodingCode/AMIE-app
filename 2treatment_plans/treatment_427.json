    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial invasive colitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empiric antimicrobial therapy with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 5\u20137 days, alongside aggressive rehydration with ORS or IV fluids based on dehydration severity. Supportive care emphasizes rest, adequate nutrition, and hygiene measures. I will closely monitor symptoms, hydration status, and any signs of complications through follow-up assessments within 48\u201372 hours. Patient education will focus on medication adherence, warning signs, and hygiene practices to prevent transmission. An infectious disease consultation is advisable if the patient deteriorates or fails to respond. This approach aims to resolve infection, prevent complications, and ensure a return to baseline functioning while minimizing risks such as dehydration or progression to peritonitis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start empiric antibiotics and rehydration; assess hydration and clinical stability.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom improvement, completion of antibiotics, hydration optimization.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitoring for recurrence, addressing any residual gastrointestinal issues, reinforcing hygiene education.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of medication adherence, signs of worsening, hydration tips, hygiene measures to prevent spread.",
