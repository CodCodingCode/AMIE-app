    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, supported by presentation and context, but needs confirmation of functional neurological disorder vs. medical causes. - Severity classification: Moderate \u2013 symptoms are acute but not life-threatening, more about distress and functional impairment. - Urgency level: Routine care with urgent evaluation to exclude life-threatening causes like hypocalcemia or cardiopulmonary issues. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Tetany (mentioned as the everyday gold standard diagnosis), anxiety/panic attacks, other neurological or metabolic causes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Education and reassurance, combined with addressing emotional factors. - Supporting evidence: Behavioral interventions and reassurance help reduce symptoms in functional neurological disorders. - Patient-specific considerations: Emotional amplification of symptoms; possible underlying anxiety; patient's information withholding style necessitates careful communication. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary medications unless specific indications arise; ensure no delay in medical workup.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not primarily indicated at this stage unless comorbid anxiety is confirmed. If needed, low-dose benzodiazepines may be cautiously considered short-term. - Rationale for selection: To mitigate acute anxiety if present, but should be used only briefly and with monitoring. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief may be seen within hours to days if anxiety-driven; functional neuro symptoms often require behavioral therapy. - Key side effects to monitor: Sedation, dependence risks with benzodiazepines. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: SSRI or SNRI if anxiety persists; refer to mental health specialist.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on symptom management and emotional regulation. - Patient education priorities: Clear explanation of functional neurological disorder, emphasizing that symptoms are real but not due to structural damage. - Lifestyle modifications: Stress reduction, adequate sleep, regular activity as tolerated. - Behavioral interventions: Mindfulness, stress management techniques, possibly referral to physical or occupational therapy focusing on functional skills.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess within 1-2 weeks to evaluate symptom progression and response. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom frequency/severity, emotional health status, adherence to therapy. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening neurological deficits, signs of metabolic destabilization, new physical findings requiring urgent investigation. - Treatment response assessment: Improved symptom control, reduced distress, or functional impairment.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use open, empathetic language that validates her experiences, providing information at a comfortable pace. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that symptoms are treatable and discuss the benign nature with reassurance. - Adherence strategies: Encourage active participation, provide written summaries, involve supportive persons if appropriate. - Family involvement: Offer education to family members if appropriate, respecting the patient's preferences.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology (to exclude other causes), mental health specialist (psychotherapy), possibly physiotherapy. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators, mental health therapists. - Community resources: Support groups for functional neurological disorders, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss access to therapy and services; explore coverage options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of functional neurological disorder with hyperventilation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes patient education to validate her experiences and reduce anxiety, behavioral therapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy to address underlying emotional factors, and reassurance that her symptoms are not due to structural neurological or metabolic disease. If indicated, short-term use of anxiolytics may be considered cautiously, but pharmacological treatment is secondary to behavioral interventions. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks is essential to monitor symptom progression and response. Additional referrals to neurology and mental health specialists will support ongoing management. Ensuring clear communication tailored to her information withholding style, involving supportive persons if appropriate, and providing educational resources will optimize adherence and outcomes. The goal is to reduce her symptoms, address underlying emotional factors, and restore functional well-being.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Reassure her, conduct a thorough neurological exam, evaluate for metabolic abnormalities (especially calcium levels), and explain the benign nature of functional symptoms. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate CBT, monitor symptom changes, and address any emerging psychological concerns. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduction in symptom frequency/severity, improve emotional coping, and reinforce functional improvements. - Patient handout summary: Include information about functional neurological disorder, stress management tips, reassurance that symptoms are treatable, and instructions for follow-up.
