    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Branchial cleft cyst (likely a second branchial cleft cyst)\nJustification: The patient's long-standing lateral neck lump near the lower neck that intermittently enlarges, becomes tender, and discharges material through a small hole is characteristic of a congenital branchial cleft cyst. The cyst often presents in young to middle-aged adults, especially if infected or inflamed. The intermittent nasal stuffiness and voice changes are likely incidental or related to minor mucosal issues and not directly connected. The absence of systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats makes malignancy less likely. The lack of neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness) suggests the lesion is not involving nearby nerves. The history and presentation strongly support a congenital cyst that has become inflamed or infected periodically and may require surgical excision.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nBranchial cleft cyst END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of a likely second branchial cleft cyst that has a history of intermittent enlargement, tenderness, and episodic discharge, the primary management goal is definitive treatment to prevent recurrent infections and resolve the cyst. While conservative measures such as antibiotic therapy may help in the acute infected episodes, definitive management generally involves surgical excision of the cyst and any associated tract, which is typically performed by an ENT specialist or surgeon familiar with head and neck anatomy. Non-pharmacological interventions such as warm compresses can provide symptom relief during infection but do not resolve the underlying issue. Pharmacologically, antibiotics may be indicated if there is active infection, but they do not replace surgical removal. Education on the nature of the lesion and the importance of referral for surgical excision are essential, especially since the cyst has been symptomatic over a long period.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include a referral to an ENT surgeon or head and neck surgeon for definitive surgical excision of the branchial cleft cyst. In the interim, if there is active infection or discharge, an empiric course of oral antibiotics targeting common pathogens (such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or similar) can be initiated to reduce inflammation and discharge. Warm compresses and analgesics can be used for symptomatic relief. The primary care physician or psychiatrist should educate the patient regarding the nature of the cyst, the importance of surgical removal, and ensure timely follow-up with the specialist to coordinate definitive management. Antibiotic therapy should be used cautiously and temporarily, pending surgical intervention."
