The treatment plan includes initiating low-dose stimulant therapy, such as modafinil, to manage episodic hypersomnia, alongside non-pharmacological sleep hygiene practices and regular monitoring. Initial management focuses on symptom control while establishing ongoing evaluation to assess efficacy and side effects. Follow-up care will include scheduled visits every 4 weeks, symptom tracking, and patient education emphasizing adherence and recognition of potential complications. This approach aims to improve quality of life and functional capacity, with considerations to minimize medication risks and incorporate supportive behavioral interventions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate patient about KLS, discuss treatment options, and initiate modafinil at 100 mg once daily.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for symptom improvement and side effects; reinforce sleep hygiene.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stabilization of episode frequency and severity; optimize medication dose as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize episodes, adhere to medication and sleep routines, report new or severe symptoms promptly.",
