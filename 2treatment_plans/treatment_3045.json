    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Vertebrobasilar Migraine (also known as Basilar-type Migraine)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of a six-week history of worsening throbbing headache localized at the back of the head, accompanied by visual disturbances (flickering or spots), dizziness, imbalance, and occassional vomiting aligns with migrainous phenomena, particularly a migraine with aura. The visual symptoms are variable and episodic, consistent with aura. The absence of neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or speech disturbances reduces suspicion for stroke or transient ischemic attack. The symptoms are exacerbated by movement or strain, and there are no systemic risk factors for vascular disease, making a migraine higher on the differential. While other possibilities such as posterior circulation ischemia or a mass lesion could cause similar symptoms, the pattern and episodic nature lean toward migraine. The chronicity and variability suggest a primary headache disorder rather than a secondary or structural cause.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nVertebrobasilar Migraine\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of likely Vertebrobasilar Migraine, the primary goals are to reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of attacks while ensuring there are no underlying secondary causes. Non-pharmacological strategies such as identifying and avoiding potential triggers (e.g., stress, lack of sleep, certain foods) are fundamental. Stress management techniques, regular sleep hygiene, and maintaining a headache diary can help identify patterns and triggers. Pharmacologically, acute attack management can involve triptans or NSAIDs, provided there are no contraindications, to relieve symptoms during episodes. For prophylaxis, medications such as calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil) or other migraine preventive agents (e.g., topiramate, propranolol) are potential options, especially if attacks are frequent or severely impact quality of life. It's important to monitor for side effects and effectiveness to tailor treatment. Given the complexity of vertebrobasilar migraines and potential overlap with other conditions, ongoing assessment and patient education are essential.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with patient education about migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications, including regular sleep, hydration, stress reduction, and avoiding known precipitants. Initiate acute relief with NSAIDs or triptans during attacks, assuming no contraindications such as cardiovascular disease. For prophylaxis, consider starting a calcium channel blocker like verapamil, titrated gradually to prevent frequent episodes. Evaluate the patient's response over several weeks, adjusting medications as necessary. Advise maintaining a headache diary to monitor frequency and severity of attacks. Also, schedule follow-up to assess symptom progression, medication efficacy, and tolerability, and to rule out any secondary causes if symptoms change or worsen."
