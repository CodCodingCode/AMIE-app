    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: The diagnosis of conjunctivitis secondary to minor ocular trauma is plausible given the recent injury and ocular symptoms. I am reasonably certain but should confirm there's no other cause like infection or foreign body. Severity appears mild to moderate, based on symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling without signs of vision loss or significant pain. The situation does not seem emergent but warrants prompt attention. Urgency level is routine care with prompt follow-up; no immediate emergency needed unless complications arise. Differentials include bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or corneal abrasion. Still, trauma history supports this diagnosis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment involves symptomatic relief and prevention of secondary infection. Supporting evidence indicates that conservative management with lubricants and topical antibiotics when necessary is appropriate for minor trauma-related conjunctivitis. Patient-specific considerations include ensuring no contraindications to medications and assessing their ability to adhere to treatment. Avoid steroids initially unless inflammation persists and is severe, as they can mask infections.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (e.g., preservative-free lubricating drops, up to every 1-2 hours as needed). Rationale: To soothe the eye and maintain lubrication, promoting healing. Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 24-48 hours; full resolution in about a week. Key side effects to monitor: Hyperemia or irritation from drops, rare allergic reactions. Backup options if signs of bacterial infection develop: Topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin ointment twice daily).  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid rubbing the eyes, wear protective eyewear during sports, maintain hand hygiene to prevent secondary infection. Patient education priorities: Recognize worsening symptoms such as increased pain, vision changes, or discharge. Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid eye irritants; use protective gear during sports. Behavioral interventions: Gentle eyelid hygiene if needed and proper use of medications.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 48 hours if symptoms worsen, otherwise at 1 week if symptoms improve. Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, signs of secondary infection, or worsening redness/swelling. Red flag symptoms: Severe pain, vision changes, purulent discharge, or signs of corneal involvement\u2014seek urgent care. Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution and absence of increasing redness or discomfort.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Communication approach: Use simple, clear language, repeat key points, and verify understanding verbally. Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that symptoms often improve quickly and that prompt care prevents complications. Adherence strategies: Use written instructions, demonstrate eye drop use, and emphasize importance of follow-up. Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family members to aid in medication administration and observations.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Specialist referrals needed: None immediately, unless there is concern for corneal injury or no improvement after initial management. Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff to reinforce care instructions and monitor symptoms. Community resources: Provide educational materials on eye safety, and consider eye care support if recurrent issues. Insurance/cost considerations: Prescribe affordable options; ensure access to necessary supplies.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctivitis likely secondary to minor ocular trauma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes using preservative-free artificial tears for symptomatic relief, instructing the patient on proper eye hygiene, and avoiding rubbing the eyes. Close follow-up in 48 hours is essential to assess for improvement or any signs of complication. The patient should be educated about warning signs such as increased pain, vision changes, or purulent discharge, and advised to seek urgent care if these occur. Additional measures include protecting the eyes during activity, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding self-medication unless directed. This approach aims to promote healing, minimize discomfort, prevent secondary infection, and ensure timely identification of any complications. Initial management focuses on symptomatic relief and watchful waiting, with plans for follow-up in 1 week to confirm resolution. The overall goal is to achieve symptom resolution within a few days to a week while maintaining eye health and preventing further injury or infection.",
