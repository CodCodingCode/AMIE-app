    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation and initial clinica\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision with wide margins, confirmation of diagnosis via biopsy, and consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy based on tumor grade and staging. Initial management focuses on establishing histopathological diagnosis, planning surgical resection, and addressing systemic symptoms. Long-term strategies involve regular follow-up with physical exams and imaging to monitor for recurrence, along with supportive care. This approach aims to maximize tumor control, preserve function, and improve prognosis while minimizing risks, side effects, and ensuring patient understanding and adherence.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent biopsy and consult multidisciplinary team including orthopedic oncology.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete staging workup, finalize surgical plan, initiate supportive measures for systemic symptoms.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete tumor resection, commence adjuvant therapy if indicated, and establish ongoing surveillance.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of prompt treatment, steps involved in care, signs of recurrence, and contact information for questions or emergencies.",
