    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The clinical presentation of long-standing and progressively worsening neurological symptoms\u2014including movement difficulties, vision problems such as blurry vision and flickering, transient visual disturbances, and fatigue\u2014are characteristic of a demyelinating process affecting the central nervous system. The episodes of transient visual changes are typical of optic neuritis, which is common in MS. The absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss, lack of family history, and no evidence of acute infections support a diagnosis of MS. The combination of optic and motor pathway involvement, along with the episodic nature of some symptoms, aligns well with MS pathology.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, the treatment approach should aim to modify the disease course, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the cornerstone for reducing relapse frequency and delaying progression, and they should be initiated ideally under the guidance of a neurologist. Non-pharmacological strategies such as physical therapy can help maintain mobility and function, while addressing fatigue and other symptoms. Symptom management may include corticosteroids during relapses to reduce inflammation and acute deficits. Patient education about disease progression, lifestyle modifications, and support services are also essential components. Initiating DMTs early and providing comprehensive supportive care are integral to optimal management.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should refer the patient to a neurologist with expertise in MS for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of disease-modifying therapy. In the meantime, start symptomatic management with corticosteroids, such as a short course of oral or IV methylprednisolone during acute relapses if indicated. Encourage the patient to participate in physical and occupational therapy to address mobility and functional issues. Education about symptom monitoring and avoiding heat exposure, which can worsen symptoms, is important. Additionally, monitor for common MS symptoms like fatigue, spasticity, and bladder or bowel dysfunction, and initiate symptomatic treatments as appropriate (e.g., antispasticity agents, bladder management strategies). Regular follow-up is essential to assess disease progression, treatment response, and support needs."
