    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes failure to thrive, hypotonia (\"floppy\" posture), vomiting, lethargy, and abnormal movements such as stiffness and twitching. These symptoms are characteristic of a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the brainstem and basal ganglia, which are typical sites involved in Leigh syndrome. The worsening of symptoms during illness or fasting suggests a metabolic decompensation, common in mitochondrial disorders like Leigh syndrome. The absence of fever or infectious symptoms points toward a non-infectious, metabolic or genetic etiology. Given the combination of developmental delay, neurological findings, and episodic deterioration, Leigh syndrome is highly probable.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nLeigh syndrome END",
    "output": "THINKING: Leigh syndrome is a progressive mitochondrial disorder with no cure, but management focuses on supportive care, preventing metabolic decompensation, and addressing specific symptoms. The child's presentation indicates the need for prompt stabilization to prevent deterioration. Given the metabolic nature of the disorder, it is crucial to avoid fasting and ensure adequate caloric intake, particularly during illness or stress. Supportive interventions include nutritional optimization with high-calorie, easy-to-digest feeds and supplementation with mitochondrial cofactors such as coenzyme Q10, B vitamins (particularly B1/thiamine), and L-carnitine, which may support mitochondrial function. Monitoring and managing neurological symptoms, such as seizure activity, is also important. Additionally, coordinating care with specialists in neurology, genetics, and metabolic diseases is essential for comprehensive management. Safety measures to prevent aspiration and injury should be emphasized, and close clinical follow-up is necessary to monitor disease progression and symptom management.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should prioritize immediate stabilization by ensuring adequate nutritional intake, avoiding fasting, and providing supportive care to prevent metabolic crises. Initiate supplement therapy with mitochondrial cofactors such as coenzyme Q10, B-complex vitamins (especially thiamine), and L-carnitine, after consultation with a metabolic specialist. Maintain hydration and monitor for signs of neurological deterioration or seizures, treating seizures with appropriate antiepileptic medications if they occur. Ensure that the child's environment is safe, and consider involving multidisciplinary teams including neurology, nutrition, and genetic counseling for ongoing management. Regular follow-up should focus on nutritional status, neurological function, and early detection of metabolic decompensation. In cases of acute deterioration, urgent hospitalization may be required for IV hydration, supportive care, and further metabolic assessment."
