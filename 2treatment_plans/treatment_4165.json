    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Convergence Insufficiency\nJustification: The patient's history of eye fatigue, soreness, occasional double or blurry vision, and difficulty concentrating, especially during sustained close-up activities like reading and screen use, aligns with symptoms typical of convergence insufficiency. The fact that symptoms improve with distance viewing suggests that the issue stems from difficulty maintaining proper eye alignment during near tasks. The presence since childhood indicates a chronic but potentially correctable binocular vision disorder rather than a recent degenerative process. The recent eye exam not noting specific refractive errors or ocular pathology further supports a functional binocular coordination issue rather than structural eye disease.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nConvergence Insufficiency END",
    "output": "THINKING: Convergence insufficiency is a binocular vision disorder characterized by the difficulty maintaining proper eye alignment during near tasks, leading to symptoms such as eye fatigue, soreness, double or blurry vision, and difficulty concentrating. Since the patient has a longstanding history and recent eye exam ruling out other ocular pathology, treatment focusing on improving convergence function is appropriate. Evidence-based treatments typically include non-pharmacological approaches such as vision therapy or orthoptic exercises to strengthen convergence ability. While pharmacological options are limited for convergence insufficiency individually, ensuring optimal refractive correction and addressing any accommodative issues can support symptoms. Given the chronic nature and the patient\u2019s symptom pattern, a conservative, functional approach with vision therapy is preferred, often initiated through a referral to a trained orthoptist or optometrist specializing in vision therapy, if available. In the primary care or psychiatric setting, recommending structured vision exercises, along with proper ergonomic modifications during near work (such as taking regular breaks and ensuring proper lighting), can help manage symptoms. If symptoms persist despite conservative measures, further referral for specialized optometric therapy should be considered.\n\nANSWER: The primary management should involve recommending regular, structured convergence exercises\u2014such as pencil push-ups or computer-based vision therapy programs\u2014aimed at strengthening convergence control. The patient should be advised to take frequent breaks during near tasks (e.g., the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) and ensure optimal ergonomics, including proper lighting and screen distance. If available, referring to an optometrist or orthoptist for formal vision therapy would be ideal. Pharmacological treatment is not typically indicated for convergence insufficiency, so no medications are necessary at this time. Continuous monitoring and follow-up should be arranged to assess symptom improvement and adjust therapy as needed."
