    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The initial focus should be on starting methotrexate 15 mg weekly, with close monitoring of liver function, blood counts, and renal status, aiming for symptom improvement within 4-6 weeks. Physical therapy to maintain joint function and patient education on disease and medication adherence are essential components. Follow-up will occur every 4-6 weeks initially to assess response and side effects, transitioning to longer intervals as stability improves. The plan includes early rheumatology referral to optimize disease control and prevent joint damage. The goal is to achieve symptom relief, prevent progression, and improve quality of life while minimizing adverse effects. Clear communication tailored to the patient's preferences will be used to ensure understanding and adherence.",
