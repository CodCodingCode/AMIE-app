Initial management includes urgent neuroimaging to confirm stroke type, assessment for thrombolytic therapy if within the appropriate window, and stabilization of vital functions. Once stabilized, initiating anticoagulation\u2014such as warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant\u2014aims to prevent further embolic events, with consideration of antiplatelet therapy if anticoagulation is contraindicated initially. Supportive measures involve blood pressure control, lipid management, and lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and diet changes. Rehabilitation services should be engaged early to maximize neurological recovery. Follow-up will include frequent reassessment of neurological status, INR monitoring if anticoagulated, and evaluation for underlying cardiac or paradoxical embolic sources.

Coordination with neurology, cardiology, and rehabilitation teams will be essential to ensure comprehensive care and secondary prevention, aiming to minimize recurrent stroke risk and optimize functional recovery.",
