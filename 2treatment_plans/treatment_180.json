    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High confidence based on typical presentation of viral conjunctivitis with redness, tearing, and recent onset after activity. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate; symptoms are recent, primarily ocular redness, tearing, without severe pain, visual impairment, or precluding daily activities. - Urgency level: Routine care; no signs of vision loss or significant ocular trauma requiring urgent referral. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, foreign body, or other causes if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive management\u2014artificial tears, education about natural course. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, and symptomatic relief along with infection control practices is the standard. - Patient-specific considerations: No known allergies, baseline health appears stable. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection suspected; caution with eye rubbing to prevent trauma.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: None routinely; artificial tears for comfort, possibly artificial lubricants. - Rationale for selection: Symptom relief without side effects, supportive care, avoids unnecessary medication. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically resolve in 7-14 days. - Key side effects to monitor: None significant with artificial tears; if using topical medications, watch for allergic reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topical antihistamines if allergic component suspected; antibiotics if bacterial infection is confirmed.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing eyes, no sharing towels or pillows. - Patient education priorities: Explain viral nature, contagiousness, importance of hygiene, avoid contact sports until symptoms resolve. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, avoid eye irritants, discontinue contact lens use until fully recovered. - Behavioral interventions: Proper handwashing techniques, avoid close contact to minimize spread.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 5-7 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual changes, signs of worsening infection. - Red flag symptoms: Visual impairment, severe pain, photophobia, recurrence, or symptoms worsening significantly. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in redness, tearing, and discomfort within expected timeline.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation of condition, emphasizing self-limiting nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about prognosis, address worries about contagion, clarify when to seek urgent care. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions, emphasize hygiene steps, dispel misconceptions. - Family involvement: Advise on minimizing audience in shared spaces, educate family members on hygiene practices.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Usually none; refer to ophthalmologist if symptoms worsen or visual changes occur. - Other healthcare team members: Primarily patient education; no immediate consultation needed. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about viral conjunctivitis, support groups if relevant. - Insurance/cost considerations: Cost-effective initial management with reassurance; consider follow-up costs if complications develop.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive measures such as artificial tears, diligent hygiene practices, and patient education about the contagious nature of the condition and symptomatic self-care. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and infection control, with routine follow-up in 5-7 days to monitor resolution. Long-term management emphasizes prevention of spread and recognition of red flags warranting immediate attention. Follow-up care will include symptom assessment and instructions for when to seek urgent care. This approach is designed to promote spontaneous recovery, minimize complications, prevent transmission, and ensure patient understanding and adherence, while avoiding unnecessary medications and interventions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about the condition, instruct on hygiene practices, recommend artificial tears. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptomatic improvement; prevent spread; monitor for worsening symptoms. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete resolution of symptoms; reinforce hygiene education; prevent future episodes. - Patient handout summary: \"Viral conjunctivitis is contagious but self-limiting. Use artificial tears for comfort, practice good hand hygiene, avoid eye rubbing, and refrain from contact sports until symptoms resolve. Seek care if vision changes or pain develops.\"",
