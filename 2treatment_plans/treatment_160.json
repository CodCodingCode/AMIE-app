    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the clinical presentation of rectal blee\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating neoadjuvant chemoradiation if indicated, followed by surgical resection, with tailored adjuvant therapy based on pathological staging. Initial management focuses on urgent evaluation, staging, and planning for surgery and/or systemic therapy, while establishing a multidisciplinary team approach for long-term management. Follow-up care will include regular imaging and tumor marker assessments, symptom monitoring, and supportive care, with clear instructions to the patient regarding symptom recognition. This approach aims to maximize treatment efficacy, improve prognosis, and maintain quality of life, while carefully monitoring for potential complications and side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging (CT scan), schedule biopsy if not already done, and refer to surgical oncology.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete staging, initiate chemoradiation if feasible, and prepare for surgical planning.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve complete tumor resection, establish adjuvant therapy as indicated, and initiate follow-up protocols.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of treatment adherence, symptom monitoring, nutritional support, and regular follow-up appointments.",
