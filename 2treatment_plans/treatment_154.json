    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop the treatment approach for orthostatic hypotension. While hyperkalaemia is noted as the gold standard diagnosis, the patient's symptoms of dizziness upon p\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes lifestyle modifications such as increasing fluid and salt intake, gradual positional changes, and compression stockings if appropriate, with careful attention to the patient's overall health status and potential underlying causes. Initial management focuses on immediate non-pharmacologic interventions to stabilize blood pressure and reduce dizziness episodes while establishing long-term strategies to prevent falls and improve symptoms. Follow-up care will include periodic blood pressure monitoring, symptom assessment, and evaluation of underlying contributing factors, with clear instructions for the patient regarding safety precautions and symptom reporting. This approach is designed to improve orthostatic tolerance, minimize fall risk, and enhance functional status while avoiding complications like volume overload or adverse medication effects.",
