    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of sepsis secondary to bacterial infection with confirmed bacteraemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt empiric intravenous antibiotics, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and supportive care aligned with evidence-based guidelines. Initial management should prioritize stabilization through early IV fluids, monitoring vital signs, and starting broad-spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam. Supportive measures include oxygen therapy if indicated, close ICU monitoring, and regular reassessment of clinical and laboratory parameters. The patient and family should be educated about the seriousness of sepsis, signs of deterioration, and the importance of adherence to treatment and follow-up. Coordination with infectious disease specialists, nursing staff, and other healthcare providers will facilitate optimal recovery. Long-term goals include monitoring for infection resolution, preventing complications, and ensuring appropriate outpatient follow-up to confirm clinical stability.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics, start IV fluids (e.g., 30 ml/kg isotonic crystalloid bolus), monitor vitals continuously, draw blood cultures, and evaluate organ function.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve infection control, stabilize vital signs, and prevent complications; monitor labs regularly.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antibiotic course, prevent recurrent infections, and restore functional health.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of timely treatment, signs of worsening condition, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments.",
