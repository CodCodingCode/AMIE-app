    "output": "THINKING: The primary diagnosis provided is preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, not verrucous squamous cell carcinoma; the latter appears to be a separate prior diagnosis and not the current presentation. The patient's recent onset of eye redness, swelling, and tearing after playing soccer suggests an infectious process likely due to local skin trauma. The severity seems mild to moderate given the short duration and absence of systemic symptoms or visual changes. Immediate urgent care is warranted to prevent progression, especially since orbital cellulitis must be differentiated and ruled out. Differential considerations include bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or a skin abscess.  Evidence-based management involves prompt antimicrobial therapy, supportive care, and close follow-up. Antibiotics targeting common pathogens (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species) are first-line. Since preseptal cellulitis typically responds well to antibiotics without hospitalization unless signs of orbital involvement or systemic illness develop, outpatient management is preferred with strict monitoring. Further assessment should include checking for visual acuity, eye motility, and signs of orbital cellulitis to rule out more serious complications.  THINKING: Based on the above, I will develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes antibiotic therapy, supportive care, patient education, close follow-up, and coordination with ophthalmology if needed someday.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating empirical oral antibiotics targeting common causative bacteria, supportive measures such as cold compresses, and patient education about symptom monitoring. Careful attention will be paid to identifying any signs of orbital cellulitis or systemic illness that warrant immediate intervention. Initial management focuses on prompt antimicrobial therapy and symptom relief while establishing vigilant follow-up to ensure resolution and prevent complications. Follow-up care will include close monitoring of symptom progression, visual acuity, and signs of orbital extension, with clear instructions for the patient regarding warning signs prompting urgent care. This approach is designed to promote rapid resolution, minimize risks of progression, and ensure safe, effective recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Prescribe empiric oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily or doxycycline if allergy present), advise cold compress application, and educate the patient about monitoring symptoms. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess response to antibiotics, ensure reduction of swelling and redness, and exclude signs of orbital cellulitis. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antibiotic course, monitor for any recurrent or residual skin issues, and reinforce hygiene and injury prevention. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, signs of worsening (visual changes, eye pain, fever), importance of follow-up, and preventive skin care after trauma.",
