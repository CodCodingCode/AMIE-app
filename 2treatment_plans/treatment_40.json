    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given typical presentation with bila\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of other specified mumps (viral parotitis), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive care with analgesics and hydration, patient education on disease course and contagiousness, and symptomatic monitoring. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and infection control, while establishing follow-up to assess for resolution or complications. Follow-up care will include reassessment in 3-7 days, with instructions to seek immediate care if neurological or severe systemic symptoms develop. This approach aims to ensure symptom resolution, prevent spread, and provide reassurance to the patient and family, while monitoring for potential complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Advise on hydration, administer age-appropriate analgesics, and educate on disease transmission precautions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom progression, ensure symptom improvement, and maintain isolation until contagious period ends.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm complete recovery, prevent secondary infections, and discuss vaccination if not previously immunized.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize supportive care, contagiousness, and when to seek urgent medical attention.",
