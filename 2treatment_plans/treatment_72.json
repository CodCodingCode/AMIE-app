This should be combined with appropriate pain management, eye protection measures if necessary, and close neurological and ophthalmologic monitoring. The patient should be reassessed within one week to evaluate symptom progression and recovery, with ongoing follow-up to monitor for residual deficits or complications. Educate the patient on medication adherence, potential side effects, and warning signs requiring immediate evaluation. Consider referral to specialists if neurological deficits worsen or persist, and involve supportive therapies as needed. This comprehensive plan aims to minimize nerve damage, improve functional recovery, and avert permanent sequelae.",
