    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate confidence; clinical features sugges\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis with concerning features, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt diagnostic biopsy or surgical excision with patient-centered communication and follow-up. The main intervention is to obtain a biopsy to exclude verrucous squamous cell carcinoma, followed by complete excision if the biopsy confirms benign seborrheic keratosis. Emphasis will be placed on educating the patient about the necessity of histopathology, skin protection, and monitoring for changes. The plan aims to ensure definitive diagnosis, minimize malignant risk, and address patient concerns while facilitating timely follow-up.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule a biopsy or excisional procedure with dermatology; explain the need for tissue sampling.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Obtain biopsy results; if benign, consider no further intervention; if malignant, plan appropriate oncologic management.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor skin periodically for new or changing lesions; reinforce sun protection.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about skin lesion changes, importance of biopsy, follow-up schedule, and sun safety reminders.",
