    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given recent-onset symptoms consistent with viral meningitis, confirmed enteroviral etiology. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe due to presence of neck stiffness, systemic symptoms (vomiting), ocular symptoms, and potential risk of increased intracranial pressure. - Urgency level: Immediate, as the patient exhibits signs that warrant urgent evaluation and management to prevent complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial meningitis (which requires urgent antibiotics), other neuro-inflammatory conditions, or ocular pathology.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care and symptomatic management; antiviral therapy not standard for enteroviral meningitis. - Supporting evidence: Viral meningitis is typically self-limiting; supportive care with hydration, analgesics, and close monitoring suffices. - Patient-specific considerations: Young adult female; no mention of immunosuppression; ocular symptoms warrant careful assessment. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary antibiotics; monitor for signs of bacterial superinfection or neurological deterioration.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 650-1000 mg every 6 hours for headache and fever; consider analgesics for ocular pain if appropriate. - Rationale for selection: Effective for symptom relief; minimal side effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 48-72 hours with supportive care. - Key side effects to monitor: Hepatotoxicity at higher doses; ensure dosing within safe limits. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), with caution regarding gastrointestinal or renal side effects.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERventions: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Rest, adequate hydration, and avoidance of bright lights or ocular strain. - Patient education priorities: Nature of viral meningitis, expected course, warning signs, importance of follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity until symptoms resolve; maintain hydration. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management through relaxation techniques if anxiety is significant.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours; more urgent if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, neurological status, signs of increased ICP, ocular changes. - Red flag symptoms: Persistent or worsening headache, new neurological deficits, altered mental status, recurrent vomiting. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution, ability to perform daily activities, no new neurological signs.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, straightforward explanation emphasizing the benign nature of viral meningitis and expected recovery. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about symptom duration, clarify when to seek urgent care. - Adherence strategies: Explain importance of follow-up, medication adherence, and monitoring. - Family involvement: Encourage family support and awareness of warning signs requiring prompt medical attention.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurosurgery or infectious disease consultation if neurological status deteriorates. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care follow-up, ophthalmology if ocular symptoms persist. - Community resources: Educational materials on viral meningitis, support groups if anxiety is significant. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure access to symptomatic medications, arrange affordable follow-up.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive symptomatic care with close monitoring. The key interventions include administering acetaminophen for symptom relief, ensuring adequate hydration, and advising rest. Carefully observe for signs of neurological deterioration, increased intracranial pressure, or secondary bacterial infection. Educate the patient on symptom expectations, warning signs, and when to seek urgent care. Follow-up should be scheduled within 48-72 hours to assess clinical improvement and address any concerns. This plan aims to facilitate recovery, minimize complications, and provide reassurance tailored to the patient's baseline demeanor. Immediate actions include providing symptomatic medications and arranging close follow-up, with short-term goals of symptom resolution and long-term management focusing on complete recovery and patient education.",
