    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the clinical presentation of sudden redness, swelling, tearing after trauma, consistent with conjunctival hemorrhage. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as conjunctival hemorrhage typically appears as localized red patching without vision impairment unless associated with globe injury. - Urgency level: Urgent evaluation recommended to rule out globe rupture or other serious ocular injuries, especially given recent trauma. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion, intraocular injury, or rupture need to be ruled out.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation for isolated conjunctival hemorrhage; reassurance and protective measures. - Supporting evidence: Conjunctival hemorrhage is usually benign and self-limited; treatment focuses on symptom relief. - Patient-specific considerations: Given recent trauma, careful examination to exclude other injuries is essential. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary ocular pressure or manipulations; monitor for signs of more serious injury.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: No specific medications required for isolated conjunctival hemorrhage; artificial tears for comfort if needed. - Rationale for selection: These help soothe ocular surface irritation without risk. - Expected timeline for improvement: Usually resolves within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: None specific, but watch for worsening pain, vision changes, or signs of infection. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None necessary, unless secondary infection develops.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid rubbing the eye, protect eyes from further trauma, and limiting strenuous activity. - Patient education priorities: Importance of avoiding eye trauma, recognizing signs of worsening injury, and not using any topical medications unless prescribed. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest and avoid activities that could cause re-injury. - Behavioral interventions: Educate on eye protection during sports; consider eye guards if engaging in contact sports.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-7 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Resolution of redness/swelling, absence of pain, worsening visual symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Increasing pain, vision loss, persistent or expanding hemorrhage, signs of globe rupture (e.g., teardrop-shaped pupils, decreased visual acuity). - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and clinical examination confirming resolution.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language with visual aids if possible; involve storytelling to make explanations engaging. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure that most eye bleeds resolve on their own while emphasizing safety and when to seek urgent care. - Adherence strategies: Encourage eye protection and follow-up visits; provide written instructions. - Family involvement: Involve family if appropriate to reinforce care points and safety measures.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if there is suspicion of globe rupture, intraocular injury, or persistent symptoms beyond expected. - Other healthcare team members: None initially, but consider school or sports safety consultations. - Community resources: Provide informational materials about eye safety during sports. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure cost-effective follow-up plans and disposable eye protection if recommended.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctival hemorrhage secondary to trauma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines observation with preventive education. Management primarily involves reassurance, avoiding eye rubbing, and protecting the eye from further injury, with artificial tears to alleviate discomfort if needed. The focus is on careful examination to exclude more severe injury, followed by close follow-up within 3-7 days to ensure resolution. Patient education emphasizes injury prevention, recognizing warning signs, and proper eye safety during sports. If symptoms worsen or if there is concern for globe rupture, urgent ophthalmology referral is necessary. This approach aims for symptom resolution within 1-2 weeks, with minimal risk, fostering patient understanding and safety.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Conduct a thorough eye exam to confirm isolated hemorrhage, reassure the patient, and provide protective eye instructions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for symptom improvement, ensure no development of complications, and reinforce eye protection during activities. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through education on trauma prevention; reassess ocular health if new symptoms emerge. - Patient handout summary: \"Protect your eye, avoid rubbing, watch for worsening symptoms, and follow up as scheduled.\"",
