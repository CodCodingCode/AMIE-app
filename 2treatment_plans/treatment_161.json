    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based immunosuppressive therapy with careful patient monitoring, education, and support. The initial focus should be on urgent induction of remission with high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone) along with rituximab for targeted immune suppression. This approach aims to rapidly control systemic and skin manifestations, prevent organ damage, and achieve remission. Long-term management will include tapering steroids, transitioning to maintenance immunosuppression such as azathioprine or methotrexate, and regular follow-up to monitor for relapse and side effects.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV methylprednisolone infusion, arrange for rituximab infusion, and obtain baseline labs (CBC, renal/liver function, ANCA titers, imaging if indicated). Educate the patient on signs of infection and side effects.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe for clinical improvement, adjust medications as needed, and monitor labs closely.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve sustained remission, minimize steroid dose, and address any disease-related complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of medication adherence, infection prevention, regular follow-up, and promptly reporting new or worsening symptoms.",
