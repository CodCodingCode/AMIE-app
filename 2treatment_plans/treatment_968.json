    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; symptoms of redness, swelling, tearing after activity could indicate conjunctivitis or trauma, but patient\u2019s history of malignancy suggests metastasis must be ruled out rapidly.  \n- Severity classification: Moderate; symptoms have been present for 2 days with swelling and redness, but no mention of vision loss or severe pain.  \n- Urgency level: Urgent; given history of malignancy, metastasis to ocular structures cannot be excluded, requiring prompt evaluation.  \n- Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Malignant ocular involvement, infectious conjunctivitis, trauma-related injury, or secondary infection.  \n  \nNow I\u2019ll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines.  \n- First-line treatment per guidelines: Emergency ophthalmologic evaluation to exclude intraocular or ocular metastasis, followed by symptomatic management if conjunctivitis or trauma is confirmed.  \n- Supporting evidence: Rapid assessment prevents potential vision loss or progression of underlying malignancy; topical antibiotics or steroids are used for conjunctivitis or trauma respectively but require proper diagnosis.  \n- Patient-specific considerations: Patient has known malignancy, so any ocular symptoms warrant thorough examination to exclude metastasis. Symptomatic treatment should be cautious until evaluation.  \n- Contraindications or cautions: Avoid empirical steroid use without proper diagnosis, especially in the context of possible infectious or malignant causes.  \n  \nPharmacological interventions:  \n- Primary medication choice: None initiated without ophthalmologic assessment. If bacterial conjunctivitis confirmed: topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin ointment). If trauma with inflammation: possible corticosteroid eye drops under specialist guidance.  \n- Rationale for selection: Medications depend on definitive diagnosis; empiric antibiotics are standard for bacterial conjunctivitis but should be confirmed.  \n- Expected timeline for improvement: 2\u20133 days if bacterial conjunctivitis; trauma-related symptoms should improve with appropriate management within days.  \n- Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions, increased intraocular pressure, worsening pain or vision changes.  \n- Alternative medications if first-line fails: Different antibiotics or corticosteroids as per ophthalmologic consultation.  \n  \nNon-pharmacological interventions:  \n- Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid touching or rubbing eyes, maintain eye hygiene, and protect eyes from irritants.  \n- Patient education priorities: Symptoms to watch (vision changes, worsening pain, persistent redness), importance of prompt evaluation.  \n- Lifestyle modifications: Avoid strenuous activity if advised, and ensure adequate rest and hydration.  \n- Behavioral interventions: Stress the importance of follow-up and adherence to ophthalmologic recommendations.  \n  \nMonitoring & follow-up strategy:  \n- Follow-up timeline: Immediate ophthalmology referral, with reassessment in 24\u201348 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen.  \n- Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, visual acuity, ocular examination findings.  \n- Red flag symptoms: Vision loss, severe pain, increasing redness, or signs of systemic illness.  \n- Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution or stabilization, repeat examination findings.  \n  \nPatient communication strategy:  \n- Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation of need for urgent ophthalmologic assessment; reassure that symptoms are being taken seriously.  \n- Addressing patient concerns: Explain that current symptoms require prompt evaluation to exclude serious causes such as metastasis, and that diagnostic clarity guides treatment.  \n- Adherence strategies: Stress the importance of follow-up appointments and warning signs for immediate care.  \n- Family involvement: Encourage involving a trusted person to assist with transport and support.  \n  \nCoordination & referrals:  \n- Specialist referrals needed: Immediate referral to ophthalmology or ocular oncology specialist for comprehensive examination.  \n- Other healthcare team members: Coordinate with primary care, oncology team, and possibly radiology for imaging if metastasis suspected.  \n- Community resources: Provide educational materials about eye health and support groups for cancer patients.  \n- Insurance/cost considerations: Confirm appointment coverage; assist with appointment scheduling and transportation if needed.\nANSWER: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:   - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmologic evaluation; instruct the patient to avoid touching or rubbing the eye, and to seek emergency care if symptoms worsen.   - Short-term goals (1\u20134 weeks): Complete ophthalmic assessment, initiate targeted treatment based on diagnosis, monitor symptom progression, and coordinate with oncology.   - Long-term objectives (3\u20136 months): Monitor for underlying metastasis, maintain ocular health, and manage systemic malignancy as coordinated with oncology.   - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of prompt eye examination, recognize warning signs, adhere to follow-up instructions, and maintain eye hygiene.",
