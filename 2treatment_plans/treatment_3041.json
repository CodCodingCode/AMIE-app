    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of distal muscle weakness, particularly in the ankles, along with abnormal sensations like tingling and pins-and-needles in the feet and hands, suggests a peripheral neuropathy affecting both motor and sensory fibers. The difficulty with running, frequent ankle sprains, balance issues, and symptoms worsening with sustained activity and improving with rest are characteristic of a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. The fact that symptoms have persisted over time and are not linked to systemic causes like diabetes or alcohol use points toward a hereditary or genetic neuropathy, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The absence of systemic diseases, episodes of acute neurological events, or central signs further supports a diagnosis of a hereditary peripheral neuropathy.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease END",
    "output": "THINKING: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by distal muscle weakness, sensory disturbances, and foot deformities, with no cure currently available. Since it is a progressive condition, management focuses on symptom relief, maintaining function, preventing complications, and improving quality of life. Non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy and occupational therapy can help strengthen muscles, improve balance, and adapt to physical limitations. Use of orthotic devices may provide stability, especially for foot drop or Pes cavus deformities, reducing the risk of falls and ankle sprains. Regular monitoring and patient education about injury prevention are important. Pharmacologically, neuropathic pain medications like gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine can be considered if the patient experiences significant pain. Since there is no disease-modifying therapy, the focus should be on supportive care and maximizing functional independence.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a multidisciplinary approach beginning with referral to physical and occupational therapy for muscle strengthening, balance training, and gait assistance. The patient should be fitted for appropriate orthotic devices as needed to enhance stability and prevent falls. Regular neurovascular assessments are recommended to monitor progression and identify complications early. If the patient experiences neuropathic pain, pharmacological management with agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine can be introduced. Education on injury prevention, avoiding overexertion, and maintaining a safe environment are essential components of care. Family and caregiver support and counseling about the progressive nature of CMT are also important. Currently, no disease-specific pharmacotherapy exists, so focus remains on supportive measures to improve the patient\u2019s functional status and quality of life."
