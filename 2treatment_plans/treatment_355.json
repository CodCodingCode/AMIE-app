    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high likelihood given symptoms and imaging suggestive of a posterior fossa/skull base tumor involving cranial nerves, with neuroepithelioma (NOS) as provisional pathology. - Severity classification: Severe, due to neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, cranial nerve involvement), rapid progression of vision symptoms, and systemic weight loss indicating significant disease burden. - Urgency level: Immediate need for diagnostic confirmation and treatment initiation, as neurological compromise and systemic symptoms pose a risk of deterioration. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other intracranial neoplasms, metastatic disease, or inflammatory processes affecting the posterior fossa.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Multimodal approach including definitive surgical intervention (if resectable), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; tailored to tumor type and patient condition. - Supporting evidence: Complete or maximal safe resection improves outcomes; adjuvant radiotherapy reduces recurrence risk; chemotherapy may be adjunct, especially if neuroepithelioma is confirmed. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, neurological status, tumor resectability, overall health, and patient preferences. - Contraindications or cautions: Risks related to surgery in posterior fossa structures, potential neurotoxicity from radiation/chemo, and compromised recovery capacity.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 4-10 mg IV or PO every 6-12 hours) to reduce edema and intracranial pressure. - Rationale for selection: Rapid symptom relief, decreasing cerebral edema around tumor. - Expected timeline for improvement: Within 24-48 hours. - Key side effects to monitor: Hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, mood changes, GI disturbances. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Mannitol for edema, or anticonvulsants if seizures occur.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Nutritional support to address weight loss; physical therapy for weakness and functional rehabilitation. - Patient education priorities: Importance of prompt treatment, recognizing symptom worsening, and adhering to therapy. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, balanced diet rich in calories and protein, stress management techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Referral to psychological support or counseling if needed, to address anxiety or depression.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks post-intervention, then routinely every 4-6 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Neurological exam, visual assessments, cranial nerve function, symptom progression, side effects of treatments. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening of neurological deficits, severe headache, new seizures, or signs of increased intracranial pressure. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom stabilization or improvement, imaging follow-up (MRI) for tumor status.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, concise language, and confirm understanding; provide written summaries. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the seriousness but also the action plan; encourage questions at her own pace. - Adherence strategies: Encourage involvement of family or trusted individuals; scheduled follow-ups to review progress. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family members to aid understanding and support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurosurgeon and neuro-oncologist within the next week for definitive diagnosis confirmation and treatment planning. - Other healthcare team members: Neuro-ophthalmologist for vision assessment, physical and occupational therapy. - Community resources: Support groups for brain tumors, nutritional counseling. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss financial aspects early; coordinate with social work if needed for assistance.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of neuroepithelioma involving the posterior fossa or skull base with cranial nerve involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone) to reduce cerebral edema, prompt diagnostic confirmation via biopsy and imaging, and multidisciplinary intervention with neurosurgery and neuro-oncology for potential resection and adjunctive therapies. Systemic support involves nutritional intervention, physical therapy, and psychological support to address systemic and neurological symptoms. Close monitoring will be established through scheduled neurological exams, vision assessments, and repeat imaging, with attention to potential neurological decline. Effective communication tailored to her information withholding style will focus on clarity and reassurance, involving her and her family as appropriate. Coordination with specialists and support services will facilitate comprehensive care aiming for symptom stabilization, tumor control, and quality of life improvement.",
