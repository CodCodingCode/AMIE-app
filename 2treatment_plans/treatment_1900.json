    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Encephalitis (likely autoimmune or viral encephalitis)\nJustification: The presentation of new-onset neurological symptoms such as worsening clumsiness, frequent falls, speech deterioration, strange movements, and episodes of confusion suggests an inflammatory or infectious process affecting the central nervous system. The accompanying behavioral changes, irritability, night-waking, and increased tiredness further support CNS involvement. Given the age, rapid progression, and constellation of neurological and behavioral signs, encephalitis is a strong possibility, especially considering viral etiologies such as herpes simplex virus, or autoimmune processes like autoimmune encephalitis. The absence of jaundice or eye findings does not exclude CNS infectious or inflammatory etiologies. Further diagnostics such as MRI brain, CSF analysis, and possibly PCR testing are warranted, but the clinical picture points towards encephalitis as the primary diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nEncephalitis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of encephalitis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt intervention, the primary goal is to initiate treatments that address possible infectious and autoimmune causes while supporting the patient's neurological and general health. Empiric antiviral therapy with acyclovir should be started immediately to cover herpes simplex virus, the most common viral cause of encephalitis, even before confirmatory diagnostics return. It is also critical to perform urgent neuroimaging (MRI brain) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, including PCR testing for herpes and other viruses, autoimmune panels, and general CSF studies to confirm the etiology. Supportive care includes hospitalization, monitoring neurological status, ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition, and managing symptoms such as agitation or seizures if they develop. Given the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis, if autoimmune etiology is suspected, corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulin may be considered once infectious causes are ruled out. Close collaboration with neurology and infectious disease specialists is important for ongoing management and adjustment of therapy based on diagnostic results. \n\nANSWER: Initiate empiric intravenous acyclovir at standard dosing immediately to treat possible herpes simplex virus encephalitis, along with hospital admission for close neurological monitoring. Obtain urgent brain MRI and lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, including PCR for herpes and other viruses, autoimmune antibody testing, and general CSF studies. Supportive measures such as hydration, nutritional support, seizure prophylaxis if indicated, and symptomatic management of behavioral and neurological symptoms should be commenced. Once diagnostic results are available, tailor immunotherapy (e.g., corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulin) if autoimmune encephalitis is confirmed and discontinue antivirals if a viral pathogen is identified and treated accordingly."
