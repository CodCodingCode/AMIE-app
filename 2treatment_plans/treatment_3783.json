    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of transient weakness and numbness in the left arm, occurring unpredictably over six weeks, raise concern for transient ischemic attacks. The episodes are brief, resolve spontaneously, and can sometimes occur with or without headaches, which suggests episodic cerebral ischemia. The absence of vascular risk factors (no hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, or vascular disease) makes traditional atherosclerotic TIA less likely, but non-atherosclerotic vascular causes or small vessel ischemia cannot be ruled out. The associated headache could be coincidental or related to other causes, but the key concern is the neurological symptoms suggestive of transient ischemia. It is essential to evaluate for other causes of transient neurological deficits, but given the presentation, TIA is the most probable diagnosis, requiring urgent further workup.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nTIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of TIA, it is critical to address the risk of future cerebrovascular events. Although this patient does not have prominent traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia, the occurrence of transient neurological symptoms warrants urgent intervention to prevent stroke. A comprehensive evaluation, including neuroimaging and vascular studies, should be initiated promptly, but since the focus here is on initial management, the primary goals are to reduce risk factors, provide symptomatic relief, and ensure close follow-up. Pharmacological intervention with antiplatelet agents is standard; aspirin is commonly used unless contraindicated. Non-pharmacological measures include lifestyle counseling on smoking cessation, diet, and physical activity, even if risk factors are minimal, as well as controlling other possible contributing factors. Patient education about warning signs of stroke and the importance of prompt medical attention are essential components of management. \n\nANSWER: The initial treatment plan should include starting low-dose aspirin (e.g., 81 mg daily) unless contraindicated, to reduce the risk of future ischemic events. The patient should be referred urgently to a neurologist for further assessment, including brain imaging (such as MRI/MRA) and vascular studies to identify underlying causes, including small vessel disease or embolic sources. Lifestyle modifications should be emphasized, including maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. Blood pressure and blood sugar levels should be checked and managed if necessary, even in the absence of current hypertension or diabetes, to optimize vascular health. The patient should be advised to monitor symptoms and seek immediate care if neurological deficits worsen or become persistent. Close follow-up should be scheduled to review diagnostic results and adjust management accordingly."
