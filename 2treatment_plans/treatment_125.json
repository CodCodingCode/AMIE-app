    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating hydroxychloroquine therapy, considering corticosteroids if disease activity warrants immediate control, along with close monitoring of disease markers and adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventions such as adequate rest, sun protection, and lifestyle modifications are essential to support overall health. Follow-up in 4-6 weeks will help assess medication response and adjust therapy as needed. Education on recognizing symptoms and medication adherence is prioritized, tailored to the patient's communication style by simplifying information and involving family members. Coordination with rheumatology, cardiology, and ophthalmology ensures multidisciplinary care. This approach aims to control disease activity, prevent organ damage, and improve quality of life while minimizing risks associated with therapy.",
