    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan, starting with confirming the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) in this patient with prosthetic heart valve, recent dental work,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of infective endocarditis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating immediate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics tailored to culture results, consulting cardiology and infectious disease specialists urgently, and closely monitoring the patient for signs of progression or complications. The initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient and preventing embolic events, especially given the skin findings and prosthetic valve status, while planning for potential surgical intervention if indicated.\nInitial actions (today): Arrange inpatient admission for IV antibiotics, perform initial blood cultures, obtain transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography, and consult infectious disease and cardiology teams. Educate the patient about the seriousness of IE, emphasizing adherence and symptom reporting.\nShort-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve sterilization of blood cultures, reduce fever and systemic symptoms, monitor for embolic or cardiac complications, and adjust antibiotics based on microbiology. Ensure dental evaluation for source control.\nLong-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antibiotic course, reassess valve function, consider surgical intervention if indicated, and implement measures to prevent recurrence (e.g., dental hygiene, antibiotic prophylaxis for future procedures). Provide patient education on signs of relapse or complications and reinforce adherence.\nPatient handout summary: \"You have been diagnosed with infective endocarditis, which is an infection of your heart\u2019s valves. Treatment involves intensive IV antibiotics, close monitoring, and coordination with specialists. Be alert for worsening symptoms like chest pain, new neurological signs, or increased fever, and seek immediate care if they occur. Follow-up care is essential to prevent serious complications.\"\nThis approach aims to effectively treat your infection, prevent embolic and cardiac complications, and promote recovery and long-term health management.",
