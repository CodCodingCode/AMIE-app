    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based speech-language therapy with cautious pharmacological management and psychosocial support. The treatment plan includes regular, tailored speech therapy, consideration of symptomatic medications like cholinesterase inhibitors, and emotional support to address social withdrawal and distress. Initial focus should be on establishing a multidisciplinary care team and educating the patient and family about the condition to promote active participation and realistic goal-setting. Follow-up will be scheduled every 3 to 6 months for ongoing assessment, adjustments, and support. This approach aims to slow communication decline, enhance quality of life, and provide appropriate psychosocial resources while carefully monitoring for side effects and disease progression.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule neurological referral, initiate or revisit speech therapy consultation, and provide informational resources.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis with neuroimaging and neuropsychology assessment, start speech therapy, and discuss medication options.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize communication abilities, monitor emotional health, and adjust therapy or medications as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the progressive nature of the condition, importance of speech therapy, medication considerations, emotional support options, and scheduled follow-ups.",
