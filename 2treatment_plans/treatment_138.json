    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your response:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given classic presentation of anterior uveitis\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute intraocular uveitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose topical corticosteroids, such as prednisolone acetate 1% administered hourly, along with cycloplegic agents like atropine 1% drops twice daily to reduce pain and prevent synechiae. Immediate ophthalmology consultation is essential within 24 hours for detailed assessment and potential escalation of therapy if inflammation persists or complications develop. Patient education emphasizes medication adherence, recognizing adverse signs, and the importance of follow-up. Monitoring will focus on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and intraocular inflammation, with follow-up visits scheduled every 24-48 hours initially, then weekly until resolution. Long-term management involves ongoing ophthalmology care and addressing any underlying systemic causes if identified. This approach aims for rapid inflammation control, preservation of vision, and prevention of complications, while minimizing risks associated with corticosteroids.",
