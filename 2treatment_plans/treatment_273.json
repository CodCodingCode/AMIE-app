    "input": "Probable diagnosis: Structural intracranial abnormality superimposed on longstanding macrocephaly (such as hydrocephalus or mass effect)\n<Uncertain but highly suspected based on clinical pattern; confirmation needed via imaging>END",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of probable structural intracranial abnormality superimposed on longstanding macrocephaly, such as hydranencephaly, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The immediate priority is to initiate or optimize anticonvulsant therapy to control seizures and obtain recent neuroimaging to clarify current structural status. The patient should be educated on seizure safety, medication adherence, and symptom monitoring. Follow-up should be scheduled within 1-2 weeks to assess response and side effects, with ongoing evaluation every 1-3 months. Coordination with neurology and possibly neurosurgery for structural assessment, along with neuropsychology services if cognitive or emotional issues arise, is essential. This plan aims to stabilize neurological function, improve quality of life, and prevent further neurological decline while respecting the patient's communication style through clear, simple explanations and involving support systems as needed.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule urgent neuroimaging (MRI), review current seizure frequency, and start or adjust anticonvulsant medication.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve seizure stabilization, monitor for medication side effects, and confirm structural findings.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Continue neurological assessment, optimize medication regimen, and provide supportive therapies.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize seizure safety, medication adherence, importance of follow-up imaging, and ongoing neurological support.",
