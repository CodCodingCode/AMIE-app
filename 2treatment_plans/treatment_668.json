    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given systemic influenza symptoms and ocular soreness typical of viral conjunctivitis. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, since symptoms seem manageable and no mention of vision-threatening or systemic complications. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, but monitor for worsening. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, other ocular infections.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with reassurance and supportive care; artificial tears and cold compresses as appropriate. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; symptomatic care reduces discomfort. No antibiotics are indicated unless bacterial superinfection occurs. - Patient-specific considerations: Young female with ongoing influenza symptoms; avoid unnecessary ocular medications. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid touching eyes, emphasize hand hygiene to prevent spread.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial lubricating eye drops (e.g., preservative-free artificial tears), used as needed. - Rationale for selection: Relieves ocular soreness and intermittent blurriness, safe for viral conjunctivitis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 1 week. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; monitor for correct use to prevent contamination. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider topical antihistamines or anti-inflammatory drops if allergic component suspected.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, using clean tissues for ocular discharge, and practicing good hygiene. - Patient education priorities: Signs of secondary bacterial infection (e.g., increasing redness, purulent discharge), importance of hygiene, and self-limited nature of viral conjunctivitis. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, staying hydrated, avoiding eye rubbing. - Behavioral interventions: No additional techniques needed at this stage.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-7 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, ocular redness, discharge, vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Increased pain, vision changes, intense redness, or loss of vision\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief within 1 week; confirm no secondary infection.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic explanation of viral conjunctivitis\u2019s self-limited nature, emphasizing supportive care. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about symptom duration and contagiousness; advise on hygiene practices. - Adherence strategies: Encourage regular use of artificial tears, hygiene measures, and follow-up appointments. - Family involvement: Advise on preventing spread within household; educate family members on hygiene.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: None routinely, unless worsening or atypical features. - Other healthcare team members: None initially; can involve ophthalmology if unresolved or complicated. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on viral conjunctivitis and hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Recommend over-the-counter artificial tears; ensure affordability of follow-up if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptomatic management with patient education and hygiene measures. The primary interventions include the use of preservative-free artificial tears to alleviate ocular discomfort, along with diligent hand hygiene and avoidance of eye rubbing to prevent spread. The support of patient understanding about the self-limited course will facilitate adherence and reduce anxiety. Follow-up is scheduled within one week to ensure symptom resolution and to monitor for any signs of secondary infection or complication. This plan aims to relieve symptoms, prevent transmission, and promote prompt recovery while minimizing unnecessary medication use and potential side effects.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on hygiene, initiate artificial tears, and advise on symptom monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, preventing secondary bacterial infection, and reassurance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain eye health, prevent recurrences, and reinforce hygiene practices. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the viral nature of the conjunctivitis, importance of hygiene, use of artificial tears, and when to seek further care.",
