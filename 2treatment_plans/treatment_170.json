    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical presentation with enlarged cervical node, systemic B symptoms, and suspected lymphoma. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, because symptoms indicate systemic involvement and potential disease progression. - Urgency level: Urgent, as lymphoma requires prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment to improve prognosis. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other causes of lymphadenopathy (infection, autoimmune disease), but systemic symptoms strongly suggest malignant process.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate staging procedures with biopsy confirming diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP regimen) and consideration of radiotherapy if localized disease. - Supporting evidence: Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab) has demonstrated improved survival in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, comorbidities, anxiety, and preferences should inform treatment choices. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor for treatment-related immunosuppression, infections, and cardiac toxicity.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen\u2014rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone\u2014dosed per body surface area and schedule. - Rationale for selection: It is standard first-line therapy for most aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. - Expected timeline for improvement: Initial response assessed after 2-3 cycles, typically over 3-6 months. - Key side effects to monitor: Neutropenia, infection, cardiotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, corticosteroid side effects. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Salvage chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapies, or stem cell transplant, depending on response.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Supportive care including nutritional support, adequate sleep, physical activity as tolerated. - Patient education priorities: Importance of treatment adherence, recognizing infection signs, understanding disease process. - Lifestyle modifications: Stress management techniques; avoid immunosuppressive environments. - Behavioral interventions: Anxiety reduction strategies\u2014cognitive-behavioral therapy, counseling, or support groups.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess physical status and labs after each treatment cycle; imaging after 2-3 cycles. - Monitoring parameters: Complete blood count, infection signs, organ function, symptom progression. - Red flag symptoms: Fever, severe pain, new lymphadenopathy, neurological symptoms, or signs of bleeding. - Treatment response assessment: PET/CT scans, physical exam, and symptom review to confirm remission or identify relapse.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Provide clear, empathetic explanations using simple language; reassure her about the treatment process and prognosis. - Addressing patient concerns: Repeat information about safety, side effects, and support resources; acknowledge fears openly. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, provide written summaries, involve her in decision-making. - Family involvement: With consent, involve family members for emotional support and to aid understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Hematologist/oncologist for treatment planning and management, ideally within specialized centers. - Other healthcare team members: Oncology nurses, social workers, mental health professionals. - Community resources: Support groups for lymphoma patients, educational materials on lymphoma. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with financial counseling and navigating treatment coverage.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, NOS, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating diagnostic staging via biopsy, followed by first-line combination chemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP) with immunotherapy, tailored to her disease stage and health status. Supportive care and psychosocial support are integral, addressing her anxiety and emotional needs. Regular monitoring through clinical assessments, labs, and imaging will guide ongoing management. Clear communication and involving her support system will help improve adherence and reduce anxiety. Coordination with oncology specialists and support services will ensure timely, effective care aimed at achieving remission and improving quality of life.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange diagnostic biopsy if not already completed; provide education about the diagnostic process. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis histologically; initiate staging workup; begin supportive and psychological support. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete initial chemotherapy cycles; assess treatment response; plan subsequent therapy or consolidation if indicated. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of lymphoma, treatment options, expected side effects, importance of follow-up, and available support resources.",
