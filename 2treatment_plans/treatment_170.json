    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of influenza A H7N2 virus infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based antiviral therapy with supportive care and patient education. The initial management includes starting oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, to reduce disease severity and prevent complications. Supportive measures such as rest, hydration, and humidified air should be emphasized. Close monitoring of symptoms, vital signs, and oxygen saturation is crucial, with a follow-up evaluation in 48\u201372 hours to assess response and identify any worsening respiratory symptoms. The patient should be educated about warning signs requiring urgent care, including increased shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or persistent high fever. Practical instructions should include hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and avoiding contact with others to prevent transmission. Follow-up can be coordinated via clinic visit or telehealth, and a plan should be outlined for escalation if clinical status deteriorates. This approach aims to shorten illness duration, minimize complications, ensure patient safety, and promote adherence to therapy.",
