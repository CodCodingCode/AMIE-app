    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate; symptoms are typical for viral conjunctivitis, but recent eye symptoms need confirmation to exclude other etiologies. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; redness, tearing, and swelling are present but no mention of significant pain, vision changes, or photophobia. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; symptoms are recent and not severe. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis (which may need antibiotics), allergic conjunctivitis, or other ocular surface conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, and hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limiting; symptom relief with supportive measures is standard. - Patient-specific considerations: The recent onset after playing soccer suggests exposure; risk of secondary bacterial infection is low but warrants monitoring. - Contraindications or cautions: No contraindications to supportive care; avoid steroids unless inflammation persists or worsens, as they can delay viral clearance.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prescribe lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) QID; consider artificial tears containing hyaluronic acid. - Rationale for selection: To alleviate discomfort and protect mucous membranes. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms typically improve within 5-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Monitoring for allergic reactions or worsening symptoms warrants follow-up. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: If significant inflammation or secondary bacterial infection develops, topical antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents under ophthalmologic guidance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Maintain eye hygiene with regular gentle cleaning; avoid touching or rubbing eyes. - Patient education priorities: Emphasize hand hygiene, avoid sharing towels or pillows, and prevent spread. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit physical activity that increases exposure or discomfort temporarily. - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce hygiene practices and educate on viral transmission.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, signs of secondary bacterial infection (purulent discharge, worsening redness), or vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Severe eye pain, decreased vision, photophobia, or increasing swelling\u2014immediate ophthalmology referral. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and no progression by follow-up.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing that symptoms are typical and self-limiting, with reassurance. - Addressing patient concerns: Worry about contagion, discomfort, and when to seek further care. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions and reinforce importance of hygiene. - Family involvement: Encourage informing close contacts to prevent spread.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if symptoms persist beyond 7-10 days or worsen. - Other healthcare team members: None immediate, but ophthalmologist if complications arise. - Community resources: Educational materials on eye hygiene and viral conjunctivitis. - Insurance/cost considerations: Use over-the-counter lubricants; ensure follow-up appointments are accessible.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive care with patient education and vigilant monitoring. The key interventions include advising the use of artificial tears and cold compresses for symptom relief, maintaining strict eye hygiene, and avoiding touching or sharing personal items. The patient should be monitored closely with a follow-up in 3-5 days to assess symptom progression or resolution. If symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, an ophthalmology referral is warranted. Throughout care, clear communication emphasizing the self-limiting nature of viral conjunctivitis and infection prevention will promote adherence and reduce transmission. This plan aims to relieve symptoms effectively while minimizing complications and supporting recovery within a safe, patient-centered framework.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on symptom management, hygiene measures, and when to seek urgent care; prescribe artificial tears. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom resolution; prevent secondary infections. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure full recovery, reinforce infection prevention education, and evaluate for recurrent or persistent symptoms. - Patient handout summary: Include instructions on eye hygiene, signs of worsening, and follow-up steps.",
