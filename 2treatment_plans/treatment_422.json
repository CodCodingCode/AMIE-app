The initial focus is on rapid hemodynamic stabilization with volume resuscitation, blood transfusions, and careful blood pressure management. Emergency transfer to specialized surgical or interventional radiology teams is essential for definitive repair of the ruptured aneurysm. Supportive measures include close monitoring of vital signs, labs, and repeat imaging to assess repair integrity. Clear communication with the patient and family about the critical nature of the condition, treatment steps, and expected outcomes is vital. Long-term management involves controlling cardiovascular risk factors, smoking cessation, and regular follow-up with cardiology or vascular surgery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV access, start blood products as needed, stabilize vital signs, prepare for urgent imaging (CT angiography), and arrange immediate transfer to surgical care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Postoperative monitoring, ensure hemodynamic stability, manage any complications, and commence risk factor modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular surveillance imaging, blood pressure optimization, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of the situation, the need for prompt surgical repair, importance of follow-up, and lifestyle changes for long-term health.",
