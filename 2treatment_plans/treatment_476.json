    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - The final diagnosis is trauma-induced ocular surface injury, such as conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, which is typically benign but requires assessment of severity. Given the recent injury from playing soccer and the presentation of redness, swelling, and tearing, I need to ascertain whether there are additional signs of significant injury, such as pain, visual impairment, sign of globe rupture, or persistent bleeding, to classify the severity. The diagnosis confidence is high based on history and presentation, but misclassification as infectious conjunctivitis must be excluded. The severity appears mild to moderate if there are no signs of globe injury, corneal damage, or vision loss. Urgency is usually routine or immediate if danger signs are present. Differential considerations include bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion, or more serious trauma.  Step 2 - For simple trauma-induced conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, evidence-based guidelines recommend conservative management. Risk factors such as ongoing bleeding or signs of intraocular injury would warrant urgent intervention.  Step 3 - Pharmacological management is generally supportive unless secondary infection or significant corneal damage occurs. Topical lubricants or artificial tears support healing, and antibiotics are not routine unless bacterial infection is suspected. Analgesics may be used for discomfort.  Step 4 - Non-pharmacological care emphasizes protective measures, patient education on avoiding rubbing the eye, and eye protection from further injury. Stress reduction and proper rest support healing.  Step 5 - Follow-up should be scheduled within 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. Monitoring involves visual acuity, symptom progression, and signs of complication (e.g., increasing pain, vision changes). Immediate referral is needed if there are signs of globe rupture, persistent bleeding, or vision loss.  Step 6 - Due to the patient's anxious amplifier profile, the communication approach should be reassuring, clear, and empathetic, emphasizing safety and expected recovery. Address common worries proactively, provide written summaries, and involve the patient in monitoring.  Step 7 - No immediate specialist referral unless complications arise; however, referral to ophthalmology is warranted if there is any concern about intraocular injury or if symptoms persist beyond initial management.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of trauma-induced ocular surface injury, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes conservative management with artificial tears and protective measures to support healing, along with patient education on eye care and activity restriction. Initial management focuses on reassurance, symptom monitoring, and preventing further injury while establishing clear follow-up plans to assess healing and detect any complications. Follow-up care will include scheduled re-evaluation within 24-48 hours, with instructions to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen. This approach aims to facilitate recovery, minimize discomfort, and prevent long-term sequelae, while ensuring the patient feels supported and informed throughout the process.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Provide reassurance, advise to avoid rubbing or trauma, start artificial tears if tolerated, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm resolution of redness and swelling, restore comfort, and ensure no signs of serious injury. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full healing of ocular surface, no residual visual impairment, and patient understanding of eye protection. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of injury, symptoms to watch for, activity restrictions, use of lubricants, and when to seek urgent care.",
