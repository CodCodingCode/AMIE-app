    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given clinical features of cauliflower-shaped, verrucous lesions with bleeding. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering the increase in number and size of lesions over three weeks, bleeding, and associated irritation. - Urgency level: Routine care with prompt treatment; initial lesions do not appear acutely life-threatening. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other sexually transmitted infections (e.g., molluscum contagiosum, herpes, syphilis), especially if atypical features or if new symptoms develop.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Topical agents such as imiquimod 5% cream or cryotherapy. - Supporting evidence: Imiquimod stimulates local immune response effectively for multiple lesions; cryotherapy is quick and effective for localized warts. - Patient-specific considerations: Lesion location (genital area), number, patient preference, and potential tolerance. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid imiquimod if patient has hypersensitivity; cryotherapy caution if bleeding is problematic.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Imiquimod 5% cream applied thrice weekly at bedtime, washed off after 6-10 hours. - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive, suitable for multiple genital warts, with good efficacy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Partial clearance may be seen in 4-8 weeks; some lesions may require multiple treatments. - Key side effects to monitor: Local skin reactions\u2014erythema, erosion, soreness; patient education on expected mild discomfort. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution or cryotherapy.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Practice safe sex, use barrier protection consistently, and avoid new sexual contacts during treatment. - Patient education priorities: Nature of the disease, possible recurrence, importance of treatment adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain good hygiene, avoid scratching or irritating lesions. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction techniques may help immune response; consider counseling if sexual health concerns arise.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate at 4 weeks to assess response; sooner if worsening symptoms or new lesions. - Monitoring parameters: Lesion size, number, symptoms, side effects of treatment. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid worsening, signs of secondary infection, severe pain, excessive bleeding, or systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Document lesion reduction, symptom relief, and tolerability.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language emphasizing key points and reassurance; avoid overwhelming details. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that treatment may require multiple sessions, and recurrence is possible but manageable. - Adherence strategies: Simplify treatment instructions, encourage questions, and reassure about the safety profile. - Family involvement: Respect patient's preference to withhold information; involve them only if patient consents or requests.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Consider referral to a dermatologist or infectious disease specialist if lesions are refractory or complicated. - Other healthcare team members: Counseling services, sexual health education. - Community resources: Support groups for sexual health or HPV-related conditions. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage options for topical medications and procedures; assess affordability.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical imiquimod 5% cream applied thrice weekly, with close follow-up at 4 weeks to assess response and tolerability. If necessary, cryotherapy can be used as an adjunct or alternative. Emphasis is placed on practicing safe sex, maintaining good hygiene, and monitoring for side effects. Patient education will focus on treatment expectations, potential for recurrence, and importance of adherence, tailored to the patient's preference for information sharing. Follow-up will involve regular reassessment and potential referral to specialists if lesions persist or worsen. This approach aims for lesion clearance, symptom relief, and minimized side effects, while supporting the patient's overall sexual health and well-being.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Provide patient education, explain treatment plan, and demonstrate application technique; schedule first follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate treatment, monitor for adverse effects, and ensure adherence. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve lesion clearance, manage recurrences proactively, and reinforce safe sexual practices. - Patient handout summary: Key points include treatment steps, indications for follow-up, precautions, and when to seek urgent care.",
