    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your approach.  \nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high suspicion for Von Willebrand dis\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of an inherited bleeding disorder, likely Von Willebrand disease or a platelet disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent stabilization with blood product transfusions, administration of desmopressin (if appropriate), and local measures to control postpartum bleeding. Initial management focuses on rapid hemodynamic stabilization and bleeding cessation, while establishing diagnostic evaluation via hematology consultation for confirmatory testing and future management. Follow-up care will include lab monitoring of coagulation parameters and assessment of bleeding control, with patient education on recognizing ongoing bleeding and understanding her inherited condition. This approach aims to achieve effective hemostasis, prevent rebleeding, and prepare for long-term management, while minimizing risks such as fluid overload and allergic reactions. Implementation will involve immediate stabilization, short-term monitoring, and long-term coordination with specialists.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate transfusions as needed, administer desmopressin bolus if no contraindications, perform uterine assessment and manual control measures, and notify hematology.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve bleeding control, confirm diagnosis with hematology testing, and plan for outpatient management or further interventions.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish a definitive diagnosis, develop a personalized management plan, and prepare for future pregnancies or interventions as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about her condition, the importance of follow-up testing, recognition of bleeding symptoms, and contact information for urgent concerns.",
