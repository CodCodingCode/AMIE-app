The treatment plan includes promoting adequate hydration and salt intake, physical counter-maneuvers, and cautiously initiating pharmacologic agents such as fludrocortisone, with possible escalation to midodrine if needed. Concurrently, addressing the anemia with vitamin B12 supplementation is essential. Initial management emphasizes symptom relief through lifestyle modifications and patient education, followed by close monitoring for symptom improvement and potential side effects. Follow-up in 2-4 weeks is vital to reassess symptoms, blood pressure, and lab parameters, adjusting therapy as needed. Clear, simple communication tailored to the patient\u2019s cognitive style and involving family members will support adherence. Coordination with specialists for anemia and autonomic disorder management ensures comprehensive care, aiming to improve functional status and quality of life while preventing escalation of symptoms.",
