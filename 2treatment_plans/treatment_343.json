    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of probable bronchogenic carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent diagnostic evaluation with staged oncologic management tailored to the patient's overall health status. Initial focus should be on stabilizing the patient by controlling active bleeding, conducting high-resolution chest imaging (CT scan), confirming the diagnosis with tissue sampling, and accurately staging the tumor. Once staging is complete, treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy will be considered based on tumor extent and patient comorbidities. Symptomatic management includes addressing hemoptysis and supporting respiratory function, with intervention from interventional radiology if bleeding persists. Ongoing monitoring of symptoms, functional status, and treatment response will guide subsequent care. Clear, empathetic communication adapted to the patient's information-hesitant style, along with involving family as appropriate, will foster adherence and understanding. Coordination with specialists will ensure timely diagnostics and initiation of appropriate therapies, aiming to improve survival outcomes while minimizing risks and enhancing quality of life.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent chest imaging (CT scan), initiate airway stabilization if needed, and consult pulmonology for evaluation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis with biopsy, perform staging procedures, and develop an individualized treatment plan.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete definitive oncologic therapy, monitor for recurrence or progression, and provide supportive care.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of diagnostic procedures, potential treatments, symptom management strategies, and need for follow-up appointments.",
