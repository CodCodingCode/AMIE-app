    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Peripheral Neuropathy (most consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease)\nJustification: The patient's long-standing, progressive burning and numbness in feet and ankles over seven years, coupled with frequent ankle sprains, gait instability, and legs feeling heavy or shaky, strongly suggest a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. The absence of systemic symptoms, normal sensation changes with no mention of systemic illnesses, and the pattern of symptom progression point towards a hereditary or familial neuropathy, most commonly Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This condition often manifests in early adulthood, with chronic foot deformities, weakness, and gait disturbances, fitting this case's presentation. The lack of systemic inflammatory signs or metabolic risk factors reduces the likelihood of autoimmune or diabetic neuropathy.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Peripheral Neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Hereditary Peripheral Neuropathy, most consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the management primarily focuses on symptomatic relief, maintaining function, and preventing complications. Since there is no curative treatment for the genetic condition itself, intervention aims at improving quality of life and minimizing disability. Non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy and gait training can help enhance muscle strength, balance, and prevent contractures or deformities. Use of orthotic devices, such as ankle-foot orthoses, can improve stability and gait. Regular monitoring for foot deformities and skin integrity is essential to prevent ulcers, especially given the sensory deficits. Pharmacologically, medications like gabapentin or pregabalin may be considered for neuropathic pain, if present. Patient education on avoiding trauma, foot care, and activity modifications are integral. In selected cases, referral to a neurologist or a specialist in neuromuscular disorders may be appropriate for genetic counseling and further assessment, but initial management can be effectively initiated in primary care.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan includes initiating a multidisciplinary approach emphasizing daily foot and ankle care, regular physical therapy to maintain strength and balance, and the use of custom orthotic devices such as ankle-foot orthoses to assist gait stability. Implement pharmacologic therapy with agents like gabapentin or pregabalin if the patient experiences significant neuropathic pain. Educate the patient on injury prevention, proper foot hygiene, and the importance of routine foot examinations to prevent ulcers. Arrange periodic follow-up with a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist for ongoing assessment, genetic counseling, and supportive management as needed. Reinforce activity adaptations to minimize falls and injuries, and consider referral to physical and occupational therapy for tailored interventions."
