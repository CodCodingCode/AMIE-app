    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The patient exhibits core features consistent with ASD, including preference for routines, discomfort with change, sensory sensitivities (dislike of loud noises, bright lights, and tactile contact), and repetitive behaviors such as rocking and humming. The internal sensation of turbulence or bumpiness may reflect atypical sensory processing commonly seen in ASD. Additionally, social withdrawal behaviors like sitting alone, avoidance of eye contact or engagement, and heightened anxiety or nervousness in social settings align with ASD presentations. These symptoms and behaviors are persistent and characteristic, supporting this diagnosis as the most probable.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the treatment approach should be comprehensive, focusing on supporting the patient's core symptoms and enhancing functioning. Non-pharmacological interventions such as structured behavioral therapies, social skills training, and sensory integration techniques are foundational and effective in managing ASD behaviors and improving quality of life. These interventions can be initiated or coordinated through a multidisciplinary team, including behavioral therapists or occupational therapists, with the primary care physician providing ongoing support. Pharmacological treatments may be considered if the patient exhibits significant anxiety, agitation, or repetitive behaviors that interfere with daily functioning. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or antipsychotics are used cautiously and typically after behavioral strategies have been tried, ensuring benefits outweigh potential side effects. This approach aligns with current best practices for ASD management and is feasible within a primary care or psychiatric setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with arranging behavioral and occupational therapy focused on social skills, sensory processing, and behavior management; engaging a multidisciplinary team experienced in ASD is ideal. In parallel, the primary care physician or psychiatrist should address any associated anxiety or behavioral concerns. If the patient's behaviors cause significant distress or interfere with daily activities, consider starting a low-dose SSRI, such as fluoxetine or sertraline, with close monitoring of effects and side effects. Psychoeducation for the patient and family about ASD and its typical developmental course is also important to foster understanding and support. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to assess progress, adjust therapeutic interventions, and address emerging needs."
