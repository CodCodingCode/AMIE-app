    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan for arrhythmic syncope, which is likely indicative of significant underlying arrhythmia, especially given the history of cardiac arrest\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of arrhythmic syncope, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as the primary intervention to prevent sudden cardiac death, alongside evaluation for reversible causes and optimization of cardiac health. Immediate management focuses on stabilizing the patient and ensuring safety, while long-term management involves device programming, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up. Follow-up care will include device checks, symptom monitoring, and patient education about warning signs and activity restrictions. This approach aims to reduce the risk of recurrent life-threatening arrhythmias, improve survival, and enhance quality of life, while carefully monitoring for device-related complications and side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Confirm diagnosis with further electrophysiological assessment if needed, initiate discussions about ICD placement, and stabilize the patient as appropriate.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Schedule device implantation, educate the patient about the procedure and safety precautions, and review medication regimen.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Conduct device follow-up, monitor for arrhythmia recurrence, and implement lifestyle and heart-healthy modifications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of the ICD in preventing sudden death, adherence to follow-up appointments, recognizing symptoms warranting urgent care, and lifestyle adjustments to support cardiac health.",
