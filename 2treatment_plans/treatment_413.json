    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment:  \nThis patient has classic features of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, with almost nightly bedwetting and episodic daytime leakage,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based behavioral management with pharmacological therapy as needed, tailored to the patient's severity and response. Initial management should focus on enuresis alarms, bladder training, and education for the patient and family to enhance adherence and address emotional factors. Pharmacotherapy with desmopressin may be introduced if alarms alone are insufficient, with careful monitoring for side effects. Follow-up at 4 weeks is essential to assess response, adjust strategies, and support ongoing compliance. This integrated approach aims to reduce bedwetting frequency, improve bladder awareness, and support emotional well-being, while minimizing risks associated with treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient and family about enuresis, demonstrate alarm use, and discuss fluid management.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate enuresis alarm therapy and consider starting desmopressin if needed; monitor for side effects; reinforce behavioral strategies.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve a significant reduction in nocturnal and daytime episodes; establish bladder control habits; evaluate need for ongoing medication or intervention adjustments.\n- Patient handout summary: Recognize enuresis as a common condition, understand management strategies, importance of adherence, and when to seek further care.",
