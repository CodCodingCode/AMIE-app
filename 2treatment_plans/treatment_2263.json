    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Peripheral Neuropathy, likely of a multifactorial or idiopathic origin, with features most consistent with a Length-Dependent Polyneuropathy\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of burning, tingling, numbness in the feet and fingertips, along with weakness, imbalance, and cramps, suggest a peripheral nerve disorder. The progressive nature over four years, with worsening symptoms upon standing or walking, supports a length-dependent process affecting distal nerves more prominently. The absence of systemic signs such as weight loss, fever, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or known metabolic or autoimmune conditions reduces the likelihood of secondary causes like diabetes or autoimmune neuropathies. However, idiopathic peripheral neuropathy remains common in such cases. The symptoms are consistent with peripheral nerve involvement affecting sensory and motor fibers, leading to balance issues, weakness, and sensory disturbances.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nPeripheral Neuropathy, likely idiopathic or multifactorial END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, likely idiopathic or multifactorial, the primary goals are to manage symptoms, improve function, and prevent further progression. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as patient education on foot and skin care to prevent injuries, balance exercises to reduce fall risk, and physical therapy to maintain strength and mobility, are fundamental. Pharmacologically, first-line agents like gabapentin or pregabalin can be employed to address neuropathic pain, with dose titration based on response and tolerability. Considering the potential multifactorial etiology, it is also important to evaluate and address modifiable risk factors (e.g., vitamin deficiencies, alcohol intake) and ensure that comorbidities like diabetes or autoimmune diseases are managed or ruled out. Given no systemic causes are identified, the focus remains on symptom control and functional preservation.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive management plan that includes patient education on foot and skin care, focusing on injury prevention. Start pharmacologic treatment with gabapentin or pregabalin to address neuropathic pain, titrated gradually to minimize side effects. Recommend physical therapy targeting balance and strength to reduce fall risk. Review and optimize management of any underlying conditions if identified later. Advise regular follow-up to monitor symptom evolution, medication tolerability, and functional status. Additionally, consider checking vitamin B12 levels and other relevant labs to rule out contributory deficiencies, and counsel on lifestyle modifications to support nerve health."
