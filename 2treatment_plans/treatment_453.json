    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical presentation is characteris\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with supportive care tailored to the patient's age and health status. The initial priority is arranging prompt biopsy confirmation and staging to assess invasion depth and regional spread. The primary treatment involves surgical excision with adequate margins; this approach offers the best chance for cure and local control. Supportive wound care, pain management, and patient education are integral throughout treatment. Follow-up should be scheduled every three months during the first year to monitor for recurrence and manage complications. The patient should be referred swiftly to a gynecologic oncologist for definitive management and possible lymph node evaluation if indicated. Throughout, address patient concerns empathetically, ensure understanding of procedures, and involve her family support system as preferred. This plan aims to achieve optimal oncological outcomes while maintaining quality of life and minimizing complications.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule biopsy to confirm diagnosis; provide wound care instructions; discuss upcoming surgical consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete staging, surgical planning, and surgery; ensure patient understanding.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence, manage any postoperative complications, and offer psychosocial support.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of follow-up, signs to watch for, wound care tips, and emotional support resources.",
