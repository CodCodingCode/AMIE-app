Diagnostic confirmation with serologic testing for syphilis (VDRL/RPR, confirmatory treponemal tests), along with HIV and other STI screening.\n2. Initiate empiric treatment with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units in a single dose) if suspicion for syphilis is high, pending confirmatory testing. For penicillin-allergic patients, consider doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14 days, with counseling on potential allergy testing.\n3. Educate the patient about the infectious nature of primary syphilis, transmission risks, and the importance of abstaining from sexual activity until treatment completion and serologic follow-up.\n4. Advise symptomatic relief measures if any discomfort occurs, and emphasize the importance of follow-up testing at 3, 6, and 12 months to assess serologic response.\n5. Schedule follow-up in 2-4 weeks to review test results, reassess symptoms, and evaluate lesion and lymphadenopathy resolution.\n6. Discuss safe sex practices, mandatory testing of partners, and possibly notify recent partners for evaluation and treatment.\n7. If serology confirms syphilis, implement structured follow-up to monitor treatment efficacy; if final diagnoses are different (e.g., benign cyst), manage accordingly, but still ensure STI screening.\nThis plan aims to treat the suspected infection, prevent complications, and reinforce sexual health, tailored to the patient\u2019s stoic demeanor with clear, respectful communication and emphasis on the importance of testing and follow-up.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Collect baseline serologies, review allergy history, administer initial treatment if indicated, and provide patient education.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve lesion resolution, complete initial treatment, and obtain follow-up test results.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm serologic response to therapy, ensure no new lesions or symptoms, and reinforce safe sex practices.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about diagnosis, treatment, importance of follow-up, and prevention.",
