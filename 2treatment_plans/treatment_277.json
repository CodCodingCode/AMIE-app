    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach.\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating supplemental oxygen therapy with careful titration to maintain SpO2 around 88-92%, administering nebulized bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium), and corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone 40 mg daily) to reduce airway inflammation. Antibiotics are indicated if infection is suspected. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, mental status, and cardiac rhythm is essential. In addition, patient education on inhaler technique, recognizing worsening symptoms, and smoking cessation is crucial. Long-term management will involve pulmonary rehabilitation and regular follow-up within 24-48 hours after stabilization. This approach aims to rapidly improve respiratory status, prevent deterioration, and optimize COPD control, while minimizing risks of CO2 retention and medication side effects.",
