    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's presentation with progressive, bilateral lower limb weakness, tingling in the hands and feet, increased fatigue, and recent unsteadiness over years suggests a chronic, progressive process affecting the central nervous system. The absence of acute episodes, relapses, or remissions points toward a primary progressive course. The family history of similar symptoms raises suspicion for a demyelinating or autoimmune condition. Symptoms like limb weakness, paresthesia, and gait instability with a gradual progression are characteristic of MS, especially in its primary progressive form. Other conditions like peripheral neuropathy or motor neuron disease are less consistent given the pattern of progression and the sensory involvement. The lack of recent infection or systemic signs reduces the likelihood of infectious or systemic causes.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), the management focus should be on slowing disease progression, addressing symptoms, and providing supportive care. There is no curative treatment currently available for PPMS, but disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as ocrelizumab have been shown to modestly impact disease progression. Symptom management includes addressing fatigue, spasticity, gait instability, and other neurological impairments. Non-pharmacological strategies like physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications can help maintain function and quality of life. It is also important to monitor for potential complications, provide patient education, and coordinate with neurologists specialized in MS for ongoing care.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with confirming the diagnosis via MRI and possibly cerebrospinal fluid analysis, but assuming diagnostic certainty, initiation of disease-modifying therapy such as ocrelizumab is appropriate for PPMS. The primary care physician or psychiatrist should also implement symptomatic management, including physical therapy to improve mobility and strength, occupational therapy for assistance with daily activities, and counseling or support groups to address psychological impact. Pharmacologic options for symptom control may include medications such as amantadine or modafinil for fatigue, spasticity management with baclofen or tizanidine, and analgesics for sensory disturbances. Regular follow-up should be scheduled to monitor disease progression, treatment tolerability, and the emergence of new symptoms, with coordination with neurology specialists as needed."
