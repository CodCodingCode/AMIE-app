    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with supportive care measures tailored to her postpartum status. Initial management should focus on prompt intravenous antibiotic therapy with Clindamycin and Gentamicin to effectively target common pathogens involved in postpartum infections. It\u2019s important to monitor her response closely within 48-72 hours, paying attention to symptom improvement and any signs of deterioration. Patient education should emphasize medication adherence, recognition of warning signs, and the importance of follow-up. Supportive interventions include adequate hydration, rest, and perineal hygiene. Long-term management involves reassessment, potential adjustment of antibiotics based on culture results, and gynecological follow-up to prevent recurrence. This plan aims to rapidly resolve infection, prevent progression to sepsis, and support her recovery while considering her postpartum and emotional state.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV antibiotics (Clindamycin and Gentamicin), assess vital signs, document baseline symptoms, and educate the patient.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptomatic resolution, ensure completing antibiotic course, and monitor for any complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence, address any underlying pelvic issues if present, and support postpartum recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: Explains postpartum endometritis, medication usage, warning signs, and importance of follow-up care.",
