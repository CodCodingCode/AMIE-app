    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment: The patient's eye symptoms (redness, swelling, tearing) started after playing soccer, consistent with traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage. Confidence in this diagnosis is high given history; severity appears mild to moderate as symptoms are recent and not described as vision-threatening. Urgency level is routine, but monitoring for worsening or vision changes is important. Differential considerations include other eye injury or infection, but less likely given presentation.  \n\nStep 2 - Evidence-based treatment selection: Conservative management is first-line for traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage. Topical lubricants and observation are standard, as most resolve spontaneously. Antibiotics are usually unnecessary unless there's evidence of secondary infection. Patient-specific considerations include activity restriction, especially avoiding trauma. No contraindications to observation.  \n\nStep 3 - Pharmacological interventions: Usually, no medications are required unless there is significant discomfort or secondary infection. Artificial tears may be used for symptom relief. No systemic medications needed.  \n\nStep 4 - Non-pharmacological interventions: Advise complete eye rest, avoid rubbing, and protect the eye from further trauma. Educate patient on signs of worsening. Stress the importance of protective eyewear during sports. Sleep hygiene and general health optimization support recovery.  \n\nStep 5 - Monitoring & follow-up: Reassess in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen/develop vision changes. Look for persistent redness, vision loss, pain, or signs of secondary infection. Encourage immediate return if black out, severe pain, or vision changes occur.  \n\nStep 6 - Patient communication: Present the plan clearly, emphasizing conservative management, expected spontaneous resolution, and the importance of protective measures. Address concerns about eye safety and reassure about common recovery. Use straightforward language, reinforce adherence to activity restrictions, and provide written instructions.  \n\nStep 7 - Coordination & referrals: No immediate specialist referral necessary unless symptoms worsen. Consider ophthalmology consultation if unresolved or complications arise. Engage primary care support, and provide educational resources on eye safety.\nANSWER: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the history of trauma and characteristic symptoms. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; symptoms are recent, localized, and not causing vision impairment. - Urgency level: Routine care; monitor for symptom progression. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Secondary infection, corneal abrasion, or more severe ocular trauma.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Observation with supportive care; use of artificial tears if needed. - Supporting evidence: Conservative management is standard for traumatic conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage, which typically resolve spontaneously. - Patient-specific considerations: Recent activity (playing soccer), need for activity modification, reassurance. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unrrelated topical medications unless complications arise.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (lubricating eye drops), administered as needed. - Rationale for selection: To alleviate discomfort and promote healing; minimal side effects. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms usually improve within a few days to a week. - Key side effects to monitor: Rare, but watch for allergic reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider ocular lubricants with antihistamines or consult ophthalmology if no improvement.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Resting the eye, avoiding rubbing or further trauma, protective eyewear during sports. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of benign nature, signs of worsening, and importance of protection. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid activities that may cause further injury until healed. - Behavioral interventions: Use of protective eyewear, hygiene to prevent secondary infection.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassessment in 1 week. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom resolution, absence of pain or vision changes, no secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Vision loss, increasing redness or pain, discharge, or any signs of worsening. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement and patient reassurance.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, straightforward explanation emphasizing the benign, self-limited nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about good prognosis, clarify activity restrictions, and safety measures. - Adherence strategies: Provide written instructions and reinforce importance of follow-up. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for activity modifications and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: None immediately; consider ophthalmology if no improvement or complications. - Other healthcare team members: Support from primary care for overall health or injury prevention. - Community resources: Eye safety education or sports injury prevention resources. - Insurance/cost considerations: Emphasize conservative, low-cost management.  Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes observation with artificial tears, activity modification, and eye protection, supported by patient education. Initial management focuses on symptom relief, reassurance, and preventive measures, while establishing follow-up to ensure spontaneous resolution. Follow-up will include re-evaluation in one week, with instructions for immediate care if worsening occurs. This approach aims for complete recovery with minimal risk while empowering the patient with knowledge and safety practices.   IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:   - Immediate actions (today): Advise the patient to rest the eye, avoid further trauma, and start using artificial tears as needed. Provide eye protection during sports.   - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution, no development of secondary infection or vision changes.   - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full healing, return to normal activity levels, and education on eye safety.   - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the benign nature, use of lubricants, importance of eye protection, activity restrictions, and follow-up schedule.",
