    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of osteoporosis-related vertebral compression fractures, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating bisphosphonate therapy\u2014preferably oral alendronate or IV zoledronic acid depending on malabsorption considerations\u2014alongside calcium and vitamin D supplementation. It emphasizes fall prevention, physical therapy for strength and balance, and patient education on medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Close follow-up will assess symptom progression, medication efficacy, and potential side effects, with repeat bone density testing in 12-24 months. This approach aims to reduce fracture risk, improve quality of life, and maintain functional independence while carefully monitoring for adverse effects and adjusting therapy as needed.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Review renal function and serum calcium levels; discuss treatment options with the patient; initiate supplementation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Ensure medication adherence; start fall prevention strategies; schedule physical therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve adherence, monitor for side effects, evaluate symptom improvement.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about osteoporosis, importance of medication, fall prevention, and lifestyle changes.",
