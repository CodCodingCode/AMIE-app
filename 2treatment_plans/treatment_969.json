    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given the ocular inflammation and systemic symptoms suggest granulomatous disease like sarcoidosis or autoimmune uveitis, but metastasis remains a concern requiring further confirmation. - Severity classification: Likely moderate, as ocular symptoms are recent and not described as vision-threatening, but systemic signs like weight loss and malaise suggest possible systemic involvement. - Urgency level: Urgent, since ocular inflammation can threaten vision if not promptly managed, and systemic signs warrant further prompt investigation. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Malignancy progression, infectious causes of uveitis, other autoimmune conditions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Corticosteroid therapy (topical for ocular inflammation, systemic if systemic involvement is confirmed). - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids effectively reduce granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis and autoimmune uveitis. - Patient-specific considerations: The systemic symptoms and weight loss suggest possible systemic disease; systemic steroids may be appropriate but require careful monitoring. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid in uncontrolled infections, monitor for side effects like hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prednisone 40 mg daily (adjust based on weight and severity), tapering over 4-6 weeks. - Rationale for selection: Well-established efficacy in reducing granulomatous inflammation; systemic use addresses both ocular and systemic symptoms. - Expected timeline for improvement: Visual and systemic symptoms should improve within 1-2 weeks; ocular inflammation may take longer. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood pressure, blood glucose, signs of infection, bone density issues, mood changes. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Immunomodulatory agents like methotrexate or azathioprine, or biologics such as infliximab if corticosteroids are contraindicated or ineffective.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Ensure adequate rest, avoid strenuous activity during acute inflammation, maintain hydration. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, monitoring side effects, recognizing signs of worsening. - Lifestyle modifications: Balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, smoking cessation if applicable, regular gentle exercise. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management techniques, counseling support if needed.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks for initial response; then every 4-6 weeks based on disease activity. - Monitoring parameters: Ocular exam (visual acuity, intraocular pressure), systemic symptoms, blood tests (CBC, blood glucose, liver function). - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, new or worsening ocular pain, signs of infection, uncontrolled systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in ocular redness and discomfort, stabilization or improvement in vision, resolution of systemic symptoms.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Gentle, clear explanation of diagnosis, treatment rationale, and expected outcomes; acknowledge concerns. - Addressing patient concerns: Potential side effects of steroids, impact on quality of life, importance of follow-up. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication schedules, employ reminder systems, involve family members if agreeable. - Family involvement: Encourage family support to monitor for side effects and assist with appointments.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Rheumatology or pulmonology for systemic evaluation; ophthalmology for detailed ocular assessment and management. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators for medication management, possibly a social worker if systemic illness affects functioning. - Community resources: Local support groups for sarcoidosis or autoimmune diseases, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs and coverage options; consider patient assistance programs if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease with ocular involvement (most likely sarcoidosis or autoimmune uveitis), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisone 40 mg daily with gradual taper) to control ocular inflammation and systemic symptoms, alongside close monitoring of response and side effects. Adjunctive measures involve patient education on medication adherence, side effect awareness, and recognizing warning signs. The approach emphasizes timely follow-up with ophthalmology and rheumatology/pulmonology specialists for ongoing assessment, guided by clinical response and laboratory findings. Non-pharmacological interventions focus on lifestyle modifications and stress management to support overall health. This plan aims to reduce inflammation, preserve vision, and address systemic health, while minimizing adverse effects and ensuring sustainable management of the underlying condition.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange ophthalmology consultation for baseline ocular assessment; initiate corticosteroid therapy pending specialist input; order relevant labs (CBC, blood glucose, liver function). - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in ocular inflammation, monitor for medication side effects, reassess systemic symptoms. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission or control, prevent relapses, optimize systemic health, and establish a maintenance plan if needed. - Patient handout summary: Explain diagnosis, importance of medication adherence, potential side effects, signs to watch for, and scheduled follow-up appointments.",
