    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of avian influenza (H5N1), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt antiviral therapy with supportive care measures designed for severe viral pneumonia. The key interventions include initiating oseltamivir within the first 48 hours of illness, providing supportive oxygen and hydration, and maintaining close clinical monitoring for signs of deterioration. This approach emphasizes early aggressive management to reduce mortality, with clear instructions to the patient on medication adherence and signs prompting urgent care. Follow-up will be scheduled within 48-72 hours to assess response and adjust management as needed. Supportive and infection control measures are integral to improving outcomes while minimizing transmission risks. This plan aims to stabilize the patient, prevent complications, and facilitate recovery while addressing safety and adherence considerations.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer oseltamivir, initiate oxygen therapy if hypoxic, and monitor vitals closely.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom stabilization, monitor for side effects, and ensure adherence to therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete antiviral course, evaluate recovery, and assess for any residual respiratory impairment.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of early medication, signs of worsening illness, infection control, and follow-up plan.",
