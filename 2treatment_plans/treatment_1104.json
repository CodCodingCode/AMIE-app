    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on congenital aortic regurgitation and exertional syncope suggesting possible structural cardiac abnormality. - Severity classification: Likely moderate, given recurrent episodes over weeks/months with autonomic features (dizziness, feeling \"off\") and increase in frequency, though symptoms appear intermittent. - Urgency level: Urgent, because syncope during exertion in setting of known congenital cardiac defect poses risk for sudden cardiac events. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmic disorders, autonomic dysfunction, other structural heart defects.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Restriction of physical activity/strenuous exertion and initiation of further diagnostic evaluation, possible medical management depending on findings. - Supporting evidence: Limiting exertion reduces risk of syncope and adverse cardiac events; confirmation of severity guides tailored therapy. - Patient-specific considerations: Adolescent age, activity level, cognitive confusion affecting understanding. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoidance of strenuous activity until definitive diagnosis/treatment plan established.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If indicated, medications are used selectively. - Primary medication choice: Not typically first-line unless heart failure symptoms or severe valve dysfunction; beta-blockers may be considered if hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias are diagnosed. - Rationale for selection: To manage arrhythmogenic potential or reduce myocardial oxygen demand. - Expected timeline for improvement: Variable; symptom monitoring over weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: As above, antiarrhythmic agents or after further diagnostic clarification.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions. - Primary non-drug interventions: Strict activity restriction, increasing awareness of symptoms, avoiding rapid postural changes. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing warning signs, importance of reporting episodes, adherence to activity restrictions. - Lifestyle modifications: Avoid dehydration, stress management, maintaining adequate sleep. - Behavioral interventions: Use of breathing techniques, coping strategies; consider referral for counseling if anxiety affects compliance.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Establish proper follow-up. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks after initial investigations and activity restriction; more frequent if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Frequency/severity of syncope, blood pressure, echocardiography findings, ECG. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening dizziness, chest pain, syncope at rest, palpitations, new or worsening shortness of breath. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in episode frequency, improved activity tolerance, patient symptom diaries.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given patient behavioral style. - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language; repeat key points; verify understanding through teach-back. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety measures, clarify diagnosis, discuss prognosis, and importance of compliance. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize the rationale for activity restrictions, involve family in reminders, provide written summaries. - Family involvement: Include family members in education for better support and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Additional care coordination. - Specialist referrals needed: Cardiology (pediatric or adult congenital), preferably within 1-2 weeks for advanced assessment. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators, possibly a psychologist if anxiety impacts adherence. - Community resources: Support groups for congenital heart disease; educational materials provided. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for tests (echocardiogram, ECG), specialist visits; explore financial counseling if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of congenital aortic regurgitation with exertional syncope likely due to a structural cardiac abnormality, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate activity restriction to prevent syncope and potential cardiac emergencies, detailed diagnostic evaluation\u2014including echocardiography and ECG\u2014and close cardiology follow-up to determine lesion severity and guide further therapy. Lifestyle modifications such as hydration and avoiding rapid postural changes are essential. Patient education will focus on symptom recognition and safety precautions, with family involvement to support adherence. Monitoring will involve regular assessment of symptoms and repeat imaging within 1-2 weeks, with ongoing follow-up every 4-6 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. This approach aims to reduce the risk of adverse events, optimize the patient\u2019s condition, and prepare for possible medical or surgical intervention if indicated, while minimizing potential risks associated with activity or medication side effects.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Advise activity restriction, schedule urgent cardiology consultation, and arrange initial diagnostic testing. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic workup (echocardiogram, ECG), educate patient and family, monitor symptom progression. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stabilize condition, determine need for medical management or surgery, establish ongoing surveillance. - Patient handout summary: Key points about activity restrictions, symptom monitoring, importance of follow-up, and safety measures.",
