The treatment plan includes lifestyle modifications, nutritional supplementation, regular ophthalmologic monitoring, and patient education, with careful attention to individual factors such as symptom progression and visual needs. Initial management focuses on slowing disease progression while establishing long-term monitoring to detect any advancement to more severe stages. Follow-up care will include regular eye examinations every 6 to 12 months, with immediate evaluation if symptoms worsen. This approach is designed to preserve visual function, minimize progression risk, and enhance quality of life, while ensuring safety and patient engagement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient about AMD, advise smoking cessation if applicable, and recommend dietary adjustments emphasizing leafy greens and omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate AREDS2 nutritional supplement regimen, schedule baseline ophthalmology evaluation, and reinforce the importance of routine monitoring.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain lifestyle modifications, monitor for any symptom changes, and reassess visual function regularly.\n- Patient handout summary: Highlight the importance of diet, smoking cessation, regular eye exams, and recognizing new symptoms such as sudden vision loss or distortion.",
