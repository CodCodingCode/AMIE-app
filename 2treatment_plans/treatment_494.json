    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, as clinical presentation and exam indicate cholesteatoma with facial nerve involvement. - Severity classification: Severe, given the presence of facial nerve involvement, which suggests nerve damage and potential for significant complications. - Urgency level: Immediate, because facial nerve involvement indicates possible ongoing invasion or damage requiring prompt intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Malignant middle ear tumors, labyrinthine involvement, or intracranial extension, necessitating further imaging.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical removal of cholesteatoma via mastoidectomy, with possible nerve decompression. - Supporting evidence: Surgery is the definitive treatment for cholesteatoma to prevent further tissue destruction and address facial nerve impairment. - Patient-specific considerations: Adult patient with facial nerve weakness, emphasizing urgent surgical intervention; care to minimize nerve injury during surgery. - Contraindications or cautions: Delay in surgery risks permanent nerve damage and intracranial complications; caution with surgical risks in comorbidities.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg IV or oral taper) to reduce edema and nerve inflammation. - Rationale for selection: Steroids may improve nerve conduction if administered early, although definitive treatment is surgical. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some reduction in nerve edema may be noted within days; functional recovery depends on extent of nerve damage. - Key side effects to monitor: Infection, hyperglycemia, mood changes. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: No specific medications; antibiotics if infection is present.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid activities that increase intratemporal pressure, keep the ear dry, and protect from infection. - Patient education priorities: Importance of surgical intervention, symptoms of worsening, and details about nerve recovery. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain ear hygiene, avoid water exposure, and manage stress to aid recovery. - Behavioral interventions: Use of facial exercises as prescribed, support for anxiety related to neurological deficits.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Surgical outpatient follow-up within 1 week post-op; neurological assessment at 2-4 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Facial nerve function, signs of infection, wound healing, and residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening facial weakness, new or worsening headache, deterioration of hearing, or signs of intracranial involvement. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in facial nerve function over weeks; imaging if needed to assess residual disease.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, compassionate, and reassuring; emphasize the urgency but also outline the step-by-step plan. - Addressing patient concerns: Worries about nerve damage, hearing loss, and surgical risks; provide factual, empathetic responses. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, involve the patient in decision-making, provide written summaries. - Family involvement: Recommend involving a trusted family member for support and help with care instructions.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon urgently for surgical management; neurology consult if neurological deficits persist or worsen. - Other healthcare team members: Audiologist for hearing assessment and rehabilitation; physical therapy for facial nerve recovery support. - Community resources: Support groups for facial nerve palsy, patient education materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss surgical costs and post-op care; provide resources for assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cholesteatoma with facial nerve involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical intervention with supportive medical management and patient-centered care strategies. The primary intervention is urgent mastoidectomy to remove the cholesteatoma and decompress the facial nerve, aiming to prevent further tissue destruction and restore nerve function. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy may be administered to reduce nerve edema and inflammation, improving the likelihood of nerve recovery. Close postoperative follow-up within one week is essential, along with regular assessments of facial nerve function and wound healing. Patient education should focus on the importance of surgery, signs of complication, and expected recovery timeline, addressed empathetically to alleviate anxiety. Lifestyle modifications include ear protection and hygiene measures. Coordination with ENT specialists, neurology, audiology, and support services will ensure comprehensive care. This plan anticipates restoring facial nerve function, preventing further complications, and optimizing the patient's long-term outcomes.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ENT surgical consultation; prepare the patient for possible surgery. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical intervention; monitor facial nerve function and wound healing; initiate physical therapy if indicated. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stabilization or improvement of facial nerve function; monitor for recurrence; assist with hearing rehabilitation if needed. - Patient handout summary: Explanation of cholesteatoma, importance of surgery, expected recovery process, signs to watch for, and follow-up plan.",
