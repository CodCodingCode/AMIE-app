The treatment plan includes initiating urgent IV broad-spectrum antibiotics\u2014specifically, IV ceftriaxone 1g daily, IV doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, and consideration of adding metronidazole if anaerobic infection is suspected\u2014aimed at controlling infection and preventing complications. The patient should be monitored closely for clinical improvement, with reassessment within 48-72 hours, and kept under strict observation for any signs of worsening or rupture.\nInitial management should also include supportive care such as hydration, pain control, and patient education focusing on adherence, recognition of worsening symptoms, and sexual health. Follow-up will involve repeat clinical evaluations, laboratory assessments, and possibly imaging if the patient does not improve or if deterioration occurs.\nThis approach aims to resolve the infection, prevent rupture or abscess progression, and facilitate recovery while preparing for further interventions, including specialist consultation if necessary. Ensuring clear communication, addressing the patient\u2019s concerns, and involving multidisciplinary team members will optimize adherence and outcomes.",
