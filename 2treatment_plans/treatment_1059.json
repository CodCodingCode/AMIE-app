    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given the clinical features of widespread skin peeling, blistering, mucous membrane involvement, and recent drug exposure strongly suggest SJS/TEN. - Severity classification: Severe, due to extensive skin detachment (>30% total body surface area), mucous membrane involvement, systemic symptoms, and potential for rapid deterioration. - Urgency level: Immediate, as this is a life-threatening dermatologic emergency requiring prompt intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other causes of blistering such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (less likely in adults), severe bullous drug reactions, or autoimmune blistering diseases, but clinical presentation aligns best with SJS/TEN.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Immediate cessation of all suspicious medications and supportive intensive care similar to burn management. - Supporting evidence: Early withdrawal of offending drug reduces progression; supportive care reduces mortality. - Patient-specific considerations: Possible involvement of mucous membranes might complicate hydration and nutrition; patient's age and possible comorbidities need to be considered. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid corticosteroids unless in specialized burn or ICU setting, as evidence on steroids is mixed; careful monitoring if used.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: No universally proven specific drug; however, some evidence suggests IVIG, cyclosporine, or TNF-alpha inhibitors may be beneficial. - Rationale for selection: Cyclosporine (3-5 mg/kg/day) has shown promise in reducing progression and mortality. - Expected timeline for improvement: Signs of stabilization may appear within 48-72 hours; clinical improvement varies. - Key side effects to monitor: Renal function (for cyclosporine), infection signs, blood pressure, and liver function. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Plasmapheresis, corticosteroids with caution, or other immunomodulators under specialist guidance.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Strict wound care in a burn unit or ICU setting, moisture balance, infection control, and nutritional support. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of the severity, importance of early supportive care, and potential complications. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, nutritional support to promote healing, and avoidance of stressors. - Behavioral interventions: Psycho-social support as needed; involve family for emotional support.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Daily inpatient monitoring initially; re-assess every 48-72 hours once stable. - Monitoring parameters: Skin integrity, mucous membrane healing, vital signs, labs including renal and liver function, infection markers. - Red flag symptoms: Signs of sepsis, airway compromise, persistent or worsening skin detachment, new mucous membrane involvement. - Treatment response assessment: Stabilization of skin lesions, reduction in new blister formation, improving mucous membrane soreness.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, simple language emphasizing the seriousness and need for urgent supportive care, while providing reassurance about targeted interventions. - Addressing patient concerns: Likely worries about prognosis, pain, and recovery timeline; provide honest yet compassionate information. - Adherence strategies: Ensure understanding of the importance of hospitalization and follow-up; involve family if possible to support adherence. - Family involvement: Encourage family participation in care decisions and emotional support.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Early consultation with dermatology, burn specialists, intensivists, and possibly ophthalmology if ocular involvement. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff experienced in burn care, nutritionists, infectious disease specialists as indicated. - Community resources: Support groups for skin conditions, mental health resources for psychological impact. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss cost of hospitalization, treatments, and supportive therapies; coordinate with case managers.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent supportive care with targeted immunomodulatory therapies. The immediate priority is to stop any offending medication and admit the patient to a specialized burn or intensive care unit for close monitoring and skin care management. Initiate supportive measures including fluid resuscitation, pain control, infection prevention, and nutritional support. Consider starting cyclosporine (3-5 mg/kg/day) to help halt disease progression, with careful monitoring of renal function and blood pressure. Collaborate with dermatology and burn specialists for ongoing assessment, wound care, and treatment adjustments. Educate the patient about the severity of the condition, emphasizing the importance of adherence to supportive care and follow-up. Frequent reassessment is essential, with attention to signs of infection, systemic complications, and mucous membrane healing. Involve the patient's family in care discussions to enhance support and adherence. Coordinate multidisciplinary care, including ophthalmology and mental health services if needed, ensuring a comprehensive recovery plan. The goal is to stabilize the patient, prevent complications, and promote skin and mucosal healing for optimal recovery.",
