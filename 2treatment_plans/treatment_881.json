    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High certainty that this is an eyelid contusion or traumatic conjunctivitis given recent injury and symptoms. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; redness and tearing with swelling are present but no vision changes or more profound signs. - Urgency level: Routine care, as symptoms are recent and no evidence of complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Corneal abrasion or foreign body, hyphema, or serious ocular injury if symptoms worsen.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Symptomatic management with guarding, cold compresses, and artificial tears. - Supporting evidence: Rest and cold compresses reduce swelling, artificial tears soothe irritation; evidence supports conservative approaches for minor traumatic conjunctivitis. - Patient-specific considerations: Playing soccer increased trauma risk; ensure no foreign body. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid rubbing the eye; monitor for signs of worsening.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical lubricants (artificial tears) as needed; if conjunctivitis appears infectious or symptomatic, consider topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, applied twice daily for 3\u20135 days). - Rationale for selection: Non-invasive and effective for symptomatic relief; antibiotics if signs of infection. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 24\u201348 hours; full resolution in 3\u20137 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Allergic reactions to ointments, worsening redness, or pain. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Preservative-free artificial tears; different antibiotics if infection persists.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Avoid rubbing the eyes, rest from strenuous activity, protect the eye from further trauma. - Patient education priorities: Importance of avoiding further injury, signs of complications. - Lifestyle modifications: No specific diet changes, but recommend avoiding eye irritants. - Behavioral interventions: Use protective eyewear during sports to prevent further trauma.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48\u201372 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom persistence, worsening redness, pain, vision changes. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe pain, worsening redness, eye discharge, or signs of penetration. - Treatment response assessment: Decrease in redness, tearing, swelling; improvement in comfort.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Clear, simple explanations with reassurance; provide written instructions. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize safety, importance of follow-up, and avoiding further injury. - Adherence strategies: Use visual aids, confirm understanding with teach-back, and provide written care plan. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family members to support care and follow-up adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation if symptoms worsen, no improvement in 48\u201372 hours, or if signs of serious injury. - Other healthcare team members: Possible involvement of nursing staff for follow-up at home. - Community resources: Provide eye injury prevention education, sports safety info. - Insurance/cost considerations: Use OTC artificial tears initially; discuss cost of prescriptions if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of eyelid contusion or traumatic conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines symptomatic management with careful monitoring. Key interventions include applying cold packs and advising rest, using artificial tears for comfort, and considering topical antibiotic ointment if signs of infection develop. The plan emphasizes protecting the eye from further trauma, providing patient education, and scheduling a follow-up within 48-72 hours to assess healing. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate care if they experience vision changes, increasing pain, or worsening redness. Involving an ophthalmologist is advisable if symptoms do not improve or if complications are suspected. This approach aims to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and promote safe recovery with minimized risks.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Apply cold compresses, advise rest and eye protection, and provide symptomatic treatment. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce redness, swelling, tearing; prevent further injury; ensure no signs of infection or serious injury. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Full healing, prevention of future trauma, and patient education on eye safety. - Patient handout summary: Rest and protect the eye; use artificial tears; monitor symptoms; seek urgent care if condition worsens or vision changes occur.",
