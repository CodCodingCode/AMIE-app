    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Very low; the final diagnosis indicates retinal detachment, but the patient\u2019s context mentions thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The initial presentation suggests possible ocular detachment, which requires urgent ophthalmologic assessment regardless. The ultimate diagnosis is retinal detachment, so I will proceed accordingly. - Severity classification: Likely severe, given the presence of floaters, ocular swelling, and blurred vision persisting over days\u2014signs suggest an urgent detachment, especially if considering symptoms like floaters and visual disturbances. - Urgency level: Immediate to urgent referral for ophthalmologic evaluation is necessary to prevent permanent vision loss. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other causes of visual symptoms (e.g., vitreal hemorrhage, central retinal artery occlusion), which are less likely but warrant assessment.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Prompt ophthalmologic surgical repair (e.g., pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, or vitrectomy). - Supporting evidence: Surgical intervention is the definitive treatment for retinal detachment to reattach the retina and prevent further deterioration. - Patient-specific considerations: Her desire for pregnancy requires careful discussion about anesthesia and surgery timing; her minimal reported symptoms might underestimate severity, so urgent assessment is vital. - Contraindications or cautions: Delay in surgery risks permanent vision loss; avoid delaying referral.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are needed preoperatively. - Primary medication choice: None specific for retinal detachment; however, advising control of any associated symptoms like pain or nausea with analgesics or antiemetics as needed. - Rationale for selection: Medications are supportive; definitive treatment is surgical. - Expected timeline for improvement: Visual recovery depends on successful reattachment; initial stabilization is immediate once surgery is performed. - Key side effects to monitor: N/A for surgery; monitor anesthesia-related risks. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: N/A; treatment is surgical.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Keep the affected eye immobilized if advised and avoid activities that increase intraocular pressure. - Patient education priorities: Explain urgency of surgery, expectations, and risks of delay. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest as recommended; avoid strenuous activity until cleared. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction and adherence to follow-up.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Urgent ophthalmology review within 24-48 hours. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, symptom progression, signs of re-detachment. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden increase in pain, new floaters, flashes, or rapid vision loss\u2014seek immediate care. - Treatment response assessment: Postoperative re-examination to confirm attachment stability and visual improvement.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given her baseline behavior, I will communicate clearly and empathetically. - Communication approach: Use straightforward language, emphasizing urgency and importance of prompt surgical intervention. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about surgical safety, discuss fertility considerations, and clarify prognosis. - Adherence strategies: Ensure understanding of follow-up importance, involve family if helpful. - Family involvement: With her consent, involve family members to support adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Immediate outpatient consultation with ophthalmology; potentially to a retinal specialist. - Other healthcare team members: Ophthalmic nurse educators, if available. - Community resources: Patient education materials on retinal detachment. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for urgent surgery and assist with scheduling.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of retinal detachment, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical intervention with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt referral to an ophthalmologist for surgical repair, which is essential for reattaching the retina and preserving vision. Prior to surgery, supportive measures such as analgesics or antiemetics can be used if needed, but the primary focus remains on expediting surgical management. Patient education is crucial to convey the urgency of the condition, explain surgical options, and set appropriate expectations about recovery and prognosis.  Initial management emphasizes urgent ophthalmologic evaluation within 24-48 hours. Postoperative follow-up will be critical to assess reattachment, monitor for complications, and optimize visual outcomes. Lifestyle modifications include rest and avoiding activities that increase intraocular pressure. Clear communication, addressing her specific concerns about pregnancy and safety, will help improve compliance. Coordination with ophthalmology specialists is essential to ensure timely surgical care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Contact ophthalmology for urgent referral; advise patient on the importance of prompt evaluation. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical repair; monitor for postoperative complications and initial visual recovery. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve retinal stability, assess visual function, and conduct regular follow-up to detect late complications. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of surgery, postoperative care instructions, signs of detachment recurrence, and importance of follow-up visits.",
