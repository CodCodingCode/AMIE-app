    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderately confident, but definitive diagnosis of lymphoma with ocular involvement suggests systemic disease rather than isolated uveitis or scleritis. - Severity classification: Likely severe given systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) and ocular symptoms (floaters, blurriness), indicating active systemic and ocular disease. - Urgency level: Urgent, as ocular involvement with systemic lymphoma warrants prompt intervention to prevent vision loss and systemic complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Ocular lymphoma infiltration, infectious causes (e.g., viral, bacterial, or fungal), other autoimmune processes.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate systemic corticosteroids to control inflammatory ocular symptoms, alongside chemotherapy/radiotherapy for lymphoma. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are first-line for intraocular inflammation, but definitive lymphoma treatment takes precedence. - Patient-specific considerations: Immunosuppression with corticosteroids may affect lymphoma management; collaborative oncology input is critical. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid long-term high-dose steroids without oncologist coordination, watch for immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1 mg/kg/day), with dose tapering based on response. - Rationale for selection: Rapid inflammation control; essential for symptomatic relief and ocular protection. - Expected timeline for improvement: Within 1-2 weeks for ocular symptoms, but systemic symptoms may need longer to improve. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood sugar, blood pressure, signs of infection, weight gain, mood changes. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine) under specialist supervision.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Patient education on ocular hygiene, systemic disease implications, and adherence. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of systemic-ocular link, importance of follow-up, potential side effects. - Lifestyle modifications: Healthy diet, smoking cessation, stress management. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction techniques, support groups for lymphoma patients.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-examine ocular status in 1-2 weeks; oncology follow-up as per protocol. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp exam findings, systemic symptom progression, blood glucose. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening vision, new pain, eye redness, fever spikes, new neurological symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in ocular inflammation signs, stabilization or improvement of systemic symptoms.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, and informative, tailoring complexity to baseline behavioral style. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain disease severity, rationale for treatments, potential side effects, and importance of adherence. - Adherence strategies: Regular reminders, simplified medication schedules, engaging the patient in care planning. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family to support treatment adherence and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Oncology/hematology urgently for lymphoma management, ophthalmology for intraocular assessment. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care, oncology nurse specialists. - Community resources: Patient support groups, lymphoma foundations. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with medication coverage and scheduling to reduce financial barriers.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of uveitis or scleritis associated with systemic inflammatory/infectious disease, specifically confirmed or suspected systemic lymphoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating systemic corticosteroids to control ocular inflammation, coordinating promptly with hematology/oncology specialists for the systemic lymphoma management, and providing supportive care and education to the patient. Immediate management focuses on controlling eye symptoms and systemic disease activity while establishing a long-term plan for lymphoma treatment and ocular health. Follow-up care will include ocular examinations within 1-2 weeks, regular monitoring of systemic symptoms, and collaboration with oncology for ongoing therapy. Patient education will emphasize the importance of adherence, symptom reporting, and understanding the interplay between systemic and ocular health. This approach aims to preserve vision, manage systemic disease effectively, and minimize adverse effects, with continuous monitoring and multidisciplinary coordination for optimal outcomes.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology and oncology consultations; start corticosteroids with dosing instructions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in ocular inflammation; stabilize systemic symptoms; initiate definitive lymphoma therapy. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain ocular health, achieve lymphoma remission, and monitor for treatment side effects and disease relapse. - Patient handout summary: Include points on medication adherence, warning signs to report immediately, and importance of follow-up appointments.",
