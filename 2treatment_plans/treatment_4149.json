The observed slight wrist swelling and difficulty with fine motor tasks support this. No neck pain, systemic symptoms, trauma, or other joint issues are reported, making cervical radiculopathy or inflammatory joint disease less likely. Conservative measures such as wrist splints and activity modifications are appropriate initial treatments for CTS.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's presentation of numbness and burning sensations in the median nerve distribution of the left hand, exacerbated by wrist movements and at night, along with mild swelling and difficulty with fine motor tasks, the diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is appropriate. As this is a relatively recent onset (6 weeks), initial management should focus on conservative, non-invasive measures to relieve pressure on the median nerve and prevent progression. These measures are practical for primary care or psychiatric providers to implement and can be monitored over time. Pharmacologic options can be considered if symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative measures. Overall, the goal is to alleviate symptoms, improve function, and avoid unnecessary surgical intervention at this stage.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves educating the patient about activity modifications, such as avoiding repetitive wrist movements and maintaining proper ergonomics. The patient should be advised to wear a neutral wrist splint, particularly during nighttime, to reduce wrist extension and minimize median nerve compression temporarily. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can be used as needed for symptom relief. Additionally, the patient should be encouraged to take regular breaks from activities that worsen symptoms and perform gentle wrist stretches or nerve gliding exercises if tolerated. If symptoms do not improve within 6-8 weeks or worsen, referral for further evaluation, including nerve conduction studies, and consideration of corticosteroid injection or surgical release may be warranted."
