    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt neuroimaging (CT or MRI) to exclude stroke or other structural pathology, initiation of antiplatelet therapy with 81 mg aspirin daily if indicated, and addressing modifiable risk factors such as blood pressure, smoking, and lifestyle habits. Given the patient's stress-related symptoms and visual disturbances, a careful neurological and psychiatric evaluation is essential to differentiate functional/dissociative symptoms from organic disease.\nInitial management focuses on ruling out acute cerebrovascular events, providing education on symptom recognition, and advocating for lifestyle modifications. Follow-up care will involve neurologic assessment in 1-2 weeks, monitoring symptom progression, medication adherence, and risk factor control. The long-term strategy emphasizes stroke prevention, stress management, and psychological support if needed, aiming to reduce recurrence and improve quality of life.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent neuroimaging and neurological consultation; initiate aspirin 81 mg daily after exclusion of bleeding risk.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, optimize risk factor management, provide patient education, and organize follow-up.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve risk factor control, monitor for recurrent symptoms, and consider mental health support.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of follow-up, medication adherence, symptom reporting, lifestyle changes, and stress management strategies.",
