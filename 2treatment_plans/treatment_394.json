    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cat-scratch disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes observational management with consideration of azithromycin therapy for symptomatic lymphadenopathy, in addition to supportive measures such as rest, hydration, and avoidance of further scratches. Initial management focuses on symptomatic relief and education, with close follow-up in 1-2 weeks to assess response and monitor for complications. The patient should be instructed on warning signs requiring urgent evaluation, such as rapidly enlarging lymph nodes or signs of abscess. Follow-up plans aim to ensure gradual resolution while minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use. This approach strives for symptomatic relief, minimizes side effects, and encourages active patient and family involvement to improve adherence and outcomes.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient and family about the condition, start supportive care, and consider initiating azithromycin if symptoms are bothersome.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, reinforce hygiene and pet safety measures, and reassess clinical response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete immune recovery, prevent recurrence, and ensure no residual or worsening symptoms.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about cat-scratch disease, treatment plan, warning signs, and follow-up instructions.",
