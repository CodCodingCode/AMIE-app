    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of gradually worsening limb weakness, sensory disturbances (numbness, tingling, blurry vision), episodes of unsteadiness, and symptoms worse with heat and activity are characteristic of a demyelinating disorder such as MS. The episodic nature of symptoms, along with improvement in some episodes and worsening with heat (Uhthoff's phenomenon), strongly suggests MS. The absence of eye pain with movement and no visual loss reduces the likelihood of optic neuritis as an initial presentation, but the corner vision blurring could be consistent with visual pathway involvement. The pattern of relapsing symptoms with progressive difficulty over time is typical of relapsing-remitting MS. The lack of bowel or bladder issues and preserved cognition suggests early or less aggressive disease. Alternatively, other possibilities like peripheral neuropathy or other autoimmune conditions are less consistent given the central nervous system symptoms and progression pattern.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), the primary goals are to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, delay progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. Since the patient has characteristic episodes of neurological symptoms with some recovery and worsening with heat, along with no current evidence of severe disability or contraindications, starting disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is appropriate. Non-pharmacological measures such as patient education, lifestyle modifications (regular exercise, heat avoidance, stress management), and physical therapy can help optimize function and manage symptoms. The absence of significant disability or comorbidities suggests initiating a first-line DMT like interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate, which have well-established efficacy and safety profiles, or considering newer oral agents if preferred. Symptomatic treatments such as physical therapy for weakness, OT for coordination issues, and addressing fatigue or spasticity can be incorporated. Regular monitoring for side effects, adherence, and disease activity should be part of the ongoing management plan.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating a disease-modifying therapy (such as interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or an oral agent like dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, or fingolimod) to reduce relapse frequency and disease progression. The patient should be referred to a neurologist specializing in MS for confirmation and tailored therapy selection. Additionally, I recommend enrolling the patient in a multidisciplinary program that includes physical and occupational therapy, and providing education about MS, heat avoidance, and fatigue management. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor treatment response, side effects, and disease progression, with MRI scans as indicated for ongoing assessment."
