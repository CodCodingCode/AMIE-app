The treatment plan includes initiating AREDS2-based antioxidant supplementation to slow disease progression, emphasizing lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and dietary improvements, and scheduling regular ophthalmologic evaluations to monitor disease stability or progression. In cases of suspected wet AMD, prompt referral for anti-VEGF therapy would be necessary. Initial management focuses on patient education, nutritional support, and close follow-up while establishing long-term monitoring to preserve visual function. Follow-up care will include periodic assessment of visual acuity and retinal imaging, with particular attention to any signs suggesting neovascular activity. This approach aims to stabilize vision, improve quality of life, and minimize risks, while carefully avoiding unnecessary interventions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Refer for detailed ophthalmologic assessment, discuss importance of lifestyle changes, and start AREDS2 supplements.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis with ophthalmology, educate patient on disease course, and reinforce adherence to supplements.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for progression via regular eye exams, maintain compliance with lifestyle modifications, and consider low vision support if needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points about macular degeneration, importance of supplements, lifestyle tips, and follow-up schedule.",
