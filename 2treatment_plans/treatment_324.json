    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the initial presentation of ocular redness, swelling, tenderness, and subjective visual disturbances, and considering the final diagnosis of scleritis, I am highly confident in this diagnosis. - Severity classification: The presence of significant inflammation signs (redness, tenderness, swelling) indicates at least moderate severity; the absence of overt complications or profound visual loss suggests it is not severe at this stage. - Urgency level: Scleritis can progress rapidly and threaten vision; thus, it warrants urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and initiation of treatment. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Infectious causes (e.g., bacterial, viral, parasitic like Taenia solium), autoimmune etiologies, or other ocular inflammations should be considered and ruled out through further assessment.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate systemic corticosteroids for inflammation control, alongside local therapies if appropriate. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are standard for non-infectious scleritis to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. - Patient-specific considerations: Consider the possibility that infectious causes (e.g., Taenia solium) could be involved, requiring cautious evaluation before immunosuppressive therapy. - Contraindications or cautions: Must exclude infectious etiologies before starting immunosuppression; monitor for systemic side effects if corticosteroids are used.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Start oral prednisone at 40-60 mg daily, tapering as inflammation subsides. - Rationale for selection: Corticosteroids effectively suppress inflammation in scleritis; they are first-line in immune-mediated cases. - Expected timeline for improvement: Usually within 3-7 days, with signs of reduced redness, pain, and swelling. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood glucose, blood pressure, signs of infection, mood changes, osteoporosis risk with prolonged use. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate) for refractory cases, after consultation with ophthalmology/rheumatology.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Eye rest and protection; avoid irritants. - Patient education priorities: Importance of medication adherence, recognizing warning signs of worsening. - Lifestyle modifications: Stress reduction if autoimmune etiology suspected; ensure adequate sleep. - Behavioral interventions: Regular follow-up visits; supportive counseling if needed for compliance.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-7 days to evaluate response; more frequent if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity, ocular examination findings, side effects of medications. - Red flag symptoms: Increased pain, sudden visual loss, new floaters, flashes, or signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in redness, tenderness, and swelling; improvement in visual disturbances.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (baseline), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, direct language emphasizing the need for prompt treatment and follow-up. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the importance of treatment, potential side effects, and addressing fears about medication. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimen, schedule regular follow-up, provide written instructions. - Family involvement: Encourage support from family to assist with adherence and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Prompt consultation with ophthalmology for detailed assessment, possible imaging, and invasive procedures if indicated. - Other healthcare team members: Consider rheumatology consultation if autoimmune etiology suspected. - Community resources: Provide educational materials about eye care and autoimmune diseases. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs, arrange for assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of scleritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone 40-60 mg daily) to control inflammation, pending exclusion of infectious causes, with close ophthalmologic follow-up within 3-7 days. Supportive measures include eye rest and patient education on medication adherence, potential side effects, and warning signs of deterioration. Long-term management will focus on tapering steroids based on response, monitoring for side effects, and addressing underlying causes if identified. Coordination with ophthalmology is essential for detailed assessment and possible adjunct therapies. This approach aims to resolve ocular inflammation, prevent complications, and optimize visual outcomes while safeguarding patient safety through vigilant monitoring.",
