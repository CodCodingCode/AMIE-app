    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis or infectious meningitis with seizure activity secondary to measles, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive hospitalization with targeted pharmacologic therapy and patient-centered education. The initial management prioritizes hospital admission for close neurological monitoring, IV anticonvulsants to control seizure activity, and supportive measures such as hydration and rest. Supportive care and ongoing assessment will be essential, with referrals to neurologists and infectious disease specialists within the first 48 hours. The care plan includes careful monitoring for neurological worsening, managing seizures effectively, and providing clear, reassuring communication adapted to the patient\u2019s information_withholder style. Long-term management will involve outpatient follow-up, potential rehabilitation if neurological deficits remain, and vaccination counseling to prevent future infections. This integrated approach aims to optimize neurological recovery, minimize complications, and ensure the patient and family are informed and engaged in care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate hospitalization, confirm airway stability, start IV anticonvulsants if seizures occur, obtain baseline labs and neuroimaging as indicated.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve seizure control, monitor for complications, begin outpatient follow-up, and provide education on measles and prevention.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure neurological recovery, complete vaccination schedule, and minimize risk of recurrence or secondary complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include importance of hospitalization, seizure management, hydration, infection control, and upcoming follow-up.",
