    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)\nJustification: The patient's age (12 years), seizure characteristics\u2014stereotyped episodes involving myoclonic jerks, stiffness, automatisms, and possible initial sensations (\"dizzy,\" \"foggy\")\u2014are consistent with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The variability in seizure duration and presentation, along with triggers such as stress and fatigue, aligns with known precipitating factors for JME. The presence of post-ictal confusion and fatigue further supports this diagnosis. While some features overlap with other generalized epilepsies, the age, seizure semiology, and triggers most closely fit JME. The absence of specific features like tongue biting or specific EEG data does not preclude diagnosis, but the clinical presentation is typical.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nJuvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) typically requires pharmacological management with broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs, as well as lifestyle modifications to minimize seizure triggers such as stress, fatigue, and sleep deprivation. Given the patient's age and seizure presentation, initiating therapy with a medication like valproic acid or levetiracetam can be effective. Non-pharmacological interventions include educating the patient and family about seizure management, ensuring consistent sleep schedules, stress reduction techniques, and avoiding known triggers. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor treatment response and side effects. Since the patient is young and the diagnosis appears clear, starting with medication combined with lifestyle advice provides a practical and immediate approach manageable in a primary care or psychiatric setting.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should include starting the patient on an appropriate broad-spectrum antiepileptic medication such as levetiracetam or valproic acid, with dosage individualized based on age, weight, and tolerability. In addition to medication, it is important to counsel the patient and family on maintaining good sleep hygiene, managing stress, and avoiding seizure triggers like fatigue. Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled to assess seizure control, medication side effects, and adherence. Education about safety measures during seizures, including supervision and activity modifications as needed, will also support comprehensive management."
