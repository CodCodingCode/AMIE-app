    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Essential Tremor\nJustification: The patient's age (38 years old) and presentation of involuntary jerking movements and tremors predominantly affecting the hands and arms, especially during fatigue or stress, are characteristic features of essential tremor. The symptoms are intermittent, fluctuate over time, and interfere with fine motor tasks such as writing, which aligns with typical essential tremor phenomenology. The absence of other neurological signs like rigidity, abnormal postures, or gait disturbance also supports this diagnosis. The presence of a \"shaky\" feeling and difficulty fine-tuning movements in the absence of other features reduces the likelihood of other movement disorders like Parkinson's disease or dystonia.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nEssential Tremor END",
    "output": "THINKING: Essential tremor is a benign movement disorder characterized by action-induced tremors primarily affecting the hands and arms. Since the patient's symptoms are interfering with daily fine motor activities, pharmacological therapy is appropriate. First-line medications typically include propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, or primidone, an anticonvulsant. Non-pharmacological strategies such as patient education about tremor exacerbating factors (stress, fatigue) and occupational therapy to adapt daily activities can be beneficial. Given the patient's relatively young age and the functional impairment described, initiating a medication with a favorable side effect profile is prudent. Close follow-up is essential to assess response and side effects.\n\nANSWER: I recommend starting the patient on a low-dose propranolol (e.g., 40 mg twice daily), monitoring for efficacy and tolerability. If beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, consider initiating primidone, beginning at a low dose (e.g., 25 mg at bedtime) and titrating gradually. Additionally, advise the patient on lifestyle modifications to avoid known triggers of tremor worsening, such as caffeine and stress. If tremor persists or worsens despite medication, referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and consideration of advanced therapies, such as deep brain stimulation, may be appropriate in the future. Regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression and medication side effects is essential."
