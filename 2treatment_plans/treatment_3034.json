    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)\nJustification: The patient's episodes of dizziness are relatively brief (15-30 minutes), episodic, triggered by quick head movements and positional changes, and occur in response to specific head positions (e.g., turning in bed). These features are classic for BPPV, caused by displaced otoconia within the semicircular canals. The absence of recent trauma, ear infection, or other illnesses supports a benign positional vertigo diagnosis. Her normal inter-episode state further suggests a peripheral vestibular issue rather than central pathology. Stress and visual triggers can sometimes elicit dizziness in BPPV, consistent with her history.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nBenign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of BPPV, the primary treatment focus is on repositioning maneuvers to resolve otoconia displacement within the semicircular canals, which are effective and have a high success rate. These maneuvers, such as the Epley or Semont maneuver, can be performed by a primary care physician or psychiatrist trained in vestibular treatments or referred to a specialist if needed. Pharmacologic therapy is generally not indicated as a first-line treatment for BPPV but may be used temporarily for symptomatic relief in cases of severe vertigo or associated nausea. Non-pharmacological approaches like patient education about the benign nature of the condition, safety precautions to prevent falls, and instructions to avoid rapid head movements during symptomatic periods are essential adjuncts. Overall, the goal is to promptly perform canalith repositioning maneuvers, provide patient education, and monitor for symptom resolution.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating canalith repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley maneuver to physically move displaced otoconia back into the utricle. If performed in the clinic or by the patient with proper guidance, these can often resolve symptoms in a single session. Patients should be advised to avoid sudden head movements and sleep with elevated head position during episodes. Consider prescribing vestibular rehabilitation exercises if symptoms persist, and educate the patient about the benign nature of BPPV, emphasizing the likelihood of symptom resolution and the possibility of recurrence. Pharmacologic treatment is generally unnecessary but may include short-term use of antihistamines or antiemetics (e.g., meclizine or promethazine) if vertigo symptoms are severe or associated with nausea. Regular follow-up should be arranged to assess symptom resolution and discuss further management if needed."
