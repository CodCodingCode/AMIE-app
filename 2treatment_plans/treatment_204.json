    "output": "THINKING: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: I am fairly confident that the lesion described as an atypical (dysplastic) nevus fits with the clinic\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of atypical (dysplastic) nevus, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes arranging an excisional biopsy of the suspicious lesions to obtain definitive histopathologic diagnosis, along with counseling on sun protection and skin monitoring. The plan considers the patient's anxiety by providing clear information, reassurance, and plans for regular follow-up. Initial management focuses on surgical removal, with an emphasis on thorough examination and patient education to prevent future risks. Follow-up care will include monitoring healing, screening for new or changing lesions, and ongoing risk assessment. This approach aims to accurately diagnose, reduce the potential for melanoma development, and support the patient's emotional well-being, while minimizing unnecessary interventions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Schedule excisional biopsy of the most suspicious lesions; provide sun protection counseling; give patient educational materials.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete wound healing; review biopsy results; reinforce skin self-examination techniques.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Establish routine skin surveillance; address any new concerns; continue education and anxiety management as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of sun protection, skin monitoring, understanding atypical nevi, and follow-up schedule for ongoing skin health management.",
