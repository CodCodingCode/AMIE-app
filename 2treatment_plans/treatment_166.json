    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the systemic symptoms, joint swellin\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy with prednisone to rapidly control inflammation, supplemented by immunosuppressive agents as needed for disease control. Immediate management focuses on reducing systemic inflammation while monitoring for organ involvement and infection risk. Long-term management involves ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, regular lab monitoring, and patient education to promote adherence and early detection of flares.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent rheumatology consultation, order baseline labs (CBC, renal/liver function, urinalysis, ANA, anti-dsDNA), and start patient education.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptom control, monitor for medication side effects, and adjust treatment based on response.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain disease remission, prevent organ damage, and address lifestyle factors.\n- Patient handout summary: Include key points about disease, medications, possible side effects, importance of follow-up, and symptom monitoring.",
