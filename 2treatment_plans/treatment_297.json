The treatment plan includes initiating oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate 325 mg three times daily, along with dietary counseling to increase iron intake. Close follow-up in 2-4 weeks to monitor hemoglobin, ferritin, and symptom improvement is essential. Concurrently, arranging gynecologic assessment to evaluate and manage heavy menstrual bleeding is crucial for long-term control. Educating the patient about medication adherence, recognizing adverse effects, and lifestyle modifications will support recovery. This approach aims to replenish iron stores, alleviate symptoms, and address underlying menstrual issues to prevent recurrence, while minimizing side effects and ensuring sustainable, coordinated care.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe ferrous sulfate 325 mg TID, provide education on medication use and dietary changes, and schedule follow-up labs in 2 weeks.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess symptom improvement, monitor labs, and reinforce adherence.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve normalized hemoglobin, monitor menstrual pattern, and implement/or adjust gynecologic treatment.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on medication, diet, warning signs, follow-up schedule, and importance of gynecologic consultation.",
