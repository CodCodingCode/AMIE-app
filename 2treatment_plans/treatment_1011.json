    "output": "THINKING: This patient presents with symptoms consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE), such as exertional shortness of breath, dizziness, near-syncope, and malaise. The context of rapid symptom progression over two weeks and new onset suggests the need for urgent assessment and treatment. The patient's underlying hematologic condition (B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma) and possible risk factors (immobility, hypercoagulability) increase PE risk. Confirming the diagnosis via imaging (e.g., CT pulmonary angiography) is critical, and once confirmed, management must be initiated promptly. The severity appears moderate to severe given the episodes of presyncope and significant functional impairment. Immediate treatment aims to prevent morbidity and mortality, while supportive care addresses underlying causes and prevents recurrence.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt anticoagulation therapy to prevent clot extension and facilitate resolution, initial stabilization if needed, and ongoing supportive care with close monitoring. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient and confirming diagnosis with imaging, while establishing long-term anticoagulation and risk assessment. Follow-up care will include regular monitoring of coagulation parameters, patient education about symptom recognition and activity restrictions, and coordination with hematology for ongoing management considering underlying leukemia. This approach aims to prevent PE progression, reduce recurrence risk, and improve functional status, while minimizing bleeding risk associated with anticoagulation.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging (CT pulmonary angiography) to confirm PE; initiate low molecular weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) for anticoagulation pending results; monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Transition to oral anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin with bridging or direct oral anticoagulant like rivaroxaban), educate patient about medication adherence, teach symptom monitoring, and assess for bleeding complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Continue anticoagulation as per guidelines, evaluate for continuation or modification of therapy, and address underlying risk factors related to leukemia. - Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding PE signs and symptoms, medication adherence importance, recognizing bleeding or worsening symptoms, activity modifications during anticoagulation, and when to seek urgent care.",
