    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of severe headache,\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt initiation of empirical intravenous antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) along with corticosteroids (dexamethasone) to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. Supportive care such as hydration and neuro-monitoring is essential to maintain stability. The patient should be hospitalized immediately for close observation and management.\nInitial management focuses on rapid antibiotic and corticosteroid administration, with continuous assessment of neurological status and vital signs. Follow-up care post-discharge will include outpatient neurological evaluation within 1-2 weeks, monitoring for signs of complications, and ensuring adherence to therapy. Key patient education points include recognizing warning signs that require urgent medical attention and understanding the importance of completing the prescribed treatment.\nThis approach aims to reduce mortality risk, prevent neurological sequelae, and facilitate recovery while addressing the patient's specific needs and ensuring safety.",
