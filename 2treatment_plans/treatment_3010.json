    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes limited social engagement, lack of typical age-appropriate play, restricted responses to social stimuli (such as not making eye contact or responding when called), and sensory sensitivities (to loud noises and bright lights). She exhibits behaviors common in ASD, such as staring at objects for extended periods, limited expressive language, and altered social interactions. These hallmark features strongly suggest ASD, especially given her age and developmental profile. Alternative diagnoses (e.g., global developmental delay or specific sensory processing disorder) may coexist, but the core features point toward ASD as the most probable diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the child's diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the treatment approach should be comprehensive and individualized, focusing on improving social communication, reducing challenging behaviors, and supporting sensory regulation. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early intensive behavioral therapy (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis) are foundational and should be initiated as soon as possible to promote skill development in communication, social interactions, and adaptive behaviors. Additionally, speech and occupational therapy can help address expressive language delays and sensory sensitivities, respectively. These therapies can significantly enhance the child's developmental trajectory and quality of life. Pharmacological treatment is not routinely first-line but may be considered if there are associated behavioral challenges such as severe irritability, hyperactivity, or impulsivity that interfere with therapy or daily functioning. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., sertraline) or atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone or aripiprazole) may be prescribed under specialist supervision to manage these symptoms. Overall, a multidisciplinary approach involving the primary care provider, neurologist or psychiatrist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and possibly behavior specialists is advisable to support the child's developmental and behavioral needs effectively.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with initiating early intervention programs, including applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy and speech and occupational therapy, to promote social, communication, and adaptive skills. Parental training and support are also essential to help caregivers implement behaviors and facilitate development in everyday settings. A comprehensive sensory assessment can guide tailored sensory integration strategies at home and school. If the child exhibits significant behavioral challenges such as severe irritability or hyperactivity that impede therapy participation or daily functioning, consider pharmacological intervention under specialist guidance, such as a low-dose atypical antipsychotic (risperidone or aripiprazole) for irritability or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., sertraline) for anxiety or obsessive behaviors. Regular follow-up to monitor progress and adapt interventions as needed should be scheduled, ensuring a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to maximize developmental outcomes."
