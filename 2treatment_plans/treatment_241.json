    "output": "THINKING: In this case, the primary diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome (CES), which is a surgical emergency. Although the initial finding is intervertebral disc degeneration without prolapse, the clinical prese\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical decompression with supportive medical management and patient-centered communication. The key interventions include immediate surgical consultation for decompression, bladder management via catheterization, and close neurological monitoring. The plan emphasizes the urgency of intervention to maximize neurological recovery while providing clear education to the patient about the condition and the risks involved. Postoperative follow-up will focus on functional recovery, symptom stabilization, and rehabilitation to optimize long-term outcomes. This approach aims to prevent permanent deficits, alleviate symptoms, and support the patient through a coordinated multidisciplinary effort.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent surgical consultation, initiate bladder catheterization, stabilize the patient, and perform initial assessments.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical decompression, monitor neurological and bladder function, and address postoperative pain.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve neurological recovery, restore bladder and motor functions, and commence rehabilitation.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the emergency nature of the condition, plan for surgery, importance of follow-up, and signs of worsening to watch for.",
