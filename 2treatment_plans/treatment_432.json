    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop my treatment plan for conjunctivitis likely due to trauma or viral etiology. I need to confirm the diagnosis, assess severity, and determine urgency. Considering the recent onset and presentation, a mild to moderate viral conjunctivitis is most probable, especially given the timeframe and activity-related trigger. The key is symptom management, reassurance, and prevention of secondary infection. Since no signs of vision-threatening complications or significant pain are noted, this can be managed primarily with supportive care, with close monitoring for any worsening signs.  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on presentation and recent trauma during sports. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as redness and tearing are prominent but no vision loss or severe pain. - Urgency level: Routine care needed, as the condition is self-limited but warrants follow-up. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis (if symptoms worsen), corneal abrasions, or other ocular trauma complications.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care, including artificial tears and cold compresses, with appropriate eye hygiene. - Supporting evidence: Evidence indicates viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; symptomatic relief with cold compresses reduces discomfort. - Patient-specific considerations: No contraindications to topical treatments; important to avoid touching eyes. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection is suspected.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Artificial tears (preservative-free), used as needed. - Rationale for selection: To alleviate irritation and improve comfort, safe for viral conjunctivitis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms should improve within 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Minimal; watch for allergic reactions to eye drops. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None typically needed; if symptoms persist or worsen, consider consultation for possible secondary bacterial infection or other causes.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Good hand hygiene, avoid touching or rubbing eyes, discard contaminated towels or pillows. - Patient education priorities: Viral conjunctivitis is contagious; handwashing reduces spread. - Lifestyle modifications: Limit contact with others; avoid eye makeup or contact lenses until healed. - Behavioral interventions: Emphasize adherence to hygiene precautions.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days or sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, pain, vision changes, signs of secondary infection. - Red flag symptoms: Increased pain, decreased vision, intense redness, photophobia; seek immediate care if these occur. - Treatment response assessment: Symptomatic improvement, reduction in redness and tearing.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, factual explanation emphasizing the benign, self-limited nature. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the prognosis and contagiousness, instruct on hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Emphasize the importance of hygiene and symptom monitoring. - Family involvement: Advise family members on hygiene to prevent spread.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consult if symptoms worsen, do not improve in a week, or if vision symptoms develop. - Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff on symptom monitoring. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on conjunctivitis and hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Recommend over-the-counter artificial tears to keep costs manageable.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctivitis likely related to trauma or viral etiology, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive care with patient-centered education. The treatment plan includes use of artificial tears for symptomatic relief, strict hand hygiene, and avoidance of eye touching or sharing personal items. Initial management focuses on comfort and prevention of secondary infection, with reassurance of the self-limited nature of viral conjunctivitis. Follow-up care in 3-5 days will assess symptom progression, with urgent evaluation if symptoms worsen or signs of secondary infection develop. Emphasis will be placed on patient education about contagion, hygiene, and recognizing warning signs requiring immediate care. This strategy aims for symptom resolution within a week, minimizes unnecessary medication use, and prevents complications.",
