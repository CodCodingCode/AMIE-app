The treatment plan includes initiating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focused on panic management and coping skills, alongside starting an SSRI such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily, with gradual titration. This approach aims to reduce panic episodes and associated somatic symptoms over 4-6 weeks. Careful monitoring of symptoms and medication side effects will guide adjustments. Patient education will emphasize understanding the benign nature of these episodes, stress reduction techniques, and lifestyle modifications like exercise and sleep hygiene. Follow-up is planned in 2-4 weeks to assess progress, with clear instructions for seeking immediate care if severe physical symptoms or signs of worsening occur. Involving the patient's support system and coordinating with mental health specialists will enhance long-term management. This integrated strategy aims to improve the patient\u2019s quality of life, reduce anxiety, and manage somatic concerns effectively.",
