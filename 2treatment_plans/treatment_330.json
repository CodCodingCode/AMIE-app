    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lentigo maligna melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient education and vigilant follow-up. The primary intervention is prompt surgical excision with appropriate margins for complete removal. This will be complemented by patient education on sun protection, regular skin self-examinations, and avoidance of UV damage. Postoperative monitoring will focus on wound healing and early detection of any recurrence or new lesions, with scheduled follow-ups every 3-6 months. Communication should be tailored to the patient's information withholding style by providing clear, simple explanations and written instructions. Coordination with a melanoma specialist is essential for optimal care. This strategy aims to achieve complete tumor removal, reduce recurrence risk, and promote long-term skin health while addressing the patient's individual needs and potential concerns.",
