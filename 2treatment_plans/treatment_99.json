STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Prompt biopsy for definitive diagnosis; if confirmed as Merkel cell carcinoma, management includes surgical excision with appropriate margins, possibly combined with radiotherapy. - Supporting evidence: Merkel cell carcinoma is known for aggressive behavior; early surgical removal plus radiation improves local control and survival. - Patient-specific considerations: Given age, sun exposure history, and lesion characteristics, prompt diagnosis and definitive treatment are prioritized. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in biopsy; consider patient's overall health status, vascular status, and potential surgical risks.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not applicable initially; treatment is surgical and possibly radiotherapy. - Rationale for selection: Surgical excision is standard first-line therapy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Pathology results within days; surgical healing over weeks; radiation effects depend on treatment course. - Key side effects to monitor: Postoperative infection, wound healing complications. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab) if surgical options are limited or if metastasis occurs.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Sun protection education, skin self-examinations. - Patient education priorities: Importance of early evaluation of suspicious skin lesions, sun safety measures, adherence to follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Minimize sun exposure, use broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage regular skin checks once treated and healed, avoid excessive sun exposure.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Recheck post-biopsy within 1 week; if diagnosed and treated surgically, follow-up in 2-4 weeks; then, periodic oncology review based on pathology. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, signs of local recurrence, new skin lesions. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid recurrence, new symptoms, systemic signs (fever, malaise). - Treatment response assessment: Clinical healing, pathology reports, imaging if indicated.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, straightforward language, emphasizing urgency and importance of swift diagnosis and treatment, while respecting his storytelling style. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about procedure, discuss possible outcomes, address fears about cancer severity. - Adherence strategies: Provide written summaries, schedule follow-ups proactively, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Encourage family support for appointments and post-treatment care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Dermatologic surgeon or surgical oncologist within a week; possibly radiation oncology for adjuvant therapy. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing staff for wound care education. - Community resources: Skin cancer support groups, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist with scheduling, coverage questions for biopsy and surgery.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma suspicion, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate diagnostic biopsy with definitive surgical excision, possibly followed by adjuvant radiotherapy depending on pathology results. The management emphasizes prompt evaluation, complete tumor removal, and appropriate follow-up, tailored to the patient's history and clinical presentation. Initial efforts focus on urgent biopsy within the next few days, surgical planning, and patient education on sun safety. Long-term management includes regular skin examinations, monitoring for recurrence or metastasis, and coordination with oncology specialists if indicated. This approach aims to achieve local control, reduce the risk of metastasis, and improve overall prognosis while minimizing complications.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Schedule prompt skin biopsy; educate the patient about signs of complications. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic biopsy, perform surgical excision if confirmed, and initiate wound care. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Monitor for recurrence; consider radiation therapy if indicated; reinforce sun protection. - Patient handout summary: Explain necessity of biopsy, potential treatments, importance of sun safety, and follow-up schedule.",
