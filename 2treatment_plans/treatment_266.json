    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency presenting with conjunctival xerosis and dry eye disease, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines systemic vitamin A repletion with ocular surface management. The plan includes administering age-appropriate systemic vitamin A supplementation promptly, along with the use of preservative-free artificial tears to relieve ocular dryness. Nutritional counseling to improve dietary sources of vitamin A will support long-term correction. Patient education will focus on adherence, warning signs of toxicity, and dietary modifications. Follow-up will be scheduled in 1-2 weeks to monitor clinical and systemic response, with ongoing assessments over 3-6 months to ensure resolution and prevent recurrence. This integrated approach aims to rapidly restore vitamin A levels, improve ocular surface health, and prevent potential complications while minimizing adverse effects.",
