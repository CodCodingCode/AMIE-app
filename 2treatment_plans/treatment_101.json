The treatment plan includes performing a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) for diagnosis and initial treatment, followed by intravesical BCG immunotherapy to reduce recurrence risk. This plan integrates lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and hydration, along with routine surveillance including cystoscopy and urine cytology every 3 months initially. Close follow-up and patient education are emphasized to ensure adherence, especially given the patient's stoic tendency. Collaboration with urology specialists and supportive services will optimize outcomes. The goal is to prevent progression, detect recurrences early, and maintain quality of life while minimizing risks associated with treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange cystoscopy and TURBT, educate the patient about symptoms to watch for, and discuss the need for intravesical therapy.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete TURBT, initiate BCG therapy, and reinforce adherence and lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve no recurrence on surveillance cystoscopy, maintain lifestyle changes, and monitor for treatment side effects.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the diagnosis, treatment steps, importance of follow-up, lifestyle tips, and warning signs that require prompt medical attention.",
