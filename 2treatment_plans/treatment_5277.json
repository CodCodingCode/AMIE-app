    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Vestibular Hypofunction or Functional Dizziness (possibly related to a mild vestibular disorder or overall deconditioning)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of persistent headache localized at the back of the head, associated with dizziness, unsteadiness, and a feeling of eyes being \"funny\" suggests a vestibular or balance disorder. Absence of trauma, neck stiffness, or neurological deficits makes central causes less probable. The associated mood changes, fatigue, decreased appetite, and difficulty with daily activities point toward a possible contribution of systemic factors such as anxiety, depression, or deconditioning affecting the vestibular system. No significant ocular or neurological signs like vision changes or numbness are reported, reducing suspicion for other neurological or ocular pathology. The chronic, gradual onset and variety of symptoms fitting within benign vestibular or functional causes make this a plausible diagnosis at this stage.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nVestibular Hypofunction or Functional Dizziness END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the likely diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction or functional dizziness, the primary approach should focus on vestibular rehabilitation to improve balance and reduce symptoms. Addressing potential contributing factors such as deconditioning, anxiety, and mood disturbances is also important, as these can exacerbate dizziness and affect recovery. Non-pharmacological strategies like vestibular therapy have strong evidence for efficacy in vestibular hypofunction, and addressing lifestyle factors such as activity levels can promote neuroplasticity and symptom improvement. Pharmacological intervention may be considered only if symptoms are significantly distressing or impairing, such as using vestibular suppressants temporarily. However, these should be used cautiously to avoid prolonging deconditioning.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with recommending vestibular rehabilitation therapy, ideally guided by a physical or occupational therapist experienced in vestibular disorders, to help retrain the balance system and improve symptoms. The patient should be encouraged to gradually increase daily activity levels to combat deconditioning and enhance recovery. Addressing associated mood and fatigue through psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, and, if appropriate, short-term antidepressant or anxiolytic medication can help improve overall function. Additionally, moderate caffeine intake can be maintained, but alcohol and sedatives should be avoided as they can worsen balance issues. Follow-up should focus on symptom progression, adherence to vestibular exercises, and mental health support if needed. Pharmacological options such as short-term vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine) may be used sparingly if symptoms are severe, but priority should be on vestibular rehab and lifestyle modifications."
