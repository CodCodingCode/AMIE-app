    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High. The patient has clinical signs consistent with an orbital hemorrhage/contusion, likely secondary to trauma, with minimal pain and swelling currently but guarded responses indicative of possible underreporting. - Severity classification: Moderate, given the two-day duration with persistent redness, swelling, and tearing, but no vision loss or severe pain. Monitoring is needed for potential progression. - Urgency level: Urgent; orbital hemorrhages can worsen or lead to complications such as increased intraorbital pressure or vision impairment. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible underlying orbital fracture, intraocular injury, or increasing intraorbital pressure.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Conservative management with close monitoring; consider corticosteroids if swelling threatens optic nerve function. - Supporting evidence: Observation is appropriate for mild to moderate orbital hemorrhages without vision compromise; corticosteroids may reduce swelling and prevent optic nerve compression. - Patient-specific considerations: Patient\u2019s stoic/minimizer tendency warrants careful clinical examination and possibly more aggressive monitoring due to underreporting. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid unnecessary manipulations; corticosteroids should be used cautiously if signs of increased intraocular pressure or infection are present.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 60 mg daily, tapering over one week). - Rationale for selection: To reduce edema and inflammation, decreasing risk of optic nerve compression. - Expected timeline for improvement: Initial signs of swelling reduction typically within 24-48 hours, with continued improvement over 3-7 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Elevated intraocular pressure, hyperglycemia, infection risk. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider periocular corticosteroid injections or hospitalization with intravenous steroids if significant vision changes occur.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Cold compresses to reduce swelling, head elevation when resting. - Patient education priorities: Importance of avoiding activities that increase orbital pressure, recognizing early signs of deterioration. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, avoiding strenuous activity, adhering to medication schedules. - Behavioral interventions: Encourage reporting new or worsening symptoms promptly; support for managing anxiety related to the injury.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 24-48 hours in person or via telemedicine; if stable, then weekly for the first month. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, degree of swelling, pain level, and signs of optic nerve compromise. - Red flag symptoms: Decreased vision, new or worsening pain, increased swelling, protrusion of the eyeball, or eye movement restriction. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom resolution, reduction in swelling, stable or improved visual acuity.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language emphasizing the importance of monitoring and reporting symptoms without minimizing her experience. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure her that her symptoms are taken seriously and that close follow-up is essential. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication instructions, schedule follow-ups promptly, and involve her in decision-making. - Family involvement: Encourage bringing a trusted family member to appointments for additional support and assistance in symptom reporting.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Ophthalmology consultation urgently within 24-48 hours to evaluate ocular status and visual function. - Other healthcare team members: Consider involving an emergency physician if clinical deterioration occurs. - Community resources: Provide education materials about orbital injuries and signs of worsening. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure medication affordability and schedule follow-up appointments considering patient coverage.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of orbital contusion/hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines vigilant observation with targeted corticosteroid therapy, lifestyle modifications, and close ophthalmology follow-up. The initial management emphasizes controlling inflammation, minimizing swelling, and preventing optic nerve compression, with corticosteroids as the first-line pharmacological intervention. Non-pharmacological measures include cold compresses, head elevation, and activity restriction. Regular monitoring will assess for signs of progression or vision impairment, with urgent specialist referral to ophthalmology within 24-48 hours. Clear patient education about symptom recognition and the importance of prompt reporting is essential, especially given her stoic/minimizer tendency. This plan aims to stabilize her condition, prevent complications, and ensure timely intervention if her clinical status changes.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent ophthalmology consult; prescribe oral corticosteroids; instruct on cold compress use and activity restrictions. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Reduce swelling, preserve visual acuity, monitor for worsening signs; have follow-up appointments scheduled. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete recovery with minimal residual effects; prevent recurrence or complications. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of follow-up, medication adherence, recognition of warning signs, and activity restrictions.",
