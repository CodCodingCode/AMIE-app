    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of pleuritic chest \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pleuritis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating NSAID therapy with ibuprofen 600-800 mg every 8 hours to reduce inflammation and pain, along with activity modifications and rest. Patients should be educated about the nature of pleuritis, signs of worsening or complications, and the importance of medication adherence. Monitoring will involve reassessing symptoms within 3-5 days, watching for red flag signs such as increasing chest pain or dizziness, and adjusting treatment as necessary. Follow-up with primary care in this timeframe is essential, with escalation to cardiology if pericardial or other cardiac involvement is suspected. This integrated approach aims to relieve symptoms effectively, prevent complications, and support the patient\u2019s recovery with attention to safety and patient understanding.",
