    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy (likely an inherited peripheral neuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease)\nJustification: The patient's progressive limb symptoms over two years\u2014difficulty lifting feet, numbness and burning sensations in fingers, and balance issues\u2014are characteristic of a length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. The absence of visual or bladder/bowel symptoms suggests a primarily motor and sensory process without central nervous system involvement. The gradual worsening without episodes of acute exacerbation points toward a chronic, hereditary etiology rather than an acquired or acute condition. Additionally, the patient's age and symptom distribution without evidence of systemic or infectious causes further support an inherited neuropathy, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which commonly presents with sensory deficits, weakness, and ataxic gait over time.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nHereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy, likely Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the primary goals are to manage symptoms, improve function, and prevent complications. Since this is a progressive hereditary condition, pharmacological options are limited to symptomatic relief, especially for neuropathic pain. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical and occupational therapy can help maintain muscle strength, improve balance, and prevent contractures. Assistive devices like orthoses or braces may assist with mobility and balance. Patient education about avoiding limb injuries due to sensory loss is crucial to prevent wounds and ulcers. Regular monitoring for development of foot deformities or ulcers should be integrated into ongoing care. Pharmacologically, if ongoing neuropathic pain is present, medications like gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine may be appropriate. Referral to a neurologist specializing in peripheral nerve disorders can be considered for further management and genetic counseling.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating and emphasizing comprehensive symptomatic management. Begin with prescribing neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin if pain is present, titrating carefully for tolerability. Encourage participation in physical and occupational therapy focused on maintaining muscle strength, improving balance, and preventing contractures. Recommend regular use of orthotic devices and assistive walking aids as needed to enhance stability and mobility. Educate the patient on injury prevention, especially in areas with sensory loss, and review foot care practices to prevent ulcers. Arrange for routine follow-up with a neurologist familiar with hereditary neuropathies for ongoing assessment and potential genetic counseling, and consider referring to a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease for comprehensive support."
