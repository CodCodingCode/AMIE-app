    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: Herpes simplex keratitis is highly suspect\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating topical antiviral therapy with trifluridine 1% five times daily and systemic antiviral therapy with oral acyclovir 400 mg three times daily, aiming to reduce viral activity and prevent progression. Immediate assessment by an ophthalmologist is crucial for confirmation and detailed examination. Supporting measures include lubrication for symptomatic relief and strict adherence to medication regimens, with detailed patient education emphasizing the seriousness of her condition, potential side effects, and need for prompt follow-up. Short-term goals involve rapid symptom improvement and lesion stabilization within 1-2 weeks, while long-term management focuses on minimizing recurrences, monitoring for complications, and preventing vision loss. Follow-up in 48-72 hours for reassessment, with close monitoring for worsening symptoms, is essential. This approach aims to achieve effective viral suppression, reduce inflammation, and protect her vision, with careful attention to potential medication side effects and ensuring her understanding and compliance through clear communication and possibly involving family support.",
