    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: The initial provided diagnosis is neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but the patient\u2019s gold standard diagnosis was perineuritis of the optic nerve, indicating a possible discrepancy or previous misclassification. Given her presenting symptoms and examination findings, this needs clarification. - Severity classification: The patient's symptoms\u2014rapid decline with dark patches, foggy vision, persistent in the same location, plus flashes\u2014are concerning for a significant lesion affecting central vision, possibly moderate to severe. However, visual acuity testing and fundus exam are needed to confirm severity. - Urgency level: Urgent eye assessment is required to rule out progression of neovascular AMD or optic nerve pathology; immediate intervention may not be needed unless vision is rapidly worsening or new symptoms emerge. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Optic neuritis, central serous chorioretinopathy, or other posterior segment pathologies.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: For neovascular AMD, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (e.g., ranibizumab, aflibercept) is standard. - Supporting evidence: Numerous randomized trials demonstrate significant slowing or stabilization of vision loss with anti-VEGF agents. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, potential comorbidities, visual acuity, and the presence of anxiety influencing symptom perception. - Contraindications or cautions: Recent ocular infections, allergies to medications, or systemic anticoagulation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Aflibercept 2 mg intravitreal injections monthly for the first 3 months, then as needed, or ranibizumab following similar protocols. - Rationale for selection: Both have proven efficacy; choice may depend on patient-specific factors and insurance coverage. - Expected timeline for improvement: Visual stabilization typically seen within 4-6 weeks; some improvement may occur earlier. - Key side effects to monitor: Endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, elevated intraocular pressure, systemic thromboembolic events. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Switching agents (e.g., from ranibizumab to aflibercept) or considering alternative therapies if no response.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Smoking cessation, dietary modifications (leafy greens, visual supplements beneficial in AMD), UV protection. - Patient education priorities: Risks of untreated AMD progression, importance of adherence, recognizing symptoms of complications. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, control blood pressure and cholesterol, avoid smoking, regular physical activity. - Behavioral interventions: Address anxiety through counseling or support groups to improve adherence and mental well-being.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reevaluate in 4-6 weeks post-initial treatment to assess treatment response and plan further injections. - Monitoring parameters: Visual acuity, fundus appearance, OCT imaging to evaluate fluid or neovascular activity. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden increase in pain, floaters, flashes, significant vision loss, or signs of intraocular infection. - Treatment response assessment: Stabilization or improvement in vision, reduction of retinal fluid on OCT.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use plain language, repeat key points, and check understanding, given her tangential storytelling style. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the effectiveness of treatment, importance of follow-up, and address fears about losing vision or procedure risks. - Adherence strategies: Simplify appointment scheduling, involve family members if possible, and provide written summaries. - Family involvement: Encourage family participation to support treatment adherence and emotional well-being.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: An ophthalmologist with retinal specialization for intravitreal injections and ongoing management, urgent if vision deteriorates rapidly. - Other healthcare team members: Visual rehabilitation specialists if long-term vision impairment persists, mental health support if anxiety remains high. - Community resources: Patient support groups for AMD, educational materials from organizations like the AMD Alliance or AAO. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure coverage for injections and follow-up visits; discuss financial assistance programs if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy\u2014preferably aflibercept or ranibizumab\u2014administered monthly for the first 3 months, with subsequent dosing based on response. Concurrently, I advise lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, dietary improvements (increased leafy greens and antioxidants), UV protection, and management of cardiovascular risk factors.  Initial management focuses on confirming the diagnosis through detailed ophthalmologic examination, OCT imaging, and visual acuity testing, with urgent follow-up within 4-6 weeks to evaluate treatment efficacy. Patient education will emphasize the importance of adherence, recognizing symptoms of complications, and understanding the treatment goals. Regular follow-up will monitor visual acuity and retinal fluid status, with ongoing anti-VEGF injections as needed, and close attention to potential side effects like intraocular inflammation or infection.  This approach aims to stabilize or improve vision, prevent further deterioration, and address underlying modifiable risk factors, with support for emotional well-being and clear communication tailored to her storytelling style. The plan ensures timely specialist involvement and considers practical aspects such as treatment costs and patient support.",
