    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered strategies. The treatment plan includes regular surveillance with neurological assessments and imaging, pain management with analgesics and neuropathic agents as needed, and considering surgical consultation for symptomatic tumors causing nerve compression. Initial management focuses on controlling symptoms, preventing neurological deterioration, and providing education. Long-term, this involves multidisciplinary follow-up with neurology, neurosurgery, physical therapy, and psychological support. Follow-up care will include periodic neurological exams and imaging to monitor tumor progression, with prompt intervention if neurological status deteriorates. Patient education will emphasize symptom reporting, activity modification, and adherence to appointments. This approach aims to preserve neurological function, improve quality of life, and address the psychosocial aspects of this chronic condition while minimizing risks associated with invasive procedures.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Conduct a detailed neurological exam, initiate symptomatic pain management, and arrange urgent neuroimaging (MRI) of the affected limb and nerve pathways.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic evaluation, establish baseline neurological function, and consult neurology/neurosurgery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete any necessary surgical interventions, establish ongoing surveillance schedule, and provide rehabilitative support.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasizes the importance of monitoring symptoms, adhering to follow-up visits, understanding the nature of neurofibromatosis, and reporting new or worsening neurological symptoms promptly.",
