    "output": "THINKING: The final diagnosis given is viral conjunctivitis, not breast engorgement, despite the conflicting patient context. The patient presents with eye redness, swelling, tearing, symptoms beginning 2 days ago after playing soccer\u2014these are characteristic of viral conjunctivitis, which is often bilateral, contagious, and self-limited. Severity appears mild to moderate based on description; there is no mention of vision changes or significant pain, indicating urgent care is not required beyond outpatient management. Differential diagnoses include bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or other ocular infections, but viral etiology remains most probable here due to rapid onset post-exposure. The standard treatment involves symptomatic management and infection control, with no specific antiviral therapy typically necessary.\nANSWER: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:   - Primary diagnosis confidence: High certainty of viral conjunctivitis based on clinical presentation and timing.   - Severity classification: Mild to moderate, as symptoms involve redness, tearing, and swelling without vision impairment or severe pain.   - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no immediate threats such as vision loss or significant pain.   - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis if symptoms worsen or do not improve in 5-7 days; allergic conjunctivitis if associated with allergy symptoms.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION:   - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive symptomatic care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, and hygiene measures.   - Supporting evidence: These interventions reduce discomfort and prevent secondary infections; antiviral medications are generally not indicated.   - Patient-specific considerations: Engaging in sports or outdoor activities may increase risk of spread; patient education on hygiene is vital.   - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid touching or rubbing eyes; limit contact with others to prevent transmission.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:   - Primary medication choice: No prescription antiviral medication necessary; consider lubricating eye drops for comfort.   - Rationale for selection: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limited; symptomatic relief is primary.   - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms often resolve in 7-14 days.   - Key side effects to monitor: Eye irritation from drops; ensure no allergic or adverse reactions.   - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Antibiotic drops are not typically indicated unless bacterial superinfection is suspected.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:   - Primary non-drug interventions: Frequent hand washing, avoiding eye rubbing, using tissue to wipe eyes, not sharing towels or pillows.   - Patient education priorities: Nature of viral conjunctivitis, contagiousness, hygiene practices, symptom duration.   - Lifestyle modifications: Minimize contact with others during contagious period; sleep hygiene.   - Behavioral interventions: Reinforce hand hygiene and eye hygiene; consider informing close contacts for monitoring.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:   - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen.   - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, new pain, vision changes, or signs of bacterial superinfection.   - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, intense eye pain, worsening redness or swelling\u2014seek immediate care.   - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in redness and tearing; comfort improvement; no new symptoms.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:   - Communication approach: Clearly explain that symptoms are likely viral and self-limited; emphasize hygiene to prevent spread.   - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about prognosis, dispel myths, and explain expected course.   - Adherence strategies: Stress importance of hygiene measures and symptom monitoring; schedule follow-up.   - Family involvement: Encourage family members to observe for similar symptoms and practice hygiene.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:   - Specialist referrals needed: Usually not necessary unless suspicion of other ocular pathology or worsening symptoms.   - Other healthcare team members: Educate nursing staff or primary care colleagues for patient education reinforcement.   - Community resources: Provide educational pamphlets on viral conjunctivitis and infection control.   - Insurance/cost considerations: Most interventions are conservative; ensure patient has access to artificial tears or hygiene supplies if needed.  Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive symptomatic care\u2014such as artificial tears and cold compresses\u2014along with strict eye hygiene measures to prevent transmission. The primary focus is on patient education regarding the contagious nature of the condition, symptom monitoring, and preventive practices. There is no need for antibiotics or antiviral medications unless atypical features or complications develop. Initial management emphasizes symptom relief, infection control, and follow-up within a few days to ensure recovery. This approach aims to optimize comfort, prevent transmission, and identify any worsening early.   IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:   - Immediate actions (today): Advise patient on eye hygiene, recommend artificial tears, and instruct on avoiding touching or rubbing eyes.   - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Symptom resolution within 7-14 days; prevent spread to others; monitor for worsening signs.   - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery; educate on prevention for future cases.   - Patient handout summary: Key points include hygiene practices, expected symptom duration, warning signs requiring prompt evaluation, and reassurance about the self-limited nature of viral conjunctivitis.",
