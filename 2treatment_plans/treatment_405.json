    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excision with adjunctive therapies and ongoing surveillance. The initial step involves urgent referral to an ocular oncologist for detailed assessment and surgical removal of the lesion, along with staging investigations such as orbital imaging and metastasis screening. Postoperative care includes monitoring for recurrence, managing ocular dryness and irritation, and educating the patient about signs of progression or recurrence. Follow-up visits should occur every 3 to 6 months for at least two years. Throughout this process, clear communication tailored to the patient's preferred information style is essential, emphasizing the importance of adherence and prompt reporting of new symptoms. Coordination with specialists and support services will help facilitate optimal outcomes and address potential financial or logistical barriers. This approach aims to achieve complete lesion removal, minimize recurrence risk, preserve ocular function, and monitor for metastasis, thereby optimizing long-term prognosis.",
