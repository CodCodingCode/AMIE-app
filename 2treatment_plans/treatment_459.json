    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nPrimary diagnosis confidence: Given the presentation of severe tearing-lik\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of a vascular dissection or aneurysm involving non-aortic arteries, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent diagnostic imaging, hemodynamic stabilization, and prompt surgical or endovascular intervention as indicated. The immediate focus is on blood pressure control with intravenous beta-blockers to reduce shear stress on affected vessels, along with urgent imaging to confirm diagnosis and extent. The plan includes close neurological and vascular monitoring, patient education emphasizing the seriousness and need for definitive intervention, and multidisciplinary coordination with vascular surgery. Long-term management will involve risk factor modification (e.g., hypertension control, smoking cessation) and regular follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence or progression. This strategy aims to prevent catastrophic complications, preserve neurological function, and promote optimal recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospitalize the patient for urgent stabilization, initiate IV antihypertensive therapy, and arrange emergent vascular imaging.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete definitive imaging, perform necessary surgical or endovascular repair, monitor for neurological recovery, and begins lifestyle modifications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve and maintain optimal blood pressure, monitor for recurrence, and ensure functional and neurological recovery.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the urgency of diagnosis, the importance of blood pressure control, adherence to treatment, and regular follow-up appointments.",
