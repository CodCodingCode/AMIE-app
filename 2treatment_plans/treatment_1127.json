    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; symptoms align with recurrent depressive disorder in full remission but currently experiencing a depressive episode. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe; based on persistent emotional numbness, fatigue, social withdrawal, and passive suicidal ideation, which impair functioning. - Urgency level: Routine care needed but with increased vigilance due to passive suicidal thoughts; potential escalation if passive ideation intensifies. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Adjustment disorder, bipolar depression, medical causes of depression (e.g., hypothyroidism), substance use effects.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Combined pharmacotherapy (antidepressant) plus psychotherapy. - Supporting evidence: Medication plus psychotherapy has demonstrated higher remission rates and symptom control in moderate to severe depression. - Patient-specific considerations: Guarded communication suggests potential difficulty in engagement; her passive suicidal thoughts necessitate careful monitoring. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for medication side effects, substance interactions, and ensure safety regarding passive suicidal ideation.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Sertraline 50 mg daily, titrate as needed. - Rationale for selection: SSRI with proven efficacy, favorable side effect profile, and safety in women. - Expected timeline for improvement: Partial response within 2-4 weeks; optimal may take 6-8 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: GI upset, sleep disturbances, increased anxiety initially, SI worsening. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Escitalopram, venlafaxine, or mirtazapine, considering tolerability.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Initiate evidence-based psychotherapy\u2014specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). - Patient education priorities: Understanding depression as a treatable condition, importance of adherence, recognizing warning signs. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular exercise, structured sleep routines, balanced diet, stress reduction techniques. - Behavioral interventions: Psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and possibly involve social support or peer groups.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 2 weeks to evaluate medication tolerability and symptom progression; then every 4 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity (e.g., PHQ-9), side effects, passive suicidal ideation, functional status. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening passive or active suicidal thoughts, emergence of plan or intent, worsening depression, or significant side effects. - Treatment response assessment: Regular symptom tracking, patient report, clinician observation.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language; reassure about treatment benefits and address fears; validate her distress. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize safety, gradual improvement, and her feelings are common but manageable. - Adherence strategies: Establish trust, clarify questions, involve her in treatment decisions, use reminders. - Family involvement: With her consent, involve a trusted family member or partner for support and monitoring.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Consider psychiatry consultation if symptoms escalate, medication response is inadequate, or active suicidality develops. - Other healthcare team members: Psychotherapist or counselor for CBT; care coordinator if available. - Community resources: Support groups, depression helplines, psychoeducational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for psychotherapy and medications; explore assistance programs if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating an SSRI such as sertraline 50 mg daily, coupled with cognitive-behavioral therapy to address her symptoms and improve coping skills. Given her passive suicidal thoughts and guarded communication, close monitoring for safety and therapeutic engagement is crucial. Immediate actions involve starting medication and scheduling follow-up within two weeks for medication tolerability and initial symptom assessment. Short-term goals include symptom stabilization and increased engagement in therapy over the next 1-4 weeks, with a long-term objective of remission and functional recovery within 3-6 months.  Implementation guidance: - Immediate actions (today): Prescribe sertraline, provide psychoeducation, and schedule follow-up. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for side effects, assess for suicidal ideation, encourage therapy attendance. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission, improve mood, restore social and occupational functioning. - Patient handout summary: Information on depression, medication adherence, importance of therapy, safety plan if suicidal thoughts change.",
