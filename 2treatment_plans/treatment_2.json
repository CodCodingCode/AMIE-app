    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: The child's presentation includes delayed developmental milestones in walking and talking, limited eye contact, atypical social interactions, and difficulties in understanding or following instructions. The child's preference for sitting quietly watching, fixation on certain sounds or toys, sensitivities to sensory stimuli such as loud noises, bright lights, and textures, as well as heightened distress with routine changes, are characteristic of ASD. The lack of typical gestures like pointing or waving further supports this diagnosis, as these are early communicative behaviors often delayed or absent in children with ASD. The behavioral profile and sensory sensitivities align with common features of autism.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of ASD is well-established based on developmental history, behavioral presentation, and sensory sensitivities. Management should focus on early intervention to improve communication, social skills, and adaptive behaviors, as well as addressing sensory sensitivities. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as structured behavioral therapies (e.g., Applied Behavior Analysis), speech therapy, and occupational therapy, are first-line and should be initiated promptly to support development and minimize behavioral challenges. Education and support for the family are also crucial. Pharmacological treatments are not curative but can be considered for specific symptoms such as severe irritability, hyperactivity, or aggression that interfere significantly with functioning, using medications like risperidone or aripiprazole under careful supervision.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan for this child includes initiating early intervention services with a multidisciplinary approach, including speech therapy to enhance communication skills, occupational therapy to address sensory sensitivities and improve daily functioning, and behavioral therapy such as Applied Behavior Analysis to support social skills and adaptive behaviors. The family should be connected with resources and educational support tailored for children with ASD. If significant behavioral dysregulation, irritability, or hyperactivity impairs the child's well-being or development, a cautious trial of low-dose risperidone or aripiprazole may be considered under close medical supervision, monitoring for side effects. Regular follow-up to assess progress, adjust therapies, and provide family support is essential for optimal management."
