    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Prim\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of uveitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating systemic corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day with a gradual taper over 6-8 weeks, to promptly control active intraocular inflammation. This is supported by guidelines showing corticosteroids' efficacy in reducing intraocular inflammation and preventing vision loss.\nGiven her clinical presentation, close monitoring within 1-2 weeks is essential to assess response and adjust therapy, with follow-ups every 4-6 weeks. During this period, routine assessments will include visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp exams for intraocular cells and flare, and possibly imaging.\nPatient education will focus on medication adherence, recognition of side effects, and timely reporting of red-flag symptoms like sudden vision loss. Lifestyle modifications, such as eye protection, healthy diet, and stress management, will support overall care.\nCoordination with an ophthalmologist experienced in uveitis is critical, ideally within one week, for definitive workup and ongoing specialist management. Additional support from primary care, with attention to systemic health and comorbidities, will ensure holistic care.\nThis plan aims to control inflammation rapidly, preserve vision, minimize treatment risks, and provide sustainable long-term management of uveitis.",
