    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Benign Cyclic Breast Tenderness\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of intermittent breast tenderness correlated with her menstrual cycle, especially premenstrual, without any palpable lumps, skin changes, nipple discharge, or other concerning findings. These typical features suggest benign cyclic mastalgia, which is common in women of her age group. The absence of alarming physical findings and her reassurance following routine screening supports this as a benign, cyclic process rather than a serious pathology.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nBenign Cyclic Breast Tenderness END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of benign cyclic breast tenderness, which is a common condition associated with hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, management primarily focuses on reassurance and symptom relief. Since there are no concerning features such as lumps, skin changes, or discharge, invasive investigations or specialized treatments are unnecessary. Non-pharmacological measures such as wearing well-fitted supportive bras, minimizing caffeine intake, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle may help reduce discomfort. Pharmacological options, like mild analgesics or hormonal modulation, can be considered if symptoms are bothersome. In cases, hormonal therapy such as oral contraceptives may be beneficial in reducing cyclic symptoms, but this should be discussed with the patient\u2019s preferences and medical history to evaluate suitability.\n\nANSWER: The patient should be reassured about the benign nature of her symptoms. Non-pharmacological measures such as wearing a supportive bra, reducing caffeine and salt intake, and maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine can be recommended to help alleviate tenderness. If symptoms are particularly bothersome, a trial of over-the-counter analgesics like NSAIDs may be considered during the premenstrual phase. If symptoms persist or significantly impact quality of life, a discussion about hormonal options, such as low-dose oral contraceptives, can be initiated to regulate hormonal fluctuations contributing to the breast tenderness. The patient should be advised to monitor her symptoms and return if there are any new or concerning changes."
