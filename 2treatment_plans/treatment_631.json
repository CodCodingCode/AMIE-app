    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High. The patient\u2019s symptoms of visual decline, halos, ocular pain, and possible steroid use strongly suggest secondary open-angle glaucoma, particularly steroid-induced. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe. The recent onset of ocular pain, significant visual symptoms, and physical signs like halos suggest elevated intraocular pressure and potential optic nerve stress. - Urgency level: Urgent. The presence of ocular pain and vision changes warrants immediate assessment to prevent irreversible optic nerve damage. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Lens-induced secondary glaucoma, acute angle-closure (less likely given the open-angle), or other secondary causes like uveitis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering therapy promptly and arrange for definitive management. - Supporting evidence: Lowering IOP reduces risk of optic nerve damage; topical medications are first-line. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety may affect adherence; history of steroid use suggests need for careful medication selection. - Contraindications or cautions: Caution with medications that may exacerbate systemic or ocular conditions; avoid steroids if they are contributing to elevated IOP.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Topical prostaglandin analogs (e.g., latanoprost 0.005% once nightly) or beta-blockers (e.g., timolol 0.5% BID), considering contraindications. - Rationale for selection: Proven efficacy in lowering IOP with favorable side effect profiles; prostaglandins are typically first-line. - Expected timeline for improvement: IOP reduction within 4-6 hours, sustained over days; symptomatic improvement may follow within days. - Key side effects to monitor: Iris pigmentation (prostaglandins), bradycardia or bronchospasm (beta-blockers), ocular irritation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Brimonidine, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topical or systemic), or laser trabeculoplasty if medications are insufficient.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Educate about medication adherence, avoid eye rubbing, and minimize steroid use if possible. - Patient education priorities: Understanding glaucoma, medication importance, and the need for regular follow-up. - Lifestyle modifications: Manage blood pressure, maintain hydration, avoid medications that raise IOP unless prescribed. - Behavioral interventions: Stress reduction techniques, provide written educational materials, and possibly refer to counseling for anxiety management.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess IOP and ocular health within 1 week of initial treatment; then every 4-6 weeks until stable. - Monitoring parameters: IOP measurements, visual acuity, visual fields, optic nerve appearance, and patient-reported symptoms. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening vision, severe eye pain, nausea, vomiting, or signs of acute angle-closure. - Treatment response assessment: Reduction in IOP to target levels, stabilization or improvement in visual symptoms, patient comfort.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (anxious_amplifier), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic, and reassurance-focused language; validate concerns. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain that the symptoms are treatable, emphasizing the importance of timely management in preventing blindness. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimens, schedule follow-ups promptly, involve the patient in decision-making. - Family involvement: Educate family members if appropriate, to support adherence and reduce anxiety.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Refer to an ophthalmologist or glaucoma specialist urgently within the next 1-2 days for comprehensive assessment and definitive treatment. - Other healthcare team members: Coordinate with nursing staff for patient education, ensure medication counseling. - Community resources: Provide educational materials, support groups for glaucoma. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs, assist with access and coverage issues, explore options for financial assistance if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lens-induced secondary open-angle glaucoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt IOP-lowering therapy with definitive ophthalmologic evaluation. The treatment plan includes initiating topical prostaglandin analogs and beta-blockers to reduce intraocular pressure, alongside patient education emphasizing medication adherence and warning signs. Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist is essential within 1-2 days for confirmatory assessment and possible surgical intervention. Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled within 1 week and every 4-6 weeks thereafter to monitor IOP, visual function, and treatment response. The plan emphasizes clear communication tailored to the patient's anxiety, involving family as appropriate, and ensuring access to resources. This integrated strategy aims to preserve visual function while minimizing risks and addressing the patient\u2019s concerns proactively.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Initiate prescribed IOP-lowering medications, provide education, and arrange urgent ophthalmology referral. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve target IOP, stabilize symptoms, and confirm diagnosis and treatment effectiveness. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent further optic nerve damage, optimize visual outcomes, and establish ongoing glaucoma management. - Patient handout summary: Understanding glaucoma, medication adherence, warning signs requiring immediate care, and the importance of regular follow-up.",
