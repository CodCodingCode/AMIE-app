    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of generalized seizure following exertional heat stroke, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating anticonvulsant therapy with levetiracetam, ensuring adequate hydration and heat avoidance, and patient education on seizure prevention. Immediate management focuses on stabilizing neurological status and preventing recurrence, while establishing long-term seizure control through medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Follow-up care will include regular neurological assessments, monitoring medication side effects and seizure activity, and coordination with neurology specialists. This approach aims to reduce seizure frequency, prevent heat-related complications, and promote safe, sustainable recovery while minimizing risks associated with medication side effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate levetiracetam at starting dose, provide patient education on heat avoidance and hydration, arrange neurology referral.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess seizure control and medication tolerance, reinforce education, adjust medication as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stable seizure control, prevent heat exposure, and evaluate for potential for medication tapering if appropriate.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on seizure management, heat stroke prevention, medication adherence, and when to seek emergency care.",
