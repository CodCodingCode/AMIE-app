    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Early Neurocognitive Disorder, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating cholinesterase inhibitors such as Donepezil 5 mg daily, coupled with lifestyle modifications emphasizing cognitive stimulation, physical activity, and social engagement. Careful monitoring of medication tolerability and cognitive function will be scheduled every 4-6 weeks initially, then spaced out as appropriate. Patient education will focus on disease understanding, safety precautions, and adherence, while involving family members in support roles. Coordination with neurology, neuropsychology, and occupational therapy services will ensure thorough assessment and safety assessments. This approach aims to stabilize or slow cognitive decline, improve safety and quality of life, and provide the patient with adequate support for ongoing management.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Prescribe Donepezil 5 mg, provide patient education materials, and arrange follow-up appointment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Assess medication tolerability, reinforce lifestyle advice, and monitor for adverse effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Evaluate cognitive progression, optimize medication, and reinforce support and safety measures.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of medication adherence, lifestyle changes, regular follow-up, safety tips, and available support resources.",
