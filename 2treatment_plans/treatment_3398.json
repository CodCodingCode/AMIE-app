    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis (MG)\nJustification: The patient's clinical presentation of gradually worsening weakness over two years, particularly affecting leg muscles and bulbar muscles (hoarse voice and choking), with symptoms worse in the mornings and improving with rest, strongly aligns with MG. The characteristic fluctuation of weakness, especially the enhancement after rest and fatigue, is typical. Absence of ocular symptoms (ptosis, double vision) does not rule out MG, as ocular involvement can be absent or minimal in some cases. Other conditions like ALS are less likely given the fluctuation pattern and absence of upper or lower motor neuron signs, and LEMS typically involves autonomic symptoms and proximal weakness with more prominent ocular or autonomic features. The gradual progression and pattern strongly support MG as the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMyasthenia Gravis END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), a condition characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest, the primary goal is to improve the patient's muscle strength and quality of life. Pharmacological treatment typically involves acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission and are the first-line therapy. Considering the symptoms have been progressing over two years with significant bulbar and limb involvement, it is also prudent to assess the severity and consider additional immunomodulatory therapies if symptoms are moderate to severe or not adequately controlled with initial medications. Non-pharmacological approaches include educating the patient about symptom management, activity modifications, and avoidance of triggers such as infections or excessive physical exertion. While advanced therapies like plasmapheresis or IVIG are reserved for severe cases or exacerbations, they may be considered if pharmacological management is insufficient or during crises. Regular monitoring for treatment efficacy and side effects, as well as evaluation for thymic abnormalities via imaging, should be incorporated into ongoing care.\n\nANSWER: Initiate treatment with pyridostigmine to improve muscle strength, dosing adjusted based on clinical response and side effects. Educate the patient about proper medication use, symptom management, and activity modifications to prevent overexertion. Arrange for baseline thymic imaging (such as a CT scan) to evaluate for thymoma, and refer to a neurologist for further assessment and consideration of immunosuppressive therapy if symptoms are moderate to severe or inadequate response to pyridostigmine. Monitor the patient regularly for symptom progression, medication side effects, and potential complications, and advise the patient to report any sudden worsening of weakness or respiratory symptoms promptly."
