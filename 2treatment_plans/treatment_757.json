    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with social communication difficulties and sensory sensitivities\nJustification: The patient's presentation includes persistent social anxiety, feeling overwhelmed in social environments, and a tendency to hide or withdraw, which suggests social communication challenges. The history of early developmental differences, such as avoiding pretend play and possible reduced eye contact, aligns with classic signs of ASD. The preference for routines and heightened sensitivities to lights and smells further support sensory processing issues common in ASD. These features collectively indicate that social anxiety may be a manifestation within the broader context of an ASD diagnosis, rather than isolated social phobia. The overlap of social difficulties, sensory sensitivities, early developmental signs, and reliance on routines strongly point toward ASD as the most probable diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of ASD with prominent social communication difficulties, sensory sensitivities, and social anxiety suggests a need for a comprehensive, individualized approach. Non-pharmacological interventions such as social skills training, behavioral therapy, and sensory integration techniques can help improve social functioning and manage sensory sensitivities. These interventions should be tailored to the patient's developmental level and specific challenges. Additionally, supporting routines and providing environmental modifications may help reduce anxiety and overstimulation. Pharmacological treatment can be considered if symptoms such as severe anxiety, irritability, or hyperactivity significantly impair functioning and do not respond sufficiently to behavioral strategies. Since primary care physicians and psychiatrists can oversee these interventions, initiating behavioral therapies and considering a trial of medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety, would be appropriate, with careful monitoring.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with referral to a multidisciplinary team, including speech and occupational therapists, for targeted social skills training and sensory integration therapy to address communication and sensory sensitivities. Implementing consistent routines and environmental modifications at home and school can help reduce anxiety and overstimulation. Cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored for children with ASD may assist in managing social anxiety and improving social interactions. Pharmacologically, if anxiety or other behavioral disturbances are severe, initiating a low-dose SSRI such as fluoxetine or sertraline under supervision could be beneficial, with close monitoring for side effects. Regular follow-up should assess progress, adjust interventions as needed, and coordinate care with specialists experienced in ASD."
