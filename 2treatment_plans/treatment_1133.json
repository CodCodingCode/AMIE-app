The absence of recent medication changes rules out drug-induced hyperprolactinemia. The visual symptoms and head pressure suggest a mass effect from a pituitary tumor, most likely a prolactinoma. Given the absence of other hormonal disturbances and the presence of galactorrhea, this diagnosis aligns most closely with a prolactinoma.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nProlactinoma\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of prolactinoma, the primary approach involves pharmacological therapy to reduce prolactin levels and tumor size, thereby alleviating symptoms such as galactorrhea and visual disturbances. The first-line treatment for prolactinoma is typically the dopamine agonist bromocriptine or cabergoline, which effectively decrease prolactin secretion and can shrink the tumor. Non-pharmacological interventions primarily involve surgical options; however, these are reserved for cases where medication is contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective. Supportive care includes monitoring symptoms and visual fields, as well as screening for hormonal deficiencies if symptoms suggest additional endocrine involvement. Since the patient reports visual disturbances and head pressure, close ophthalmologic and neurological follow-up is recommended during treatment to ensure the tumor is shrinking and not causing irreversible damage.\n\nANSWER: Initiate treatment with a dopamine agonist such as cabergoline, starting at a low dose and titrating gradually to alleviate symptoms and normalize prolactin levels. Educate the patient about potential side effects like orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal discomfort, and monitor prolactin levels periodically (e.g., every 4-6 weeks initially) to assess response. If the patient is intolerant to cabergoline or if there is inadequate response, consider switching to bromocriptine or evaluating for surgical intervention if there is progressive visual impairment or tumor growth despite optimal medical therapy. Additionally, advise follow-up with ophthalmology to monitor visual field improvements, and consider endocrine assessment to evaluate other pituitary function. Supportive counseling or addressing fatigue and decreased interest may also be beneficial as part of comprehensive care."
