    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given recent cannabis use with perceptual and physical symptoms consistent with a cannabis-induced anxiety disorder and acute panic attack. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering the recent onset of significant perceptual disturbances, physical symptoms such as tachycardia and dizziness, waking symptoms, and fears of passing out or a heart attack indicating substantial distress. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to ensure safety, rule out medical causes, and provide immediate reassurance. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Medical conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, neurological issues), other psychiatric conditions such as psychosis or mood disorders, substance withdrawal or interactions.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Psychoeducation, reassurance, and monitoring, with consideration for pharmacotherapy if symptoms persist or escalate. - Supporting evidence: Cognitive-behavioral techniques and reassurance are the mainstays for panic and cannabis-induced anxiety; medication may be auxiliary. - Patient-specific considerations: Her baseline mild anxiety, recent increase in cannabis, and emotional distress suggest a need for gentle intervention and monitoring. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid benzodiazepines initially unless severe; monitor for substance interactions; avoid polypharmacy unless necessary.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medication is warranted, - Primary medication choice: A low-dose SSRI, such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily, starting cautiously. - Rationale for selection: SSRIs are first-line for anxiety disorders, effective for persistent symptoms, with a favorable safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Some benefit may be seen within 2-4 weeks; full effect in 6-12 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, initial increased anxiety; monitor for suicidality especially early. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: SNRI (venlafaxine), or augmentation with psychotherapy.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Psychoeducation regarding anxiety, avoiding cannabis, stress management techniques. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing symptoms, understanding the benign nature of episode, avoiding substance triggers. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep, balanced diet, moderate exercise, structured routines, stress reduction. - Behavioral interventions: Referral for cognitive-behavioral therapy focusing on anxiety management, coping skills, and substance use counseling.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 1-2 weeks to evaluate symptom progression and medication tolerability. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity, medication side effects, substance use changes, functional status. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, new psychotic features, worsening physical symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom frequency and intensity logs, patient self-report, clinician evaluation.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clear, empathetic, validating her distress while emphasizing safety and staged treatment. - Addressing patient concerns: Explain that symptoms are common and manageable, reassure about treatment options. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimen, schedule frequent follow-ups, encourage involvement in therapy. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve trusted family for support and to reinforce treatment adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Consider psychiatric consultation if symptoms persist or worsen, or for medication management. - Other healthcare team members: Psychiatrist, therapist trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy. - Community resources: Connection to local mental health support groups or substance use counseling. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication costs early, explore available programs or generic options.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cannabis-induced anxiety disorder with acute panic attack features, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes psychoeducation, avoidance of cannabis, and lifestyle modifications, complemented by initiating an SSRI such as sertraline 25-50 mg daily to address ongoing anxiety symptoms if they persist. Immediate management focuses on reassurance, safety, and close monitoring, with follow-up scheduled within 1-2 weeks to assess symptom evolution and medication tolerability. Long-term management will emphasize psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy, to develop coping skills and prevent recurrence, while also addressing substance use. Patient education will prioritize symptom recognition, substance avoidance, and stress reduction techniques. Regular follow-up and coordination with mental health specialists are essential to optimize outcomes, minimize risks, and ensure sustainable management of her anxiety.",
