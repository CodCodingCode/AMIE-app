    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  \n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.  \n- Pr\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Congestive Heart Failure with Secondary Nephrotic Syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating diuretics such as furosemide to reduce volume overload, along with careful assessment of renal function and electrolytes. In addition, ACE inhibitors may be introduced cautiously to improve cardiac outcomes, considering the patient's renal status. Non-pharmacological measures include sodium and fluid restrictions, elevation of affected limbs, and patient education on symptom monitoring. Close follow-up within one week will assess response to therapy, with regular monitoring of symptoms, weight, laboratory parameters, and potential side effects. Communication will be empathetic and clear, addressing her emotional state and involving family support when appropriate. Referrals to cardiology and nephrology are recommended for ongoing specialists' input. This coordinated approach aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent deterioration, and enhance quality of life while diligently monitoring for and managing complications.",
