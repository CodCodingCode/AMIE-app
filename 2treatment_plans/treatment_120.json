    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary diagnosis confidence: The initial impression suggests myocarditi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute rheumatic endocarditis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose penicillin G benzathine injections to eradicate streptococcal infection, supported by supportive care aimed at reducing inflammation and monitoring for cardiac involvement. Short-term management involves close observation of symptoms, serial cardiac assessments, and addressing any complications promptly. Long-term management includes regular follow-up with cardiology, adherence to prophylactic antibiotics as indicated, and patient education on recognizing warning signs. This approach is designed to resolve active infection, prevent further cardiac damage, and support recovery while minimizing risks associated with therapy. Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient and confirming the diagnosis, with ongoing monitoring to assess response and modify treatment as needed.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Administer penicillin G benzathine 1.2 million units IM; initiate supportive care, and order baseline labs, ECG, and echocardiogram.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve symptomatic improvement; monitor inflammatory markers and cardiac function.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence via secondary prophylaxis with penicillin; monitor for and manage any residual cardiac issues.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize completing prescribed antibiotics, reporting new or worsening symptoms, avoiding strenuous activity initially, and attending all follow-up appointments.",
