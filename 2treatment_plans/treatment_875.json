    "output": "THINKING: Step 1 - Diagnosis confirmation and severity assessment: The patient presents with typical symptoms of viral conjunctivitis\u2014redness, tearing, swelling\u2014began 2 days ago following playing soccer, which suggests a contagious viral etiology. Confidence in this diagnosis is high given the characteristic presentation and recent activity. Severity appears mild to moderate, as there are no reports of significant pain, vision loss, or systemic symptoms. Urgency is routine; no signs of complication requiring urgent care. Differential diagnoses like bacterial conjunctivitis or allergic conjunctivitis are less likely but should still be monitored if symptoms worsen.  Step 2 - Evidence-based treatment selection: First-line treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive care\u2014artificial tears, good hygiene, and patient education\u2014since antiviral medications are rarely needed. This approach is supported by clinical guidelines and evidence that it reduces symptoms and prevents secondary bacterial infection. Considerations include the patient's stoic_minimizer behavior; emphasis on reassurance and simple measures is essential. Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial superinfection is suspected after follow-up.  Step 3 - Pharmacological interventions: No specific antiviral medications are recommended; artificial tears are sufficient. If discomfort is significant, preservative-free lubricants can be advised. Antibiotics are generally avoided in viral cases. Expect symptom improvement within a week; if worsening or persistence beyond two weeks, reevaluate for other etiologies. Monitor for secondary bacterial infection signs\u2014purulent discharge, worsening redness. Backup if symptoms persist or worsen include antibacterial eye drops as dictated by clinical assessment.  Step 4 - Non-pharmacological interventions: Primary recommendations include strict hand hygiene, avoiding touching or rubbing eyes, and disinfecting shared equipment (e.g., sports gear). Patient education on contagious nature and prevention is key. No specific lifestyle modifications are necessary, but encouraging adequate sleep and stress management can support immune function. Stress the importance of not returning to sports until symptoms resolve to prevent spread.  Step 5 - Monitoring & follow-up strategy: Follow up in 3-5 days via clinic or phone to assess symptom progression or resolution. Reassure the patient that improvement is expected within a week. Advise immediate care if vision changes, intense pain, or increased redness occur. Track symptom duration and any signs of secondary infection.  Step 6 - Patient communication strategy: To address the stoic_minimizer style, present the plan confidently but briefly, emphasizing that supportive care is effective and symptoms typically improve quickly. Reassure and normalize the experience, stress the importance of hygiene and observation. Proactively address concerns about contagion and returning to activities. Emphasize simple measures for adherence, and consider involving family members in education if appropriate.  Step 7 - Coordination & referrals: No immediate specialist referral is necessary unless atypical features develop. Ensure patient understands when to seek urgent care. Consider providing educational materials on eye hygiene and contagious illnesses. Confirm that the patient has access to follow-up care, and discuss initial advice with family if possible to reinforce adherence.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive measures such as artificial tears, good hand hygiene, and patient education on contagion prevention, with careful attention to symptom monitoring. Immediate management focuses on reassurance and simple symptomatic relief, while establishing follow-up to assess progress and address any complications. Follow-up will involve a review of symptoms within 3-5 days, with instructions for seeking urgent care if vision changes, severe pain, or worsening redness occur. This approach aims to promote symptom resolution, prevent spread, and minimize unnecessary medication use, ensuring safe and effective recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on ocular hygiene, recommend artificial tears as needed, and advise avoiding contact with others and refraining from sports until resolution. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Expect symptom improvement within a week; follow up to reassess. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence and secondary infections; reinforce hygiene practices. - Patient handout summary: Key points include the contagious nature of viral conjunctivitis, importance of handwashing, avoiding eye rubbing, using preservative-free artificial tears if needed, and when to seek urgent care.",
