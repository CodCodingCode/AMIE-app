    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach: First confirm the diagnosis of incomplete uterine prolapse with posterior vaginal wall prolapse and assess severity\u2014likely moderate t\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse with stress urinary incontinence, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes pelvic floor muscle training and consideration of a pessary for support, with education about symptom management and lifestyle modifications. Initial management focuses on conservative measures aimed at symptom relief and pelvic support, while preparing for surgical consultation if indicated. Follow-up care will include symptom assessment in 4-6 weeks, with attention to urinary leakage frequency, prolapse severity, and patient comfort, along with education on pelvic floor exercises and prolapse symptoms. This approach is designed to improve pelvic support, reduce urinary incontinence episodes, and enhance quality of life while minimizing risks associated with unnecessary interventions.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on pelvic floor exercises, discuss pessary options if acceptable, and provide educational materials.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate pelvic floor physical therapy (try to refer if not already in place), and assess for pessary fit and tolerability.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve symptomatic improvement with conservative measures, and evaluate the need for surgical intervention if symptoms persist or worsen.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize pelvic floor exercises, importance of pelvic support, early signs of prolapse worsening, and when to seek immediate care (e.g., sudden worsening, severe pain, inability to void).",
