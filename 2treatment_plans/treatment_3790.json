    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (or another sinonasal malignancy)\nJustification: The patient's persistent six-month history of unilateral nasal obstruction, bleeding, foul smell, anosmia, facial tenderness, and worsening symptoms suggests a progressive mass lesion. The development of occasional blurry vision indicates possible invasion into nearby orbital structures. The absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss does not rule out malignancy. The chronicity and progression of symptoms, particularly nasal bleeding and facial tenderness, are highly suspicious for a malignant sinonasal tumor such as squamous cell carcinoma, which is known to invade local tissues over time. Other benign conditions like polyps or chronic sinusitis are less likely to cause such progressive and invasive features, especially with new visual symptoms. Fungal sinusitis is less probable without systemic immunocompromise and characteristic features. Given the clinical picture, malignancy remains the most probable diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nSinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (or other sinonasal malignancy) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma or other sinonasal malignancy, early and coordinated intervention is critical to optimize outcomes. The patient\u2019s presentation with persistent unilateral nasal symptoms, facial tenderness, systemic signs suggesting local invasion, and visual changes indicates an advanced lesion requiring prompt evaluation and intervention. While definitive diagnosis depends on imaging and biopsy, initial treatment should focus on securing a tissue diagnosis, managing symptoms, and preparing the patient for potential surgical or oncologic treatments. Non-pharmacological measures such as avoiding nasal irritants and ensuring supportive care to maintain breathing and comfort are important, but the primary focus is on rapidly obtaining diagnostic confirmation and initiating a multidisciplinary treatment approach.\n\nANSWER: The primary care physician or psychiatrist should refer the patient immediately to an otolaryngologist or head and neck specialist for urgent nasal endoscopy, biopsy, and imaging studies such as contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of local invasion. Preliminary management includes symptomatic relief: advising saline nasal irrigations to help clear nasal passages, managing pain with over-the-counter analgesics as needed, and monitoring for new or worsening neurological or visual symptoms. While definitive oncologic treatment (surgical resection, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) is typically coordinated by specialists, supportive pharmacological intervention may include corticosteroids to reduce edema around the orbital area if visual impairment worsens, upon consultation with the team. The patient should also be counseled regarding the seriousness of the diagnosis, potential need for extensive treatment, and the importance of multidisciplinary care involvement."
