    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The patient's history of subacute, progressive neurological symptoms over three years\u2014including distal numbness in the limbs, increasing weakness, instability, and abnormal sensations\u2014are characteristic of a demyelinating disorder such as MS. The recent visual disturbances (blurriness, floaters) further support this, especially as they occur episodically and are associated with tiredness, consistent with optic nerve or visual pathway involvement typical of MS. The absence of bowel/bladder symptoms, systemic features, or recent trauma makes other neurological illnesses less likely. The progression pattern and multifocal neurological signs strongly suggest MS as the most probable diagnosis.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the treatment approach should aim to modify the disease course, manage symptoms, and support the patient's overall functioning. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the cornerstone for reducing relapse frequency and delaying disability progression. Early initiation of DMTs such as interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or newer agents (e.g., dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod) can be considered based on availability and patient tolerability. Symptomatic treatments may include addressing fatigue, spasticity, and visual disturbances, with medications like amantadine or modafinil for fatigue and baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity. Non-pharmacological strategies should include patient education about MS, physical therapy to maintain mobility and function, and psychological support due to the chronic nature of the illness. Regular follow-up for monitoring disease activity, side effects, and functional status is essential. In some cases, collaboration with a neurologist specializing in MS can optimize management. Overall, initiating disease-modifying therapy and comprehensive supportive care will help improve quality of life and disease outlook.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves starting disease-modifying therapy (such as interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or an alternative DMT suitable for the patient), along with symptomatic management tailored to the patient's presenting issues\u2014such as medications for fatigue and spasticity, and counseling or support groups to address psychological impacts. The patient should be referred to a neurologist experienced in MS for ongoing management and monitoring. Implementing physical therapy to maintain function and providing education about MS, including symptoms to watch for and lifestyle modifications, are also important components. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to assess treatment efficacy, side effects, and disease progression, with adjustments as needed."
