    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, my primary concern is to confirm the diagnosis based on clinical presentation and assess severity. The patient's eye symptoms developed after playing soccer, consistent with trauma. Since no mention of vision changes or other concerning signs is indicated, I consider this a benign, mild to moderate presentation. Immediate intervention is typically not necessary unless complications arise, but monitoring is essential for any signs of increased intraocular pressure or visual impairment. Supporting evidence recommends reassurance and symptomatic management for subconjunctival hemorrhage, which usually resolves spontaneously within two weeks. Caution should be taken to rule out more serious ocular injuries if symptoms worsen or if there are additional signs such as pain, vision loss, or penetrating injuries.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of traumatic conjunctivitis/subconjunctival hemorrhage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes reassurance and observation, with symptomatic management as needed, and careful follow-up to ensure resolution. Initial management focuses on protecting the eye from further trauma and monitoring for signs of worsening. Long-term management involves patient education on the natural course of subconjunctival hemorrhage with reassurance that it typically resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks. Follow-up care will include scheduled examination in 1 week to assess healing and ensure no emerging complications. The plan aims to promote recovery, minimize patient anxiety, and prevent unnecessary interventions.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on the benign nature of subconjunctival hemorrhage, advise avoidance of rubbing the eye, and recommend cold compresses to reduce swelling if there is any discomfort. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor for resolution of redness and ensure no new symptoms such as pain, vision changes, or discharge. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Confirm complete resolution; educate about the typical course and when to seek medical care if symptoms change. - Patient handout summary: Provide information that subconjunctival hemorrhages are common after trauma, usually resolve on their own, and advise protective measures during physical activity to prevent future injury.",
