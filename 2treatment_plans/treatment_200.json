    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of inhalant-induced neurotoxicity, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive care, patient education, and careful monitoring. Immediate management focuses on ensuring the patient remains safe, avoids further inhalant exposure, and receives reassurance. Supportive measures include regular neurological assessments and withholding any sedating medications unless severe agitation appears, in which case low-dose antipsychotics may be used judiciously. Patient and family education about the risks of inhalant use and strategies for abstinence are critical. Follow-up should occur within a week to evaluate cognitive recovery and address any ongoing concerns. Long-term management involves counseling services, behavioral interventions, and possible referral to substance use specialists. Implementation includes daily monitoring of neurological status, emphasizing abstinence, and ensuring coordinated care to prevent recurrence and promote full recovery.",
