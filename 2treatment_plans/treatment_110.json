    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high; classic visual aura symptoms align with migraine with aura, but given the patient's age and concerning cognitive symptoms, further assessment is necessary to rule out other neurodegenerative or secondary causes. - Severity classification: Likely mild to moderate for the migraines themselves, but the increasing cognitive complaints and visual disturbances warrant prompt evaluation to exclude progression or alternative diagnoses. - Urgency level: Routine care with urgent neurodiagnostic evaluation; immediate attention is necessary if new neurological deficits or rapid cognitive decline emerge. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Early signs of neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease), transient ischemic attacks, or other neurological causes of visual symptoms.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Migraine prophylaxis and abortive therapy; behavioral modification. - Supporting evidence: Migraine with aura management is well-established with triptans for attacks and preventive medications (e.g., lifestyle changes, medications) to reduce frequency. - Patient-specific considerations: Age, cognitive complaints, stress levels, anxiety tendency; cautious medication use considering potential side effects. - Contraindications or cautions: Ensure no contraindications to triptans if used acutely; be cautious with medications that may impair cognition or interact with underlying conditions.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: For episodic relief, triptans (e.g., sumatriptan 50 mg at onset), if no contraindications. For prevention, consider low-dose amitriptyline or topiramate, initiated after evaluation. - Rationale for selection: Triptans are effective for migraine with aura. Preventive medications can reduce frequency, especially given increasing episodes. - Expected timeline for improvement: Acute relief within hours; preventive benefits in 4-6 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Cardiac risk with triptans, cognitive or mood effects from preventive medications, sedation, or weight changes. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Beta-blockers (propranolol), valproate, or lifestyle modifications.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Stress management, sleep hygiene, hydration. - Patient education priorities: Recognize migraine triggers, differentiate aura from other neurological symptoms. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep schedule, balanced diet, hydration, stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness or biofeedback. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety and stress management; consider referral.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Re-assessment in 4 weeks after initiating preventive therapy and behavioral interventions; sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Frequency and severity of migraines, cognitive status, medication side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Rapid cognitive decline, new neurological deficits, worsening visual disturbances, or symptoms suggestive of secondary causes\u2014must seek emergency evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom diaries, patient self-reporting, functional impact tracking.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language, acknowledging concerns, and explaining the rationale behind each step. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about migraine management, discuss cognitive symptoms' evaluation, and emphasize safety. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication regimens, set reminders, involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Educate family members about warning signs and support strategies.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology consultation within 2 weeks, especially for cognitive assessment and further epilepsy/neurological work-up. - Other healthcare team members: Possible neuropsychology assessment, primary care follow-up. - Community resources: Patient support groups for migraine and caregiver resources. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for medications, diagnostic testing, and referrals.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of migraine with aura, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating acute relief with triptans if contraindications are absent, and implementing preventive measures such as lifestyle modifications and possibly low-dose prophylactic medications like amitriptyline or topiramate, after thorough assessment. Emphasis should be placed on stress reduction, sleep hygiene, and cognitive-behavioral therapy to address anxiety and stress. Immediate actions involve scheduling neurological evaluation and ensuring patient safety. Short-term goals include monitoring attack frequency, severity, and cognitive symptoms over the next 4 weeks, with ongoing assessment of medication tolerability. Long-term management aims at reducing migraine episodes, supporting cognitive health, and addressing psychological well-being over 3-6 months. Patient education will focus on recognizing migraine triggers, differentiating aura from other neurological symptoms, and understanding the importance of medication adherence and routine follow-up. This plan aims to improve quality of life, prevent complication progression, and facilitate ongoing evaluation of cognitive concerns while minimizing medication side effects and fostering patient engagement.",
