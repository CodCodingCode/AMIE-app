    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely a diagnosis of migraine, possibly with aura or visual disturbances, considering the patient's history of progressively worsening headaches, associated symptoms such as nausea, visual blurring, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating, in the absence of focal neurological deficits or signs of secondary intracranial pathology. The episodic nature of the symptoms and the absence of warning signs point toward a primary headache disorder, with migraine being most probable given the visual disturbances and variability in symptom severity and duration.\n\nJustification:\nThe patient's presentation aligns with migraine features: recurrent headaches with a gradual onset of pressure or tightness, associated visual symptoms (blurry vision on the sides, occasional double vision), nausea, and dizziness. These are common prodromal or aura phenomena. The absence of specific triggers does not exclude migraine, as triggers can vary or be subtle. Progressive worsening over time warrants monitoring but does not necessarily indicate secondary pathology, especially in the absence of new focal neurological deficits or alarming signs such as persistent deficits, worsening symptoms, or changes in consciousness. The lack of focal neurological symptoms reduces the likelihood of secondary causes like tumors or vascular events. The ineffective response to pain medication suggests a need for further evaluation and possibly prophylactic treatment, but does not negate the migrainous diagnosis.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (clinical features strongly suggest migraine but further evaluation may be warranted to rule out secondary causes)\n- No further clarification needed: No (additional testing such as neuroimaging would help confirm the diagnosis and exclude secondary pathology)\n\nANSWER:\nMigraine with visual symptoms\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation is consistent with migraine with aura, characterized by recurrent episodes of headache, visual disturbances, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Since these symptoms are episodic and there are no signs of secondary causes, migraine is the most likely diagnosis. Non-pharmacological strategies are important to help manage frequency and severity, including lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding known triggers (e.g., certain foods, stress), and incorporating stress-reduction techniques. Pharmacological therapy can be initiated for acute relief and prophylaxis. For acute treatment, NSAIDs or triptans may be effective; however, given the poor response to over-the-counter medications, prescribing a triptan for use at headache onset could be considered. For prophylaxis, if attacks are frequent or debilitating, medications like low-dose beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) or other agents such as amitriptyline could be appropriate, provided there are no contraindications. Regular follow-up should be arranged to assess response and adjust therapy, and patient education about migraine triggers and symptom management is essential.\n\nANSWER: Initiate lifestyle modifications emphasizing regular sleep, hydration, and trigger avoidance. For acute management, prescribe a triptan (e.g., sumatriptan) to be taken at headache onset, with instructions on proper use. If the migraine attacks are frequent (more than 4 episodes per month) or significantly impair functioning, consider starting a preventive medication such as propranolol, beginning at low doses and titrating as tolerated. Educate the patient about recognizing early warning signs of migraine and the importance of consistent medication use. Schedule follow-up in 4-6 weeks to evaluate response, adjust therapy as needed, and reinforce lifestyle modifications. If symptoms persist or worsen, further assessment, including neuroimaging, may be warranted to exclude secondary causes."
