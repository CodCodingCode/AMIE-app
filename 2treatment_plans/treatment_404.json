    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: High; pigmented ocular surface lesion wi\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt surgical excision of the lesion with wide margins, followed by staging and evaluation for potential adjunctive therapies such as radiotherapy if indicated. Immediate management aims to control local disease, prevent recurrence, and preserve vision. Long-term management will involve regular follow-up examinations, imaging, and monitoring for signs of recurrence or metastasis. Patient education will focus on understanding the seriousness of melanoma, the importance of follow-up, and lifestyle modifications to reduce risk factors. This approach aims to achieve local control of the tumor, minimize potential complications, and optimize patient outcomes while minimizing risks associated with undertreatment or delayed diagnosis.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent referral to ocular oncology specialist for evaluation and surgical planning. Educate the patient on the importance of prompt intervention.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical excision with histopathologic analysis, initiate stage-specific management if necessary, and start surveillance planning.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular surveillance visits, ocular imaging, and assessment for recurrence or metastasis. Address any visual or ocular surface issues early.\n- Patient handout summary: Inform the patient about the nature of conjunctival melanoma, the importance of timely treatment, follow-up schedule, and lifestyle modifications like UV protection.",
