The lesion's features\u2014enlargement over two months, erythema, scaling, crusting, central bump, possible induration, and bleeding episodes\u2014suggest a lesion that is at least moderate in severity, possibly advanced locally, but no evidence of metastasis at this time. Urgency is moderate to high, as there is a risk of local tissue invasion and potential for progression. Differential considerations include other skin malignancies or inflammatory disorders, but biopsy confirms SCC.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: First-line treatment per guidelines is surgical excision with clear margins, which provides the best chance for complete removal and accurate histopathologic assessment. Supporting evidence shows surgery offers high cure rates (>95%) and is favored for accessible facial lesions. Patient-specific factors include age, skin localization, and the lesion's size, which makes surgical excision feasible. Contraindications include poor surgical candidates or lesions in anatomically challenging areas where alternative treatments may be considered; caution is needed to minimize disfigurement.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Medications are secondary to surgical excision but may be considered for residual or unresectable disease. Topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or imiquimod can be used adjunctively or if surgery is contraindicated. Expected timeline for noticeable improvement with topical therapy is 4-6 weeks, with complete resolution in several months. Side effects include local inflammation, erosion, and discomfort requiring patient monitoring. Alternative systemic options are rarely needed but include systemic chemotherapeutics or radiation if indicated for advanced disease.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Non-drug measures include minimizing sun exposure with broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen and protective clothing, avoiding trauma to the area, and smoking cessation if applicable. Patient education should emphasize skin protection and early recognition of changes. Behavioral interventions may include counseling on UV exposure risks and routine skin checks. Lifestyle modifications include maintaining general skin health, nutrition, and stress management.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: Follow-up should be scheduled in 2-4 weeks post-treatment to assess wound healing, confirm complete excision histologically if done, and identify any signs of recurrence. Long-term skin surveillance every 6-12 months is recommended, especially for patients with extensive sun damage. Key symptoms warranting prompt evaluation include new lesions, persistent or recurrent bleeding, non-healing sores, or increasing induration. Treatment response will be monitored clinically by lesion resolution and absence of abnormal growths.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's information_withholder style, communication should be clear, concise, and reassuring. I will use simple language, provide visual aids if helpful, and ask for feedback to confirm understanding. Key concerns to address include the nature of the lesion, treatment options, prognosis, and importance of follow-up. Emphasize the rationale for surgery and skin protection. To improve adherence, I will schedule follow-up visits proactively and ensure the patient feels involved in decision-making, addressing fears or doubts openly. Family involvement can be helpful if the patient is comfortable, especially for support with wound care.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: Referral to a dermatologist or surgical oncologist is essential for definitive excision, ideally within the next 1-2 weeks. Collaboration with nursing staff for post-op wound care instructions and possibly a skin cancer nurse specialist for ongoing surveillance is beneficial. Educational materials on skin cancer prevention and early detection should be provided. Insurance and cost considerations should be discussed, ensuring resources are accessible.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines definitive surgical excision with personalized patient education and long-term skin surveillance. The initial priority is surgical removal of the lesion with clear margins to ensure complete eradication. Postoperative follow-up should be scheduled within 2-4 weeks to monitor healing and confirm pathology results. Throughout the process, I will educate the patient on sun protection strategies, signs of recurrence, and the importance of routine skin checks. Additional measures include lifestyle modifications to reduce skin damage, and a long-term follow-up plan every 6-12 months. Coordination with a dermatologist or surgical oncology specialist for excision and ongoing management will optimize outcomes while minimizing risks. This plan aims to achieve complete lesion clearance, prevent recurrence, and promote skin health.",
