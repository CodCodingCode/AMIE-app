The treatment plan includes initiating guideline-directed therapy with ACE inhibitors and diuretics to address volume overload and improve cardiac function, alongside lifestyle modifications such as sodium restriction and upright positioning. Close monitoring of symptoms, renal function, and blood pressure will be maintained, with follow-up scheduled within 1-2 weeks to assess response and adjust medications accordingly. We will also ensure referral to cardiology for definitive cardiac assessment and ongoing management, and provide education to enhance adherence and early recognition of worsening symptoms. This multifaceted approach aims to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent hospitalization, while carefully monitoring for potential side effects and complications.",
