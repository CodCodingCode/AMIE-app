    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on systemic involvement consistent with sarcoidosis, but the initial context mentions osteochondromatosis, which requires clarification. Given the systemic features and multisystem involvement, sarcoidosis is probable. - Severity classification: Moderate to severe, considering multisystem involvement including neurological and visual symptoms, which can impact quality of life and function. - Urgency level: Urgent, due to neurological and visual symptoms which may indicate progression or complications needing prompt evaluation. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other granulomatous diseases, autoimmune conditions, neurosarcoidosis, neurometabolic disorders.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Initiate corticosteroid therapy, typically oral prednisone. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are the mainstay for sarcoidosis with significant multisystem involvement. - Patient-specific considerations: Young age, neurological symptoms may require careful dosing and monitoring; potential side effects need vigilance. - Contraindications or cautions: Monitor for infection, diabetes, osteoporosis, or mood changes; adjust dose accordingly.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Prednisone, starting dose 20-40 mg daily, tapered based on response. - Rationale for selection: Well-established efficacy in reducing granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis. - Expected timeline for improvement: Clinical response may be seen within 4-6 weeks, with imaging and symptom improvement over months. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood sugar, blood pressure, signs of infection, weight gain, mood changes, calcium status. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Methotrexate, azathioprine, or hydroxychloroquine as steroid-sparing agents.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Regular physical therapy for musculoskeletal symptoms; visual and neurological assessments. - Patient education priorities: Disease nature, medication side effects, importance of adherence, symptom monitoring. - Lifestyle modifications: Balanced diet, regular exercise within tolerance, smoking cessation, stress management. - Behavioral interventions: Support groups, counseling to address anxiety and fatigue.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 4 weeks for initial response; then every 3 months. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, pulmonary function tests if applicable, serum calcium, ACE levels, chest imaging, neurological and ophthalmologic evaluations. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening vision, new neurological deficits, chest pain, signs of infection, severe mood changes. - Treatment response assessment: Resolution or improvement of systemic symptoms, stabilization or improvement on imaging, functional status.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Clearly explain diagnosis, treatment rationale, and importance of adherence using empathetic, patient-centered language. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about treatment benefits and side effect management; validate feelings of anxiety. - Adherence strategies: Simplify medication schedules, set expectations, encourage questions, involve patient in decision-making. - Family involvement: With patient's consent, involve family to support adherence and monitor for side effects.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Pulmonologist (for systemic assessment), neurologist (for neurological symptoms), ophthalmologist (for visual disturbances), rheumatologist if needed. - Other healthcare team members: Physical and occupational therapists. - Community resources: Patient support groups for sarcoidosis, educational materials. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify medication coverage, affordable treatment options, and support programs.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of sarcoidosis with multisystem involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating corticosteroid therapy with prednisone, starting at 20-40 mg daily and tapering based on response, to reduce granulomatous inflammation. Supportive treatments such as physical therapy and regular neurological and ophthalmologic assessments are essential. Education on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and lifestyle modifications will empower the patient. Follow-up will be scheduled every 4 weeks initially, with continued monitoring of symptoms, function, and potential medication side effects. Coordination with specialist providers\u2014including pulmonology, neurology, and ophthalmology\u2014is crucial to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to control systemic disease activity, preserve neurological and visual function, and improve quality of life while minimizing side effects.",
