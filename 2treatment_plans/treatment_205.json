    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency with target organ damage, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines immediate blood pressure control with ongoing management strategies. Initial management includes IV antihypertensive therapy\u2014specifically, labetalol infusions\u2014to rapidly but safely lower BP while monitoring maternal and fetal status if pregnant. This will be accompanied by close neurological, visual, and renal monitoring. We will also implement supportive measures such as bed rest, positional adjustments, and patient education about symptom recognition and medication adherence. Follow-up involves reassessment within 24-48 hours, with gradual BP normalization and ongoing outpatient management emphasizing blood pressure control, lifestyle modifications, and addressing underlying renal pathology. This plan aims to prevent further organ damage, preserve renal function, and stabilize the patient\u2019s condition while ensuring clear communication considering her behavioral style.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV labetalol infusion, continuous BP, neurological and fetal monitoring (if pregnant), and stabilize patient\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve target BP safely, confirm resolution of neurologic and visual symptoms, and begin outpatient antihypertensive therapy\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain BP within target range, prevent recurrence, optimize renal function, and plan for postpartum or ongoing pregnancy management\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize importance of blood pressure control, medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and follow-up appointments.",
