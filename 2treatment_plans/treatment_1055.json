    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to confirm the diagnosis and determine urgency. The patient has an acute presentation with bilateral lower extremity paralysis and severe back pain, consistent with spinal cord infarction or compression. The severity is severe given profound motor and sensory deficits. Immediate recognition necessitates urgent intervention to prevent permanent disability. Differential diagnoses include transverse myelitis, epidural abscess, or neoplasm, but the sudden onset strongly suggests infarction. Treatment must prioritize rapid diagnosis, stabilization, and intervention. Management includes prompt imaging (MRI) to confirm the cause and surgical or medical intervention as indicated. Medical treatment would aim to restore perfusion or decompress the cord, with corticosteroids used to reduce edema if appropriate. Long-term rehabilitation is crucial. Close follow-up with neurology, possibly neurosurgery, and physiotherapy is essential.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of spinal cord compression secondary to acute arterial infarction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent neuroimaging to confirm the cause, prompt stabilization, and early intervention to minimize neurological deficits, alongside supportive and rehabilitative care. Initial management focuses on achieving prompt diagnosis through MRI, maintaining hemodynamic stability to improve spinal cord perfusion, and consulting neurosurgery for potential surgical decompression if indicated. Corticosteroids may be administered cautiously to reduce edema, following institutional protocols. Long-term management involves multidisciplinary rehabilitation, physical therapy, and neurologic follow-up to optimize recovery and functional outcomes. The focus is on preventing secondary injury, monitoring for progression or complications, and addressing the psychological impact of sudden paralysis. This approach aims to maximize neurological recovery while minimizing risks such as further ischemia or secondary damage.",
