The plan includes initiating vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine) and, if inflammation persists, considering corticosteroids like prednisone with careful monitoring. Non-pharmacological measures emphasize rest, hydration, and avoiding rapid head movements, with potential referral to vestibular therapy. Follow-up is scheduled within 1-2 weeks to assess symptom resolution and side effects. Patient and family education will focus on explaining the condition's benign nature, expected recovery, and safety precautions. This approach aims to alleviate symptoms, promote inner ear recovery, and prevent complications, while minimizing medication risks.",
