    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of several months' progressive numbness and tingling starting in the feet and spreading proximally, along with weak legs and frequent unnoticed injuries suggests a peripheral nerve process affecting motor and sensory fibers. The worsening of symptoms with activity and relief with rest points toward an inflammatory or demyelinating process. The increased fatigue, dizziness especially upon standing (suggestive of autonomic involvement), and the poor healing of injuries could reflect systemic or neuroimmune dysfunction. The position-related fluctuation in symptoms may indicate involvement of nerve roots or lower motor neurons. The absence of central symptoms (vision changes, cognitive issues, unilateral weakness) helps exclude central nervous system causes like stroke or multiple sclerosis. Overall, CIDP is a plausible diagnosis given the pattern of symmetrical, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy with autonomic features, distributed over months, with signs of progressive weakness and relapsing/remitting features.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nChronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of CIDP, the primary goal is to reduce autoimmune-mediated demyelination and promote nerve remyelination to improve function and prevent progression. Pharmacological treatment typically involves immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasmapheresis. These options have been shown to be effective in controlling disease activity. Non-pharmacological interventions include physical therapy to maintain muscle strength, prevent contractures, and improve mobility, as well as occupational therapy to adapt daily activities. Addressing autonomic symptoms and managing comorbidities like orthostatic dizziness is also important. Early initiation of treatment can improve the prognosis and quality of life.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with initiating intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, as it is considered first-line and has a favorable safety profile, especially in cases involving significant disability. Prednisone or other corticosteroids can be considered if IVIG is contraindicated or unavailable, with careful monitoring for side effects. Plasmapheresis is another option for acute management or if pharmacologic therapy fails. Non-pharmacological measures should include referral to physical and occupational therapy for muscle strengthening, mobility support, and activity adaptation. Additionally, monitor autonomic symptoms closely, and consider orthostatic precautions, including gradual position changes and compression stockings if indicated. Regular follow-up to assess treatment response and side effects is essential, along with laboratory work as needed to monitor therapy safety."
