    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)\nJustification: The patient presents with a six-month history of progressively worsening intermittent swelling of the right leg, which worsens with prolonged standing and enhances with the activities that increase venous pressure. The swelling is associated with heaviness and tightness, and the skin appears slightly thicker without significant discoloration, redness, warmth, or ulceration\u2014classic features of venous stasis changes. The fact that elevation helps reduce swelling, although inconsistently, supports venous origin rather than lymphatic or arterial causes. The absence of signs of infection, recent trauma, or systemic illness further favors CVI. The patient\u2019s age and gender are consistent with typical presentation, as CVI commonly affects middle-aged women due to venous valvular incompetence. Other causes, such as lymphedema or deep vein thrombosis, are less likely given the chronicity, intermittent nature, and absence of other signs or risk factors.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nChronic Venous Insufficiency END",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of gradually worsening leg swelling that improves with elevation, along with signs of venous stasis and absence of signs indicating alternative causes such as infection, arterial insufficiency, or lymphatic obstruction, confirms chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Management should focus on symptomatic relief, preventing progression, and improving venous return. Non-pharmacological measures like leg elevation, compression therapy, and lifestyle modifications are first-line and accessible strategies that can significantly alleviate symptoms. Pharmacological options, such as topical or systemic venoactive agents, can be considered but are often adjuncts. Surgery or invasive procedures are generally reserved for advanced cases with skin complications or ulceration, which are not currently present in this case. The primary care setting can initiate conservative management effectively.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should begin with advising the patient on consistent use of graduated compression stockings (generally 20-30 mm Hg) during daytime activities to improve venous return and reduce swelling. Encourage regular leg elevation (above the level of the heart) multiple times daily to alleviate edema. Recommend lifestyle modifications such as weight management, avoiding prolonged standing or sitting, and engaging in low-impact aerobic exercise to promote venous circulation. Over-the-counter topical anti-inflammatory agents are generally not indicated unless skin changes or ulcers develop. Pharmacologically, consideration can be given to venoactive medications like diosmin or horse chestnut extract if symptoms persist, but these should be discussed with the patient regarding evidence and safety. Reassessment should occur in 4-6 weeks to evaluate symptom improvement and consider referral to a vascular specialist if symptoms worsen, ulcers develop, or if invasive interventions become necessary."
