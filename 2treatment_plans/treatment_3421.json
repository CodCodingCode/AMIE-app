    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Pending diagnosis based on current data, likely a form of cerebellar ataxia, possibly related to a degenerative cerebellar disorder such as Multiple System Atrophy cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) or a hereditary ataxia like Spinocerebellar Ataxia. The prominent features of gait instability, leg stiffness, eye movement abnormalities (jerky or jumpy eye movements), and difficulty maintaining steady gaze point toward cerebellar dysfunction. Absence of signs like tremor or significant cognitive or autonomic issues makes MSA less certain but still possible. The combination of gait disturbance, eye movement abnormalities, and balance issues are classic for cerebellar pathology.\n\nJustification:\nThe patient's presentation with gait unsteadiness, leg stiffness and spasms, difficulty with coordination tasks such as dressing, and eye movement abnormalities (jerky/saccadic eye movements, difficulty maintaining gaze) are characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction. The symptoms are progressively impacting functional mobility. The lack of tremor or other extrapyramidal signs suggests cerebellar disease rather than Parkinsonism. The absence of cognitive decline or autonomic symptoms narrows the differential but doesn't exclude cerebellar degeneration. Given the chronic progression and symptom profile, a degenerative cerebellar ataxia is most likely.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\nANSWER:\nCerebellar ataxia, likely a degenerative form such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia or another cerebellar disorder END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the clinical presentation consistent with cerebellar ataxia, likely a degenerative disorder such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia or another cerebellar degeneration, the primary goals are to manage symptoms, improve functional mobility, and prevent complications. Non-pharmacological interventions like physical and occupational therapy can help improve balance, coordination, and daily functioning, which are crucial for safety and independence. Although pharmacological options are limited, some medications such as aminopyridines or anticonvulsants like gabapentin or pregabalin may offer modest benefits in reducing associated symptoms like gait instability or tremors, if present. Regular assessment and supportive care should also be emphasized, along with patient education about disease progression and safety measures.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should start with referral to physical and occupational therapy aiming to improve gait, balance, and coordination. Safety measures such as use of assistive devices, environment modifications, and fall prevention strategies should be implemented. Pharmacologically, consider trialing medications like gabapentin or clonazepam if there are associated symptoms such as tremor or myoclonus, though evidence is limited and use should be individualized. Symptomatic management for eye movement abnormalities and spasticity can be explored with medications like baclofen or tizanidine. Regular follow-up to monitor progression and provide supportive care, including evaluation by neurology specialists for definitive diagnosis and genetic counseling if hereditary ataxia is suspected, should be arranged. Education about disease progression and safety is essential."
