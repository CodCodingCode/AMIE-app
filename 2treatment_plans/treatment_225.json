    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute bowel obstruction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes immediate hospital admission for stabilization, nil per os status, IV fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and antiemetics, with urgent surgical consultation to evaluate the need for operative intervention. Initial management focuses on correcting dehydration, relieving symptoms, and close monitoring for signs of deterioration. Long-term management involves monitoring bowel function, preventing recurrence through patient education, and planning definitive surgical intervention if indicated. Follow-up care will include regular reassessment of symptoms and vital signs, timely communication with surgical teams, and patient education to recognize warning signs requiring urgent care. This approach aims to resolve the current obstruction promptly, minimize risks of complications, and support recovery with appropriate surgical and supportive measures.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospital admission, NPO, IV fluids, vital sign stabilization, and urgent surgical consultation.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, observe for resolution, prepare for possible surgery, and patient education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Address underlying cause (adhesions), prevent recurrence, and restore normal bowel function.\n- Patient handout summary: Overview of bowel obstruction, importance of urgent care, expected course, and warning signs to seek immediate help.",
