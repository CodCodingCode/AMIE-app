    "output": "THINKING: The diagnosis of lymphoma, with presentation of systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, warrants prompt confirmation and staging, but given the suspicion of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic l\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lymphoma (likely Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes prompt staging, initiation of appropriate chemotherapy regimens, supportive care (e.g., transfusions, infections prevention), and coordinated specialist referral with hematology-oncology. Initial management focuses on confirming diagnosis via biopsy, completing staging workup (PET/CT, bone marrow biopsy), and stabilizing the patient if needed. Long-term management involves chemotherapy cycles, regular monitoring of treatment response, and managing potential side effects. Patient education will focus on treatment expectations, symptom monitoring, and the importance of follow-up. This approach aims to maximize remission chances, minimize complications, and support the patient's overall well-being.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent lymph node biopsy, order baseline labs (CBC, metabolic panel, LDH, ESR, infectious workup), and hospital admission if symptoms warrant stabilization.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete staging, confirm diagnosis, start chemotherapy as per protocol, and provide supportive measures (growth factors, transfusions if needed).\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission, monitor for relapse, manage long-term sequelae, and provide psychosocial support.\n- Patient handout summary: Include information on lymphoma, treatment expectations, importance of follow-up, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.\nSTOP HERE.",
