The treatment plan includes immediate volume repletion with isotonic saline to restore perfusion, careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function, and patient education to promote adequate hydration and early recognition of worsening symptoms. Initial management focuses on urgent fluid resuscitation to prevent progression of kidney injury, while establishing long-term hydration habits. Follow-up care will include serum and urine monitoring within 24-48 hours, with adjustments based on clinical response. Educating the patient on hydration importance, signs of deterioration, and lifestyle modifications is crucial, along with involving family support to improve adherence. This integrated approach aims to restore renal function, prevent complications, and establish sustainable hydration routines, minimizing risks such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV isotonic saline infusion, monitor vital signs, assess urine output, and order labs (renal panel, electrolytes).\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve stable hydration status, normalize renal function and electrolytes, and reinforce hydration education.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Prevent recurrence through lifestyle modifications, regular follow-up, and addressing underlying causes.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Stay well-hydrated by drinking enough fluids daily, recognize early signs of dehydration, and follow your healthcare provider's advice for kidney health.\"",
