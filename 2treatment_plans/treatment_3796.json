    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Congenital Hearing Loss (Sensorineural Hearing Loss)\nJustification: The child's reported behaviors\u2014poor response to auditory stimuli, inconsistent reaction to noises (especially louder sounds), and previous audiological testing indicating roughly poor hearing in both ears\u2014are characteristic of sensorineural hearing impairment. Her tendency to respond more to visual cues and her limited speech development further support this diagnosis, as these are common features in children with significant hearing deficits. The inconsistent auditory responses suggest residual hearing that is limited or variable, which aligns with congenital sensorineural deficits rather than conductive issues, which typically would be more consistent but could vary with middle ear status. The absence of significant responses to speech and her preference for visual stimuli point clearly toward a hearing impairment impacting communication and social interaction.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCongenital Hearing Loss (Sensorineural Hearing Loss) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of congenital sensorineural hearing loss, the primary goal is to optimize the child's communication development and support auditory and speech therapy, while also considering the need for assistive devices to maximize hearing potential. Non-pharmacological interventions such as early audiological management\u2014including fitting the child with appropriately powered hearing aids if residual hearing can be effectively amplified\u2014are essential. Enrollment in early intervention programs that offer speech, language, and auditory therapy is critical to promote language development and social integration. Additionally, periodic audiological monitoring should be scheduled to assess hearing and device effectiveness. Pharmacological treatment is generally not indicated for congenital sensorineural hearing loss unless there are specific associated conditions, which are not specified here. In some cases, if a cochlear implant is considered appropriate later on, early evaluation by audiology and otolaryngology specialists is recommended. Parental education and support are vital components to ensure consistent device use and engagement in therapy programs.\n\nANSWER: Initiate a comprehensive audiological management plan that includes fitting of appropriate hearing amplification devices, such as hearing aids if residual hearing is sufficient, along with referral to early intervention services specializing in speech, language, and auditory therapy. Ensure regular audiologic follow-up to monitor hearing status and device performance. Educate the parents or caregivers about the importance of consistent hearing device use, and coordinate with speech-language pathologists for ongoing communication development support. Consider consultation with otolaryngology for further assessment regarding cochlear implant candidacy if amplification does not provide adequate auditory access over time. No pharmacological treatment is indicated at this stage."
