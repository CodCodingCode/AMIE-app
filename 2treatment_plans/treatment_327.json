    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment plan. Since the diagnosis remains presumptive pending labs, I will focus on initial management considerations for suspected acute leukemia, \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of acute leukemia, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes urgent stabilization with blood products and infection prophylaxis, prompt hospitalization for close monitoring, and early initiation of definitive chemotherapy once the diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory studies. Initial management focuses on correcting cytopenias, preventing bleeding and infections, and providing supportive care. Establishing clear follow-up plans for monitoring blood counts, organ function, and symptom progression is essential. The approach also emphasizes transparent communication tailored to the patient's possible confusion or cognitive difficulty, with involvement of family members and multidisciplinary team coordination. This strategy aims to improve survival, reduce complications, and maintain the patient's quality of life as effectively as possible.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Hospitalize patient, start transfusions as needed, initiate empiric antibiotics, order confirmatory labs (bone marrow biopsy, flow cytometry).\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, initiate chemotherapy, monitor response closely, manage complications.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve remission, monitor for relapse, provide supportive care and rehabilitation.\n- Patient handout summary: Explain the need for urgent hospital stay, diagnostic testing, supportive transfusions, infection prevention, and subsequent chemotherapy; stress importance of follow-up visits and adherence to treatment.\nSTOP HERE.",
