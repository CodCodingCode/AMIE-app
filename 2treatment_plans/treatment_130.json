    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers for mortality benefit, combined with diuretics to control fluid overload, while carefully monitoring renal function and electrolytes. Lifestyle modifications such as sodium and fluid restriction, smoking cessation if applicable, and stress reduction are essential. Close follow-up within 1-2 weeks will assess symptom response and medication tolerance, with ongoing monitoring of vital signs, weight, and labs. Patient education will focus on recognizing worsening symptoms, medication adherence, and anxiety management. This careful, staged approach aims to improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and prevent progression, while ensuring safety through regular monitoring and timely specialist involvement.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate medication prescriptions (ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker), counsel on condition, educate about symptom monitoring.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve medication titration as tolerated, monitor renal function and electrolytes, assess symptom improvement.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Stable heart failure management, improved functional capacity, reduced hospitalizations.\n- Patient handout summary: \"Take your medications as prescribed, monitor your weight and symptoms daily, reduce salt intake, and keep follow-up appointments. Seek immediate help if symptoms worsen or if you experience chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or fainting.\"",
