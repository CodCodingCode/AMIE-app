    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks, then tapering), along with sodium restriction and fluid management to control edema. Close monitoring of urine protein, serum albumin, renal function, and blood pressure will be essential, with follow-up scheduled in 2 weeks and subsequently monthly. The patient should be educated on medication adherence, potential side effects, and when to seek urgent care. Engaging a nephrologist early and involving a dietitian will optimize long-term outcomes. This approach aims to induce remission, reduce complications, and support the patient\u2019s mental well-being while minimizing risks associated with treatment.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange nephrology referral, start patient education on diet and symptom monitoring, initiate corticosteroid therapy, and schedule follow-up.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve reduction in proteinuria, monitor for side effects, and adjust treatment as needed.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maintain remission, prevent relapses, and address potential side effects of therapy.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize medication adherence, monitor for signs of infection or worsening symptoms, maintain dietary restrictions, and keep follow-up appointments.",
