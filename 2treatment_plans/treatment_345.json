    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines urgent surgical debridement with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (such as vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam), intensive supportive care, and close monitoring. Immediate intervention aims to remove necrotic tissue and control infection, while antibiotics target the likely pathogens. The management includes thorough patient education on the seriousness of the condition, risks, and the importance of adherence to post-operative care. Follow-up involves daily wound assessments, vital sign monitoring, and early detection of deterioration. Coordination with surgical, infectious disease, and nursing teams is essential for optimal outcomes. This plan aims to prevent systemic sepsis, preserve limb function, and ensure recovery, all while minimizing complications related to delayed treatment or incomplete source control.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Initiate IV broad-spectrum antibiotics, arrange urgent surgical consultation, and prepare for surgical debridement.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve wound clearance and infection resolution, monitor for signs of sepsis, and support recovery.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete wound healing, rehabilitate limb function, and prevent recurrence or complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgent need for surgery, antibiotics, wound care instructions, signs of worsening, and follow-up schedule.",
