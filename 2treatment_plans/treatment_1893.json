    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Reactive Hypoglycemia (or postprandial hypoglycemia)\nJustification: The episodes of sweating, dizziness, racing heart, crankiness, tiredness, and behavioral changes predominantly before lunch, coupled with poor or minimal breakfast intake, suggest that she may be experiencing episodes of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) related to her fasting state. Her symptoms improve after eating, indicating a possible correction of hypoglycemia. Additionally, her increased tiredness, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes align with symptoms associated with fluctuating blood glucose levels. The fact that dietary modifications have provided some improvement further supports this diagnosis. The described pattern does not fit other common diagnoses like insulinoma or adrenal insufficiency because her symptoms are closely tied to feeding times and dietary intake, typical of reactive hypoglycemia in children.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nReactive Hypoglycemia END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia, the primary goal is to stabilize blood glucose levels and prevent further episodes. Non-pharmacological strategies such as dietary modifications are foundational and should be emphasized, including ensuring consistent, balanced meals with complex carbohydrates, adequate protein, and healthy fats to minimize blood sugar fluctuations. Encouraging small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day can help prevent hypoglycemic episodes, especially before lunch or during fasting periods. Monitoring symptoms and possibly maintaining a blood glucose log can help identify patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of these dietary changes. Pharmacological interventions are rarely necessary in uncomplicated reactive hypoglycemia, but if episodes persist despite dietary measures, a medication such as acarbose might be considered under specialist supervision. Education for both the patient and caregivers about recognizing symptoms and proper management is also essential. Overall, the approach should be conservative initially, focusing on dietary adjustments and symptom monitoring.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should focus on dietary modifications, including eating small, balanced, high-fiber meals and snacks every 2-3 hours to maintain stable blood glucose levels. Encourage consumption of complex carbohydrates, adequate protein, and healthy fats, especially before potential hypoglycemic episodes such as prior to lunch. Advise avoiding simple sugars and refined carbs that can cause rapid blood sugar spikes and subsequent drops. Educate the patient and caregivers on recognizing early symptoms of hypoglycemia and the importance of timely eating to prevent episodes. If episodes continue despite dietary measures, consider collaborative consultation with a specialist to evaluate the potential use of pharmacological therapy such as acarbose or other options, while closely monitoring symptoms. Reinforce regular sleep patterns, stress management, and overall healthy lifestyle behaviors to support metabolic stability."
