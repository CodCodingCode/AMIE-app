The treatment plan includes vestibular rehabilitation therapy to improve balance and reduce dizziness, safety education, and lifestyle modifications aimed at fall prevention. Pharmacologic interventions are considered only for symptom relief and should be used cautiously.\nInitial management focuses on initiating vestibular rehab and ensuring a safe environment. Follow-up will occur in 4-6 weeks to assess progress and adjust interventions accordingly. This plan aims to enhance stability, reduce fall risk, and improve quality of life while acknowledging the progressive nature of her cerebellar condition. Potential risks such as sedation or worsening neurological symptoms will be monitored closely, and care will be coordinated with neurology and rehabilitation specialists.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Refer to vestibular and physical therapy; conduct home safety assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate vestibular exercises, educate patient on safety, monitor for adverse effects.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve improved balance confidence, reduce near-falls, maintain independence.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize regular exercises, home safety, awareness of symptoms, and importance of follow-up visits.",
