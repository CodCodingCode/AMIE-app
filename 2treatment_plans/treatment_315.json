    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of external otitis (likely otomycosis) with mild systemic fatigue, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes topical antifungal therapy using clotrimazole 1% applied twice daily for 7-10 days, along with ear protection measures to prevent water ingress. Education on keeping ears dry, avoiding trauma, and completing the full course of treatment is essential. Close follow-up in 7-10 days is important to assess symptom resolution and detect any signs of worsening or complications. If systemic symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation and possibly systemic antifungal therapy or ENT consultation are indicated. Non-pharmacological interventions focus on water avoidance and patient education. The plan aims for symptom resolution within the first week, with continued monitoring for full recovery and prevention of recurrence, while minimizing risks of ototoxicity or secondary bacterial infection.",
