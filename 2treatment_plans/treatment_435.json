    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: The initial diagnosis was conjunctivitis, but the context indicates a periosteal fibrosarcoma, which is a malignant tumor rarely presenting as conjunctivitis. Given the discrepancy, the actual concern is the periosteal fibrosarcoma. The eye symptoms are unlikely to directly relate, but may suggest local invasion or secondary effects. Overall confidence in this diagnosis is high based on the data provided. - Severity classification: Likely severe, given the aggressive nature of fibrosarcoma and potential for tissue invasion. - Urgency level: Urgent; periosteal fibrosarcoma requires prompt diagnosis and management. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Ocular invasion signs, secondary infection, or metastasis.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Surgical excision with clear margins, possibly combined with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on staging. - Supporting evidence: Complete surgical resection is primary for fibrosarcomas; adjuvant therapy improves local control. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient\u2019s stoic_minimizer behavioral style may lead to underreporting symptoms, requiring sensitive communication. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid delay in treatment; monitor for neurovascular compromise or metastasis.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If applicable, interventions will primarily be surgical, with adjunct therapies as needed. - Primary medication choice: Not primary; surgical excision is the main treatment. Adjunctivity may involve radiation or systemic therapy if indicated. - Rationale for selection: Surgery offers the best chance for local control. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptom relief will depend on surgical recovery; overall prognosis hinges on complete removal. - Key side effects to monitor: Postoperative infection, wound healing complications. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Chemotherapy or radiation therapy following surgery if margins are inadequate.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Patient education on surgical procedure, prognosis, and follow-up importance. - Patient education priorities: Explain diagnosis, treatment plan, potential complications. - Lifestyle modifications: Rest, adequate nutrition to promote healing. - Behavioral interventions: Emphasize the importance of timely follow-up and reporting new symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Within 1-2 weeks post-surgery, with periodic imaging every 3-6 months. - Monitoring parameters: Wound healing, signs of local recurrence, imaging for metastasis. - Red flag symptoms: New or worsening swelling, pain, neurological deficits, or systemic symptoms. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical examination, imaging, and pathology reports.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (stoic_minimizer), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use straightforward, empathetic language emphasizing the importance of prompt treatment. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that delays can worsen prognosis, and involve the patient actively in decision-making. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, provide written info, and schedule prompt follow-up. - Family involvement: If appropriate, involve family to support adherence and understanding.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Surgical oncologist/radiation oncologist within priority; pathology for definitive diagnosis. - Other healthcare team members: Rehabilitative services post-surgery. - Community resources: Possible linkage to cancer support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Assist patient with scheduling tests and procedures, discuss coverage.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of periosteal fibrosarcoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines prompt surgical excision with potential adjunctive radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on tumor margins and staging. The treatment plan includes scheduling definitive surgical removal with oncologic surgical specialists, providing detailed patient education, and planning for close postoperative surveillance with periodic imaging. Immediate actions involve arranging surgical consultation, discussing the prognosis, and ensuring the patient understands the urgency. Short-term goals within 1-4 weeks are successful surgical intervention and recovery, while long-term objectives focus on tumor control, monitoring for recurrence or metastasis, and functional rehabilitation. Follow-up should be scheduled based on postoperative recovery and pathology results, with clear instructions for reporting new or worsening symptoms. Overall, this approach aims to achieve effective local tumor control, minimize complications, and support the patient through coordinated multidisciplinary care.",
