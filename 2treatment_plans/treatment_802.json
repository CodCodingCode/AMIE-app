    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High; clinical examination confirms complete uterovaginal prolapse. - Severity classification: Severe, as it is a complete prolapse with tissue protrusion, recent worsening symptoms, bleeding, and increased discharge. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed due to tissue protrusion, bleeding, and worsening symptoms that pose risk for tissue ischemia or infection. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible tissue ulceration or necrosis, infection, or concomitant pelvic pathology.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Pelvic floor rehabilitation and pessory if patient prefers conservative management; surgical intervention for definitive repair. - Supporting evidence: Surgery is proven to provide definitive correction in severe cases; pessories are effective and less invasive options. - Patient-specific considerations: Given her age, symptom severity, and her cautious communication, patient preferences, comorbidities, and ability to undergo surgery must be considered. - Contraindications or cautions: Caution with surgery if comorbidities pose anesthesia risk; pessory use contraindicated if tissue necrosis or friability.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Not primary, but antiseptics or topical estrogen may be used if mucosal atrophy or ulcerations are present. - Rationale for selection: To promote tissue healing and reduce discomfort. - Expected timeline for improvement: 2-4 weeks for tissue improvement. - Key side effects to monitor: Local irritation, allergic reactions. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: None primary; focus on surgical or pessary options.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Vaginal hygeine, avoiding heavy lifting, managing constipation. - Patient education priorities: Recognize signs of tissue ischemia, infection; proper pessary use if applicable. - Lifestyle modifications: Constipation prevention, weight management, pelvic floor exercises pre-surgery as tolerated. - Behavioral interventions: Supportive counseling about prognosis, surgical options, and activity restrictions.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Arrange within 1-2 weeks post-intervention, sooner if symptoms worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom progression, tissue condition, signs of infection, pessary fit if used. - Red flag symptoms: Increased bleeding, foul smell, tissue necrosis, severe pain, systemic signs. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom relief, tissue appearance improvement, patient reports.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, empathetic language; provide written summaries; check understanding. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about safety, outline benefits and risks of options, answer questions patiently. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, involve family if acceptable, encourage questions. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve family for support and assistance.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Gynecologic surgeon or urogynecologist for surgical planning within 2-4 weeks. - Other healthcare team members: Nurse educators for pessary management, physical therapists for pelvic floor therapy. - Community resources: Pelvic health support groups, educational programs. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss coverage for surgery versus pessary, assist with referral processes.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of complete uterovaginal prolapse, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes detailed evaluation for surgical correction as the definitive option, with conservative measures like pessary fitting if preferred or contraindicated. Initial management focuses on addressing tissue health, preventing infection, and patient education about symptom monitoring. Long-term management involves scheduled follow-ups to assess response, discuss surgical options, and optimize pelvic floor support. The plan emphasizes clear communication, careful monitoring for complications, and coordination with specialized care providers to ensure safe and effective treatment outcomes.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Perform thorough pelvic exam to confirm prolapse extent, assess tissue viability, and rule out ulceration or necrosis; educate the patient about warning signs. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Implement pessary trial if appropriate, optimize hygiene, manage constipation; evaluate suitability for surgical repair. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete surgical intervention if indicated, restore pelvic support, and initiate pelvic floor strengthening exercises post-recovery. - Patient handout summary: Key points on prolapse understanding, warning signs, hygiene practices, and upcoming treatment steps.",
