The fact that seizures are more frequent during feeding and sleep, combined with global developmental delays, suggests a severe epilepsy syndrome affecting brain development. The absence of prior pregnancy or delivery complications, along with no family history, indicates a primary idiopathic or possibly structural/metabolic epileptic encephalopathy rather than a secondary cause. The clinical picture is consistent with epileptic syndromes that begin in infancy, where frequent seizures and developmental regression are prominent features.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional diagnostics such as EEG, neuroimaging, and metabolic workup are necessary for definitive classification)\n- No further clarification needed: No (more information such as EEG findings or neuroimaging would help confirm the diagnosis)\n\nANSWER:\nInfantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (e.g., West syndrome or similar early onset epileptic disorder) END",
    "output": "THINKING: The presentation of frequent seizures characterized by body stiffness, eye rolling, possible jerking, along with developmental delays and poor feeding, is suggestive of an infantile epileptic encephalopathy such as West syndrome. Early intervention is crucial to improve seizure control and potentially mitigate further developmental regression. Treatment should include both pharmacological management to control seizures, typically with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosteroids, and additional supportive measures. Non-pharmacological approaches like neurodevelopmental support and early intervention services are important, but initial management should focus on controlling the seizures promptly. Diagnosis should be confirmed with an EEG, and neuroimaging may be necessary to identify any structural abnormalities. Since rapid initiation of treatment can improve outcomes, the primary care physician or psychiatrist should begin appropriate antiseizure medication(s) and coordinate referrals for EEG, neuroimaging, and specialist consultation.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan involves initiating high-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy or oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone to control the seizures associated with infantile epileptic encephalopathy. A concurrent increase in seizure safety measures and supportive care, including ensuring a safe environment and nutritional support, should be provided. Immediate referral for an EEG is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment; neuroimaging (MRI) should be performed to evaluate for structural causes. If seizures persist or if corticosteroids are contraindicated, initiating additional antiepileptic drugs (e.g., vigabatrin, especially if tuberous sclerosis is suspected) may be considered. Close monitoring of seizure frequency, developmental progress, and medication side effects is vital, with ongoing collaboration with neurology and early intervention specialists to optimize outcomes."
