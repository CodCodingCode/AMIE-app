    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (MMP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of persistent, painful red patches and erosions in the oral and genital mucosa, which worsen with spicy foods and are resistant to treatment, strongly suggests a subepithelial autoimmune blistering disorder. The presence of white, thin, net-like lines (possibly Wickham striae) around the lesions is characteristic, though not specific, for mucous membrane involvement. Dry eyes and discomfort further support an autoimmune process focused on mucous membranes. MMP is known to affect mucus membranes, often presenting with painful erosions resistant to simple treatments, and may be associated with ocular involvement, such as dry eyes. The absence of skin rashes or systemic symptoms makes other autoimmune diseases less likely at this stage.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nMucous Membrane Pemphigoid (MMP) END",
    "output": "THINKING: Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (MMP) is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder primarily affecting mucous membranes, often requiring immunosuppressive therapy to control disease activity and prevent progression, especially ocular complications. Since the presentation includes persistent erosions resistant to simple treatments and signs consistent with autoimmune involvement, the treatment should focus on reducing immune-mediated damage. Initial management typically involves topical corticosteroids for localized lesions, especially oral and genital erosions. Given the potential severity and risk for ocular involvement, a systemic immunosuppressant like doxycycline or a low-dose corticosteroid can be considered if topical therapy alone is insufficient. Additionally, supportive measures such as good oral and genital mucosal care, avoiding spicy or irritating foods, and maintaining strict oral and genital hygiene are important. Collaboration with specialists, such as an ophthalmologist, is advisable if ocular symptoms worsen or persist, but primary care or psychiatry can initiate initial control measures.\n\nANSWER: The treatment plan should start with high-potency topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate gel, applied directly to oral and genital lesions multiple times daily to reduce inflammation. Advise the patient to avoid spicy or irritating foods and maintain gentle mucosal hygiene. If lesions are extensive, persistent, or involve the eyes, consider initiating a systemic immunosuppressant like doxycycline or a low-dose systemic corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone 20 mg daily), with close monitoring for side effects. It is also prudent to refer the patient to a specialist, such as a dermatologist or ophthalmologist, for further evaluation and management of potential ocular involvement. Regular follow-up to assess treatment response and monitor for complications is essential."
