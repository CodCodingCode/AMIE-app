Given her age, symptom duration, localization, and activity-related pain, the diagnosis of osteoa\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating a tailored physical therapy program focusing on hip-strengthening and range-of-motion exercises, weight management if applicable, and activity modifications to reduce joint stress. Pharmacologic management with NSAIDs\u2014such as naproxen 250 mg twice daily\u2014can be used cautiously if tolerated, with monitoring for gastrointestinal or renal side effects, aiming for symptom relief within a few weeks. Non-pharmacologic interventions like patient education on joint preservation, appropriate activity pacing, and weight control are essential.\nLong-term management will involve regular follow-up in 4-6 weeks to assess symptom improvement, functional capacity, and medication tolerance. Monitoring should include noting any signs of worsening pain, instability, or new symptoms. Advise the patient to seek immediate care if experiencing acute worsening, severe pain, or signs of infection or significant inflammation.\nEffective communication with the worried, family-involved patient involves providing comprehensive education, addressing concerns about disease progression and treatment safety, and involving family members in understanding and supporting lifestyle modifications. Including the patient in shared decisions enhances adherence.\nIf symptoms do not improve or if joint degeneration advances significantly, referral to an orthopedic specialist for potential advanced interventions such as intra-articular injections or surgical options should be considered.\nImplementation guidance:\n- Immediate actions (today): Educate the patient on arthritis, initiate activity modifications, and consider starting NSAIDs if appropriate.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate physical therapy, assess medication efficacy and tolerability, and reinforce weight/lifestyle advice.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve improved pain control, maintained joint function, and prevent progression through ongoing management and possible referrals.\nPatient handout summary:\n\"Your osteoarthritis of the hip can be managed with a combination of safe medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. Regular follow-up will help monitor your progress, and urgent care is needed if symptoms suddenly worsen or you experience severe new pain.\"",
