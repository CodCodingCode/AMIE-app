    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based psychological therapy with supportive and educational interventions. The plan includes initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored to the child's developmental level, engaging family support, and promoting healthy lifestyle habits. Pharmacologic treatment is not immediately indicated given the mild to moderate severity but can be considered if symptoms persist or worsen. Regular follow-up in 2-4 weeks is essential to monitor progress and adjust the plan accordingly. This approach aims to facilitate emotional adjustment to the recent move, promote resilience, and prevent escalation of mood symptoms while minimizing risks. Implementation involves engaging the patient through clear communication, involving family members, and coordinating care with mental health specialists.",
