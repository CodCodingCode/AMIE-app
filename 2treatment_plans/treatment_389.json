    "output": "THINKING: STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:  \n- Primary diagnosis confidence: given the clinical description of a persistent, crusted, ulcerated facial lesion with possible shiny or scar-li\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Basal Cell Carcinoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based surgical management with patient-centered care strategies. The initial priority is to schedule surgical excision with clear margins, preferably Mohs micrographic surgery for optimal cosmetic and functional outcomes on the face. Post-operative wound care and sun protection education are essential. Follow-up includes a wound assessment in 2-4 weeks and annual skin examinations to monitor for new lesions. Patient education will focus on understanding the benign nature of BCC, importance of sun safety, and adherence to follow-up. This plan aims to achieve complete lesion removal, minimize recurrence, and promote long-term skin health, while addressing her confusion through clear communication and support.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Refer for surgical consultation and instruct on sun protection and wound care.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete excision, ensure proper wound healing, and reinforce sun safety practices.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Regular skin surveillance, patient education reinforcement, and monitoring for new lesions.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include the nature of BCC, treatment plan, importance of follow-up, and sun safety tips.",
