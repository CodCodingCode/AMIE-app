    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, as the presentation of a progressively enlarging, mildly painful lump with systemic symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, fatigue) in the context of a suspected mesenchymal malignancy strongly suggests malignancy, likely lymphoma. However, definitive diagnosis requires histopathology. - Severity classification: Severe, given systemic symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, fatigue) and the enlarging mass, indicating potentially advanced or aggressive disease. - Urgency level: Urgent, as this presentation warrants prompt diagnostic confirmation and initiation of treatment to prevent further progression or complications. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other malignancies (e.g., soft tissue sarcoma), infectious or inflammatory processes (e.g., abscess, tuberculosis), or autoimmune diseases.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: For confirmed lymphoma, standard management involves combination chemotherapy tailored to lymphoma subtype, with or without radiation therapy depending on staging and histology. - Supporting evidence: Evidence from clinical trials supports chemotherapy regimens like R-CHOP for B-cell lymphomas or other appropriate protocols based on histopathology, with targeted agents used in specific subtypes. - Patient-specific considerations: The patient's age, comorbidities, performance status, and preferences should guide therapy choices. - Contraindications or cautions: Careful monitoring for immunosuppression-related infections, cytopenias, and organ toxicities.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), dosed per protocol. - Rationale for selection: R-CHOP is the standard first-line treatment for many B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with proven efficacy. - Expected timeline for improvement: Initial response often assessed after 2-3 cycles (4-6 weeks), with clinical and imaging follow-up. - Key side effects to monitor: Myelosuppression, infections, cardiotoxicity (doxorubicin), peripheral neuropathy (vincristine), and steroid-related effects. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Second-line salvage regimens (e.g., ICE, ESHAP), immunotherapy, or clinical trials.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Adequate nutritional support, infection prevention strategies, psychosocial support. - Patient education priorities: Explanation of the disease process, treatment expectations, side effect management, importance of adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Maintain balanced nutrition, rest, stress management. - Behavioral interventions: Counseling or support groups for coping with cancer diagnosis and treatment side effects.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate after every 2-3 chemotherapy cycles, with imaging (PET/CT) after 3-6 cycles. - Monitoring parameters: Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, Cardiac function (echocardiography or MRI), symptom assessment. - Red flag symptoms: Fever, severe pain, rapid worsening of swelling, neurologic deficits, or signs of infection\u2014requiring immediate evaluation. - Treatment response assessment: Based on imaging, clinical exam, and symptom improvement.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Gentle, clear, and visually supported explanations, checking comprehension frequently, and encouraging questions. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize the importance of diagnosis and treatment for improving health outcomes, reassure about safety measures, and respect her need for privacy. - Adherence strategies: Establish trust, provide written summaries, involve family members if appropriate, and check understanding. - Family involvement: With patient consent, involve trusted family members in discussions to support adherence and emotional well-being.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Hematologist/oncologist for diagnosis confirmation, staging, and treatment initiation. - Other healthcare team members: Oncology nurses, social workers, nutritionists, mental health providers. - Community resources: Cancer support groups, patient education programs. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for chemotherapy, supportive care, and transportation; assist with financial counseling if needed.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of lymphoma, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating standard chemotherapy regimens such as R-CHOP for likely B-cell lymphoma, with staging and biopsy confirmation to tailor therapy. Supportive care measures include nutritional and psychosocial support, infection prevention, and diligent monitoring of treatment response and side effects. Immediate priorities involve diagnostic confirmation through biopsy, staging investigations, and beginning appropriate chemotherapy under expert hematology guidance. Follow-up will involve regular clinical assessments, imaging, and laboratory monitoring to evaluate treatment efficacy and adjust as necessary. Patient education will focus on understanding the treatment process, managing expectations, and addressing concerns, delivered with gentleness suitable for her communication style. This approach aims to achieve remission or control of disease progression while minimizing risks and supporting her overall well-being.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent biopsy and staging assessments; start patient education about the importance of diagnosis and treatment. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Confirm diagnosis, complete staging workup, initiate first cycles of chemotherapy, and monitor for adverse effects. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve disease remission, manage side effects, and provide ongoing supportive care and surveillance. - Patient handout summary: Basic information about lymphoma, treatment expectations, side effect management tips, and support resources.",
