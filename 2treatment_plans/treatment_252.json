    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, given presentation and context, but confirmatory labs and collateral history are needed. - Severity classification: Moderate, as symptoms are fluctuating, involving disorientation and behavioral changes, but no evidence of severe agitation, hallucinations, or vital instability. - Urgency level: Urgent care needed to prevent further decline or injury, especially due to wandering and confusion. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Other causes like infections, metabolic disturbances, or underlying neurological conditions may contribute.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Identify and discontinue psychoactive substances, supportive care, and treat underlying causes. - Supporting evidence: Literature underscores the importance of removing offending agents and providing environmental support. - Patient-specific considerations: Her emotional distress, possible underreporting, and wandering behavior warrant close observation and tailored interventions. - Contraindications or cautions: Be cautious with abrupt cessation of certain substances if dependence issues exist; avoid polypharmacy unless necessary.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: Not typically first-line unless agitation or severe symptoms require; if needed, low-dose haloperidol (e.g., 0.5\u20131 mg BID) can be used with caution. - Rationale for selection: To manage severe agitation or psychosis if present, fostering safety. - Expected timeline for improvement: Usually within days to a week. - Key side effects to monitor: Extrapyramidal symptoms, QT prolongation, sedation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Benzodiazepines may be used cautiously if agitation persists; atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone) as alternatives.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Environmental modifications to ensure safety, reorientation techniques, regular routine, and supervision. - Patient education priorities: Explain the importance of avoiding substances that worsen cognition, safety precautions, and medication adherence. - Lifestyle modifications: Promote regular sleep, hydration, balanced nutrition, and stress reduction. - Behavioral interventions: Cognitive stimulation activities, redirection, involving family or caregivers to provide reassurance.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 48-72 hours for medication effects and safety; outpatient review in 1-2 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Cognitive status, behavior, safety concerns, medication side effects. - Red flag symptoms: Increased disorientation, age-related neurological deficits, new hallucinations, vital sign instability. - Treatment response assessment: Improvement in orientation, reduced confusion, stabilization of wandering episodes.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language, with frequent reassurance; reassure about safety and the plan. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss fears, clarify any misconceptions, and involve her in planning as tolerated. - Adherence strategies: Engage family members, provide written summaries, simplify medication routines. - Family involvement: Essential; educate caregivers about warning signs, safety measures, and follow-up.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology to exclude other causes if no improvement or if new neurological findings emerge. - Other healthcare team members: Nursing for safety monitoring, social work for support planning. - Community resources: Support groups, home safety assessments, counseling services. - Insurance/cost considerations: Ensure coverage for outpatient follow-up and home safety modifications.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of delirium due to psychoactive substances, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes identifying and discontinuing offending substances, ensuring a safe and supportive environment, and providing symptomatic management with close monitoring. Initial management focuses on removing psychoactive agents and stabilizing the patient, while establishing long-term strategies such as environmental modifications, caregiver education, and regular follow-up to monitor progress. Follow-up care will include reassessment of cognitive status, safety precautions, and medication effects, with clear instructions for the patient regarding safety and symptoms to watch for. This approach aims to promote recovery, prevent injury, and address underlying issues while minimizing adverse effects and supporting the patient\u2019s functional recovery.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Review current medication and substance use, initiate safety precautions, and arrange for close monitoring. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Observe for improvements in orientation and behavior, adjust medications as needed, and engage caregivers in safety and education. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve stabilization, reduce the risk of recurrence, and address underlying causes of substance use or other contributing factors. - Patient handout summary: Emphasize the importance of avoiding problematic substances, safety precautions, follow-up appointments, and alerting caregivers if symptoms worsen or new issues arise.",
