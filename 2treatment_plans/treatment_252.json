The treatment plan includes initiating neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin, alongside lifestyle modifications focusing on foot care, safety, and managing underlying systemic factors. Addressing her anxiety through behavioral techniques and ensuring regular follow-up will optimize symptom control and quality of life. Initial management emphasizes symptom relief within a few weeks, with ongoing monitoring of medication efficacy and side effects. Future steps involve referrals for specialist evaluation if necessary, engagement of multidisciplinary team members, and patient education to foster adherence and safety.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Explain the diagnosis to the patient, initiate education on foot care and safety, and prescribe gabapentin with dosing instructions.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Achieve initial symptom relief, evaluate medication tolerability, and reinforce non-pharmacological strategies.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Improve pain and sensory symptoms, prevent complications, and manage underlying systemic contributions.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points include understanding polyneuropathy, medication use, foot safety, and when to seek urgent care.",
