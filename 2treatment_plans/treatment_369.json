    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop a treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary dia\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of Malignant Temporal Bone or Skull Base Neoplasm (e.g., Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Invasion), I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines surgical intervention, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary framework. Initial management involves urgent staging, detailed imaging, and consultation with head and neck oncology specialists to determine resectability. If tumor resection is feasible, surgical excision should be pursued promptly, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with a cisplatin-based regimen is indicated for unresectable or advanced cases to improve local control and survival. Supportive care includes pain management, nutritional support, facial nerve rehabilitation, and psychological counseling. Close monitoring with periodic imaging and neurological assessments is essential to evaluate treatment response and detect potential progression or complications. Clear patient education about the importance of adherence, side effects, and warning signs is vital. Coordination with surgical, oncology, radiation, audiology, and rehabilitation teams will ensure comprehensive care. This plan aims to improve survival outcomes, preserve function where possible, and optimize quality of life while carefully monitoring for treatment-related adverse effects.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent imaging (MRI/CT), initiate consultations with surgical and oncology teams, and stabilize any acute symptoms.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete diagnostic workup, determine resectability, start neoadjuvant therapy if indicated, and address supportive needs.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve tumor control, rehabilitate nerve function, monitor for recurrence, and provide ongoing supportive and palliative care as needed.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize the seriousness of the diagnosis, outline the planned treatment approach, highlight the importance of follow-up, and instruct on recognizing symptoms requiring urgent evaluation.",
