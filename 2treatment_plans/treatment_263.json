    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines supportive care, targeted antiviral therapy, and patient education. The management includes providing symptomatic relief with hydration and analgesics, considering antiviral treatment with tecovirimat for more severe cases, and implementing infection control measures such as isolation and hygiene. Vaccination with JYNNEOS should be discussed, especially given the exposure history, if timing allows. Close monitoring of symptoms, lesion progression, and potential side effects is essential, with follow-up within a week. Clear communication tailored to the patient's storytelling style, emphasizing key facts and providing visual aids, will support adherence. Coordination with infectious disease specialists and public health resources will optimize outcomes and prevent further transmission. This plan aims to resolve systemic symptoms, reduce transmission risks, and prevent complications while respecting the patient's unique behavioral and clinical context.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Obtain detailed exposure history, assess for contraindications to vaccines/medications, start supportive care, and consult infectious disease.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Monitor symptom progression, initiate antiviral therapy if indicated, implement isolation, and educate the patient.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Complete isolation, assess for full recovery, and evaluate for any sequelae or complications.\n- Patient handout summary: Key points on transmission prevention, symptom management, signs to watch for worsening, and importance of follow-up.",
