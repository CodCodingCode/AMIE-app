    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, given skin lesions consistent with vasculitis and ocular symptoms possibly related to systemic vasculitis. - Severity classification: Moderate, because skin lesions are persistent, and ocular symptoms are emerging but not described as causing severe vision loss yet. - Urgency level: Urgent, as ocular discomfort and visual changes require prompt evaluation to prevent permanent damage. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Kaposi sarcoma, hematologic malignancy, infectious causes, other systemic vasculitides.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Corticosteroids to reduce systemic inflammation, possibly combined with immunosuppressants if vasculitis is confirmed. - Supporting evidence: Corticosteroids are standard initial therapy in systemic vasculitis to control inflammation swiftly. - Patient-specific considerations: Need to evaluate for infectious vs. autoimmune causes; patient's overall health and comorbidities. - Contraindications or cautions: Watch for infections, blood glucose control, and side effects of immunosuppression.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Prednisone 40-60 mg daily, tapering as inflammation improves. - Rationale for selection: Potent anti-inflammatory effects; rapid symptom control. - Expected timeline for improvement: Noticeable skin and ocular symptom reduction within 1-2 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Blood pressure, blood glucose, signs of infection, mood changes, osteoporosis risk. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Cyclophosphamide or rituximab for severe or refractory vasculitis.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Eye rest, avoiding trauma to skin lesions, skin care to prevent infection. - Patient education priorities: Recognizing signs of worsening, infection risks, medication side effects. - Lifestyle modifications: Adequate hydration, balanced diet, smoking cessation if applicable. - Behavioral interventions: Stress management, follow-up adherence strategies.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks to assess response; regular follow-up every 4-6 weeks. - Monitoring parameters: Skin lesion size and appearance, ocular symptoms, visual acuity, blood pressure, blood glucose, and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). - Red flag symptoms: Sudden vision loss, severe ocular pain, new neurological deficits, signs of infection. - Treatment response assessment: Clinical improvement of skin and ocular symptoms; laboratory normalization.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (tangential_storyteller), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use clear, simple language with visual aids, and allow flexible discussion to accommodate tangential narratives. - Addressing patient concerns: Reassure about the importance of follow-up, potential side effects, and prognosis. - Adherence strategies: Encourage written summaries, scheduled reminders, and involve family if appropriate. - Family involvement: Engage family members if patient agrees, to support adherence.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Rheumatology for vasculitis management, ophthalmology urgent consultation. - Other healthcare team members: Primary care nurse for education and monitoring, possibly social work for support. - Community resources: Eye health support groups, vasculitis patient organizations. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication affordability, coverage for specialty visits.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis with ocular involvement, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 40-60 mg daily) to control systemic inflammation, with close monitoring for side effects. A prompt ophthalmology consultation is essential to assess ocular signs and prevent vision loss. Supportive skin care, patient education about symptom monitoring, and lifestyle modifications will complement pharmacotherapy. Short-term goals include reducing inflammation within 1-2 weeks and preventing ocular complications, while long-term management involves tapering steroids as tolerated, periodic assessment of disease activity, and possibly adding steroid-sparing agents if indicated. Follow-up will be scheduled every 1-2 weeks early on, with laboratory and clinical monitoring, and patient education will emphasize recognizing worsening symptoms and adherence to therapy. Coordination with rheumatology and ophthalmology specialists is crucial to optimize outcomes. This approach aims to stabilize the vasculitis, preserve vision, and improve overall health while minimizing risks associated with treatment.",
