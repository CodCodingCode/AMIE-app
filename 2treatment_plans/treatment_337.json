    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome, I recommend an immediate, coordinated multidisciplinary approach emphasizing urgent surgical decompression, supported by perioperative medical management and comprehensive patient education. The primary intervention is prompt surgical removal of the compressive disc and bony spurs, ideally within 24 hours to optimize neurological recovery. Preoperative stabilization may include cautious use of corticosteroids to reduce edema, although definitive treatment is surgical. Postoperatively, close neurological and bladder function monitoring will be essential, with ongoing physical therapy to restore mobility and function. Clear communication with the patient about the seriousness of the condition, the need for rapid intervention, and the recovery process will help address anxiety and promote adherence. Follow-up appointments should be scheduled within one week post-surgery and include regular assessments for neurological improvement. Family involvement and support will be vital in perioperative care, and coordination with neurosurgery or spine specialists is crucial for timely intervention.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Arrange urgent surgical consultation and imaging review; prepare for surgery; initiate preoperative stabilization.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete surgical decompression; monitor neurological status; begin rehabilitative therapy.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Maximize functional recovery, bladder control, and mobility; provide ongoing support and education.\n- Patient handout summary: Emphasize urgency of surgical treatment, importance of follow-up, and key signs of neurological or autonomic deterioration.",
