    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: Moderate to high, based on vestibular migraine features and symptom description, but the initial context suggests a brainstem stroke syndrome, which raises concern. The discrepancy indicates the need for thorough evaluation. - Severity classification: Likely moderate to severe, given the impact on balance, risk of falls, and potential for underlying serious pathology (brainstem stroke). - Urgency level: Urgent, since symptoms suggest neurovascular concerns that may require prompt imaging and assessment. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Brainstem stroke, TIA, other vestibular or ocular motor disorders, intracranial pathology.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: For vestibular migraine, lifestyle modifications combined with migraine prophylaxis. - Supporting evidence: Migraine management guidelines recommend prophylactic medications and behavioral strategies to reduce frequency and severity. - Patient-specific considerations: Female patient, possible guarded communication; risk of falls; potential confusion with stroke syndrome. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid medications that impair balance or cognition unless clearly indicated.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If medications are appropriate, I'll select based on efficacy and safety. - Primary medication choice: Low-dose amitriptyline 10-25 mg at bedtime, titrated as tolerated. - Rationale for selection: Amitriptyline has evidence for prophylaxis of migraine with aura and vestibular symptoms; sedative properties may aid sleep, which helps migraine management. - Expected timeline for improvement: Usually 4-6 weeks to observe significant reduction in frequency. - Key side effects to monitor: Drowsiness, anticholinergic effects, mood changes, cardiac concerns (if dose increases). - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Topiramate, propranolol, or gabapentin.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: I'll include lifestyle and behavioral interventions that enhance outcomes. - Primary non-drug interventions: Headache diaries, vestibular rehabilitation therapy, stress reduction techniques. - Patient education priorities: Identifying triggers, importance of medication adherence, fall prevention measures. - Lifestyle modifications: Regular sleep schedule, hydration, balanced diet, stress management. - Behavioral interventions: Vestibular therapy; cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety or stress related to symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: I'll establish appropriate monitoring and follow-up care. - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 4-6 weeks to evaluate medication efficacy and tolerability. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom frequency/severity, medication side effects, fall risk. - Red flag symptoms: Sudden worsening, new neurological deficits, persistent visual loss, signs of stroke. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom diaries, patient report, functional assessment.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: Given the patient's behavioral type (information_withholder), how should I communicate this plan? - Communication approach: Use simple, clear language; provide written summaries; reassure that symptoms are being managed proactively. - Addressing patient concerns: Emphasize the importance of follow-up and safety measures, reassure about safety of medications. - Adherence strategies: Encourage questions, involve family or caregiver if appropriate, verify understanding. - Family involvement: Discuss with the patient if family support can assist with medication adherence and fall prevention.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: What additional care coordination is needed? - Specialist referrals needed: Neurology consultation within 1-2 weeks for diagnostic clarification and management adjustment. - Other healthcare team members: Vestibular therapist, physical therapist, possibly neuro-otologist. - Community resources: Vestibular rehabilitation programs, migraine support groups. - Insurance/cost considerations: Discuss medication coverage, physical therapy access, and follow-up logistics.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of vestibular migraine, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes initiating prophylactic medication such as low-dose amitriptyline, implementing lifestyle modifications including sleep and trigger management, and engaging vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Initial management focuses on quickly assessing symptom severity, ensuring safety to prevent falls, and educating the patient about triggers and treatment adherence. Long-term management aims to reduce symptom frequency and improve functional stability. Follow-up will occur in approximately 4-6 weeks to evaluate response and make necessary adjustments. Patient education will emphasize safety, medication adherence, and understanding the importance of monitoring symptoms. This approach is designed to optimize symptom control, minimize risks, and promote sustainable management of vestibular migraine while coordinating with neurology and rehabilitation specialists to ensure comprehensive care.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Arrange neurology consultation, provide safety guidance, and give educational handouts. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate prophylactic medication, start vestibular therapy, and establish headache diaries. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduced attack frequency, improve balance, and reinforce lifestyle modifications. - Patient handout summary: Key points on medication use, fall prevention, trigger management, and when to seek urgent care.",
