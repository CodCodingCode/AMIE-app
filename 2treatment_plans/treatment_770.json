    "input": "THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Congenital Congenital Nasal Anomaly (likely congenital absence or severe malformation of the external nose, such as congenital arhinia)\nJustification: The lifelong breathing difficulties, particularly pronounced when lying down or exerting herself, suggest airway obstruction. The fact that she has no nose indicates an extreme form of congenital nasal malformation, which directly impairs airflow and olfaction (absence of smell). The presence of skull and facial features such as a larger forehead and wide-set eyes suggest syndromic or developmental anomalies associated with craniofacial malformations. Her speech difficulty and facial features point towards a congenital developmental anomaly affecting midface structures. Lack of prior surgeries or additional abnormalities simplifies the picture to a primary congenital anomaly rather than acquired or complex syndromic pathology. The clinical picture coherently aligns with congenital arhinia or severe nasal aplasia, which would explain the anosmia and breathing failure, especially in supine or exertional states.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCongenital arhinia (absence of the external nose due to a congenital developmental defect)\nEND",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the diagnosis of congenital arhinia, the primary concern is airway management to alleviate breathing difficulties, especially during sleep and exertion. The absence of the external nose indicates significant nasal and possibly upper airway malformations, which may cause airflow obstruction. This condition can compromise oxygenation and be life-threatening if not addressed. In addition to ensuring airway patency, addressing associated functional issues such as speech difficulties and facial aesthetics, in collaboration with specialists, is important. While pharmacological options are limited for structural congenital anomalies, non-invasive measures can provide immediate relief. Long-term management often involves surgical reconstruction, but this is usually planned with specialized surgeons. Initial treatment should focus on maintaining airway patency, optimizing breathing, and preventing complications.\n\nANSWER: The immediate management plan includes assessing and securing the airway, which may involve the use of nasal or oral airway adjuncts, and considering referral for evaluation by an ENT specialist experienced in craniofacial anomalies for potential surgical reconstruction of the nasal structures. In the interim, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of hypoxia, and strategies such as elevating the head of the bed can help improve breathing. Non-pharmacological interventions include ensuring a safe environment for oxygenation, possibly utilizing supplemental oxygen if necessary, and providing respiratory support during sleep if obstructive episodes are significant. Long-term, a multidisciplinary approach involving craniofacial surgeons, speech therapists, and psychologists is essential for addressing reconstructive needs, speech development, and psychosocial support. Pharmacological treatments are limited but may include medications to manage associated conditions if present, such as sleep-related breathing disorders. Immediate priority remains airway stabilization and specialist consultation for definitive reconstructive planning."
