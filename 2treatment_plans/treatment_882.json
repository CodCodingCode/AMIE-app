    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency. - Primary diagnosis confidence: High due to characteristic physical findings and longstanding history. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate; physical appearance is stable, no functional impairment, but social anxiety is impacting quality of life. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no immediate medical threats, but psychosocial support is important. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Possible underlying anxiety disorder\u2014should assess further if symptoms worsen.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: Now I'll select treatments based on current clinical guidelines. - First-line treatment per guidelines: Multidisciplinary approach with surgical consultation if patient or family opts for correction, and psychosocial interventions for anxiety. - Supporting evidence: Surgical correction is standard for congenital polydactyly if desired, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for social anxiety. - Patient-specific considerations: Asymptomatic physical deformity with social distress, requiring sensitivity to child's preferences. - Contraindications or cautions: Surgical intervention is elective; avoid unnecessary procedures unless requested. Monitor for emotional distress.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: If social anxiety is significant and impairing: - Primary medication choice: Consider selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline starting at 25 mg daily, titrated gradually. - Rationale for selection: SSRIs are first-line for social anxiety, evidence supports efficacy, with a favorable safety profile. - Expected timeline for improvement: Noticeable benefits often in 4-8 weeks. - Key side effects to monitor: Sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavioral agitation. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Cognitive-behavioral therapy remains primary; medications added if therapy alone is insufficient.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Initiate age-appropriate CBT focusing on social skills and coping strategies. - Patient education priorities: Normalize feelings, explain social anxiety, and dispel misconceptions about congenital deformity. - Lifestyle modifications: Encourage participation in peer activities, ensure supportive social environment. - Behavioral interventions: Consider social skills groups and family-based therapy.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 4 weeks for medication side effects and initial response; longer intervals based on progress. - Monitoring parameters: Anxiety levels, social engagement, side effects, family feedback. - Red flag symptoms: Worsening anxiety, suicidal ideation, emergent depression; instruct immediate contact if these occur. - Treatment response assessment: Use standardized scales such as the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN).  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Use age-appropriate, empathetic language, emphasizing support and options. - Addressing patient concerns: Discuss the child's feelings, potential for improvement, and respect for their preferences. - Adherence strategies: Simplify instructions, involve family, set achievable goals. - Family involvement: Engage parents for support and therapy participation.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: Plastic surgeon for surgical options if desired; child psychologist or psychiatrist experienced in anxiety. - Other healthcare team members: School counselors, social workers. - Community resources: Support groups for children with congenital deformities or social anxiety. - Insurance/cost considerations: Verify coverage for therapy and potential surgery; discuss financial options with family.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of congenital polydactyly with secondary social anxiety, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that includes evaluating parental and patient preferences regarding surgical correction, initiating cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored to age and social concerns, and considering pharmacotherapy (such as SSRIs) if anxiety significantly impairs functioning. This plan emphasizes a multidisciplinary team to support both physical appearance concerns and emotional well-being, with ongoing monitoring of social anxiety symptoms and functional status. The goal is to improve social confidence and quality of life while respecting the child's stability and autonomy.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Provide education on the nature of the deformity and social anxiety; engage family support; discuss therapy options. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy; assess for medication readiness if necessary; monitor emotional responses. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Achieve reduced social anxiety symptoms; consider surgical correction if the family wishes and the child is receptive; support social reintegration. - Patient handout summary: \"Understanding your condition; options for physical correction; strategies to overcome social anxiety; importance of support and follow-up.\"",
