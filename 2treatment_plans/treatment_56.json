    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:  STEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary diagnosis confidence: High, based on characteristic ocular symptoms (redness, soreness, tearing, discharge, photophobia) and systemic symptoms. - Severity classification: Mild to moderate conjunctivitis; no evidence of vision impairment or severe systemic illness, consistent with typical viral conjunctivitis. - Urgency level: Routine care needed; no signs of vision-threatening complications or requiring immediate intervention. - Differential considerations still requiring monitoring: Bacterial conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis, or other ocular pathology if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  STEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION: - First-line treatment per guidelines: Supportive care\u2014artificial tears, cold compresses, and hygiene measures. - Supporting evidence: Viral conjunctivitis is self-limiting; symptomatic relief with artificial tears and cool compresses improves comfort. - Patient-specific considerations: Anxiety may heighten perception of symptoms; reassurance is important. - Contraindications or cautions: Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed or suspected.  STEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary medication choice: No antiviral or antibiotic drops indicated initially. - Rationale for selection: Viral conjunctivitis typically resolves without medication; antibiotics do not hasten recovery and can promote resistance. - Expected timeline for improvement: Symptoms generally improve within 7-10 days. - Key side effects to monitor: Unusual worsening, persistent pain, vision changes\u2014indicate possible secondary infection or other pathology requiring earlier reassessment. - Alternative medications if first-line fails: Consider antibiotics only if bacterial superinfection suspected, verified by clinical signs.  STEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: - Primary non-drug interventions: Maintain ocular hygiene\u2014frequent handwashing, avoiding touching eyes, using clean tissues for discharge. - Patient education priorities: Clear instructions on avoiding eye contact with contaminated hands, importance of not sharing towels or linens. - Lifestyle modifications: Minimize eye rubbing, use sunglasses to reduce photophobia. - Behavioral interventions: Reassurance to reduce anxiety; stress management techniques if anxiety exacerbates perceived symptoms.  STEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY: - Follow-up timeline: Reassess in 3-5 days if symptoms persist or worsen. - Monitoring parameters: Symptom severity, discharge quality, visual acuity, signs of secondary bacterial infection. - Red flag symptoms: Vision loss, intense pain, increasing redness, or the development of corneal involvement\u2014seek urgent care immediately. - Treatment response assessment: Symptom improvement, reduced discharge, decreased photophobia.  STEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY: - Communication approach: Empathetic, clear, reassuring\u2014acknowledge anxiety and explain that viral conjunctivitis is common and self-limiting. - Addressing patient concerns: Clarify that systemic symptoms are likely viral and not indicative of hantavirus or other severe disease, emphasize importance of hygiene. - Adherence strategies: Encourage following hygiene measures, keep follow-up appointments, avoid touching or rubbing eyes. - Family involvement: Advise informing close contacts if contagious, and encourage shared hygiene practices.  STEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS: - Specialist referrals needed: None unless complicated symptoms or no improvement after 7-10 days. - Other healthcare team members: Educate patient about primary care follow-up. - Community resources: Provide educational materials on viral conjunctivitis and eye hygiene. - Insurance/cost considerations: Emphasize reliance on supportive care; avoid unnecessary prescriptions to reduce cost.\nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis, I recommend a comprehensive treatment approach that combines evidence-based medical management with patient-centered care strategies. The treatment plan includes supportive measures such as ocular hygiene, artificial tears, and cold compresses, with reassurance tailored to reduce anxiety. Initial management focuses on symptom relief and patient education, emphasizing hygiene to prevent contagion and secondary infection. Follow-up is planned within 3-5 days to monitor improvement, with instructions to seek urgent care if vision changes, persistent pain, or worsening symptoms occur. This approach aims to promote comfort, expedite recovery, and minimize unnecessary medication use, thereby achieving effective and sustainable management of viral conjunctivitis.  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: - Immediate actions (today): Educate patient on hygiene practices, provide symptomatic relief recommendations, and establish follow-up date. - Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete symptom resolution, prevent secondary infection or complications. - Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Reinforce preventive measures, address any residual anxiety. - Patient handout summary: Cover eye hygiene, symptom expectations, when to seek urgent care, and reassurance about the self-limited nature of viral conjunctivitis.",
