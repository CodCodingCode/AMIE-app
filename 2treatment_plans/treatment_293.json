    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic clinical reasoning to develop your treatment approach:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nLet me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity/urgency.\n- Primary \nANSWER: Based on the diagnosis of bacterial meningoencephalitis due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C, I recommend initiating immediate intravenous ceftriaxone therapy to rapidly control the infection. Supportive care should include hydration, rest, and close neurological monitoring. The treatment plan emphasizes prompt administration of antibiotics, vigilant monitoring for neurological and systemic deterioration, and thorough patient education regarding medication adherence and symptom recognition. Follow-up assessments should be scheduled within 1-2 weeks post-discharge to ensure resolution and monitor for potential complications. This comprehensive approach aims to effectively treat the infection, minimize neurological sequelae, and promote full recovery.\nIMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:\n- Immediate actions (today): Start IV ceftriaxone, obtain baseline labs, and perform detailed neurological assessment.\n- Short-term goals (1-4 weeks): Complete antibiotic course, monitor for symptom resolution, and evaluate for any neurological deficits.\n- Long-term objectives (3-6 months): Ensure complete recovery, prevent complications, and provide education on recurrent infection risks.\n- Patient handout summary: Importance of prompt treatment, medication adherence, recognizing warning signs, and follow-up schedule.",
