    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a several-week history of rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits including narrower stools, unintentional weight loss, and persistent fatigue. While these symptoms are likely genuine, they may be perceived as more severe due to anxiety. Additional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, urgency, or discomfort are not explicitly reported but should be evaluated. The timeline may be slightly longer or more variable than reported, and further assessment should include exploration of associated symptoms, medical history, and family history to determine the underlying cause and appropriate diagnostic workup.1. Diagnosis: Colorectal carcinoma Justification: The combination of persistent rectal bleeding, change in stool caliber (narrowing), weight loss, and fatigue strongly suggests colorectal cancer, especially in an adult with several weeks of symptoms. These are classic red flags for a neoplastic process.  2. Diagnosis: Diverticulosis with bleeding Justification: Common cause of lower GI bleeding in adults, especially if bleeding is recurrent or episodic. Although less associated with altered bowel habits, it remains a plausible cause, particularly if bleeding is prominent.  3. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's Disease) Justification: Chronic inflammation can cause bleeding, diarrhea, and weight loss. While abdominal pain isn't explicitly reported, IBD remains in the differential, especially in the context of ongoing symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Colonic polyps (adenomatous) or early neoplastic lesions Justification: Polyps can cause bleeding and may contribute to bowel habit changes if large or obstructive, and are precursors to cancer.  5. Diagnosis: Ischemic Colitis Justification: Typically presents with rectal bleeding and abdominal discomfort in older adults. The absence of specific pain here makes it less likely but still a differential.  6. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids or anorectal fissures Justification: Common causes of rectal bleeding; however, they are less likely to cause systemic symptoms like weight loss or bowel narrowing.  7. Diagnosis: Infectious colitis (less likely given the chronicity) Justification: Usually causes acute diarrhea and bleeding; less consistent with several-week history and weight loss.  8. Diagnosis: Bowel obstruction (secondary to tumor or other pathology) Justification: Could explain bowel narrowing and altered habits, but less directly causes rectal bleeding without associated obstruction symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Colonic tuberculosis (rare) Justification: Can cause bleeding, weight loss, and bowel changes, but less common in this context.  10. Diagnosis: Colonic angiodysplasia or vascular malformation Justification: Can cause bleeding but unlikely to produce the chronic systemic symptoms like weight loss and bowel narrowing over several weeks.

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a several-week history of rectal bleeding and stool narrowing, accompanied by unintentional weight loss and persistent fatigue. The description of symptoms suggests ongoing gastrointestinal changes, likely related to the colon or rectal pathology. While the patient reports these symptoms as moderate and progressive, emotional factors and anxiety could have influenced their perception, potentially leading to underreporting of additional symptoms such as pain, urgency, or bleeding severity. Further detailed evaluation is necessary to clarify the specifics of bleeding, investigate associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and assess the emotional burden influencing patient reporting.1. Diagnosis: Colorectal adenocarcinoma Justification: The prolonged rectal bleeding, stool narrowing, weight loss, and fatigue are classic red flags for colorectal cancer, especially in adults with progressive symptoms over weeks. This is the most concerning and probable diagnosis given the context.  2. Diagnosis: Diverticulitis with stricture formation Justification: Diverticulitis can cause bleeding and lead to strictures causing stool narrowing; however, the absence of acute pain makes this less likely but still relevant in differential.  3. Diagnosis: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis) Justification: Chronic inflammation could cause bleeding and stricture (especially Crohn's), but less likely without significant pain or diarrhea; nonetheless, it must be considered.  4. Diagnosis: Benign colorectal polyps with bleeding Justification: Polyps can cause bleeding and sometimes stool narrowing, especially if large or malignant. The weight loss is less typical for benign polyps but still plausible.  5. Diagnosis: Ischemic colitis Justification: Usually presents acutely with pain; chronicity less typical without additional ischemic symptoms, but bleeding could occur in some cases.  6. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids or anal fissures Justification: Common causes of rectal bleeding but less likely to cause stool narrowing or weight loss; less probable in this scenario.  7. Diagnosis: Gastric or small bowel malignancy with bleeding Justification: Less likely given localization of symptoms to the distal bowel; but should consider if upper GI bleeding was suspected.  8. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis of the colon Justification: Rare but can cause ulceration, bleeding, and strictures; more common in endemic regions.  9. Diagnosis: Infectious colitis (chronic infection) Justification: Usually presents with diarrhea rather than stool narrowing or weight loss, making this less likely.  10. Diagnosis: Functional or psychogenic bowel disorder Justification: Considering emotional factors, but symptoms progression and weight loss make this unlikely as a primary diagnosis.

    "input": "An adult female presents with a several-week history of intermittent rectal bleeding, described as blood at bowel movements, and stool narrowing, accompanied by unintentional weight loss and persistent fatigue. She reports concerns about possible malignancy, influenced by family history, but the specific severity of bleeding and associated symptoms such as pain or urgency may be underreported or exaggerated by emotional distress. The timeline indicates a gradual onset with fluctuating intensity. Further detailed clinical evaluation is necessary to quantify symptoms, assess emotional factors, and determine the underlying etiology.1. Diagnosis: Colorectal carcinoma Justification: The patient's several-week history of intermittent rectal bleeding, stool narrowing, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue aligns with typical presentation of colorectal cancer. The gradual symptom onset, systemic signs, and family history increase the likelihood. These features suggest a neoplastic process causing luminal narrowing and blood loss, fitting the pattern of colorectal malignancy.  2. Diagnosis: Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Justification: Chronic inflammation can cause rectal bleeding and stool changes over weeks. The intermittent nature and systemic symptoms like fatigue are compatible. Although less likely without mention of pain or diarrhea, IBD remains a differential, especially if family history includes IBD, which could influence likelihood.  3. Diagnosis: Benign colorectal polyps Justification: Polyps can cause rectal bleeding and stool narrowing, especially if large or with hemorrhagic features. They are precursors to cancer, and symptom duration over weeks supports a slow-growing process. Polyps are common in women and could explain bleeding, though they are less associated with weight loss unless malignant transformation occurs.  4. Diagnosis: Anal fissure or hemorrhoids Justification: Hemorrhoids or fissures commonly cause rectal bleeding. However, they typically produce painless bleeding and do not cause stool narrowing or systemic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue, making these less likely as primary causes but still possible contributors or benign explanations for bleeding episodes.  5. Diagnosis: Infectious proctitis or other infectious causes Justification: Infections can cause bleeding and inflammation, but the prolonged, progressive course with systemic weight loss and fatigue makes infectious causes less probable. They are included for completeness but are lower on the likelihood scale given the chronicity and systemic features.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotional and somewhat vague descriptors (\"really frightening,\" \"so tired,\" \"really bad\") that reflect genuine distress, but she avoids overly clinical detail initially. Her explanations become more detailed when asked, but she may still filter her responses to emphasize her concern. - Information flow: She is initially reserved, volunteering minimal info but opens up when prompted. Her responses are organized but focus primarily on her immediate fears, with less attention to broader medical history unless directly asked. - Response style: She prefers concise answers but is willing to elaborate under questioning, indicating a tendency to withhold more detailed information until explicitly encouraged.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitations and the tendency to answer only what is asked suggest she might be holding back additional details about her emotional state, family influence, or health behaviors. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays how severe her symptoms might be, using words like \"really bad\" but not describing specific impacts or fears in depth unless prompted. - Amplification patterns: She clearly amplifies her emotional response, describing her fears and fatigue vigorously, indicating genuine anxiety which may exaggerate her perception of threat. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance to discuss her anxiety or her health habits suggests mild discomfort or shame about her fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No notable confusion; her timeline is consistent, indicating reliable recall. - Family influence: She openly mentions her family history, influencing her fears, but does not seem manipulated or overly influenced in her current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, possibly coupled with health anxiety, as she overstates the severity of her fears due to distress. - Severity: Moderate, as her emotional state significantly influences her reporting, though symptoms are real. - Areas most affected: Her perceived severity of cancer risk and fears about surgery are most biased, potentially leading her to overestimate dangers. - Reliability: Her self-report is reasonably trustworthy but likely colored by anxiety, warranting corroboration with clinical and diagnostic data.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper emotional context, her understanding of her actual risk, and her coping mechanisms. She may also withhold doubts or fears about her prognosis. - Symptoms probably minimized: She might be downplaying her own level of distress or the impact on her daily life, beyond fatigue and physical symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of cancer and surgery are probably exaggerated by her anxiety, which needs addressing to ensure appropriate management. - True timeline: Symptom progression appears consistent, but her emotional amplification might cause her to perceive it as more sudden or severe than it is objectively.  In summary, Margaret demonstrates communication biases consistent with moderate health-related anxiety and emotional amplification, which influence her perception of severity and her reporting style. Building rapport and addressing her emotional concerns will be essential to accurate assessment and management.",

    "input": "An adult female presents with a several-week history of rectal bleeding and stool narrowing, with reports of bright red blood mainly on toilet paper and daily changes in bowel caliber. She reports associated fatigue and unintentional weight loss. She experiences intermittent pain and urgency during bowel movements. Given her emotional distress and communication style, the severity of bleeding and other symptoms may be underestimated; objective assessment is needed to quantify bleeding, evaluate for anemia, and determine the exact extent of bowel involvement. Further detailed inquiry is required to clarify the true severity of her symptoms and systemic effects, while considering that her reports might be influenced by psychological factors.1. Diagnosis: Colorectal adenocarcinoma Justification: The presentation of several weeks of rectal bleeding, stool narrowing, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and intermittent pain is highly suggestive of a malignant mass in the rectum or distal colon. Bright red blood on toilet paper indicates distal bleeding but could also be from friable tumor tissue. The change in stool caliber and systemic symptoms emphasize a neoplastic process causing luminal obstruction or infiltration. Her weight loss and fatigue raise concern for malignancy-related anemia and systemic effects, making colorectal cancer the most probable diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) Justification: The patient reports intermittent pain, urgency, and rectal bleeding over weeks. While more characteristic of IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis with continuous rectal bleeding and narrowing, some features overlap. The systemic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue could reflect active inflammation causing anemia and discomfort. The stool changes and bleeding might be from inflammatory ulcers and mucosal edema, but the duration and systemic symptoms also fit with malignancy\u2014thus, a plausible differential.  3. Diagnosis: Diverticular disease with bleeding Justification: While diverticulosis commonly causes painless rectal bleeding, especially in older patients, it usually presents with overt bleeding rather than stool narrowing or systemic symptoms like weight loss. Nonetheless, if bleeding is significant and recurrent, it could cause anemia and confusion with other etiologies. Given her systemic symptoms and stool change, diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding alone are less likely but warrant consideration if bleeding is prominent.  4. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids or anorectal fissures Justification: Bright red blood on toilet paper is characteristic of hemorrhoids or fissures; however, these typically do not cause stool narrowing, weight loss, or systemic symptoms. Their inclusion accounts for common benign causes of bleeding but is less probable given systemic and structural signs, making them a less likely primary diagnosis but still relevant in differential.  5. Diagnosis: Ischemic colitis Justification: Ischemic colitis can cause rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and systemic symptoms, especially in older individuals or those with vascular disease. However, its presentation is usually more acute and localized, and it tends not to cause stool narrowing over several weeks or weight loss, thus making it a less likely primary consideration but relevant as a secondary possibility.  STOP HERE.**   COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:   - Language choices: The patient uses specific descriptors when discussing bleeding (\u201cbright red,\u201d \u201cmostly on toilet paper\u201d) but remains vague about frequency and volume. She describes symptoms with emotional intensity (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201creally bad,\u201d \u201cso tired\u201d), which emphasizes distress but may also indicate some emotional amplification. There\u2019s a tendency to frame symptoms as significant but not necessarily worsening beyond the described level, possibly to seek reassurance or downplay personal burden.   - Information flow: She volunteers key details about bleeding and stool changes early, suggesting recognition of importance, but her responses to broader history questions are minimal unless prompted, reflecting some guardedness or discomfort. Her responses are organized but somewhat limited in depth, focusing on her core worries.   - Response style: She tends to give concise, emotionally charging responses, with willingness to share her immediate fears but hesitation in elaborating on historical or less pressing details. Her responses are consistent but sometimes vague, indicating possible strategic withholding of finer symptom details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:   - Evidence of withholding signs: Vague descriptions about the bleeding and stool patterns, potentially indicating a reluctance to fully disclose or discomfort in discussing personal bowel issues.   - Minimization behaviors: Slight downplaying of symptom frequency (\u201cmost days,\u201d \u201csome pain\u201d), possibly to avoid alarm or because she perceives these as less severe than they truly are.   - Amplification patterns: Emphasizing her emotional reactions (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201cvery tired,\u201d \u201closing weight all at once\") to elicit concern, which supports heightened emotional distress.   - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but possible subtle discomfort around discussing bowel symptoms, given vague descriptions and a focus on emotional fears.   - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are coherent.   - Family influence: The mention of her family history of cancer may increase perceived threat and influence her responses to heighten concern.    **BIAS ASSESSMENT:**   - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with possible symptom minimization\u2014she is clearly distressed and anxious, which could lead to overestimation of danger, yet she may also minimize certain symptom specifics.   - Severity: Moderate\u2014her distress consciously enhances the presentation, but factual responses are generally honest with a tendency toward emotional exaggeration.   - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and frequency detail, where she might be underreporting or overemphasizing based on her emotional state.   - Reliability: Moderate\u2014she appears honest about her fears but may subconsciously adjust details to match her emotional needs, necessitating corroborative diagnostic information.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:   - Information likely missing: Precise details about bleeding (amount, timeline), stool pattern specifics, and the full extent of associated symptoms like pain or urgency.   - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual bleeding volume or severity, and possibly the degree of weight loss and fatigue, could be worse than reported, given her tendency to provide vague info and emotional emphasis elsewhere.   - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of cancer and surgery seems heightened, which might lead her to perceive the situation as more dire than it objectively is, influenced by her family history and emotional distress.   - True timeline: The progression is likely more aggressive; her current distress level suggests symptoms may have developed more rapidly or severely than she explicitly states.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient's description of bleeding on toilet paper and stool narrowing over several weeks, with systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, points toward a potentially serious underlying condition such as colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. - She emphasizes emotional distress and describes her symptoms with some vagueness, which may affect the accuracy of her account. To differentiate between diagnoses and clarify her symptom severity, further details about the bleeding (amount, timing, consistency) and stool characteristics are needed. - Since she reports intermittent pain and urgency, exploring the nature and triggers of these symptoms will help differentiate inflammatory processes from structural neoplastic causes. - Her family history of cancer heightens suspicion for malignancy, which warrants targeted questions about systemic symptoms, previous screening, and risk factors. - Given her presentation and communication style, I need to ask focused, clarifying questions that balance sensitivity and specificity to gather precise data without increasing distress.

Can you tell me more about how often you see the bleeding\u2014does it happen with every bowel movement or only some of the time? Also, has the amount of blood changed recently\u2014are you noticing more, less, or about the same? Regarding your stool, you mentioned it sometimes narrows\u2014does that happen at certain times or is it a consistent change? And have you experienced any other symptoms during bowel movements, like pain, urgency, or a feeling that you haven't fully emptied? Lastly, besides feeling very tired and losing weight, have you noticed any fevers, chills, or any other new symptoms?\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "**   COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:   - Language choices: The patient uses specific descriptors when discussing bleeding (\u201cbright red,\u201d \u201cmostly on toilet paper\u201d) but remains vague about frequency and volume. She describes symptoms with emotional intensity (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201creally bad,\u201d \u201cso tired\u201d), which emphasizes distress but may also indicate some emotional amplification. There\u2019s a tendency to frame symptoms as significant but not necessarily worsening beyond the described level, possibly to seek reassurance or downplay personal burden.   - Information flow: She volunteers key details about bleeding and stool changes early, suggesting recognition of importance, but her responses to broader history questions are minimal unless prompted, reflecting some guardedness or discomfort. Her responses are organized but somewhat limited in depth, focusing on her core worries.   - Response style: She tends to give concise, emotionally charging responses, with willingness to share her immediate fears but hesitation in elaborating on historical or less pressing details. Her responses are consistent but sometimes vague, indicating possible strategic withholding of finer symptom details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:   - Evidence of withholding signs: Vague descriptions about the bleeding and stool patterns, potentially indicating a reluctance to fully disclose or discomfort in discussing personal bowel issues.   - Minimization behaviors: Slight downplaying of symptom frequency (\u201cmost days,\u201d \u201csome pain\u201d), possibly to avoid alarm or because she perceives these as less severe than they truly are.   - Amplification patterns: Emphasizing her emotional reactions (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201cvery tired,\u201d \u201closing weight all at once\") to elicit concern, which supports heightened emotional distress.   - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but possible subtle discomfort around discussing bowel symptoms, given vague descriptions and a focus on emotional fears.   - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are coherent.   - Family influence: The mention of her family history of cancer may increase perceived threat and influence her responses to heighten concern.    **BIAS ASSESSMENT:**   - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with possible symptom minimization\u2014she is clearly distressed and anxious, which could lead to overestimation of danger, yet she may also minimize certain symptom specifics.   - Severity: Moderate\u2014her distress consciously enhances the presentation, but factual responses are generally honest with a tendency toward emotional exaggeration.   - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and frequency detail, where she might be underreporting or overemphasizing based on her emotional state.   - Reliability: Moderate\u2014she appears honest about her fears but may subconsciously adjust details to match her emotional needs, necessitating corroborative diagnostic information.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:   - Information likely missing: Precise details about bleeding (amount, timeline), stool pattern specifics, and the full extent of associated symptoms like pain or urgency.   - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual bleeding volume or severity, and possibly the degree of weight loss and fatigue, could be worse than reported, given her tendency to provide vague info and emotional emphasis elsewhere.   - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of cancer and surgery seems heightened, which might lead her to perceive the situation as more dire than it objectively is, influenced by her family history and emotional distress.   - True timeline: The progression is likely more aggressive; her current distress level suggests symptoms may have developed more rapidly or severely than she explicitly states.",

    "input": "An adult female presents with a several-week history of intermittent bright red rectal bleeding mostly observed on wiping, with a report of substantial bleeding on some occasions, and persistent stool narrowing noted most days. She reports associated fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and episodes of feeling feverish or chills. She experiences mild to moderate discomfort and urgency during bowel movements, and describes a dull ache afterward. Despite her subjective reports of systemic symptoms, objective evaluation is necessary to determine the severity of bleeding, check for anemia, and assess overall clinical status. Her communication suggests emotional distress may influence her perception, possibly leading to overestimation of symptom severity; therefore, further objective investigations are essential to appropriately evaluate her condition.Colorectal carcinoma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses an emotional, somewhat subjective tone\u2014e.g., \"quite a bit sometimes,\" \"really frightening,\" indicating distress. She employs vagueness (\"most days,\" \"kind of like that all the time now\") which suggests some reluctance to provide specific details. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming but mixes specific details with vague descriptions, perhaps to avoid fully confronting the severity or because of discomfort. She responds directly but with mild hesitation and emotional overlays. - Response style: Her answers are elaborative but occasionally inconsistent or vague, revealing underlying anxiety but also some potential withholding of precise details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Mild vagueness about blood volume and frequency (\"quite a bit sometimes,\" \"most days\"), possibly to minimize perceived severity or manage her discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Her use of \"most days\" rather than every day and minimizing pain during movements may reflect an attempt to downplay the symptoms. - Amplification patterns: She words her distress with emotional expressions like \"really frightening,\" possibly amplifying perceived severity due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not overt, but the discomfort discussing blood on toilet paper and stool changes suggests some embarrassment influencing her responses. - Confusion/memory issues: No specific evidence of memory lapses but some ambiguity in describing symptom timing and details. - Family influence: Her concern about family cancer history might heighten her anxiety, leading to amplification of her symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification combined with some minimization\u2014she seems emotionally overwhelmed, leading to possible exaggeration of her concerns while underreporting specific details to manage discomfort. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional state influences her descriptions, shaping her reporting and potentially affecting clinical judgment. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of blood, stool narrowing, and pain\u2014subject to both amplification and mild minimization. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional distress and vague language suggest some risk of misrepresenting symptom severity, so clinical findings should be corroborated with objective tests.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise amount, consistency, and timing of bleeding and pain details. She might understate the severity of bleeding or pain due to embarrassment or anxiety. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of bleeding and discomfort may be worse than she reports. Her attempts at minimizing may obscure true urgency. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of cancer and surgery are likely exaggerated by anxiety; her emotional distress could cause her to over-focus on worst-case scenarios. - True timeline: The structure suggests her symptoms are progressively worsening, but her overemphasis might make me cautious\u2014actual progression might be more gradual or less severe than perceived.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient\u2019s vague descriptions and emotional distress require clarification to accurately assess the severity and characteristics of her symptoms. - Key information gaps include the exact amount and pattern of bleeding, changes in stool habits over time, presence of anemia, and any associated symptoms like pain or systemic signs beyond what's reported. - Diagnostic priorities involve differentiating between benign causes like hemorrhoids or fissures versus serious conditions like malignancy or inflammatory disease. - Patient's emotional and communication style suggests she might minimize some details or be influenced by anxiety, so questions need to be gentle but focused to elicit precise information. - The goal is to confirm whether symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for significant pathology, especially in light of her systemic symptoms and alarm features. - This stage is crucial for gathering objective details that influence the urgency and type of investigations needed before diagnosis is confirmed.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused, clarifying questions aimed at specifics of bleeding patterns, stool changes, and associated symptoms. - Emphasis on symptom timeline, quantity, and consistency to distinguish between benign and concerning causes. - Sensitive, open-ended language to encourage honesty while minimizing patient discomfort or defensiveness. - Expected to either confirm severity suggestive of pathology or reassure regarding less alarming causes, guiding next steps.\nANSWER: \"Could you tell me exactly how much blood you've noticed during a typical bowel movement\u2014like, are you seeing spots on the toilet paper, or is it more like a small amount, or quite a bit of bleeding? And when you say 'most days,' do you mean every day, or just several days a week? Also, have you noticed if your stool changes\u2014do they become consistently narrow or thin, or only sometimes? And since you've mentioned feeling tired and losing weight, have you also experienced any other symptoms like fever, chills, or night sweats that you've noticed along with these bowel changes?\"",
