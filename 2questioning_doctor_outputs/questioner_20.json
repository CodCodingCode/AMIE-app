    "input": "A patient presents with an acute onset of systemic illness characterized by fever, chills, body aches primarily in the back and joints, and a rash on the chest. She reports feeling dizzy on sitting or standing and exhibits increased respiratory rate. Her emotional distress appears to amplify her perception of symptom severity, although the core signs suggest an infectious process, possibly viral or bacterial. No neurological deficits or mental confusion are currently reported but should be formally assessed to rule out subtle neurological involvement. Further evaluation, including a physical examination and mental status assessment, is necessary to determine the severity of her condition objectively.1. Diagnosis: Sepsis (e.g., bacterial origin) Justification: The systemic signs of fever, chills, tachypnea, and malaise with hypotension/dizziness suggest a severe systemic infection potentially progressing to sepsis, which must be promptly identified and treated.  2. Diagnosis: Viral exanthem (e.g., acute viral infection like dengue, chikungunya) Justification: Systemic symptoms with rash and myalgia are characteristic of viral illnesses common in many clinical settings, especially if the rash appears on the chest and is associated with systemic symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Meningococcemia Justification: Rapid onset of systemic illness with rash and possible progression to septicemia makes meningococcal infection a critical \"can't miss\" diagnosis requiring urgent recognition.  4. Diagnosis: Rickettsial infection (e.g., typhus, spotted fever) Justification: Systemic illness with rash, fever, and myalgia may represent rickettsial disease, especially if there's a history of potential exposure to vectors.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune vasculitis (e.g., systemic vasculitis or lupus flare) Justification: Symptoms of systemic rash and malaise, along with joint involvement, can be autoimmune in origin, although less likely without chronicity or other autoimmune features.  6. Diagnosis: Acute HIV infection Justification: Fever, rash, myalgia, and systemic symptoms could represent primary HIV infection, which can present acutely with nonspecific symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Thrombocytopenic purpura or other hematologic illness Justification: Hematologic manifestations can include rash (petechiae), systemic symptoms, and dizziness; however, no explicit mention of bleeding or lab findings is provided.  8. Diagnosis: Lyme disease or other tick-borne illness Justification: Depending on geographic exposure, systemic illness with rash and myalgia could represent early Lyme disease or similar vector-borne infection.  9. Diagnosis: Drug reaction with systemic symptoms Justification: If recent medication initiation occurred, a drug hypersensitivity syndrome might present acutely with rash, systemic symptoms, and malaise.  10. Diagnosis: Autoimmune or connective tissue disease flare Justification: Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus can present with rash, fever, and joint symptoms, but less common as initial presentation acutely without prior autoimmune history.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged words such as \"terrible,\" \"really scared,\" and \"awful,\" indicating heightened anxiety. Her descriptions are generally detailed but sometimes vague or mixed, like \"all kind of mixed up in my head,\" which reflects possible confusion or fatigue. - Information flow: She appears forthcoming and eager to explain her symptoms but often combines multiple symptoms into broad strokes, which may obscure specific details. Her responses tend to be organized around her feelings of fear, rather than precise clinical features. - Response style: She provides elaborate descriptions often driven by emotional distress, and she tends to focus more on how she feels than precise symptom chronology. She does not withhold information but frames it within her worry.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she seems open but may be more impulsive with her disclosures due to anxious urgency. - Minimization behaviors: Her language does not suggest minimization; instead, she amplifies her symptoms, perhaps as an expression of her fear. - Amplification patterns: Her use of intense descriptors (\"terrible,\" \"so weak,\" \"really scared\") indicates amplification, likely influenced by anxiety and urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she is straightforward about her symptoms and concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: Her statement about being \"all mixed up in my head\" suggests possible cognitive fatigue or confusion, which may affect her clarity. - Family influence: The only mention of family is her daughter visiting infrequently; there\u2019s no evidence her responses are influenced by family pressure or opinion.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be anxiety-driven emotional amplification, leading to overestimation of symptom severity and distress. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as her anxiety significantly influences her perception and reporting, which may distort clinical interpretation. - Areas most affected: The perception of her respiratory distress, fever, and pain; her emotional state inflates the severity of her presentation. - Reliability: Her self-reporting is affected by her anxiety, meaning while her symptoms are genuine, the intensity may be exaggerated, warranting cautious clinical corroboration.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully disclose subtle neurological signs, baseline cognitive status, or more gradual symptom progression, possibly because her anxiety dominates her perception. - Symptoms probably minimized: Respiratory compromise and subtle physical signs may be more severe than she reports, given her emotional focus. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of dying and catastrophic illness could be overstated; her emotional state could lead her to perceive her condition as worse than it objectively is. - True timeline: The report aligns with a rapid progression, but her heightened emotional response likely magnifies her perception of speed and severity of worsening.  Overall, her communication reflects significant anxiety amplification, which influences her perception of severity, but her open sharing and full symptom description are helpful, provided clinical assessment verifies her physical findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's significant emotional distress and detailed symptom reporting, it's essential to build rapport and validate her experience before delving into specifics. To continue exploring her symptoms and gain clarity, an open-ended question that encourages her to describe her experience in her own words is appropriate. This will help understand her perspective, gather more detail, and identify any other concerns she may have overlooked. Since her anxiety may influence how she perceives and reports symptoms, phrasing the question gently is important to create psychological safety. This aligns with the phase goals of establishing trust, exploring the broad picture, and gathering as much contextual information as possible.\nANSWER: \"Please tell me more about what you've been experiencing since this all started, in your own words. How has this been affecting you day to day?\"",

    "input": "Patient is a middle-aged adult presenting with an acute systemic illness characterized by reported fever, chills, generalized body aches, a rash on the chest, increased respiratory rate, and dizziness upon sitting or standing. While the patient describes feeling very unwell, her account indicates difficulty in accurately recalling symptom chronology and intensity due to emotional distress and confusion, which may lead to overestimating severity. Physical examination and further assessment are needed to evaluate the extent of systemic involvement, identify any subtle neurological or organ-specific findings, and establish an objective severity of her condition. Additional clarification of symptom onset, progression, and mental status is necessary to guide further management.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial Sepsis Justification: The combination of systemic symptoms (fever, chills, body aches), increased respiratory rate, and dizziness suggests a severe systemic response, possibly sepsis, especially if an infectious source is present. The rash could point toward meningococcal or other bacterial infection, which requires urgent diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Viral Exanthem (e.g., Dengue or Viral Septicemia) Justification: Fever, body aches, rash, and systemic symptoms are characteristic of certain viral infections, such as dengue fever, which can cause rash, fever, and malaise, particularly in endemic areas.  3. Diagnosis: Meningococcal Meningitis/Septicemia Justification: The rash on the chest along with fever, systemic illness, and neurological symptoms such as confusion and dizziness rise concern for meningococcal disease, which can present with rash and rapid deterioration.  4. Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis or Allergic Reaction Justification: Rash combined with systemic symptoms could be a severe allergic response, especially if symptoms developed rapidly and along with dizziness, indicating possible autonomic involvement.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Vasculitis Justification: Vasculitis can cause systemic symptoms including rash, fever, and malaise, especially in middle-aged adults, though less acutely severe unless there is organ involvement.  6. Diagnosis: Acute HIV Seroconversion Justification: Acute retroviral syndrome presents with fever, rash, body aches, and systemic symptoms, often in middle-aged adults, though additional history would assist.  7. Diagnosis: Endocarditis Justification: Infective endocarditis can cause systemic symptoms, skin findings (e.g., petechiae), and constitutional symptoms, especially with unrecognized bacteremia.  8. Diagnosis: Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (or other tick-borne illness) Justification: Characterized by fever, rash, and systemic illness; more common in endemic areas, and can present acutely.  9. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) flare Justification: SLE can cause systemic symptoms, rash, and constitutional signs, though less acute unless complicated; emotional distress may also suggest autoimmune activity.  10. Diagnosis: Heat Exhaustion / Dehydration Justification: Could cause dizziness and systemic malaise but less likely to cause fever and rash without other contributing factors; lower likelihood given severity and rash presence.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret uses mostly emotional and vague language (\"terrible,\" \"all kind of,\" \"muddled\") which reflects her distress and difficulty in precise description. She balances personal affect with some clinical detail. - Information flow: Her responses are detailed and elaborative but scattered, indicating she is trying to give a comprehensive picture but struggles with organization due to anxiety or confusion. - Response style: She tends to elaborate extensively, including unsought details, and exhibits hesitation, which suggests internal distress and cognitive overload affecting her clarity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There's no clear evidence of withholding; she seems anxious to communicate everything she perceives. - Minimization behaviors: She avoids minimizing symptoms; instead, she emphasizes their severity, though her own words suggest potential exaggeration driven by fear. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of danger (\"worst,\" \"really scared,\" \"burning up inside\") suggest a heightened emotional state that could amplify perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not notably evident; her open explanations imply comfort in sharing her concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear signs are present \u2014 her statement that her experience is \"all so muddled\" and uncertainty about timing indicate significant cognitive confusion. - Family influence: Not directly evident, her responses reflect personal distress rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Confusion/memory distortion, likely compounded by anxiety, leading to difficulty sequencing symptoms accurately. Emotional distress may also cause her to overemphasize the severity. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given her explicit mention of muddled memory and struggles in ordered description. - Areas most affected: Timeline of symptom onset and progression, specific details about rash and breathing changes. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional state and confusion compromise precise reporting, but her willingness to share is good.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact timing and sequence of symptom onset, which are critical in sepsis management. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs that she may not fully grasp or report accurately, such as subtle aspects of her rash or early signs of deterioration. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear may lead her to perceive her condition as worse than it truly is, possibly causing overestimation of severity. - True timeline: The actual progression was likely more rapid and severe than her narrative suggests, but her confusion clouds this. Her distress suggests she is genuinely unwell, but the precise sequence is uncertain.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient\u2019s emotional distress and confusion create gaps in her recall of symptoms, especially concerning the timeline and specific features. - It\u2019s crucial to explore her perspective on when symptoms started and how they evolved, without making assumptions, to clarify the sequence and severity. - Understanding how she perceives her overall condition and what worries her most will help gauge her concerns and anxieties, which may influence her reporting and experience. - Gentle, open-ended questions can help her elaborate without feeling pressured, building trust and providing more context.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, to encourage storytelling and detailed explanation. - Information target: Symptom timeline, progression, specific signs (like rash or breathing difficulty), and her emotional experience. - Communication approach: Sensitive and validating, allowing her to express herself freely while gently guiding to clarify key details. - Expected value: This will help refine the understanding of the onset, progression, and impact, informing diagnosis and immediate management priorities.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about when you first started to notice these symptoms and how things have changed since then?

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged adult presenting with an acute systemic illness characterized by reported onset of chills, fever, and body aches. She also reports a rash on her chest, increased respiratory rate, dizziness upon sitting or standing, and general weakness. Her symptom timeline suggests initial symptoms starting last evening with worsening overnight, although her recall is affected by emotional distress and confusion, which may lead to overestimation of severity. Physical examination and further assessment are necessary to determine the actual extent of symptoms, vital signs, mental status, and any additional findings to guide appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Meningococcal sepsis (meningococcemia) Justification: The combination of fever, chills, rash, rapid progression of systemic illness, and hypotension or dizziness suggests meningococcal infection. Rash on the chest that may be petechial or purpuric supports this, as meningococcemia classically presents with petechial rash. The acuity and systemic symptoms are consistent with sepsis and potential disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is characteristic in meningococcal disease.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial sepsis (other etiologies like gram-negative bacteria) Justification: Fever, chills, body aches, and rash could result from gram-negative bacteremia (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli). Elevated respiratory rate and dizziness indicate systemic inflammatory response. While rash is less specific, bacterial sepsis remains high on the differential and could mimic meningococcemia if rash is non-specific.  3. Diagnosis: Viral exanthem with systemic symptoms (e.g., viral febrile illness such as dengue or measles) Justification: Viral infections can cause systemic symptoms including fever, body aches, rash, and constitutional symptoms. The rash location and appearance, along with systemic features, could suggest a viral exanthem, especially in the context of rapid worsening. However, the rash\u2019s description and severity lean more toward sepsis.  4. Diagnosis: Drug reaction or hypersensitivity syndrome Justification: If the patient were on new medications, this could cause fever, rash, and systemic symptoms. However, no medication history is provided, making this less likely, though still in differential.  5. Diagnosis: Heat stroke or other non-infectious systemic inflammatory response Justification: The physical activity level or environmental exposure isn't specified, and systemic inflammatory symptoms could be due to non-infectious causes. Yet, the presence of rash and rapid progression favors infectious causes over this diagnosis.

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged woman presenting with an acute systemic illness characterized by reported fever, chills, and generalized body aches beginning the previous evening, with progression overnight. She reports a rash on her chest that appeared around the same time but is uncertain of its exact onset. She also describes increasing weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness upon sitting or standing, and confusion about the timeline and severity of her symptoms, suggesting possible neurological and respiratory involvement. Physical examination has confirmed a generalized erythematous rash on the chest. Due to her emotional distress and vague recall, the severity of her neurological and respiratory symptoms may be underestimated, and her overall clinical picture could be more severe than her subjective report indicates. Further objective assessment, including vital signs and neurological exam, is necessary to determine the true extent of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Meningococcal septicemia (meningococcemia) Justification: The rapid onset of fever, chills, rash, altered mental status, hypotension, and systemic symptoms strongly suggest meningococcal septicemia. The rash onset on the chest along with systemic signs and neurological changes aligns with characteristic findings of meningococcal infection, which can cause petechial or purpuric rash, sepsis, and confusion. Immediate identification and treatment are crucial due to high mortality risk.  2. Diagnosis: Viral exanthem with systemic involvement (e.g., Dengue, Viral Hemorrhagic Fever) Justification: The general rash, febrile illness, body aches, and systemic symptoms could represent a severe viral infection, such as Dengue or another hemorrhagic fever, which can cause rash, fever, weakness, and bleeding tendencies. These viruses may also cause neurological symptoms and respiratory compromise in severe cases. The rash appearance coinciding with fever supports this.  3. Diagnosis: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) Justification: The presentation of fever, rash, hypotension, dizziness, and systemic illness with rapid progression is consistent with TSS, often associated with superantigen-producing bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The rash and multisystem involvement align with TSS features, particularly if there is an entry site or toxin exposure.  4. Diagnosis: Rickettsial disease (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever) Justification: The erythematous rash involving the chest, systemic symptoms with fever, body aches, and neurological signs fit with Rickettsial infections, which can cause vasculitis leading to rash, systemic symptoms, and neurological impairments. These illnesses often carry severity and require prompt antibiotic treatment.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune or inflammatory process (e.g., Vasculitis, Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) Justification: Although less likely in this acutely febrile setting with prominent rash and systemic features, autoimmune processes could explain the neurological and systemic symptoms, especially if infectious causes are ruled out. The generalized rash and neuro symptoms could be manifestations of systemic vasculitis or post-infectious autoimmune phenomena like ADEM, included due to evolving neurological symptoms, although they are less probable as primary diagnoses at this stage.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret uses vague and non-specific descriptions like \"kind of all over my chest\" and \"a little earlier,\" which dilute the perceived severity. She employs emotional language, expressing fear (\"I'm so scared,\" \"I'm overwhelmed\") that indicates distress but also reflects a tendency to amplify concern, possibly to seek reassurance. - Information flow: She offers some details proactively, such as when symptoms started, but often qualifies her statements (\"I think,\" \"maybe\"), which suggests a reluctance or difficulty in stating facts definitively. Her responses are generally organized but show hesitation, indicating internal conflict or uncertainty. - Response style: Her answers are elaborative but often include pauses (\"I think,\" \"not sure\"), with some tangential information that may distract from core symptoms, possibly to avoid focusing on alarming details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of reluctance to confirm precise timing or details about symptoms' progression\u2014\"I think it was yesterday or maybe earlier\"\u2014suggests covert withholding or uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the rash (\"not growing or anything\") and describing dizziness as \"like I\u2019m spinning\" rather than a specific severity or precise description, which might mask the true extent of neurological involvement. - Amplification patterns: Her frequent expressions of fear about dying (\"could I be dying,\" \"pass out\") and her detailed worry about rapid deterioration may be exaggerated projections of her anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame, but her hesitation and qualifying language suggest discomfort discussing certain symptoms or fears. - Confusion/memory issues: The inconsistent timeline (\"started maybe last night or earlier,\" \"dizziness started maybe last night\") indicates cognitive distraction, difficulty recalling precise symptom onset, common in septic states. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but her report of infrequent family visits could contribute to feelings of isolation, possibly impacting her reporting accuracy.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of **confusion/memory bias**, compounded by emotional amplification of concern and some minimization, influenced by fear. Her vague responses and hesitation suggest cognitive and emotional biases that distort the factual accuracy of her report. - Severity: Moderate, because the patient's cognitive ambiguity, emotional exaggeration, and reluctance to specify details significantly impair objective assessment reliability. - Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy and symptom severity are most biased, especially regarding the rash, dizziness, and progression of symptoms. Her tendency to soften or qualify statements hinders clear clinical interpretation. - Reliability: Moderate to low\u2014her report provides important cues but may understate or overstate certain aspects due to emotional and cognitive biases, necessitating cautious interpretation and possibly additional assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise onset and progression of symptoms, exact appearance and progression of the rash, and details of neurological symptoms. Her confusion suggests she may not fully recall or comprehend the timeline or severity, leading to underreporting or overemphasis of fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: The rash\u2019s significance, the neurological symptoms (dizziness, passing out risk), and the potential severity of infection. She may downplay the extent of her weakness and respiratory compromise. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of death (\"could I be dying\") and worry about recovery are likely exaggerated by anxiety rather than all symptoms being equally severe. - True timeline: The actual progression may be more rapid and severe than reported, with her confusion causing delay in accurate chronology; she likely underestimates the urgency of her condition due to emotional distress.",

Her descriptions suggest a rapidly progressing illness with possible neurological and respiratory involvement, though she underestimates the severity.

Further objective assessment is urgently indicated to determine the extent of her illness.Sepsis secondary to skin infection (likely cellulitis with systemic involvement) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague words like \"probably,\" \"maybe,\" and \"I think,\" indicating uncertainty and possible difficulty with recall or decision to understate details. Her emotional language is moderate\u2014images of distress are present but not exaggerated. For example, \"I just feel all of this Bad now\" reflects emotional distress but is nonspecific. - Information flow: She tends to offer additional details beyond what is asked, perhaps seeking reassurance or due to anxiety, but also shows inconsistency in reporting timelines and symptom progression, indicating some difficulty in organizing or recalling facts. - Response style: Her answers are elaborative but sometimes hesitant, with pauses and expressions of uncertainty, suggesting discomfort or confusion about her own symptoms or their timing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is limited evidence of overt withholding; however, her vagueness about timing and rash details suggests possible subconscious underreporting or difficulty in accurate recall. - Minimization behaviors: She refers to her rash as \"not growing,\" possibly minimizing its seriousness, or at least underplaying changes, despite descriptions suggesting concern. - Amplification patterns: She expresses fears explicitly\u2014\"Is this serious? Could I be dying?\"\u2014indicating her worries may be somewhat heightened. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There's little explicit evidence, but her hesitations and vague descriptors could imply discomfort in discussing certain symptoms, or fear of sounding overly worried. - Confusion/memory issues: Strongly indicated by the repeated uncertainty about timeline (\"maybe yesterday or the day before\") and conflating symptom onset, consistent with fatigue or anxiety. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but her responses might be influenced by her concern about her health and possible desire to be truthful but cautious.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response uncertainty coupled with mild minimization and confusion bias. She underreports precise details, possibly to avoid escalation or due to cognitive overload from distress. - Severity: Moderate, since her responses show some inconsistency and vagueness; however, her physical symptoms are severe, so her self-report may understate their severity. - Areas most affected: Timeline and rash details are most biased, as her uncertainty and vague language obscure the actual rapid progression typical of sepsis. - Reliability: Moderate; her distress and confusion mean her narrative should be corroborated with clinical findings, but her concern appears genuine.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timing of symptom onset, specific changes in rash, and the true extent of dizziness. She might also be underreporting severity or urgency, especially regarding the rash's progression. - Symptoms probably minimized: The rash's significance and the rapid progression of her dizziness might be understated; she appears to downplay any worsening or potential danger. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about dying or losing her mind are overt, but while valid, may be exaggerated relative to her actual clinical state, driven by her anxiety. - True timeline: The actual deterioration is likely more rapid and severe than her reported timeline suggests, as her confusion and vague recollections hint at cognitive overload or distress impeding accurate recall.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We still need to clarify the precise timeline of rash appearance and progression, as well as details about whether symptoms like dizziness and weakness are worsening or stable. Understanding whether the rash or neurological symptoms appeared first could help differentiate between potential diagnoses like sepsis, drug reactions, or other infectious causes. - Diagnostic priorities: Given the concern for systemic infection, confirming the rash's characteristics and its relationship to neurological symptoms is crucial. Exploring the severity and progression of dizziness and weakness will help determine whether neurological complications are developing. - Patient factors: The patient\u2019s vague language and distress suggest she might have difficulty recalling exact timelines or may underplay symptoms. Questions should be phrased gently, emphasizing understanding rather than suspicion, to help her provide more accurate details. - Interview phase goals: To obtain the last critical pieces of information, especially symptom timelines, any signs of worsening, or new developments, which are vital before confirming diagnostic decisions and preparing for treatment discussions.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions on symptom timing, rash changes, and symptom severity. Some open-ended questions to allow elaboration, but primarily targeted to clarify critical details. - Information target: Timeline of rash and neurological symptoms, changes in rash appearance, progression of dizziness and weakness, and patient's interpretation of these changes. - Communication approach: Phrase questions collaboratively to reduce patient anxiety, e.g., \"Based on what you've told me, can we go over when you first noticed these symptoms and how they've changed today?\" - Expected value: These questions will help determine if the clinical picture aligns more with an urgent infectious process versus other etiologies, solidify diagnostic certainty, and guide urgent management if needed.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, to help us understand how your symptoms are changing, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the rash on your chest and what it looked like at that time? Has it grown or changed in color or appearance since then? Also, regarding your dizziness and weakness\u2014have these feelings gotten worse or stayed the same since you first noticed them? Did your dizziness start before or after the rash appeared? And if you're comfortable sharing, how would you describe the severity of these symptoms today compared to when they first started?\"",
