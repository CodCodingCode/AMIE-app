    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral) Justification: The rapid onset of redness, tearing, and swelling is typical of viral conjunctivitis, which is common after exposure to contaminated surfaces or contact with infected individuals. The recent physical activity might be incidental, but viral conjunctivitis often presents acutely with tearing and conjunctival redness.  2. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Playing soccer could have caused minor trauma to the eye, leading to conjunctival irritation, redness, swelling, and tearing, especially within 2 days of activity.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Allergies can cause conjunctivitis with redness, tearing, and swelling. If the patient has a history of allergies or exposure to allergens (e.g., pollen at outdoor sports), this is plausible, though acute onset shortly after activity favors trauma or infectious causes.  4. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Bacterial infections can cause unilateral or bilateral conjunctivitis with redness, swelling, and tearing. Usually more purulent, but can overlap with viral features.  5. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Playing soccer could introduce debris or a foreign body causing irritation, redness, swelling, and tearing, especially if symptoms persist after initial trauma.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Although less likely without systemic signs (fever, pain beyond ocular symptoms), swelling and redness could suggest this serious infection, especially if symptoms worsen or include pain with movement.  7. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or epithelial injury Justification: Trauma during soccer can cause corneal scratches, resulting in redness, tearing, and discomfort; swelling might be minimal but present due to irritation.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Inflammatory process involving intraocular structures can cause redness and tearing, but typically associated with pain, photophobia, and decreased vision; less likely without additional ocular symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (Acute angle-closure) Justification: Presents with redness and tearing but usually with pain, nausea, and visual disturbances; less likely without systemic symptoms.  10. Diagnosis: Ruptured globe Justification: Severe trauma can cause globe rupture, leading to redness and swelling, but usually with obvious external signs of trauma and a sudden onset of pain, which are not specified here.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific sensory descriptions, but also includes words like \"weird\" and \"just,\" which balance clinical details with emotional reactions. The tendency to refer to episodes as \"terrifying\" and \"worst\" indicates emotional intensification. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming about her symptoms but tends to focus on perceptions of severity rather than emotional toll or contextual factors. Responses are organized but brief, showing an intent to clarify her worries. - Response style: Her responses are straightforward, with some hesitations, reflecting anxiety-driven honesty. She elaborates on sensory and physical details but avoids deepest emotional or psychological implications unless prompted.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; appears openly willing to share symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" in \u201cjust suddenly can\u2019t control my body,\u201d possibly to lessen perceived severity, or to make symptoms seem less alarming. - Amplification patterns: Overemphasis on the worst episodes and fears of tumors and epilepsy, possibly to elicit reassurance or due to genuine anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; she appears open, though somewhat anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her description of timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Her mention of family history indicates awareness but no evident influence on her current reporting beyond background context.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification, especially concerning severity and prognosis. - Severity: Moderate, as her emotional distress shapes her perception but her physical descriptions and responses seem accurate. - Areas most affected: Her perception of how severe and uncontrollable her symptoms are; her fears about tumors. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy regarding physical symptoms but susceptible to emotional distortions influencing her assessment of danger.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might underreport less alarming variants of episodes or her emotional impact, focusing instead on worst fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possible less intense episodes or subtle signs she doesn\u2019t recognize or mention. - Concerns probably amplified: Serious diagnoses and inability to control symptoms are likely overemphasized due to anxiety. - True timeline: Her actual condition may involve a more gradual or fluctuating symptom progression that she perceives as more rapid or severe; her anxious mindset influences her reporting of recent episodes.",
    "output": "THINKING: I need to build rapport and gather more detailed information about her eye symptoms, especially focusing on how she perceives their impact and any details she hasn't yet described fully. Since her current presentation involves redness, swelling, and tearing following playing soccer, it's important to explore the onset, progression, and her experiences with these symptoms. Additionally, given her anxiety about serious conditions, I must approach her with sensitivity and curiosity, encouraging her to share her perspective freely.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact timeline of symptom development, associated pain or vision changes, previous eye issues, and her perception of what might have caused this. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether symptoms are due to trauma, infection, allergy, or other causes. - Patient factors: She's somewhat anxious and straightforward, so open, non-judgmental questions are best. - Interview phase goals: Establish trust, explore her subjective experience, and understand her concerns in her own words.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to invite detailed narratives. - Information target: Symptom onset, description, associated factors, and perceived triggers. - Communication approach: Gentle, validating, and curious, avoiding leading questions. - Expected value: This will help differentiate between potential causes and understand her perspective, easing her anxiety and guiding subsequent inquiry.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what you noticed exactly when your eye started bothering you after playing soccer? For example, what was the very first thing you experienced, and how did it develop over the following hours or days?\"",

Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral or allergic) Justification: Common cause of eye redness and tearing; onset two days ago aligns with infection or allergy, which are frequent after outdoor activity.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Recent trauma from playing soccer increases risk; symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling are consistent, and this is a common sports-related ocular injury.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden swelling and redness following physical activity could indicate ruptured small blood vessels; typically painless but causes visible redness.  4. Diagnosis: Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis Justification: Recent activity with eye swelling and redness; infection in the eyelid tissues without orbital involvement; usually preceded by trauma or skin breach.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness common; recent outdoor activity may have exposed to allergens; often bilateral and with itching, though not specified.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Inflammatory process inside the eye presenting with redness and swelling; can be associated with recent physical exertion or trauma, though less acute in onset.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: More severe swelling, possible proptosis, and pain would be expected, but still considered due to proximity; usually accompanied by systemic symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Acute glaucoma Justification: Presents with redness and swelling; typically causes ocular pain and visual disturbances, not specified here.  9. Diagnosis: Iris or ciliary body trauma Justification: Trauma from playing soccer could cause iris injury, leading to redness and swelling; less common without eye pain.  10.

    "input": "The patient is a 42-year-old woman presenting with a several-month history of episodic sensory disturbances, including tingling and feelings of mental fuzziness, often preceded by unusual smells or tastes. She reports these episodes involve transient loss of control with limb twitching and consciousness impairment, and she expresses significant fear about serious neurological conditions such as epilepsy or brain tumors. Her subjective descriptions are emotionally charged, which may overstate the severity, though consistent themes suggest real transient neurological phenomena. She reports feeling worse post-episode but provides limited specifics about trigger factors, frequency, or associated symptoms like automatisms or confusion. Further detailed assessment is needed to clarify episode characteristics and to evaluate for underlying neurological causes.1. Diagnosis: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Justification: The patient's episodes involve sensory phenomena such as unusual smells or tastes, which are classic auras originating from the temporal lobe. The transient loss of control, limb twitching, and consciousness impairment all suggest focal seizures with secondary generalization or complex partial seizures. The episodic nature over several months supports this diagnosis, and her concern about neurological conditions aligns with seizure semiology.  2. Diagnosis: Focal Seizures (Other than Temporal Lobe) Justification: The sensory disturbances and impaired consciousness could be focal seizures arising from extra-temporal areas, especially if additional features like automatisms or automatisms are identified. However, the specific mention of sensory aura makes temporal origin more probable.  3. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) Justification: The emotional charge in the description and subjective fears could suggest dissociative or psychogenic episodes. However, the typical phenomenology described aligns more closely with epileptiform activity, reducing this likelihood but still warranting consideration if diagnostic ambiguity persists.  4. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura Justification: Although the sensory phenomena could be migrainous, the episodes involve loss of control and twitching, which are less typical for migraine alone. Migrainous aura is usually visual or sensory without motor features or impaired consciousness, making this less probable but still a differential consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Brain Tumor or Structural Lesion Justification: Persistent concern about tumors is common, but the episodic nature without persistent deficits or focal neurological signs makes a structural lesion less immediate. It remains a consideration if further neurological findings emerge, but current data favor epileptic phenomena over structural causes.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"kind of,\" \"really,\" and \"terrifying,\" which suggests emotional engagement but less precise description. She balances straightforward symptom descriptions with high emotional intensity, indicating a tendency to amplify her concerns. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming with symptoms when prompted but tends to withhold or be vague about the specifics of her episodes' frequency, duration, and triggers. Her responses are organized around her worries, often shifting focus from detail to emotional state. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative regarding her fears but somewhat minimal on clinical specifics. She tends to describe her symptoms in detail when describing her sensations but glosses over precise timelines or episode counts, possibly to avoid discomfort or due to confusion.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation and vagueness about the timeline and severity; reluctance to specify how often episodes occur or their exact nature, which may suggest she\u2019s concealing or minimizing the full extent. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the complexity or severity of her episodes with phrases like \"just\" and \"kind of,\" possibly to avoid alarming herself or the clinician, but her emotional language contradicts this. - Amplification patterns: Overemphasis of emotional impact (\"terrifying,\" \"worst,\" \"worse\") indicates anxiety amplification, possibly leading her to perceive her condition as more severe than clinically evident. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but some hesitance could suggest discomfort when discussing the more distressing aspects. - Confusion/memory issues: Her statements imply some memory or perception distortions (\"don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening\"), consistent with seizure aura or confusion, but no evidence of deliberate misinformation. - Family influence: Her constant concern about serious outcomes reflects external fears, possibly reinforced by family history, but she appears to respond personally rather than being overly influenced externally.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias driven by anxiety and fear, leading her to overstate her distress and seek reassurance. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional response influences her reporting, potentially inflating perceived severity, although she provides consistent symptoms. - Areas most affected: She likely overestimates the danger of her condition (believing it might be a tumor) while underreporting specific episode details, which could provide helpful diagnostic clues. - Reliability: Moderate; her descriptions are credible but colored by emotional distress, so clinical data should be corroborated with objective assessments.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about episode frequency, duration, and context; she may be minimizing subtle symptoms or previous minor episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity or impact of her episodes might be greater than she reports, given her intense emotional reactions. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about tumors and seizures are likely exaggerated by anxiety, possibly leading her to overestimate risks. - True timeline: The progression may be more gradual or less severe than her emotional portrayal suggests; her distress may be inflating her perception of worsening over time.  Overall, her responses are strongly influenced by emotional bias, mainly anxiety-driven amplification, with some tendency toward minimization of specific clinical details, which could impact accurate assessment.",

Understanding these factors is critical for distinguishing epilepsy from other causes. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether her episodes are consistent with focal seizures, including their semiology, to support or exclude temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, rules out psychogenic events and other neurological conditions. - Patient factors: Her emotional engagement and tendency to use vague or emotionally charged language mean I need to ask targeted follow-ups gently to elicit precise details without increasing her anxiety or defensiveness. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the differential by obtaining detailed, factual descriptions of her episodes\u2014timing, duration, triggers, and associated features\u2014and assess the consistency and severity of her symptoms.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions aimed at concrete details about her episodes, including the semiology, frequency, and factors influencing them. Also, confirmatory questions about associated symptoms like automatisms or post-ictal states. - Information target: Episode duration, presence of automatisms, auditory or visual phenomena, post-episode confusion, and possible triggers like stress or sleep deprivation. - Communication approach: Phrase questions sensitively to avoid increasing anxiety while encouraging detailed, accurate reporting. Use transitional phrases such as \"When this has happened, can you tell me exactly how long it lasted?\" or \"During these episodes, do you notice any automatisms or movements you don\u2019t control?\" - Expected value: These questions will help differentiate epileptic seizures from psychogenic events or other causes, by honing in on the semiology and pattern of her episodes.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how long each of your episodes typically lasts?

    "input": "The patient is a 42-year-old woman presenting with a history of recurrent episodic neurological symptoms over several months. She reports episodes characterized by sensory phenomena such as tingling, a sensation of mental fuzziness, and an unusual smell or taste prior to loss of consciousness. During episodes, involuntary limb twitching and a transient impairment of awareness are noted. She describes these episodes as lasting a few seconds to longer durations, with post-event confusion and fatigue that she perceives as lasting hours or more; these residual symptoms are likely more persistent than she reports. Communication suggests possible emotional amplification of distress related to her symptoms; therefore, the actual frequency and severity may be underestimated or overemphasized. There is no explicit mention of automatisms, but subtle movements or warning symptoms cannot be ruled out. Further detailed assessment is needed to determine precise episode duration, automatisms, trigger factors, and the pattern of post-ictal symptoms, with consideration of potential underreporting or overestimation due to emotional distress.1. Diagnosis: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness) Justification: The episodes include sensory symptoms such as unusual smells or tastes, involuntary limb twitching, and impairment of awareness\u2014classic features of temporal lobe seizures. The post-ictal confusion and fatigue further support a seizure diagnosis. The recurrent, episodic pattern over months aligns with epilepsy, especially with aura-like sensory phenomena.  2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Nonepileptic Events Justification: The patient's emotional distress and potentially exaggerated reporting raise suspicion of psychogenic events. While some features overlap with epilepsy, the variability and mention of emotional amplification suggest a possible non-epileptic origin. However, the consistent seizure-like movements and sensory aura make pure psychogenic events less likely but still possible.  3. Diagnosis: Syncope Justification: Syncope could mimic some episodes, especially if associated with sensory symptoms. But the involuntary limb twitching, impaired awareness, and post-episode confusion are less characteristic of syncope, which typically involves brief loss of consciousness without automatisms or sensory aura.  4. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Justification: TIA may produce neurological deficits but usually lacks the stereotyped sensory phenomena, involuntary movements, and post-ictal confusion. The episodic, stereotyped nature favors seizures over TIA.  5. Diagnosis: Sleep disorder or parasomnia Justification: Less likely due to the presence of sensory aura and involuntary movements; these typically occur during sleep, and the described features align more with seizure activity rather than parasomnia.

Her responses suggest discomfort in fully disclosing or possibly lack of awareness. - Response style: She provides mostly linear responses but with hesitations and non-specific qualifiers, indicating possible internal conflict about what to share or difficulty perceiving her symptoms objectively.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague estimates of episode durations and her reluctance to specify exact timelines suggest withholding or uncertainty. She might be unsure herself. - Minimization behaviors: Calling episodes \"just a few seconds\" but acknowledging they sometimes feel longer could point to minimizing actual seizure severity or duration. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions of confusional states and exhaustion are emotionally amplified, possibly as a response to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her hesitance and vague language imply some discomfort with revealing the full extent of her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: She admits to feeling confused afterward and taking \"a good while\" to recover, which aligns with post-ictal states but may be exaggerated due to emotional distress. - Family influence: Information is internally driven; no clear external influence evident in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification leading to emotional overestimation of distress, combined with some minimization of symptom duration. - Severity: Moderate. Her emotional distress influences her interpretation, but she communicates core aspects reliably. - Areas most affected: Duration and severity of seizures and post-ictal confusion; these may be over- or under-reported due to emotional bias. - Reliability: Moderately reliable overall; her emotional state influences perception but generally aligns with typical seizure presentation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about seizure frequency, duration, and post-ictal state severity; emotional impact and stress level. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual length and impact of seizures might be more extensive, especially post-ictal confusion and exhaustion. - Concerns probably amplified: Severity of potential diagnoses like tumor or epilepsy, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: Actual episodes may be longer or more intense than indicated; her emotional distress clouds her perception of exact timing and severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The current information suggests episodic neurological events with sensory, motor, and awareness impairment features, pointing toward seizures, possibly temporal lobe epilepsy. - She reports post-ictal confusion and fatigue, but her emotional distress might influence her perception of severity and duration, so targeted questions about these aspects are necessary. - Clarifying details about triggers, specific features (such as automatisms), and consistency of symptoms can help distinguish between epileptic and psychogenic events. - Her vague symptom descriptions and emotional state warrant questions about any pre-episode sensations and the characteristics of residual symptoms, as well as family history and risk factors. - The goal now is to refine understanding of duration, automatisms, and post-ictal symptoms, as well as explore possible triggers or precipitating factors.

Her emotional distress influences her interpretation, but she communicates core aspects reliably. - Areas most affected: Duration and severity of seizures and post-ictal confusion; these may be over- or under-reported due to emotional bias. - Reliability: Moderately reliable overall; her emotional state influences perception but generally aligns with typical seizure presentation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about seizure frequency, duration, and post-ictal state severity; emotional impact and stress level. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual length and impact of seizures might be more extensive, especially post-ictal confusion and exhaustion. - Concerns probably amplified: Severity of potential diagnoses like tumor or epilepsy, driven by anxiety. - True timeline: Actual episodes may be longer or more intense than indicated; her emotional distress clouds her perception of exact timing and severity.",

    "input": "The patient is a 42-year-old woman presenting with recurrent episodic neurological symptoms over several months. She reports episodes lasting from a few seconds to longer, involving involuntary limb twitching, sensory phenomena such as unusual smells or tastes (notably metallic or burnt rubber odors), and transient feelings of mental fuzziness. These episodes are followed by a period of confusion and fatigue, which she perceives as lasting hours, though such durations may be overestimated due to emotional distress and anxiety. She occasionally notices mild automatisms, like mouth movements or blinking, during episodes, but the frequency and consistency are uncertain. Pre-episode sensory changes and involuntary movements suggest focal seizure activity with automatisms. Her concerns about serious neurological disease are influenced by emotional factors, which may cause her to overstate the severity and persistence of symptoms; objective features common to seizures are present, but the exact durations of post-ictal fatigue are likely shorter than reported. Further assessment is required to evaluate subtle automatisms, confirm seizure pattern, determine frequency and triggers, and differentiate true symptom severity from emotional amplification.Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific details about her symptoms\u2014sensory experiences, automatic movements, post-episode exhaustion\u2014but also employs vague language (\"sometimes,\" \"kind of\") which can mask uncertainty. Her emotional language (\"really scared,\" \"worried\") emphasizes anxiety. Her descriptions reveal both clarity and emotional overstatement. - Information flow: She is proactive in volunteering detailed accounts but tends to frame her fears strongly, indicating an emotional bias. Her responses are organized but centered around anxiety-provoking themes. - Response style: She elaborates extensively, often emphasizing worst-case scenarios, which demonstrates a tendency toward amplification of concerns and emotional responsiveness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she shares detailed experiences but may omit less severe or less sensory symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Limited; she appears forthcoming but sometimes downplays her emotional distress or the impact severity. - Amplification patterns: Strong; repeatedly emphasizes her fears of serious pathology, and her description of symptoms often sounds more severe due to emotional tone. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal; no overt signs, but hesitations may hint at internal discomfort with her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Evident in her reports of post-episode exhaustion lasting hours, reflecting genuine confusion and fatigue. - Family influence: Her mention of family history may heighten her fears, subtly influencing her perception of risk.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias\u2014her fears about serious illness manifest as overestimations, magnified through emotional intensity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her expressions are emotionally driven, but she provides detailed and consistent symptom descriptions. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity, prognosis, and her own health risk assessment. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014while her subjective reports seem honest, her emotional bias may inflate her perception of danger and severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of ongoing mild symptoms or functional impact, and subtle signs of less severe episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less distressing or transient symptoms may be underappreciated; her focus is primarily on severe, distressing episodes. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of tumor or catastrophic neurological illness are exaggerated relative to clinical risk, driven by her anxiety. - True timeline: Her reports of progression are consistent, but her perception of duration and severity is likely inflated by emotional distress, which may not fully match actual clinical progression.  **In summary**, Margaret exhibits clear anxiety-driven amplification biases, which influence her perception of her symptoms. Her detailed descriptions aid clinical understanding but should be interpreted with awareness of her emotional overlay, ensuring both her genuine experiences and underlying fears are addressed appropriately.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Although she describes sensory phenomena and automatisms, it remains unclear whether these have been directly observed or confirmed by others, and whether her automatisms are consistent or variable. It is also important to understand if she has recognized certain triggers or patterns, and to clarify the duration and severity of her post-episode fatigue in relation to objective signs. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming seizure activity and automatisms, differentiating from other neurological or psychological causes, and assessing the consistency of her episodes' features. - Patient factors: She appears detail-oriented but also somewhat emotionally driven; careful, empathetic questioning will ensure she feels safe sharing information without feeling judged or dismissed. - Interview phase goals: To confirm the seizure diagnosis, rule out other causes such as migraines, psychogenic episodes, or other neurological conditions, and to assess her understanding and fears around the diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions aimed at specific seizure features and automatisms. - Information target: Specific details about automatisms, sensory symptoms, triggering factors, duration, and consistency. - Communication approach: Gentle, collaborative phrasing to encourage accurate reporting and reduce anxiety. - Expected value: Clarifying these features helps confirm seizure activity and prepares for appropriate management discussions.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me about automatic movements and sensory experiences during your episodes, I want to ask a bit more about those automatisms. Can you tell me if you or anyone else has ever seen you make any involuntary movements like lip-smacking, eye blinking, or hand rubbing during these episodes? Also, do you notice any particular triggers or patterns before an episode starts, such as stress, fatigue, or specific sensations? Finally, you've mentioned feeling very tired and confused afterward\u2014does this fatigue always last as long as you think, or have you noticed if it sometimes gets better sooner than expected?\"",
