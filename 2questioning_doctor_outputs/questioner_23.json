    "input": "A 22-year-old woman presents with complaints of increased facial and body hair growth, irregular menses occurring intermittently over several months, a noticeable deepening of her voice, and feelings of fatigue. These reported symptoms are corroborated by her descriptions but are likely underappreciated in terms of emotional and social impact due to her expressed discomfort and shame. There is no reported history of other associated symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disturbances, or appetite alterations, but these require further assessment. Physical examination findings are consistent with hyperandrogenism, and hormonal evaluation may be indicated to identify underlying causes such as androgen excess or other endocrine disorders. Additional information is needed regarding her emotional well-being, potential other systemic symptoms, and the overall impact on her daily functioning.1. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Common etiology of hyperandrogenism in young women presenting with hirsutism, amenorrhea or irregular menses, and metabolic symptoms; supported by the pattern of symptoms.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic)\nJustification: Can present in young women with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities; often has a gradual onset and may be misdiagnosed as PCOS.\n3. Diagnosis: Ovarian androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Rapid onset or worsening of symptoms; typically more severe virilization signs, although less common in young women.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Similar to ovarian tumors, but adrenal masses may produce excess androgens leading to virilization; important to consider due to potential malignancy.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure\nJustification: Considered if there's history of androgen medication use or supplements; non-described in the vignette but relevant in differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome\nJustification: Can involve hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities; less likely without classic features such as purple striae or osteoporosis, but still a consideration.\n7. Diagnosis: Androgen-producing ovarian cysts\nJustification: Rare but possible cause of hyperandrogenism; typically associated with ovarian cysts seen on imaging.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperprolactinemia\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularities and fatigue; hyperandrogenic features are less direct but possible if associated with other endocrine disturbances.\n9. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism)\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularities and fatigue; rarely causes hyperandrogenism but should be considered in systemic evaluation.\n10. Diagnosis: Idiopathic hirsutism\nJustification: In some cases, hirsutism occurs without clear laboratory abnormalities; less likely given the presence of other symptoms like voice deepening and irregular menses.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: She uses clear, specific language to describe her physical symptoms, with emotional descriptors (\"embarrassing,\" \"really tired\"). Her language balances clinical detail with personal feelings.\n- Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions without prompt, indicating openness. Her responses are organized but include emotional content.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborative where emotional impact is concerned but generally direct regarding symptoms; she avoids tangential topics.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: None evident; she provides ample detail.\n- Minimization behaviors: Little evidence, her descriptions seem honest; she does not downplay her symptoms.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear amplification; she reports experiencing symptoms without exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort when mentioning feelings of embarrassment, suggesting internal shame about physical changes, possibly impacting full disclosure in different contexts.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No detectable inconsistencies; her timeline appears coherent.\n- Family influence: Not explicitly indicated; her responses appear personally driven without external prompting.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimal bias; responses seem authentic and reliable.\n- Severity: Mild, mainly emotional distress rather than intentional bias.\n- Areas most affected: Her emotional expression might influence the perceived severity or urgency but does not distort factual symptom reporting.\n- Reliability: High; she is transparent about her symptoms and feelings.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Deeper emotional or social impact, potentially related to her self-consciousness or family concerns, not explicitly stated.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Not evidently minimized; she states her symptoms plainly.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Her embarrassment and emotional distress may overstate the subjective burden, but her factual descriptions appear accurate.\n- True timeline: Consistent with her report; no conflicting evidence suggests significant distortion.\nOverall, her communication suggests reliability with mild emotional hesitance that might slightly influence her comfort in discussing sensitive aspects, but it does not substantially impair accurate clinical assessment.",

    "input": "A 22-year-old woman presents with symptoms consistent with hyperandrogenism, including increased facial and body hair, irregular menstrual cycles with periods sometimes absent over several months, a deepening voice, and fatigue. Her communication patterns suggest possible underreporting or minimization of the severity and full extent of her symptoms, likely due to emotional discomfort related to her condition. Further detailed history, including precise symptom onset, emotional impact, and assessment for additional systemic manifestations, is recommended to clarify underlying etiologies.1. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Most common cause of hyperandrogenism in young women, presenting with menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and fatigue; prevalence is high, with characteristic ovarian morphology and mild to moderate androgen excess.\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: Presents with rapid onset of virilization signs, such as deepening voice and significant hirsutism; less common but serious, especially if symptoms are severe and progressive.\n3. Diagnosis: Adrenal tumor (adrenal carcinoma or adenoma)\nJustification: Can produce excess androgens leading to virilization; considered given the deepening voice and significant symptoms, especially if ovarian sources are excluded.\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)\nJustification: Can present with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities; however, usually identified earlier unless mild or non-classic form.\n5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic hirsutism\nJustification: Common cause of hirsutism sans other systemic signs; less likely here due to virilization features and menstrual irregularity.\n6. Diagnosis: Obesity-related hyperandrogenism\nJustification: Obesity can exacerbate androgen levels and menstrual irregularities but is less likely to cause virilization or deep voice independently.\n7. Diagnosis: Pituitary or hypothalamic disorders affecting gonadotropins\nJustification: Can influence menstrual cycles but less directly associated with severe virilization.\n8. Diagnosis: Ovarian hyperthecosis\nJustification: Rare cause of hyperandrogenism presenting with menstrual irregularities; more common in postmenopausal women but possible here.\n9. Diagnosis: Medication-induced hyperandrogenism\nJustification: Certain drugs can elevate androgen levels, but no medication history provided.\n10. Diagnosis: Other genetic syndromes affecting androgen production\nJustification: Rare and less likely based on presentation but included for completeness.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague, non-specific language (\"a few months ago,\" \"kind of stopped,\" \"really irregular\") which indicates hesitancy or discomfort discussing precise details. Emotional expressions like \"embarrassing\" and \"I don\u2019t know\" reflect emotional distress and possible shame.\n- Information flow: They are generally forthcoming about symptoms but hold back specific timelines and emotional responses, perhaps to avoid revealing uncertainty or vulnerability. The responses are organized but slightly scattered due to vagueness, suggesting cautious sharing.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborated but non-specific, with a tendency toward defensiveness or avoidance of detailed chronological information. They answer directly but tend to hedge, indicating potential discomfort or uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Ambiguous timelines (\"not sure exactly when\") and avoidance of specific dates suggest reluctance to share complete details, possibly to hide uncertainty or discomfort.\n- Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"kind of stopped\" and \"really irregular\" may serve to lessen perceived severity, masking true functional impact.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; the patient seems cautious, possibly underreporting or downplaying the symptoms to avoid shame.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The explicit mention of feeling \"embarrassing\" about their appearance change indicates emotional discomfort connected to the symptoms, which may inhibit full disclosure about emotional or psychological impacts.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Uncertainty about the exact onset suggests mild memory or recall issues, likely due to emotional distress or the sensitivity of the topic.\n- Family influence: There is limited evidence of familial influence beyond awareness of family history; responses are self-focused without apparent external pressure.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Response vagueness coupled with possible minimization and embarrassment influences.\n- Severity: Moderate, as the patient shares core symptoms but with notable vagueness and emotional concealment affecting detailed accuracy.\n- Areas most affected: Timeline details and emotional impact are least reliable, potentially obscuring the true course of symptoms.\n- Reliability: Moderate; self-reports are honest but limited by emotional discomfort and recall difficulty, necessitating careful corroboration.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise timing, emotional severity, and full extent of functional impact are probably underreported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The patient may be downplaying the severity or extent of hormonal effects, especially emotional distress or associated risks.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Expressions of worry and embarrassment may lead to overestimation of distress levels but could also reflect genuine anxiety that warrants attention.\n- True timeline: The actual symptom progression may be more complex or different from the reported, as recall is vague and emotional factors influence specificity.",

    "input": "A 22-year-old woman presents with clinical features suggestive of hyperandrogenism, including gradual-onset irregular menstrual cycles over approximately six months, increased facial and body hair growth, a deepening of her voice, and reported fatigue. Her symptom reporting is influenced by emotional distress, which may lead to underestimation of physical severity and possible omission of other associated symptoms such as skin changes or mood disturbances. Further detailed history and physical examination are necessary to clarify the extent and impact of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism in young women, presenting with menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and sometimes voice changes. The gradual onset over months aligns with typical PCOS presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: Rapid or progressive virilization (voice deepening) suggests a tumor secreting high levels of androgens; though less common, it must be considered due to her symptoms, especially if symptoms are worsening or pronounced.\n3. Diagnosis: Adrenal hyperplasia (congenital or acquired)\nJustification: Adrenal hyperplasia can produce excess androgens, leading to similar features; persistent symptoms over months and bilateral adrenal involvement can point toward this.\n4. Diagnosis: Idiopathic hirsutism\nJustification: Common in young women, presenting with androgen excess without other hormonal abnormalities; usually milder, but can cause significant hirsutism.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen use\nJustification: Although not mentioned, should be considered if patient is using supplements or medications containing androgens or anabolic steroids.\n6. Diagnosis: Cushing\u2019s syndrome\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularities and hair growth, but typically associated with weight gain, skin changes, and hypertension, which are not specified here.\n7. Diagnosis: Ovarian or adrenal neoplasm (benign or malignant)\nJustification: May produce androgens leading to virilization; less common, but critical to consider.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperthecosis (a form of stromal ovarian hyperplasia)\nJustification: Causes severe virilization in younger women, with features like deepening voice; rare but relevant.\n9. Diagnosis: Adrenal carcinoma\nJustification: Rare but important to consider if elevated androgen levels are disproportionate and associated with other signs of malignancy.\n10. Diagnosis: Other rare causes of hyperandrogenism (e.g., familial male-limited precocious puberty or genetic syndromes)\nJustification: Unlikely in this case based solely on presentation, but residual considerations.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague, emotionally charged language with frequent qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"like\") that obscure exact details, indicating discomfort and guardedness.\n- Information flow: They tend to be reserved, providing minimal details unless guided, with responses that seem to prioritize emotional comfort over factual accuracy.\n- Response style: Responses are concise, emotionally laden, and somewhat scattered, reflecting discomfort and possibly an attempt to avoid deeper discussion of bodily changes.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Limited specificity about the exact onset and progression of symptoms, perhaps to avoid confronting the details or due to embarrassment.\n- Minimization behaviors: Not overtly minimizing physically; however, by being vague, they may be downplaying the severity or extent of their symptoms.\n- Amplification patterns: They describe feelings like \"really tired\" and \"scary,\" which may heighten perceived impact emotionally.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Clear discomfort discussing bodily changes, evident in vague descriptions and emotional expressions.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies suggest difficulty recalling specifics, possibly stress-related.\n- Family influence: Mention of family history elevates concern but does not appear to influence response pattern directly.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias: Emotional distress bias; feelings of fear and embarrassment influence the patient\u2019s reporting, potentially exaggerating emotional response rather than objective facts.\n- Severity: Moderate; responses are affected but still contain core factual information.\n- Most affected areas: Timeline and emotional interpretation of symptoms; responses tend to focus more on emotional impact than precise details.\n- Reliability: Moderate; while responses are genuine, emotional bias may distort the accurate perception of symptom severity and timeline.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact timing, severity, and physical details of symptom progression; patient may be avoiding certain details due to discomfort.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Specific physical signs and objects of concern may be downplayed or obscured.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional reactions may lead the patient to perceive the condition as more distressing or urgent than the actual physical state.\n- True timeline: The progression is likely more gradual and less emotionally charged; emotional distress might exaggerate the perceived abruptness or severity.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: 22-year-old woman Chief complaint: Irregular menstrual cycles and signs of hyperandrogenism, with concern about worsening symptoms Present illness: The patient reports experiencing irregular menses\u2014often missed or infrequent\u2014starting approximately six months prior. She observes increased facial and body hair growth, voice deepening, and feelings of fatigue. She describes these symptoms as gradually worsening over time. Due to emotional distress, her descriptions are broad and somewhat hesitant, suggesting possible underreporting of severity or related features such as skin changes or mood symptoms. Physical signs likely include androgen excess manifestations, but their extent remains to be objectively confirmed.1. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: The patient\u2019s irregular menses, hyperandrogenic features (hirsutism, possibly virilization signs), and the chronic progression over months fit the typical presentation of PCOS. Although virilization features are usually mild or absent, the gradual worsening aligns with PCOS\u2019s endocrine imbalance.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-Classical)\nJustification: The presence of hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity can be seen in non-classical CAH, which develops gradually and can cause virilization signs. This is plausible in a young woman with evolving symptoms and increased androgen activity.\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Ovarian Tumor\nJustification: The progressive virilization, including voice deepening and facial hair, suggests a possible androgen-secreting ovarian tumor, which typically presents with rapid or significant virilization; the subacute worsening over months can fit, though less common.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumor or Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Cortex Adenoma\nJustification: Signs of virilization could result from an adrenal tumor producing excessive androgens. The slow progression over months is plausible in some benign tumors, though these are often associated with more abrupt onset.\n5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Hyperandrogenism\nJustification: Less likely given symptoms are worsening and involve features of virilization; idiopathic hyperandrogenism usually has milder or isolated features but remains a possibility in early stages or less specific presentations.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses somewhat vague but emotionally charged language, like \"kind of scary,\" which indicates she is comfortable expressing worry but hesitant about specifics. She tends to describe progression broadly (\"a few months ago,\" \"got worse\") rather than precise dates, suggesting a tendency to be somewhat imprecise or cautious in her disclosures.\n- Information flow: She provides a coherent, organized narrative about the timeline but with some vagueness, possibly reflecting cautiousness or discomfort. She is willing to share the core story but avoids detailed elaboration, perhaps to avoid discomfort or because she is unsure about details.\n- Response style: Responses are moderately elaborated, with a tendency toward generalization over specifics. She answers directly but with qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\"), indicating some hesitance or emotional discomfort with the topics discussed.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Mild vagueness about specifics and hesitations, especially on exact timing and severity, suggest some withholding or reluctance, possibly to protect herself from emotional discomfort.\n- Minimization behaviors: By describing symptoms as \"kind of scary\" and not elaborating on severity, she might be downplaying the degree of distress or physical symptoms, minimizing the urgency or impact.\n- Amplification patterns: The phrase \"kind of scary\" indicates an emotional amplification, possibly seeking reassurance or signaling distress without overt exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the modest language hints at mild embarrassment or shame about symptoms, especially regarding physical changes.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Responses are consistent, with no evidence of confusion, but she employs vague temporal language, possibly to avoid precise recall.\n- Family influence: The mention of family history could reflect awareness of her condition but does not indicate external pressure influencing responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild vagueness combined with emotional amplification.\n- Severity: Mild; her responses are generally credible but include cautious hedging and emotional expressions that could slightly distort the perceived severity.\n- Areas most affected: The specific timeline and emotional impact may be under- or overestimated slightly due to her cautious and emotional phrasing.\n- Reliability: Overall reliable for basic symptom description, but some details (severity, emotional impact) should be probed further for accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact details of symptom severity, functional impairment, or emotional distress are probably underreported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: She may understate how much these changes affect her daily life and emotional well-being.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional language (\"scary\") suggests she is genuinely worried, but there's less evidence she exaggerates physical symptoms.\n- True timeline: Timeline seems accurate but expressed in vague terms possibly to avoid emotional discomfort, thus might be simplified.",

    "input": "The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with a six-month history of irregular menses, characterized by missed or infrequent periods, and gradual development of signs consistent with androgen excess, including increased facial and body hair growth and a deepening of her voice. She reports these symptoms as worsening and describes the situation as \"scary,\" although her communication suggests possible underreporting of severity, especially regarding emotional or additional physical manifestations. There are no documented skin changes or other associated symptoms at this point, but further clinical examination and evaluation are required to assess the extent of virilization, skin features, and to determine underlying causes such as hormonal imbalance or polycystic ovary syndrome.1. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Ovarian Tumor\nJustification: The patient exhibits signs of virilization (facial/body hair, deep voice) and irregular menses, over a relatively short period (six months). Ovarian tumors, such as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, are known to produce excess androgens leading to virilization. The rapid onset and progression strongly favor a neoplastic cause rather than a benign or functional disorder. This diagnosis best explains both the menstrual irregularity and the virilization changes.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-classic Form)\nJustification: This condition can present in young women with androgen excess and menstrual disturbances, sometimes developing gradually. Though more common earlier in life, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia can manifest in adolescence or early adulthood with signs of virilization, especially if untreated or undiagnosed. The gradual progression supports this possibility, although rapid virilization is less typical unless an adrenal crisis occurs.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is a common cause of irregular menses and hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism and mild virilization. However, severe voice deepening is less characteristic. Nonetheless, given the menstrual irregularity and androgen features, PCOS remains a plausible, although less likely, diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian Hyperthecosis\nJustification: This is a rare condition involving diffuse luteinization of ovarian stroma, leading to increased androgen production, causing virilization and menstrual irregularity.

    "input": "The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with a six-month history of irregular menstrual cycles characterized by missed or infrequent periods. She reports gradual development of facial and body hair growth and a deepening of her voice over the same period. She describes these changes as \"scary\" but provides vague details, indicating possible underreporting of severity. She also notes increased skin oiliness and feelings of tiredness, although she does not volunteer other skin features such as acne or sleep disturbances explicitly. Communication patterns suggest she may be minimizing or hesitant to fully disclose the emotional and physical impact of her symptoms. Additional assessment is needed to evaluate the extent of virilization, skin features, and emotional wellbeing, with targeted questioning recommended to uncover any unspoken symptoms or concerns.1. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: The rapid onset (6 months) of virilizing features such as facial and body hair growth, voice deepening, and increased skin oiliness strongly suggests an androgen-secreting tumor, most commonly ovarian. These tumors can produce high levels of testosterone, leading to prominent virilization. The relatively quick progression over six months favors this diagnosis over other chronic causes. The patient's age aligns with ovarian tumors that can present hormonally active.\n2. Diagnosis: Adrenal androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Similar to ovarian tumors, adrenal tumors can produce excess androgens resulting in virilization. The six-month history and severe features could be explained by an adrenal carcinoma or adenoma secreting androgens. The clinical picture aligns with this possibility, especially if tumor localization or hormone levels support adrenal origin.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is a common cause of irregular menses and mild androgen excess, often presenting with hirsutism and skin oiliness. However, the rapid development and severe virilization points less toward PCOS, which usually causes gradual, milder symptoms. It remains a differential consideration but is lower in likelihood given the clinical severity and quick progression.\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)\nJustification: CAH, especially 21-hydroxylase deficiency, can cause virilization and menstrual irregularities. However, this condition typically presents in childhood or early adolescence, and features tend to include salt-wasting crises or adrenal insufficiency. Its presentation at age 22 with rapid virilization over six months is less typical, making it a less probable diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure\nJustification: External androgen intake can cause virilization, but typically, patients or their environment are aware of such exposure. No information suggests external androgen use, making this less likely in this case. It's included for completeness but is a lower probability.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and modest language, possibly to avoid embarrassment or overstatement. Examples include \"a little oilier\" and \"more tired,\" rather than precise quantifications.\n- Information flow: Generally forthcoming about physical symptoms but restrained in emotional or subjective details, indicating cautious disclosure. They tend to provide lists of symptoms without elaborating on feelings.\n- Response style: Responses are brief, somewhat guarded, and demonstrate deliberate moderation, perhaps to manage discomfort or uncertainty regarding their own health status.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The use of vague descriptors and non-specific details, such as \"a little\" or \"maybe,\" suggests deliberate or unconscious withholding of full symptom severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"more tired than usual\" and \"a bit deeper\" voice indicate downplaying, possibly to avoid alarming the clinician or due to difficulty assessing symptoms.\n- Amplification patterns: Limited evidence; responses are measured and cautious rather than exaggerated.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and modest framing when discussing skin and hair changes point to mild embarrassment or discomfort.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No significant signs of confusion; responses align logically and consistently.\n- Family influence: While concerned about family history, no external influence appears to alter honesty or openness in their responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias: Mild tendency toward underreporting or modesty bias, possibly influenced by embarrassment or uncertainty.\n- Severity: Mild\u2014responses are controlled, with potential underestimation of symptom severity.\n- Most biased symptoms: Emotional impact and extent of physical changes may be understated, impacting overall accuracy.\n- Reliability: Moderate\u2014clinicians should consider that the full severity could be higher than reported, especially for subjective symptoms.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Missing info: The patient is probably not fully disclosing the emotional distress and the true extent of physical changes, which might be more significant.\n- Symptoms minimized: Actual hormone levels or extent of masculinization effects may be underestimated.\n- Concerns amplified: Anxiety about family history may be heightened internally but not vividly expressed.\n- True timeline: Likely consistent with six months of gradual progression, but emotional responses might be more intense than acknowledged.",
