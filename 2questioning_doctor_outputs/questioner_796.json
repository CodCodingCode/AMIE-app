    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Periorbital (Preseptal) Cellulitis Justification: Recent trauma (playing soccer) can cause skin or eyelid breach leading to infection; swelling and redness are classic. Requires prompt recognition to prevent progression to orbital cellulitis.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: Presents with redness, tearing, swelling; common post-activity, especially if contaminated environment or minor trauma occurred. Usually bilateral and with mucopurulent discharge, though not specified.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Common in active individuals; associated with tearing and redness, typically bilateral. Recent activity could be coincidental; less likely without itching.  4. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: Typically starts with watery tearing and redness, sometimes following upper respiratory illness, which is not specified here. Less likely without systemic viral symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion or Foreign Body Justification: Trauma during soccer could cause corneal surface injury, leading to redness, tearing, swelling, pain. Presenting symptoms align with superficial eye injury.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: More severe than preseptal cellulitis; characterized by pain, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, fever. Less likely given the brief duration and localized swelling without other systemic symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis due to contact lens or environmental irritants Justification: Not specified, but could be related if contact lens or eye exposure occurs during activity, causing irritation.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis or Iritis Justification: Presents with eye redness and tearing but usually associated with pain and photophobia; less common acutely post-sport without other systemic signs.  9. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Causes redness and tearing, usually with acute pain, headache, visual disturbances; less likely given onset after physical activity without other signs.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital Trauma with Hemorrhage Justification: Could cause swelling, pain, and redness; however, typically associated with direct trauma, which is not explicitly mentioned. Less likely without direct trauma reported.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses mostly vague and cautious language (\u201cnot too bad,\u201d \u201ckind of heavy\u201d), indicating some reluctance to fully disclose worst-case scenarios or internal fears. Her descriptions are focused on physical sensations but lack detailed emotional insight, reflecting a tendency to minimize or self-protect. - Information flow: She initially provides essential symptoms willingly but refrains from elaborating on all aspects unless prompted, suggesting a guarded response style. Overall, her responses are organized but somewhat hesitant. - Response style: Responses are concise with some elaborative elements but avoid detailed disclosure of severity or emotional impact unless questioned.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The downplaying of symptom severity (\u201cnot too bad,\u201d \u201cjust uncomfortable\u201d) and delay in mentioning full systemic concern (e.g., skin changes, increase in pain) indicate withholding of full severity, likely to avoid alarm or embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: The phrase \u201cnot too bad\u201d and describing swelling as \u201cnot too bad\u201d contrast with her concern about serious conditions, showing they may be minimizing her real pathology. - Amplification patterns: Describing symptoms as \u201cfull of pressure,\u201d \u201cheavy,\u201d and \u201csore\u201d could reflect actual discomfort but also serve to communicate worry without explicitly stating severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitations, coupled with guarded responses, suggest mild discomfort or shame about discussing symptoms that may imply serious illness. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: No evidence that others are affecting her responses; responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Moderate information withholding bias**, due to hesitance in revealing the full extent of her symptoms and concerns. - Severity: Moderate, because she balances disclosure with protective minimization, which could impede full clinical understanding. - Areas most affected: Symptoms related to pain severity, systemic signs (e.g., skin changes), and her true emotional distress are likely underrepresented. - Reliability: Moderate; her guarded responses require cautious interpretation, understanding she might be holding back more distress or information.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed severity of pain, presence of skin discoloration, warmth, or worsening systemic signs\u2014these are critical for assessing PE risk but may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may understate the *urgency* of her symptoms, which could delay recognition of a potentially serious clot. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about blood clots seems genuine but perhaps exaggerated, influencing her tone. - True timeline: Symptoms might have progressed more rapidly or be more severe than conveyed; the three-week timeline might underestimate acuteness, especially if systemic signs are present but unmentioned.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The goal is to deepen understanding of her eye symptoms by exploring the full scope of her experience, including details she may have not yet shared, such as worsening features, associated behaviors, or emotional reactions. - She appears somewhat cautious and minimizes severity, so using open-ended questions that invite elaboration while being non-threatening can help her feel comfortable sharing more. - I want to gently encourage her to describe any changes in her symptoms over time, her emotional response, and how this is affecting her daily life, to uncover additional relevant information. - Considering her guarded responses, framing questions to emphasize her perspective and avoid making her feel judged or alarmed is key. - This aligns with the early exploration phase, focusing on building trust and gathering broad, detailed symptom history.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact severity, progression, systemic signs, emotional impact, and concerns about the current situation. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the nature and severity of the eye issue, rule out any signs of worsening or systemic involvement. - Patient factors: Guarded, somewhat minimization, cautious language\u2014questions should appear open and empathetic. - Interview phase goals: Foster rapport, encourage detailed elaboration, explore the full extent of her symptoms and concerns.

    "input": "The patient is a 45-year-old woman presenting with a several-week history of right leg heaviness and mild abdominal bloating. Although she reports minimal eye symptoms described as \"weird\" sensations that are \"not right,\" her communication pattern suggests these symptoms may be more significant than reported, potentially involving visual disturbances or ocular discomfort. The timeline and full extent of her eye-related issues remain uncertain due to hesitancy and vague descriptions. Further targeted assessment is necessary to elucidate possible ocular, neurological, or systemic pathology that may not be fully disclosed at this stage.1. Diagnosis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Justification: Right leg heaviness over weeks suggests possible venous insufficiency or thrombosis, common in women in this age group with minimal activity or other risk factors.  2. Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst or mass Justification: Abdominal bloating and her age make ovarian pathology a plausible cause, possibly exerting pressure or causing hormonal effects.  3. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) Justification: Vague visual or ocular sensations, combined with neurological symptoms like leg heaviness, could suggest demyelinating disease, especially if those sensations are neural in origin.  4. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal disorder (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, or mild ascites due to systemic illness) Justification: Abdominal bloating may result from GI causes or systemic conditions causing fluid retention; unlikely as primary but worth consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Peripheral neuropathy Justification: Sensations described as \"weird\" may involve nerve dysfunction, which can cause sensory disturbances and gait or heaviness sensations.  6. Diagnosis: Lumbar radiculopathy or nerve root compression Justification: Leg heaviness and vague sensory symptoms could be due to nerve irritation or compression in spinal roots.  7. Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure or systemic fluid retention Justification: Bloating and leg heaviness could relate to systemic edema, especially if other features like dyspnea are present; less likely without additional signs.  8. Diagnosis: Carotid or ocular vascular insufficiency Justification: Minimal eye symptoms may reflect transient vascular issues affecting ocular perfusion, leading to weird sensations.  9. Diagnosis: Lymphadenopathy or systemic infection Justification: Could cause abdominal bloating if lymphatic drainage is affected or if there's an underlying infection, though less common without other systemic signs.  10. Diagnosis: Malignancy (e.g., pancreatic or other abdominal tumors) Justification: Bloating and systemic symptoms in middle-aged women can suggest occult malignancy, though less specifically aligned with her primary complaints.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and minimizing language (\"nothing really,\" \"weird sometimes\") when describing the eye, indicating discomfort or reluctance to share details.

    "input": "The patient is a 45-year-old woman presenting with a several-week history of right leg heaviness, pressure, and mild abdominal bloating, consistent with her reported systemic symptoms. She also reports occasional abnormal visual sensations, characterized as flickering or flashing lights, but describes these symptoms vaguely and responds with minimal detail, indicating possible underreporting. Her communication suggests discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose the severity of her eye symptoms, which may be more persistent or severe than described, potentially including visual field abnormalities, floaters, or ocular pain. Objective clinical findings are not available from the initial conversation; further targeted ocular and neurological assessments are needed to elucidate the full extent of her visual and systemic symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Neoplasm (e.g., brain tumor or metastatic lesion) Justification: The combination of systemic symptoms (leg heaviness, abdominal bloating) and transient visual phenomena may reflect intracranial mass effect or infiltration affecting visual pathways and systemic function; systemic symptoms suggest a disseminated process, making neoplasm a prime consideration.  2. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating disease Justification: Occasional abnormal visual sensations like flickering or flashing lights are characteristic of optic neuritis or demyelination; systemic symptoms might be secondary or part of a broader neuro-inflammatory process; MS can cause both optic symptoms and systemic features.  3. Diagnosis: Central nervous system (CNS) tumor (e.g., glioma, metastasis) Justification: The visual symptoms and systemic signs could be explained by a mass lesion compressing visual pathways or causing neurological deficits; the systemic symptoms could relate to tumor burden or paraneoplastic phenomena.  4. Diagnosis: Inflammatory or infectious meningitis/encephalitis Justification: The presence of systemic symptoms alongside visual phenomena could suggest an infectious or inflammatory CNS process, especially if systemic signs are severe; vague ocular symptoms may reflect meningeal or neuro-ocular involvement.  5. Diagnosis: Vascular disorder (e.g., ischemic optic neuropathy or cerebrovascular event) Justification: Flashes of light can be precipitated by ischemia or transient vascular disturbances; systemic signs like leg heaviness and bloating could relate to vascular pathology or hypercoagulability, raising suspicion for vascular causes affecting the visual pathway or systemic circulation.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited disclosures about the eye symptoms until prompted, with vague descriptions, indicating possible reluctance to disclose or lesser perceived importance. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the eye symptoms as \"nothing,\" \"random,\" and \"not serious,\" possibly to avoid alarming herself or to minimize her discomfort. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; her concern appears moderate, and she does not exaggerate symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signs of discomfort when discussing her eye, evidenced by vague language and brief responses. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; timeline and symptom description seem consistent, though incomplete. - Family influence: No evident influence detected.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Underreporting/minimizing bias regarding her eye symptoms, likely rooted in discomfort or uncertainty about how to describe them. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she acknowledges the symptoms but minimizes their significance, risking underestimation of potential danger. - Areas most affected: Eye symptom reporting; the core symptoms (leg and abdomen) are more thoroughly described, thus more reliable. - Reliability: Moderate; self-report about the eye is somewhat compromised, so clinical assessment should probe further.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about the eye symptoms such as duration, progression, associated visual changes, or impact on daily function. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possible underlying serious ocular issues like visual disturbances, flashes, or retinal pathology. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about her clot appears justified and more accurately reported. - True timeline: The actual progression of her eye symptoms may be more insidious or severe than her vague description suggests, indicating the need for targeted ocular examination.

    "input": "The patient is a 45-year-old woman presenting with systemic symptoms of right leg heaviness and abdominal bloating experienced over several weeks. She reports experiencing flickering or flashing lights in her left eye but describes these symptoms vaguely and minimally, which suggests she may be underreporting their severity or frequency. Objective assessment is needed to evaluate for underlying ocular or neurological pathology, as her visual symptoms may be more significant than indicated. Comprehensive ocular and neurological examinations are recommended to clarify the nature and extent of her visual disturbances and systemic complaints.1. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Justification: The flickering or flashing lights in the eye suggest a possible optic neuritis or visual disturbance consistent with MS. The systemic symptoms like leg heaviness could reflect neurological involvement affecting motor pathways or demyelination. MS often presents in women of middle age with visual symptoms and neurological signs, fitting this case. Although she reports minimal visual symptoms, the neurologic signs warrant considering MS as a primary diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Venous Thrombosis or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: The systemic presentation of right leg heaviness over several weeks raises suspicion for a DVT, which can cause swelling, heaviness, and potentially embolic phenomena. Abdominal bloating might indicate a systemic or abdominal pathology related to venous congestion or mass. The systemic nature suggests vascular involvement, but without specific signs of DVT, it remains secondarily probable.  3. Diagnosis: Carotid Artery Disease / Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Justification: Visual disturbances such as flickering lights may be transient ischemic phenomena. The presence of systemic symptoms and unilateral visual symptoms lean towards embolic or ischemic causes. TIA is a consideration, especially given her age and symptoms, but less likely without more focal neurological deficits.  4. Diagnosis: Ocular Migraine (Visual Migraine) Justification: Flickering lights and visual disturbances are characteristic of ocular migraine, which can occur without significant neurological deficits. Her minimal reports could suggest episodic migraine phenomena, especially if no other neurological findings are present. However, systemic symptoms are less common with migrainous aura alone, making this less probable.  5. Diagnosis: Abdominal or Systemic Malignancy with Paraneoplastic or Vascular Manifestations Justification: Systemic symptoms like abdominal bloating and leg heaviness could be related to underlying malignancy causing systemic hypercoagulability or venous thrombosis, as well as possible paraneoplastic neurological effects. While less immediate, this remains in differential due to systemic pattern.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and hedging language (\u201ckind of,\u201d \u201cnot really,\u201d \u201cmaybe\u201d), indicating a tendency to minimize or underreport certain symptoms, especially the eye flashes. They avoid detailed descriptions, perhaps out of uncertainty or discomfort. - Information flow: They tend to be reticent about their eye symptoms, volunteering minimal information unless pressed. Their responses about leg and abdomen are more forthcoming, likely reflecting their greater concern about those areas. - Response style: Responses are concise and somewhat evasive regarding the eye, more detailed about physical discomfort, which suggests they prioritize certain symptoms over others or feel less comfortable discussing ocular issues.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient minimizes their eye symptoms (\u201cnothing really,\u201d \u201cnot serious\u201d), possibly hiding the true frequency or severity of flashes. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the eye sensations despite acknowledging flickering. This could stem from uncertainty or a belief that it isn\u2019t significant. - Amplification patterns: While not overtly exaggerating, they express concern about their leg heaviness and abdominal bloating as \u201creally heavy,\u201d potentially amplifying their perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitance to elaborate on eye symptoms, possibly reflecting embarrassment or uncertainty. - Confusion/memory issues: Mild ambiguity about how often or how significant their eye symptoms are, which could reflect genuine uncertainty rather than cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not evident; responses appear internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely minimization bias regarding the eye issues, possibly coupled with vagueness bias influencing the clarity of their symptom description. - Severity: Moderate - they acknowledge flickering but minimize its importance; this bias may lead to underestimating the ocular symptoms' significance. - Areas most affected: Eye-related symptom reporting is most biased, as their vagueness and minimization reduce the reliability of the data. - Reliability: Moderate; their descriptions of limb and abdominal symptoms seem trustworthy, but eye symptoms are probably underreported or understated, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true nature and impact of the eye flickering are probably understated; they might experience more frequent or bothersome visual phenomena than they admit. - Symptoms probably minimized: The eye symptoms\u2019 severity; the patient\u2019s vague description suggests they might not fully recognize or communicate their significance. - Concerns probably amplified: About the leg and abdominal symptoms\u2014they openly express worry, and their detailed descriptions support real concern. - True timeline: The leg and abdominal symptoms\u2019 progression appears accurate; the eye symptoms\u2019 timeline is vague, which means their true pattern or severity might be more complex or chronic than conveyed.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient exhibits a tendency to minimize or vague reporting of visual symptoms, which impairs accurate assessment of their severity and characteristic features. - Given her systemic symptoms and current vague description, I need to clarify whether her visual phenomena are consistent with migraine aura, or suggest a neurological cause like MS or vascular ischemia. - It\u2019s crucial to distinguish between episodic and persistent visual disturbances, as well as associated features such as pain, duration, and timing, to narrow the differential diagnosis. - Since she reports flickering and flashing but minimizes their impact, I should ask about how often, how long they last, and whether they are progressing or linked to specific triggers. - A sensitive, focused follow-up will help uncover details that may not be volunteered, allowing better correlation with possible diagnoses like migraine, demyelinating disease, or ischemic events.

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and hedging language (\u201ckind of,\u201d \u201cnot really,\u201d \u201cmaybe\u201d), indicating a tendency to minimize or underreport certain symptoms, especially the eye flashes. They avoid detailed descriptions, perhaps out of uncertainty or discomfort. - Information flow: They tend to be reticent about their eye symptoms, volunteering minimal information unless pressed. Their responses about leg and abdomen are more forthcoming, likely reflecting their greater concern about those areas. - Response style: Responses are concise and somewhat evasive regarding the eye, more detailed about physical discomfort, which suggests they prioritize certain symptoms over others or feel less comfortable discussing ocular issues.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient minimizes their eye symptoms (\u201cnothing really,\u201d \u201cnot serious\u201d), possibly hiding the true frequency or severity of flashes. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the eye sensations despite acknowledging flickering. This could stem from uncertainty or a belief that it isn\u2019t significant. - Amplification patterns: While not overtly exaggerating, they express concern about their leg heaviness and abdominal bloating as \u201creally heavy,\u201d potentially amplifying their perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitance to elaborate on eye symptoms, possibly reflecting embarrassment or uncertainty. - Confusion/memory issues: Mild ambiguity about how often or how significant their eye symptoms are, which could reflect genuine uncertainty rather than cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not evident; responses appear internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Likely minimization bias regarding the eye issues, possibly coupled with vagueness bias influencing the clarity of their symptom description. - Severity: Moderate - they acknowledge flickering but minimize its importance; this bias may lead to underestimating the ocular symptoms' significance. - Areas most affected: Eye-related symptom reporting is most biased, as their vagueness and minimization reduce the reliability of the data. - Reliability: Moderate; their descriptions of limb and abdominal symptoms seem trustworthy, but eye symptoms are probably underreported or understated, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true nature and impact of the eye flickering are probably understated; they might experience more frequent or bothersome visual phenomena than they admit. - Symptoms probably minimized: The eye symptoms\u2019 severity; the patient\u2019s vague description suggests they might not fully recognize or communicate their significance. - Concerns probably amplified: About the leg and abdominal symptoms\u2014they openly express worry, and their detailed descriptions support real concern. - True timeline: The leg and abdominal symptoms\u2019 progression appears accurate; the eye symptoms\u2019 timeline is vague, which means their true pattern or severity might be more complex or chronic than conveyed.",

    "input": "The clinical presentation involves a 45-year-old woman reporting systemic symptoms of right leg heaviness and abdominal bloating persisting over several weeks. She describes intermittent flashes or flickering lights in her left eye but communicates these symptoms in a vague, hesitant manner, suggesting possible underreporting of their frequency and severity. Her responses indicate concern, but she may be minimizing or withholding details about the full extent of her visual disturbances. Further targeted assessment is necessary to clarify the nature, frequency, and progression of her ocular symptoms, alongside systemic evaluation to identify potential underlying causes.Vaso-occlusive cerebrovascular or retinal ischemic event ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, non-specific language (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"I think\") which indicates a tendency to downplay or avoid detailed disclosure; emotional descriptors like \"unsettling\" show underlying concern but with guarded expression. - Information flow: Responses are often brief, hesitant, and only elaborated when prompted, reflecting reluctance or uncertainty. Information appears organized but limited. - Response style: The patient relies on minimal elaboration, often hedging, indicating discomfort or lack of confidence in recalling precise details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The vague descriptions and hedging about how often and how long the flickering occurs suggest deliberate or unconscious withholding of details. - Minimization behaviors: Describing the flickering as \"just a flicker,\" \"kind of random,\" and \"not really sure\" might reduce perceived seriousness but could mask more significant symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Concern is expressed (\"unsettling,\" \"worried\"), but the actual details do not indicate high levels of distress, suggesting some emotional amplification without factual exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitations and vague responses may reflect discomfort or shame about discussing potential or perceived minor symptoms they are unsure about. - Confusion/memory issues: The uncertainty regarding timing and specifics hints at mild memory difficulty or difficulty in accurately recalling episodic details. - Family influence: No explicit evidence; responses are internally driven without external cues.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate response bias characterized by underreporting and vagueness, possibly to avoid alarm or due to uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate. The patient communicates concern but with incomplete detail, affecting assessment accuracy. - Areas most affected: Eye-related symptoms, as details about frequency, triggers, and visual changes are vague. - Reliability: Moderate; the emotional concern suggests genuine worry, but the details are insufficient for complete confidence, so corroboration may be necessary.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timing, frequency, triggers, associated visual phenomena, or related discomforts are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity or impact of flickering episodes may be greater than described; episodes could be more frequent or longer-lasting. - Concerns probably amplified: The emotional concern (\"unsettling\") suggests worry that might be disproportionate or internally magnified compared to clinical severity. - True timeline: Actual episodes may be more persistent or frequent, but the patient\u2019s vague recollection understates this.  This analysis suggests the patient is attempting to communicate concern but is cautious about revealing full details, which can impact clinical evaluation and management.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The key areas that still need clarification involve the specifics of the flickering lights\u2014how often, how long they last, whether they are constant or intermittent, and what triggers or relieves them. Additionally, the patient\u2019s understanding of these symptoms and their impact on her daily life are not fully explored. - Diagnostic priorities: To confirm or exclude retinal or cerebrovascular causes, I need to gather detailed symptom chronology, associated visual changes, and potential red flags like sudden vision loss or new neurological deficits. - Patient factors: The patient communicates hesitantly and with vague language, indicating discomfort or uncertainty, so I should use gentle, precise, yet open questions that encourage elaboration without causing defensiveness. - Interview phase goals: To obtain concrete, detailed descriptions of the visual phenomena, assess for features suggestive of serious pathology, and gauge her understanding and concern level, all to confirm the most likely diagnosis or identify red flags.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions addressing timing, duration, triggers, and associated phenomena. - Information target: Frequency, duration, and characteristics of the flickering lights, associated visual or systemic symptoms, and patient\u2019s understanding of her symptoms. - Communication approach: Phrase questions empathetically, acknowledging her concerns, and emphasizing that detailed sharing helps ensure accurate assessment and proper care. - Expected value: Clarifies the episodic details critical for ruling in conditions like retinal ischemia or migrainous phenomena and reduces uncertainty for diagnostic confirmation.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that the flickering or flashing lights in your eye happen sometimes, but I\u2019d like to understand better. When these flashes occur, are they happening constantly, or do they come and go? How long do each of these episodes last\u2014just a few seconds, or longer? Do you notice any particular triggers\u2014like when you\u2019re tired, stressed, or in bright or dim lighting? And during these flashes, do you see anything else, like spots, distortion, or changes in your vision? Also, have these episodes changed over time, becoming more frequent or intense?\"",
