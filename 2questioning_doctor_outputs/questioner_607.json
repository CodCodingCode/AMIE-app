    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with a three-day history of dysuria, thick yellow vaginal discharge, itching, lower abdominal discomfort, and intermenstrual bleeding. These symptoms are suggestive of a urogenital infection, possibly an STI such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, though the severity may be amplified due to emotional distress. The patient does not report systemic symptoms like fever or malaise, but these need to be explicitly evaluated. Further assessment including physical examination, laboratory testing, and detailed sexual history is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other potential causes, with awareness of possible communication biases influencing symptom reporting.1. Diagnosis: Gonorrhea Justification: Presents with dysuria, purulent yellow vaginal discharge, and intermenstrual bleeding\u2014classic features of mucopurulent cervicitis due to gonorrhea, common in sexually active women.  2. Diagnosis: Chlamydia trachomatis infection Justification: Common cause of urethritis and cervicitis with mucopurulent discharge; often asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, but can cause similar clinical picture.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial vaginosis Justification: Presents with abnormal vaginal discharge and itching; although the discharge is often malodorous, it may sometimes be yellowish, and it is a frequent cause of vaginal symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Trichomoniasis Justification: Causes yellow, frothy vaginal discharge, pruritus, and dysuria; often associated with intermenstrual bleeding and itching, making it a plausible differential.  5. Diagnosis: Cervicitis due to non-specific infection or irritation Justification: Cervical inflammation can cause vaginal discharge and bleeding; common in the setting of other STIs or local irritation.  6. Diagnosis: Yeast (Candida) vulvovaginitis Justification: Itching and abnormal discharge are common; although the discharge is usually cottage-cheese-like, it can sometimes be yellowish and associated with discomfort.  7. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Justification: Lower abdominal discomfort and cervical/vaginal discharge; although typically systemic features like fever are present, early mild cases may present with localized symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Endocervical polyp or cervical ectropion Justification: Can cause intermenstrual bleeding; though less likely with predominant dysuria/discharge, it remains a differential for bleeding.  9. Diagnosis: Urethral or vesical calculi Justification: Can cause dysuria and lower abdominal discomfort; less likely given predominant vaginal discharge and bleeding.  10. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervical neoplasm Justification: Intermenstrual bleeding warrants investigation, though less likely in a young woman without other risk factors; important to exclude in persistent or recurrent cases.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses detailed and emotionally charged language to emphasize severity, such as \"Really bad,\" \"worse,\" \"really itchy,\" and \"dull, nagging pain.\" He is specific about symptoms but frames them within a context of distress, which may enhance perceived urgency. His responses are organized, with clear chronological progression, and he communicates concerns openly. - Information flow: The patient appears forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions without hesitation. He does not deflect or minimize, instead accentuating the worsening of symptoms to ensure his concerns are recognized. - Response style: His responses are elaborate, narrative-driven, and direct. He emphasizes his feelings and perceptions actively, with some emotional expression.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is minimal evidence of withholding; his detailed account suggests he is eager to communicate his experience. - Minimization behaviors: Not apparent; he appears to overstate rather than understate symptoms, perhaps driven by anxiety. - Amplification patterns: Yes, he seems to amplify concerns, especially regarding severity and potential consequences (\"could be something serious,\" \"I don\u2019t understand what's happening\"). - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal signs detected; he discusses sexual health openly, though some discomfort about discussing sexual activity and STDs could exist subtly. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indications; timeline appears consistent, although intense worry might momentarily cloud clarity. - Family influence: No evidence of influence from others in his responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias. He overemphasizes the seriousness of his symptoms, likely due to anxiety and fear of having a severe infection. - Severity: Moderate to severe, considering his intense emotional presentation and detailed description of distress. - Areas most affected: The perceived severity and emotional concern about possible serious illness are most biased, possibly leading him to overestimate risks. - Reliability: His self-report is generally reliable regarding symptoms but influenced by emotional distress, so clinical judgment should incorporate this bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Underlying psychosocial factors, such as anxiety levels and health literacy, which may influence his perception of severity. Specific details about recent sexual encounters and previous health behaviors might be underreported or not elaborated fully. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual extent of discomfort might be worse; he may be more distressed than conveyed, especially regarding the physical discomfort and risk of infection complications. - Concerns probably amplified: His worries about serious illness and STD consequences are likely exaggerated by anxiety, which can lead to overestimation of severity. - True timeline: Symptoms appear to have worsened rapidly; he reports onset three days ago with significant escalation, consistent with the progression of urethritis or infection, though emotional factors might influence his perception of how quickly symptoms intensified.  In summary, Jason's communication showcases clear emotional amplification of his symptoms driven by anxiety, leading to potentially exaggerated concerns. While his symptom descriptions are detailed and generally trustworthy, his emotional response might inflate perceived severity, necessitating reassurance and careful clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient has already shared specific symptoms and the recent timeline, but to deepen understanding, I should explore his overall experience and how these symptoms impact his daily life and emotional state. - Since he is presenting with distress, it\u2019s important to gently gauge his general concern level and any other symptoms he might not have mentioned yet, including systemic or related issues. - An open-ended question about his personal perspective and concerns will help establish rapport and provide insights into his emotional state, which is crucial given his anxiety-driven reports. - Focusing on his broader experience with the symptoms will help us understand how much of his worry is rooted in symptom severity versus emotional response.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Common cause of eye redness, tearing, and swelling; potentially triggered or coinciding with recent activity; usually bilateral or unilateral with mild discomfort; prevalent in general population.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or superficial corneal injury Justification: Recent trauma from playing soccer with potential foreign body or scratch; presents with redness, tearing, and possible discomfort; common in sports injuries.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye inflammation caused directly by minor trauma or foreign body; similar signs to conjunctivitis but directly related to recent physical activity; common in contact sports.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Presents with redness and tearing; typically bilateral and associated with allergies, though less likely given recent activity and trauma context.  5. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Sudden onset of sectoral eye redness and swelling; usually mild and self-limited; not typically triggered by trauma but considered in differential.  6. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Redness and swelling around eyelids; chronic condition, less likely to acutely develop after physical activity but still possible.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis (anterior) Justification: Inflammation inside the eye causing redness and tearing; less likely without pain or vision changes but important to consider.  8. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Severe infection causing swelling, redness, and potentially proptosis; red flags include pain, fever, or visual disturbances\u2014less likely without systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body Justification: Trauma-related injury might involve foreign body in the eye causing localized symptoms; confirms importance of examining for foreign objects.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Causes redness and tearing with increased intraocular pressure; usually presents with pain, halos, and decreased vision; less likely given trauma context and normal symptom description.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He employs emotional, intense language (\"really bad,\" \"freaked out,\" \"scared\"), emphasizing his distress but also revealing reliance on emotional cues possibly leading to overstatement of severity. Specific symptom mentions are detailed and direct, demonstrating openness. - Information flow: The responses are highly organized, with clear threads linking symptoms to worries; he volunteers extensive details when asked about his overall feeling, indicating a cooperative and forthcoming response style. However, his focus on worst-case anxiety could distort the perceived severity. - Response style: He tends to be elaborative and emotionally driven, sharing symptoms with emphasis but not necessarily minimizing or withholding critical info.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There are no strong signs of withholding; he openly discusses multiple aspects of his symptoms and concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Possible minimalization of prior health; he states he is \"really freaked out\" now but may underplay past episodes or his understanding of risks.

    "input": "The patient is a adult male presenting with symptoms suggestive of genitourinary infection, including burning during urination, yellow penile discharge, penile pruritus, persistent lower abdominal pain, and intermenstrual bleeding. These symptoms are currently reported as severe and worsening over several days. Communication biases indicate that mild or early symptoms may have been present but are underreported or unnoticed, and current symptoms may be amplified by anxiety. The timeline of symptom development is likely more gradual than described, with initial mild irritation or discharge that was overlooked. Further detailed sexual history and assessment for additional signs are necessary to clarify the underlying cause and guide management.1. Diagnosis: Gonorrhea Justification: The yellow penile discharge and burning sensation strongly suggest gonorrhea, a common causative agent of urethritis in sexually active men. The progression to severe, worsening symptoms aligns with typical gonorrheal infection, which often produces purulent discharge and urethral inflammation. The presence of intermenstrual bleeding and abdominal pain could reflect ascending infection or concomitant cervicitis or PID, especially given sexual activity.  2. Diagnosis: Chlamydia trachomatis infection Justification: Chlamydia is highly prevalent among sexually active adults and can cause urethritis with mucopurulent discharge, sometimes less purulent than gonorrhea but still causing discomfort. It often coexists with gonorrhea, making it a top differential. Symptoms like penile pruritus and intermenstrual bleeding support this, as chlamydial infections can involve the lower genital tract.  3. Diagnosis: Cervicitis/Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Justification: The intermenstrual bleeding and persistent lower abdominal pain, combined with urethral symptoms, suggest possible involvement of the cervix or upper genital tract. Although PID is more common in females, in males, anal or epididymal involvement may mimic this pattern. In women, PID would fit more clearly, but given the mention of anal or pelvic pain, extension of infection might be consistent.  4. Diagnosis: Urethral or Ano-genital Candida infection Justification: Pruritus and penile discharge could occasionally be seen in candidal infections, although less typical with purulent discharge. The degree of severity and worsening suggests an inflammatory process more than superficial yeast infection but still warrants consideration, especially if the patient is immunocompromised.  5. Diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection Justification: HSV can cause penile pruritus and lesions but less commonly causes yellow discharge or severe worsening over days without vesicular lesions. The clinical picture is less typical but included due to genital pruritus and pain, especially if other signs are inconclusive.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient mixes emotional descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"freaked out\") with vague terms (\"somehow,\" \"kind of\"), indicating emotional distress possibly influencing factual reporting. His focus on personal impact over precise details suggests anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Information flow: He tends to volunteer symptoms but with some hesitations and vagueness, especially regarding the onset and triggers, hinting at discomfort or uncertainty. His responses are somewhat organized but contain gaps or non-specific references. - Response style: He provides elaborated descriptions driven by concern but may avoid explicit disclosure about initial symptom circumstances or subtle details. His responses are emotionally charged, with some avoidance in detailing the timeline.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Doesn't specify circumstances surrounding symptom start, possibly hiding minor or less alarming details, or feels unsure about exact timing. - Minimization behaviors: Downplays the very beginning with \"nothing really happened,\" which may understate initial severity. - Amplification patterns: Describes symptoms as \"really bad,\" \"worse each day,\" and uses strong emotional language, possibly heightening perceived danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitations around discharge and bleeding topics suggest discomfort or shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Vague descriptions of onset (\"just started bothering me somehow\") imply uncertainty about the timeline. - Family influence: No evidence, responses appear internally focused, driven by personal distress.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-influenced amplification with some tendency to minimize initial symptoms, leading to polarized reporting. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his distress and emotional responses strongly color his report but are based on genuine severe symptoms. - Areas most affected: The timeline and initial symptom description are most biased, affecting accurate historical assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; his reports are credible regarding current severity but may lack accuracy about onset and early progression, due to emotional influence and possible embarrassment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact timing and circumstances of symptom onset, early symptoms, and context of when pain or discharge first appeared. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial mild symptoms, such as early discomfort, are likely understated or unnoticed. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about severity and serious illnesses (e.g., STDs, complications) are likely exaggerated by anxiety. - True timeline: The actual symptom progression is probably more gradual; the patient\u2019s current high distress level may cause him to perceive it as worse than it is early on.  # Short Answer",

    "input": "The patient is an adult male presenting with genitourinary symptoms suggestive of an infectious process. He reports recent onset of burning during urination, thick yellow penile discharge, penile pruritus, persistent lower abdominal pain, and intermenstrual bleeding, with symptoms described as severe and worsening over the past three days. However, communication biases indicate that earlier, milder symptoms such as mild irritation or minimal discharge likely preceded the current state and were possibly unnoticed or dismissed. He has recent unprotected sexual activity, which increases suspicion for sexually transmitted infections. The current presentation may be exaggerated by anxiety, and additional details about systemic symptoms, prior episodes, and a comprehensive sexual history are needed to clarify the clinical picture and guide management.1. Diagnosis: Gonorrhea Justification: The patient's thick yellow penile discharge, severe dysuria, and recent unprotected sex are classic for gonorrheal urethritis. Gonorrhea often causes purulent discharge and rapid symptom escalation, aligning with the worsening symptoms over three days. The presence of penile pruritus and abdominal pain can also suggest complications such as epididymitis or prostatitis associated with gonorrhea.  2. Diagnosis: Chlamydial urethritis Justification: Chlamydia is a common co-infection with gonorrhea, and it can cause similar urethritis symptoms with less purulent discharge but still significant irritation and discomfort. Although the patient's discharge is described as thick and yellow, chlamydia often causes milder symptoms but remains a major concern in this context given recent unprotected sex and sexual symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Epididymitis Justification: Persistent lower abdominal pain, especially if localized to the hemiscrotum, could indicate epididymitis, which commonly results from bacterial STIs like gonorrhea or chlamydia. The progression over days makes epididymitis a likely complication of primary urethritis.  4. Diagnosis: Prostatitis Justification: Lower abdominal pain, dysuria, and systemic symptoms may reflect prostatitis, often caused by STIs in sexually active males. The intermenstrual bleeding could relate to inflammation or mucosal disruptions associated with infection.  5. Diagnosis: Herpes genital infection (initial episode or outbreak) Justification: Although less likely given the description, genital pruritus and infectious symptoms raise consideration of herpes. However, herpes typically presents with vesicular lesions and less purulent discharge, making it lower on the list but still relevant for differential exclusion.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs emotionally charged descriptors like \"really burning\" and \"really bad,\" indicating high concern. He also uses hedging (\"I think,\" \"maybe\") and some vague phrases (\"somehow,\" \"like a throbbing\") reflecting uncertainty or discomfort. There\u2019s a mixture of detailed description with some non-specific language. - Information flow: He generally provides organized responses with chronological details, volunteering some information but sometimes adding context to reassure or seek validation. His responses are elaborative, showing effort to clarify his distress. - Response style: The responses are mostly elaborative and expressive, with signs of distress. He answers directly but with emotional qualifiers, which may reflect an underlying anxious state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear withholding, but hedging phrases suggest mild hesitation about providing full details. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; he appears largely truthful but hedges slightly, possibly to protect himself or avoid shame. - Amplification patterns: Clear signs of emotional overstatement regarding pain and urgency (\u201creally bad,\u201d \u201cworst ever\u201d), possibly driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild, inferred from hedging and seeking reassurance; no overt shame cues. - Confusion/memory issues: No observable inconsistencies; responses are coherent. - Family influence: Not directly evidenced; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014his anxiety influences him to perceive symptoms as more severe, increasing urgency and concern. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his expressive distress might exaggerate perceived severity but remains largely trustworthy. - Areas most affected: Pain assessment and urgency perception; he overemphasizes symptom severity possibly to elicit quick help. - Reliability: Fair but somewhat influenced by anxiety; factual reporting appears accurate but emotionally skewed.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might underreport certain lifestyle factors or previous mild symptoms; could be influenced by anxiety about consequences. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident; his descriptions seem comprehensive. - Concerns probably amplified: Yes; his emotional state causes overstatement of severity, which may affect his presentation. - True timeline: Likely consistent with his report\u2014symptoms developed over days with worsening severity, but his perception is heightened by anxiety.  In summary, the patient's communication exhibits emotional amplification and moderate anxiety-driven biases that influence his perception of symptom severity, leading to expressive distress and potential overestimation of urgency.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear withholding, but hedging phrases suggest mild hesitation about providing full details. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; he appears largely truthful but hedges slightly, possibly to protect himself or avoid shame. - Amplification patterns: Clear signs of emotional overstatement regarding pain and urgency (\u201creally bad,\u201d \u201cworst ever\u201d), possibly driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild, inferred from hedging and seeking reassurance; no overt shame cues. - Confusion/memory issues: No observable inconsistencies; responses are coherent. - Family influence: Not directly evidenced; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014his anxiety influences him to perceive symptoms as more severe, increasing urgency and concern. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his expressive distress might exaggerate perceived severity but remains largely trustworthy. - Areas most affected: Pain assessment and urgency perception; he overemphasizes symptom severity possibly to elicit quick help. - Reliability: Fair but somewhat influenced by anxiety; factual reporting appears accurate but emotionally skewed.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might underreport certain lifestyle factors or previous mild symptoms; could be influenced by anxiety about consequences. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident; his descriptions seem comprehensive. - Concerns probably amplified: Yes; his emotional state causes overstatement of severity, which may affect his presentation. - True timeline: Likely consistent with his report\u2014symptoms developed over days with worsening severity, but his perception is heightened by anxiety.  In summary, the patient's communication exhibits emotional amplification and moderate anxiety-driven biases that influence his perception of symptom severity, leading to expressive distress and potential overestimation of urgency. Nevertheless, his factual details are mostly reliable, with some subjective exaggeration.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult male presenting with recent-onset genitourinary symptoms including burning during urination, yellow penile discharge, genital pruritus, and lower abdominal discomfort, along with intermenstrual bleeding that is atypical for him. The symptoms reportedly began about three days ago, with initial mild signs potentially underrecognized, but they have since worsened. The patient's concerns are heightened by anxiety, which may lead to overestimation of symptom severity. No systemic symptoms such as fever or chills have been reported at this time, and no external lesions have been described. Further assessment is necessary, including a detailed sexual history, evaluation for systemic signs, and physical examination, to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.Gonococcal or Chlamydial Urethritis/Cervicitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of specific symptoms (\"burning when I pee,\" \"yellowish discharge\") and vague expressions (\"bothered me somehow\"). The emotional tone is prominent, with words like \"worried,\" \"serious,\" and \"never felt anything like this,\" indicating high anxiety. - Information flow: The patient is quite forthcoming with details about sexual history and symptom timeline, but also interjects emotional concerns that may overshadow objective descriptions. The response is organized but interwoven with emotional narrative. - Response style: It is elaborate, with the patient providing detailed descriptions and feelings, indicating a need to be understood and reassured. The responses are mostly direct but contain emotionally charged expressions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited evidence, though hesitance in downplaying initial event (\"nothing really happened\") suggests possible reluctance to fully acknowledge the cause. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" in \"just started bothering me,\" and framing symptoms as \"really bad\" only after escalation, could reflect minimization at initial stages. - Amplification patterns: The consistent emphasis on being \"worried,\" that it\u2019s \"worst\" and \"serious,\" suggests catastrophizing, possibly driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitance when discussing sexual activity and minimal mention of personal feelings about exposure indicate mild embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No notable inconsistencies; timeline appears coherent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, as the patient appears to overestimate the severity of symptoms due to worry. - Severity: Moderate; detailed symptoms but significant emotional distress impacting perception. - Areas most affected: The perceived severity of bleeding and pain, with potential overestimation of danger. - Reliability: Moderate; the report is consistent but influenced by emotional state, possibly inflating symptom severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle details about systemic symptoms or prior psychological factors influencing anxiety. Possibly underreporting of other relevant exposures or symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient might not be fully aware of the benign nature of some symptoms or could be overfocused on worst-case scenarios. - Concerns probably amplified: Overly worried about consequences, possibly leading to increased distress disproportionate to clinical severity. - True timeline: The reported progression seems plausible, although emotional amplification might skew their perception of symptom severity and urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The current focus is on symptoms and timeline, but specific diagnostic criteria for gonorrhea or chlamydia (e.g., presence of systemic symptoms, pattern of discharge, associated signs) need confirmation. Also, understanding if the patient has additional risk factors or prior episodes, as well as assessing their understanding of the condition, would clarify diagnostic certainty. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm key features that distinguish gonococcal from chlamydial infection, such as presence of external lesions, systemic signs, or response to treatments. Also, rule out other causes of genital discharge such as yeast or irritants that might mimic or complicate diagnosis. - Patient factors: The patient is quite expressive and emotionally engaged, which suggests framing questions gently and collaboratively will elicit honest detailed responses while minimizing anxiety or defensiveness.  - Interview phase goals: Confirm diagnostic criteria for gonorrhea or chlamydia, explore current symptom severity and impact, assess understanding and concerns, and gather final relevant details for diagnostic certainty before discussing treatment options.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions aimed at confirming specific features\u2014e.g., presence of external lesions, systemic symptoms. Also, open-ended questions to explore understanding and emotional impact. - Information target: Symptom specifics (discharge, pain, systemic signs), exposure details, prior history, understanding of diagnosis, concerns, and practical factors affecting treatment. - Communication approach: Phrase collaboratively to reassure and normalize, e.g., \"Based on what you've told me, we need to check some specific signs and symptoms to be sure about what\u2019s causing this.\" - Expected value: Clarifies whether diagnostic criteria are met, helps differentiate conditions, and reassures the patient, allowing for a confident move into shared decision-making.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing all these details\u2014it really helps us get a clearer picture. To confirm, have you noticed any other signs, like sores, blisters, or pain that\u2019s spreading or systemic symptoms such as fever or body aches? Also, can you tell me if you've seen any specific external changes around your genitals, like bumps or ulcers? Understanding whether you\u2019ve experienced any other issues helps us confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, how familiar are you with conditions like gonorrhea or chlamydia? Do you have any worries or questions about what might be causing these symptoms?\"",
