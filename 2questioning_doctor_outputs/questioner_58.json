    "input": "OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 28-year-old male. Chief complaint: Recent onset of hallucinations and paranoia causing feelings of unsafety. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving and a sense of being watched, describing these episodes as intense and recent. He states that these symptoms have emerged suddenly and cause him significant distress, leading him to seek medical evaluation. Given communication patterns, the true frequency, persistence, and impact of these hallucinations are likely more severe than his account suggests. He reports feeling unsafe but minimizes detail about how often or how long these hallucinations occur and whether they are ongoing. There is no information at this time about other psychotic symptoms, mood disturbances, or suicidal thoughts, which may be understated or undisclosed.1. Diagnosis: Psychiatric disorder\u2014Brief Psychotic Disorder\nJustification: Sudden onset of hallucinations and paranoia in a young adult without prior psychiatric history suggests a brief psychotic episode, especially if symptoms are recent and transient.\n2. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis\nJustification: Visual hallucinations can result from intoxication or withdrawal from substances such as hallucinogens, stimulants, or cannabis; however, no substance use details are provided, but still an important consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia spectrum disorder\nJustification: Appearance of hallucinations, particularly visual, could be part of early schizophrenia; however, the recent onset and lack of mention of other characteristic symptoms (e.g., delusions, disorganized speech) make this less likely yet still plausible.\n4. Diagnosis: Organic brain disorder (e.g., neurological cause such as seizure, tumor)\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can stem from neurological issues affecting visual pathways or occipital lobe, especially in young adults; warrants consideration given the nature of hallucinations.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance withdrawal (e.g., withdrawal from psychoactive substances)\nJustification: Some substances cause hallucinations during withdrawal; no substances are specified, but it remains a differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Delirium (due to metabolic or infectious cause)\nJustification: Acute hallucinations can occur in delirium; however, no other cognitive or systemic symptoms are described, making it less likely.\n7. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (Late-onset or undiagnosed)\nJustification: Less likely given the abruptness of symptoms and age; usually an early developmental disorder.\n8. Diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with hallucinations\nJustification: If trauma occurred, hallucinations could be part of re-experiencing; no trauma info provided.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurological infection (e.g., encephalitis)\nJustification: Viral or bacterial encephalitis can cause hallucinations; although possible, no systemic or infectious symptoms are described.\n10. Diagnosis: Para-psychological or rare neuropsychiatric conditions\nJustification: Very low probability but includes rare conditions like primitive reflexes or dissociative phenomena; less consistent with presented symptoms.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses somewhat vague and minimally descriptive language (\"started seeing things,\" \"really intense,\" \"don't feel safe\") that minimizes the severity of symptoms. They avoid explicit details about frequency or duration, likely to not appear overly upset or to mask the true extent. They express emotional concern indirectly, which can indicate internal discomfort but also a desire to present as resilient.\n- Information flow: The patient answers directly but with limited elaboration, suggesting a reluctance to share full details. Their responses are somewhat organized but lack in-depth explanation, possibly due to discomfort or shame. They do volunteer key symptoms but do so cautiously.\n- Response style: The responses are concise, focused on core symptoms, with a tendency to frame experiences as overwhelming but manageable, which may be an effort to minimize perceived severity or embarrassment.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient might be holding back details about how often symptoms occur or their impact on daily functioning, as evidenced by vague phrases and reluctance to elaborate.\n- Minimization behaviors: They downplay how \"intense\" symptoms are and focus on the feeling of not being able to \"handle it,\" possibly to avoid appearing vulnerable or to reduce stigma.\n- Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; rather, the patient tends to understate symptoms, so amplification is minimal.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signs of shame, as they prefer to describe the episode as fleeting or manageable rather than ongoing or debilitating, which could be mitigated by shame or fear of judgment.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion or memory distortion, but the somewhat superficial narrative may reflect a discomfort in discussing deeper emotional states.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence, but their guarded tone might suggest concern about external judgment or influence.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Predominantly symptom minimization combined with delayed care-seeking, as they avoid emphasizing severity and express reluctance to \"make a big deal.\"\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014symptoms described are significant (psychosis, paranoia), but the patient appears to understate their distress, which could lead clinicians to underestimate actual danger or impairment.\n- Areas most affected: The description of hallucinations and paranoia are least detailed, indicating those areas are most affected by minimization bias.\n- Reliability: Their self-report should be approached with caution, as the likelihood of underreporting is high; corroborative information may be necessary for accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The true severity and frequency of hallucinations, the impact on daily functioning, and any ongoing suicidal or dangerous ideation may be underreported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The intensity and danger posed by psychotic symptoms, as they emphasize being overwhelmed and feeling unsafe but avoid describing ongoing or severe impairment.\n- Concerns probably amplified: They might be over-worried about stigma or judgment, leading to a guarded presentation, but this is less apparent here.\n- True timeline: The sudden onset after binge suggests acute exacerbation, but their narrative might suppress the ongoing nature or urgency of intervention needs, possibly trying to present the episode as isolated or situational.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: 28-year-old male. Chief complaint: Recent onset of visual hallucinations and feelings of unsafety, with potential underreporting of severity and frequency. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving and a sensation of being watched, describing these episodes as intense and recent. He states they began suddenly, with the current episodes persisting constantly since the previous night. He reports feeling unsafe but minimizes the impact on his overall daily functioning. There is no mention of other psychotic features, mood issues, or suicidal thoughts at this time. Communication patterns suggest that he may be experiencing more frequent or severe hallucinations than he acknowledges, possibly affecting his sleep or daily activities, but he has not explicitly confirmed this.1. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis (e.g., hallucinogens, stimulants, or intoxication)\nJustification: Sudden onset of hallucinations in a young adult male could be related to recent use of psychoactive substances, especially if measures are unreported. This is common and can present with visual hallucinations.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary psychotic disorder (such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder)\nJustification: The hallucinations and feelings of being watched are characteristic symptoms of psychosis, especially occurring suddenly and persistently. Although less common at this age without prior history, it remains a possibility.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute brain lesion or injury (e.g., seizure, tumor, trauma)\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can be caused by neurological events such as occipital lobe seizures or mass lesions. The persistent and intense nature warrants considering neurological causes.\n4. Diagnosis: Delirium (due to underlying medical illness)\nJustification: Acute hallucinations may be part of delirium, especially if associated with altered consciousness or agitation. Absence of detailed mental status limits certainty but remains plausible in an acute presentation.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance withdrawal (e.g., alcohol or benzodiazepines)\nJustification: If the patient recently ceased substance use, withdrawal can cause hallucinations. This is common in substance dependence histories.\n6. Diagnosis: Charles Bonnet syndrome\nJustification: Typically occurs in visually impaired older adults; unlikely here due to age and lack of visual impairment history, so less probable.\n7. Diagnosis: Psychosis secondary to metabolic disturbance (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia)\nJustification: Metabolic disturbances can induce hallucinations; no data suggest systemic illness but remain differential considerations.\n8. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features\nJustification: Hallucinations can be part of mood episodes; however, absence of mood symptoms reduces likelihood.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., early-onset dementia or Lewy body)\nJustification: Rare at 28 years, unlikely given the recent onset and lack of other cognitive decline signs.\n10. Diagnosis: Autism spectrum disorder or other developmental disorder with hallucinations\nJustification: Unlikely as primary diagnosis given recent onset in this context.\nSTOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient tends to use vague, minimizing language (\"just couldn't handle it,\" \"stuff like this,\" \"kind of\"), chronicling experiences with emotional distress but downplaying their severity. They intersperse emotional descriptors with language that suggests reluctance or shame.\n- Information flow: Responses are brief, organized but guarded, indicating a tendency toward control over information sharing.

    "input": "Patient demographics: 28-year-old male. Chief complaint: Recent onset of visual hallucinations and feelings of unsafety, likely more severe and persistent than patient reports. Present illness: The patient describes experiencing visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving and sensations of being watched, which he reports as intense and recent. These episodes allegedly began suddenly and have been ongoing since last night. The patient states that the hallucinations are \"kinda messing with his head\" and that they occur \"pretty much all the time,\" though he minimizes the impact and severity during the interview. The patient reports feeling unsafe but avoids elaborating on the threat level or triggers, and he indicates previous similar episodes that resolved spontaneously. Given his guarded communication patterns, the true frequency and severity of hallucinations may be greater. No additional symptoms such as paranoia, sleep disturbances, disorganized thoughts, or mood symptoms have been explicitly reported, but these may be underrecognized or underreported.1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The abrupt onset of visual hallucinations since last night suggests recent substance use (e.g., hallucinogens, stimulants). Young males are at risk for intoxication leading to hallucinations; the recent start supports this hypothesis.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (Early-Onset Schizophrenia or Brief Psychotic Episode)\nJustification: Visual hallucinations are characteristic of psychosis, which can present suddenly in young adults; prior episodes that resolved spontaneously could suggest a prodromal or relapsing course.\n3. Diagnosis: Medication-Induced Hallucinations\nJustification: Less likely given no medication history reported, but must consider if the patient has recent medication changes or illicit drug use.\n4. Diagnosis: Brain Neoplasm or Lesion\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can result from occipital or temporal lobe pathology; however, absence of other neurological deficits makes this less likely but still important to consider.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance Withdrawal (e.g., after cessation of a hallucinogenic or stimulant drug)\nJustification: The recent onset and severity might be linked to withdrawal; further history needed but cannot be excluded initially.\n6. Diagnosis: Delirium due to an Underlying Medical Condition\nJustification: Sudden hallucinations can occur in delirium; less likely given no evidence of fever, confusion, or systemic illness, but it remains a differential.\n7. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features\nJustification: Generally involves mood symptoms, which are not reported, making this less likely.\n8. Diagnosis: Postraumatic or Stress-Related Disorder\nJustification: Hallucinations can occur in PTSD, but the absence of trauma history and recent onset suggest lower probability.\n9. Diagnosis: Narcotic or Substance Withdrawal with Hallucinations\nJustification: Similar to substance-induced psychosis but specific to withdrawal syndromes; depend on use history.\n10. Diagnosis: Organic Causes (e.g., epilepsy, infections)\nJustification: Unlikely without other neurological signs but still consider if no clear alternative diagnosis emerges.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices include vague and minimizing terms like \"just,\" \"kind of,\" and \"a little,\" which reduce perceived severity.

They tend to answer in a manner that minimizes their symptoms and avoid confronting the full impact.\n- Response style indicates a tendency toward minimalism and avoidance, possibly to preserve a tough image or because of discomfort discussing their experiences. The responses are somewhat disorganized or terse, reflecting emotional discomfort or cognitive disorganization.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Specific evidence of information withholding is present in statements like \"Sorry, I need to clarify...\" which suggest hesitance or difficulty in fully engaging, and the inconsistent detail levels across responses.\n- Minimization behaviors are evident in phrases like \"it's kind of messing with my head\" and \"I\u2019ve had stuff like this happen before,\" which downplay current severity.\n- There are no clear examples of amplification, but their reluctance to fully answer questions indicates an underreporting of the true extent.\n- Embarrassment or shame may be inferred from their guarded responses and the desire to not appear overwhelmed or weak.\n- The confusion about the interaction (\"Processing response\") hints at possible cognitive disorganization or difficulty in recalling specific symptoms, possibly due to disorganized thinking or anxiety.\n- No external influences are evident in their responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: *symptom minimization and response reluctance*, as the patient seems to avoid fully disclosing the severity or frequency of hallucinations and paranoia, likely to maintain a tough persona or avoid stigma.\n- Severity: *moderate*, because although the patient is aware of symptoms and admits to distress, their tendency to downplay and vague descriptions reduce the clarity of their clinical picture.\n- Most affected areas: symptom severity and impact on daily life are most biased, as underreporting impairs accurate assessment and risk evaluation.\n- Reliability: cautious; their self-reporting is compromised by deliberate or subconscious minimization, requiring corroborative information or observation for a comprehensive assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: the true severity, frequency, and possibly the duration of hallucinations and paranoia are probably more intense than indicated. They may withhold details of episodes, which could be critical for safety planning.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: hallucinations and paranoid thoughts are likely more persistent and distressing, as the patient minimizes their impact to appear resilient.\n- Concerns probably amplified: their concern about appearing \"not a big deal\" suggests overcompensation to mask vulnerability, possibly leading to underestimation of risks such as self-harm or behavioral deterioration.\n- True timeline: their reporting appears consistent but simplified; episodes may be ongoing and severe, aligning with their history of recent binge use, but their effect may be more profound than the conversation reveals.",

    "input": "A 28-year-old male reports experiencing visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving and sensations of being watched, which began abruptly since last night and have been persistent, especially at night. He describes these experiences as intense but tends to minimize their severity and impact. He reports that the hallucinations are occurring almost constantly and are disrupting sleep and concentration. He also reports feelings of being unsafe during these episodes. Due to guarded communication and hedging, the actual severity and associated features such as paranoia or mood symptoms may be underestimated. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify the frequency, impact, potential triggers, associated psychiatric symptoms, and safety concerns.1. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis (possibly due to hallucinogens, stimulants, or other drugs)\nJustification: The hallucinations began abruptly last night and are persistent; sudden onset in a young individual suggests a possible recent substance use or intoxication. Visual hallucinations are common with certain recreational drugs. The patient minimizes severity, which could indicate unrecognized or unreported substance use. Immediate consideration is warranted due to recent onset and potential toxicity hazards.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder\nJustification: Visual hallucinations, especially persistent ones, can be part of early schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, the abrupt onset in a 28-year-old with no prior history makes this less likely without prodromal features. Still, the persistent hallucinations and feelings of being watched align with psychosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute neurological event, such as seizure or temporal lobe pathology\nJustification: Onset of visual hallucinations can be secondary to neurological causes like occipital or temporal lobe disturbances or seizures. Shadows and sensations of being watched may suggest complex partial seizures or other organic processes, especially if hallucinations are vivid, sudden, and persistent.\n4. Diagnosis: Delirium or acute confusional state\nJustification: The persistent hallucinations and feelings of being watched, especially at night, could be manifestations of delirium, possibly from infection, metabolic disturbance, or intoxication. The recent change and severity of symptoms point toward an acute neurocognitive disturbance.\n5. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features\nJustification: Less likely given the abrupt onset, but mood disorders like depression with psychotic features can sometimes involve visual hallucinations, especially if co-occurring physiological stressors are present. However, the description favors a more organic or primary psychotic cause.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and understated terms (\"kinda messing,\" \"not sure if that\u2019s normal\") indicating minimization and reluctance to fully acknowledge the severity.\n- Information flow: Responses tend to be short and somewhat guarded, with limited elaboration, reflecting potential discomfort or an attempt to underestimate symptoms.\n- Response style: Answers are concise, with qualifiers that diminish the perceived severity, and tend to avoid detailed specifics \u2014 likely to appear more in control.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of vague, non-specific language and qualifiers suggests intentional or unconscious withholding of full severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying hallucinations as \"kinda\" and expressing uncertainty about normalcy imply an effort to minimize distress or avoid appearing overly troubled.\n- Amplification patterns: Minimal; there is no evidence of exaggeration; responses seem subdued.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but the hedging implies possible discomfort or shame.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about timing and frequency hints at some difficulty with precise recall, but not definitively.\n- Family influence: Not indicated.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Moderate **minimization**, as the patient softens the impact of symptoms and hesitates to provide detailed information.\n- Severity: Moderate, since symptoms are acknowledged but under-characterized, potentially hiding true severity.\n- Areas most affected: Functional impact and symptom severity are likely underestimated, affecting clinical understanding.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses suggest some degree of underreporting but are not entirely untrustworthy.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The full extent of hallucinations, their frequency, and impact on sleep and daily functioning.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The distress, impairment, and possibly dangerous behaviors (e.g., self-harm risk during episodes) are underestimated.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient may over-focus on normal variances or be overly cautious, but this appears less prominent here.\n- True timeline: The escalation and severity may be more acute or profound than described, considering the tendencies for minimization and vagueness in responses.",

    "input": "A 28-year-old male reports experiencing visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving and sensations of being watched, which began abruptly last night and have persisted since then. He indicates these hallucinations are mainly at night and are disrupting his sleep and focus. Although he minimizes the severity and impact, his guarded communication style suggests that the symptoms may be more frequent and distressing than he admits. He also reports recent recreational drug use, though he downplays its significance. No additional symptoms are explicitly disclosed, but further assessment is necessary to explore possible auditory hallucinations, paranoid thoughts, mood disturbances, and overall safety. The clinical picture indicates a recent onset of distressing hallucinations likely influenced or exacerbated by substance use, with potential additional psychiatric features that are currently underreported due to communication biases.1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The patient reports recent recreational drug use with an abrupt onset of visual hallucinations\u2014including shadows and being watched\u2014which are common features of intoxication or withdrawal states involving substances like cannabis, hallucinogens, stimulants, or synthetic drugs. The symptoms' initiation last night and their nocturnal occurrence align with typical intoxication effects, especially considering recent substance use. The guarded communication may mask the true severity, and substance use is a strong clue supporting this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform)\nJustification: While the sudden onset post-drug use suggests a substance trigger, the persistent hallucinations and sensory disturbances could indicate an emerging primary psychotic disorder. The fact that hallucinations are vivid, ongoing, and not clearly linked to ongoing intoxication leaves room for this diagnosis, especially if substance use continues or if symptoms persist after clearance.\n3. Diagnosis: Sleep-Related Hallucinations (Hypnagogic or Hypnopompic)\nJustification: The hallucinations are primarily at night and involve shadow figures and sensations of being watched, which could represent sleep-related phenomena. However, the ongoing alertness and the description suggest these may be more than typical night terrors or hypnagogic states, especially given the patient's concern and the recent onset, making this less likely but worth consideration.\n4. Diagnosis: Paranoid or Anxiety-Related Psychosis\nJustification: The sensation of being watched and shadows could reflect paranoid ideation, often seen in anxiety disorders or in early stages of psychosis. Yet, without other signs of paranoia or anxiety symptoms, this is lower probability but remains in differential diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Organic Brain Cause (e.g., Temporal Lobe Seizures or Neurocognitive Disorder)\nJustification: The abrupt onset of hallucinations could also suggest an underlying neurological issue, such as focal seizures affecting visual perception or an early neurocognitive process. Nonetheless, the lack of focal neurological findings and temporal relation to recent drug use make this less probable here but still a relevant consideration if symptoms persist or other features emerge.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient predominantly uses vague, minimizing phrases (\"probably nothing,\" \"kind of messing with my head,\" \"not a big deal\") which obscure the full severity of symptoms and substance use.\n- Information flow: They tend to be reluctant and guarded, providing brief, non-specific responses that limit detailed disclosure especially on sensitive topics like substance use and hallucinations.\n- Response style: Responses are minimal and somewhat deflective, avoiding elaboration, with a tendency to downplay symptoms and activities related to their condition.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Consistent downplaying of symptoms and substance use, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose the impact or frequency.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of language like \"probably nothing,\" \"not that bad,\" and \"not a big deal\" indicates active downplaying of symptom severity.\n- Amplification patterns: No evidence of exaggeration; responses suggest underreporting rather than overstatement.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Subtle cues like avoiding detailed descriptions or using non-specific language imply discomfort or shame in fully discussing issues.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence there, responses are consistent but vague, possibly to avoid revealing confusion or insecurity.\n- Family influence: Not directly indicated, but the guarded responses may reflect concern about judgment from others or clinicians.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as the patient intentionally or unconsciously downplays the symptoms and substance use.\n- Severity: Moderate, since key information is underreported but some acknowledgment of symptoms exists.\n- Areas most affected: Substance use history and the severity and impact of hallucinations, which are likely more intense or frequent than reported.\n- Reliability: Limited; their self-report should be interpreted cautiously, considering their tendency to minimize and avoid full disclosure.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The actual frequency and severity of hallucinations and substance use, which are probably worse than reported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The extent of psychotic features and substance use severity, risking underestimating clinical urgency.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their reluctance and minimizations may cause clinicians to underestimate the danger of ongoing psychosis or relapse.\n- True timeline: Symptoms and substance use may have been ongoing and escalating beyond their brief account, affecting prognosis and treatment planning with potential underestimation if relying solely on these responses.",

    "input": "The patient is a 28-year-old male presenting with reports of visual hallucinations, primarily shadows and sensations of being watched, which he states began abruptly last night and have persisted since. These hallucinations occur mainly at night and have disrupted his sleep and concentration. He reports recent recreational drug use over the past several days but minimizes its significance, suggesting possible influence on his current symptoms. Communication biases indicate that the actual severity, frequency, and impact of these hallucinations may be underreported. No additional symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, mood changes, or paranoid ideation were disclosed, though further assessment is necessary to identify potential underlying psychiatric conditions or safety concerns.1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The recent recreational drug use combined with abrupt onset of visual hallucinations primarily at night suggests a substance-induced etiology. Many recreational substances, including hallucinogens or stimulants, can cause acute psychotic reactions manifesting as visual hallucinations. The lack of other psychotic symptoms and the temporal relationship support this diagnosis as most probable.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychiatric Disorder (Brief Psychotic Disorder)\nJustification: Although less likely given the abrupt onset without prior psychiatric history, new-onset psychosis can occur idiopathically or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. The absence of previous symptoms or mood disturbances reduces likelihood, but it remains a differential, especially if substance effects are ruled out.\n3. Diagnosis: Delirium (Secondary to Substance or Other Underlying Cause)\nJustification: The visual hallucinations occurring abruptly, especially at night, could indicate delirium; however, core features such as fluctuation of consciousness or widespread cognitive deficits are not described, making this less probable but still worth consideration if other signs develop.\n4. Diagnosis: Neurological Causes (e.g., Occipital Lobe Lesion)\nJustification: Visual hallucinations can occur with occipital lobe pathology, but the sudden, isolated onset starting overnight and associated with drug use make this less likely without additional neurological signs or deficits present.\n5. Diagnosis: Sleep-Related Hallucinations or Parasomnias\nJustification: While hallucinations at night can occur in sleep disorders, these are generally associated with sleep paralysis or narcolepsy. The persistence over the night and the patient's report suggest a more active psychopathological process rather than a sleep disorder, but considering sleep-related causes allows comprehensive differential.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices are predominantly vague and minimization-laden, with phrases like \"probably just messing with my head\" and \"nothing,\" indicating an attempt to downplay seriousness.
