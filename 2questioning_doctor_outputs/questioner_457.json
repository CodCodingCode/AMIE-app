    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (most likely viral) Justification: Common, presents with redness, tearing, and swelling; onset after activity is typical; usually bilateral and associated with recent activity or exposure.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body or abrasion Justification: Recent physical activity increases risk; symptoms of redness, tearing, and discomfort are consistent; trauma mechanism supports this.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are typical; however, swelling is less prominent unless allergic reaction is severe; less likely without prior allergy history.  4. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Blepharitis causes eyelid swelling and redness; though usually chronic, acute exacerbation can occur; recent activity less directly related.  5. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness involve eyelid tissues; severe cases may cause swelling after trauma; less likely without systemic signs.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: More serious, causes eyelid swelling, redness, pain, possibly proptosis; associated with recent trauma or infection; red flag diagnosis.  7. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Presents with redness and tearing; however, typically associated with pain, visual disturbance, and mid-dilated pupil; less likely here.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes redness, tearing, and discomfort; often associated with pain and photophobia; less likely without visual or systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: May cause redness and tearing; typically presents with a corneal lesion and pain; less probable without vesicular skin lesions.  10. Diagnosis: Acute dacryocystitis Justification: Swelling near medial eyelid, tearing; often associated with infection of lacrimal sac; less likely without warmth or discharge.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Marcus tends to use emotionally charged and somewhat vague language, such as \"stuff,\" \"things,\" \"shadows,\" and \"losing it,\" which reflects his distress and difficulty in precise articulation. His repeated emphasis on fear and losing control shows emotional overtones overshadowing clinical precision. - Information flow: His responses are somewhat scattered and elaborative, providing key details but often drifting into tangential expressions of fear and hopelessness. This indicates an attempt to communicate his suffering but with disorganized structure. - Response style: He is largely forthcoming about his symptoms but tends to ramble or interject emotional concerns, thus making his responses appear unorganized and exaggerated, especially when describing severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of deliberate withholding, but the vague language may indicate discomfort or difficulty in articulating specifics. He may be reluctant to discuss certain thoughts or feelings outright, preferring general descriptions. - Minimization behaviors: Not significantly evident; he openly reports hearing voices and seeing shadows, suggesting he perceives these as severe and warrants attention. - Amplification patterns: He appears to amplify the distress by emphasizing the voices, shadows, and fears of losing control, likely driven by his anxiety. The repeated emphasis on losing it could inflate perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Possible subtle discomfort when discussing his symptoms; however, emotional distress seems more prominent. He doesn't show overt shame but may avoid deeper discussion of personal history. - Confusion/memory issues: Occasional disorganized speech and difficulty articulating thoughts point to cognitive disarray but no clear evidence of memory lapses unrelated to psychosis. - Family influence: Mention of family history may influence his perception of illness but doesn't appear to distort his responses directly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The most prominent bias is emotional amplification, where his intense fear and paranoia lead to overstatement of current symptoms, especially regarding losing control and danger. - Severity: Moderate to severe \u2014 his high distress levels inflate symptom perception, yet he reports tangible hallucinations and paranoia, indicating actual symptom presence. - Areas most affected: His perception of hallucinations and paranoid ideation are most biased, likely exaggerated by fear. - Reliability: Self-report should be interpreted with caution; emotional overload may lead to overreporting, but his descriptions align with clinical findings. Cross-verification with objective measures is recommended.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He may be withholding specific insights into his level of functioning, thoughts of intent, or detailed history of previous episodes. He might understate his coping ability or previous control. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of disorganized thinking or potential impulsivity might be underreported if he fears stigma or judgment. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about harming himself or others are likely magnified by his current emotional state; these worries may be more wishful fears rather than imminent risk. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have escalated recently, but emotional distress may have created an exaggerated sense of deterioration. The progression might be more gradual than described, with recent stressors exacerbating existing symptoms.  Overall, Marcus's communication is heavily influenced by his emotional state, with tendencies toward overemphasizing fears and symptoms, and some degree of disorganized expression that warrants careful clinical interpretation.",

    "input": "The patient, presumed adult, presents with complaints of persistent auditory hallucinations involving voices, visual disturbances characterized by shadows, and paranoid delusional thoughts about surveillance and being watched. These symptoms cause significant distress and impair concentration, with the patient fearing loss of control and potential harm to self or others. Communication indicates high emotional engagement, which may lead to exaggeration of symptom severity; thus, actual symptom intensity might be somewhat less severe than reported. The clinical picture suggests true psychotic phenomena, though further assessment is needed to determine the precise course, severity, and impact of these symptoms, as well as additional features such as mood, cognition, and insight.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The presence of persistent auditory hallucinations, visual shadows, and paranoid delusions aligns with a primary psychotic disorder, most likely schizophrenia given the duration (persisting symptoms) and impact. This is the most common cause of such symptoms in adults without additional medical or substance-related clues.  2. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder Justification: The combination of psychotic symptoms with mood disturbance is typical; however, no mood symptoms are explicitly reported, making this less likely but still a critical differential.  3. Diagnosis: Brief psychotic disorder Justification: Symptoms are persistent, but if they had a sudden onset and brief duration (<1 month), this would be plausible; however, ongoing distress suggests otherwise.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis Justification: Toxins or drugs like stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine) could cause hallucinations and paranoia; absent history of substance use, but still consider given presentation.  5. Diagnosis: Organic brain disorder (e.g., tumor, neurodegenerative disease) Justification: Visual shadows and hallucinations could be signs of neurological illness; however, no neurological deficits are noted, making this less probable but important to consider.  6. Diagnosis: Delusional disorder Justification: Paranoid delusions alone without hallucinations are typical; hallucinations here argue more strongly for primary psychosis, so this is less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features Justification: Severe depression or mania can have psychosis, but no mood symptoms are reported, reducing likelihood.  8. Diagnosis: PTSD-related hallucinations Justification: Visual and auditory disturbances can occur but are typically related to trauma; absent trauma history in vignette makes this less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Dissociative or psychogenic disorder Justification: Usually involves different presentation; persistent hallucinations with strong paranoia point less toward this.  10. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder or other developmental disorder Justification: While hallucinations are not characteristic, some misinterpretations can occur, but unlikely given presentation.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Marcus primarily employs emotionally intense, distress-focused language (\"really scared,\" \"losing it,\" \"worried I might do something bad\"). His speech contains vivid sensory descriptions (\"voices,\" \"shadows\") that emphasize his perception of symptoms. There\u2019s limited use of clinical or neutral terminology, favoring more visceral expressions, which indicates an emotional, rather than purely factual, communication style. - Information flow: He tends to answer openly but with scattered, tangential comments, reflecting cognitive disorganization and anxiety. Responses are often lengthy and emotion-laden, with some repetition, suggesting difficulty in focusing or organizing thoughts, leading to a less precise flow of information. - Response style: His responses are elaborative but sometimes rambling, indicating a tendency to express distress verbally to seek validation or relief. His tendencies toward tangential or disorganized speech, especially when anxious, may obscure accuracy of symptom chronicity and severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There are no clear signs of withholding; Marcus appears open about his experiences, although his disorganized speech could hint at underlying cognitive interference. - Minimization behaviors: There's minimal evidence of symptom minimization; he emphasizes distress and paranoia strongly, implying he perceives his symptoms as severe. - Amplification patterns: He appears to amplify his distress and paranoia\u2014describing voices as \"always there,\" shadows as \"moving,\" and fearing self-harm or harm to others\u2014possibly exaggerating to communicate urgency and need for help. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs of shame or embarrassment; his tone appears openly distressed, though he might feel overwhelmed. - Confusion/memory issues: Yes, his disorganized, tangential speech and difficulty focusing suggest cognitive overload or memory impairment, consistent with acute psychosis. - Family influence: Mentions of family history relate more to background context than response bias; no evidence of external influence shaping current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias dominates; Marcus's emotional distress leads him to more strongly emphasize symptoms, possibly exaggerating their intensity and impact. - Severity: Moderate to severe; his vivid descriptions and high anxiety level suggest significant perceptual and cognitive distortions, but some descriptions may be colored by emotional distress. - Areas most affected: Paranoia, hallucinations, and agitation are most affected by bias, likely exaggerated due to anxiety and paranoid thoughts. - Reliability: Moderate; his emotional state impacts perceptual accuracy, so his self-report may overstate severity but still conveys genuine distress.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Potentially, he might be experiencing more subtle cognitive deficits or insight limitations he's unable to express but are affecting functioning. - Symptoms probably minimized: None evident; he's openly reporting severe symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of losing control and harming others may be exaggerated due to paranoia, influenced by anxiety. - True timeline: The reported recent escalation aligns with peak distress; however, the emotional amplification suggests the actual symptom severity could be somewhat less than described but still significant.  **Summary:** Marcus's communication is heavily emotionally charged, with clear signs of amplification of paranoia and distress owing to his anxiety. His disorganized speech indicates cognitive strain, possibly exacerbating the perception of symptom severity. The clinician should interpret these reports with an understanding that the emotional state influences the perception and reporting of symptoms, emphasizing the need to corroborate with behavioral observations and collateral information when possible.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The patient reports hallucinations and paranoia but needs more detail about the onset, duration, and the context of these experiences.

    "input": "The patient presents with psychotic symptoms including auditory hallucinations, visual shadows, and paranoia, with emotional distress likely amplifying perceived severity. Symptoms have been worsening over two months, although actual intensity may be less than reported. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify symptom specifics, insight, and risk factors.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The patient exhibits core features of psychosis\u2014auditory hallucinations, visual shadows, and paranoia\u2014that have been worsening over two months, fitting the typical course for schizophrenia. The emotional distress and potential insight suggest a primary psychotic disorder rather than substance-induced or mood disorder psychosis. The subacute but persistent progression aligns with diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.  2. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder Justification: Although less certain without mood symptoms detailed, the presence of prominent psychosis with emotional distress could suggest schizoaffective disorder if mood symptoms are present concurrently or intermittently. However, lacking specific mood disturbance information makes this less likely than schizophrenia but remains differential.  3. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: If the emotional distress is intense and mood symptoms (depression or mania) are present or overshadow the psychosis, this diagnosis could be considered. Currently, insufficient mood data limits its likelihood; nonetheless, it remains in the differential given distress and paranoia.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis Justification: Substance use (e.g., hallucinogens, stimulants) can cause psychotic symptoms. However, without supporting history of recent substance use, this is lower in probability but still possible, especially if undisclosed.  5. Diagnosis: Organic Brain Disorder (e.g., tumor, neurodegeneration) Justification: Visual shadows and paranoia could suggest neurological pathology. However, the pattern of symptoms over two months without focal neurological deficits or other neurological signs makes this less likely currently but warrants consideration if other features emerge.

His use of \"like\" and \"all mixed up\" reflects vagueness and attempts to verbalize internal chaos. There are no obvious minimizations, but his elaboration may serve to justify the severity of his distress. - Information flow: He tends to be forthcoming about symptoms, volunteering details about hallucinations and paranoia, but his responses are scattered and tangential, often jumping between ideas without clear structure. He appears eager to communicate his distress but sometimes struggles to focus on specific questions, highlighting disorganized thinking. - Response style: His answers are lengthy and detailed, which can be helpful but also reflect emotional overwhelm.

    "input": "The patient presents with ongoing psychotic features, including persistent auditory hallucinations and visual shadows, along with paranoid delusions regarding surveillance and being followed. These symptoms have been increasing over a period beginning approximately two months ago, with some indications they may have started earlier. The patient experiences emotional distress and a sense of disorganized thinking, with fears of losing control and harming themselves or others, though the severity of hallucinations and functional impact may be greater than reported. Communication biases suggest symptom underestimation and possible withholding of details linked to hallucination content and risk behaviors. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify symptom specifics, safety concerns, and the full course of illness.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The patient exhibits persistent auditory hallucinations, visual shadows, paranoid delusions, disorganized thinking, and emotional distress. Symptoms have been escalating over two months, suggesting a pattern consistent with a primary psychotic disorder. The combination of positive symptoms and disorganized thoughts aligns with schizophrenia. The symptoms are pervasive, lasting beyond a month, and involve multiple domains, supporting this diagnosis over brief psychotic episodes.  2. Diagnosis: Schizophreniform Disorder Justification: The duration of symptoms is approximately two months; if symptoms resolve within six months, this could be categorized as schizophreniform disorder. The clinical presentation overlaps significantly with schizophrenia but hasn't necessarily persisted beyond the initial illness phase, making this a potential alternative.  3. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder (Depressive or Bipolar Type) Justification: Although mood symptoms are not explicitly detailed, the possibility exists if mood episodes have occurred with psychotic features. Without evidence of mood episodes concurrent or prior to psychosis, this remains less likely but considered due to overlapping features.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: No information on substance use is provided. Still, in a real scenario, substances like stimulants or hallucinogens could produce similar psychotic features. Given current data, less likely but remains in differential if substance use is confirmed.  5. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: Less probable given the two-month duration and ongoing symptom escalation, as brief psychotic disorder typically lasts less than one month. Still, if symptoms resolve quickly, it could be considered; however, current evidence favors a longer course diagnosis.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional, distress-laden words like \"losing it,\" \"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" which amplify the perceived severity. Vague descriptors such as \"like,\" \"sort of,\" and \"kind of\" reduce specificity, possibly to avoid detailing the full extent of symptoms or due to discomfort. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat organized but include tangential, rambling segments\u2014especially when discussing fears\u2014indicating scattered thought patterns. They tend to elaborate when encouraged but also hold back certain details, likely to avoid shame or stigma. - Response style: They exhibit a mix of elaborative and hesitant speech. When discussing hallucinations or fears, responses are sometimes lengthy and expressive but occasionally disorganized or circular, reflecting internal distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Reluctance to specify symptom frequency or intensity, such as vague statements about hallucination occurrence (\"mostly at night\") and minimal elaboration on shadow experiences suggest attempts to minimize severity. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" or \"only\" when describing hallucinations may downplay distress, possibly to avoid stigma or shame. - Amplification patterns: Expressions like \"losing it\" and \"scared I might do something bad\" suggest exaggerated fears driven by paranoia or anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitancy or vagueness when discussing hallucinations and fears of harm, indicating possible shame or discomfort with these topics. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies in describing the timeline, such as not specifying exact dates or durations, point to cognitive disorganization likely influenced by emotional state. - Family influence: Mention of family history might subtly influence responses, though no direct evidence of external influence on current disclosures.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is a combination of minimization of symptom severity and amplification of fears of loss of control and harm, shaped by emotional distress, paranoia, and stigma. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given the emotional intensity, disorganized responses, and possible under-reporting of symptom severity. - Areas most affected: Hallucination frequency and impact, insight into symptom severity, and the consistency of their timeline are likely biased, affecting accurate clinical assessment. - Reliability: While their emotional expressions provide valuable insight, their responses are influenced by anxiety and possible shame, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may be underreporting the severity and frequency of hallucinations and paranoia, possibly minimizing their impact to avoid shame. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual intensity of hallucinations and disorganized thinking could be more profound; they may not fully disclose their level of distress or cognitive disorganization. - Concerns probably amplified: Fears of losing control and causing harm are likely exaggerated by anxiety, possibly intensifying their perception of risk beyond actual capabilities. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms might have been more rapid or severe than conveyed, considering the disorganized narrative and emotional distress impacting recall.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient has described hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking, but specific features of the hallucinations and delusions are somewhat vague. - To sharpen differential diagnoses, I need more precise info about the hallucinations (e.g., content, frequency, time of day, emotional impact). - Since symptoms could be more severe than reported, clarifying details about the content and any exacerbating factors is important. - The patient's communication style suggests possible minimization, so questions should gently probe for consistency and symptom impact without leading. - Given the two-month duration, exploring whether mood symptoms are present or have occurred concurrently could help differentiate schizoaffective disorder. - Clarifying the timeline, triggers, and course of symptoms will help determine if this is an ongoing disorder or a recent episode.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused question targeting hallucination details: content, timing, emotional response. - Confirmatory questions about delusions or paranoia related to surveillance or harm. - Inquire about presence of mood symptoms, triggers, or substances. - Gentle, specific questions to address possible underreporting and ensure accurate symptom picture.\nANSWER: Marcus, you mentioned hearing voices and seeing shadows, and I want to understand more about what these experiences are like for you. Can you tell me, do the voices or shadows happen more at some times of day, like at night or when you're feeling upset? Also, what do the voices usually say or talk about\u2014are they related to you or other people? And how do these experiences make you feel emotionally, for example, scared, angry, or confused? This will help us understand how these symptoms affect you daily.",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional, distress-laden words like \"losing it,\" \"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" which amplify the perceived severity.

    "input": "The patient is an adult male presenting with ongoing psychotic symptoms including persistent auditory hallucinations and visual shadows, which tend to worsen during nighttime and periods of anxiety. He reports feelings of disorganized thinking and emotional distress, with fears of losing control and potential self-harm or harm to others. His descriptions suggest these symptoms are more frequent and severe than he explicitly states, potentially minimizing their impact and avoiding detailed disclosure. The timing indicates a gradual onset over the past two months, with possible earlier subtle signs. Overall, the clinical picture indicates a moderate to severe psychotic disorder, necessitating further detailed assessment of hallucination content, safety concerns, and functional impact, considering the likelihood of underreporting.Schizophrenia ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Marcus employs emotional, vague, and somewhat disorganized language such as \"like,\" \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" which hampers precise understanding. He frequently uses fear-based descriptors, e.g., \"I\u2019m losing it,\" \"I might do something bad,\" showing distress but without detailed specifics. - Information flow: His responses are somewhat scattered, providing core details but with interruptions and tangents (\"it\u2019s like my mind is all jumbled\"). He responds with some reluctance to specifics but offers enough to suggest symptoms are worse now. - Response style: Responses tend to be lengthy but disorganized, indicating difficulty in structuring thoughts; this pattern suggests emotional overwhelm, especially when discussing sensitive topics like hallucinations and paranoia.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Marcus seems hesitant to fully detail the content and frequency of his hallucinations, possibly to avoid embarrassment or because of fear of seeming \"crazy.\" His vague references imply a withholding of the full extent of his experiences. - Minimization behaviors: While openly acknowledging hallucinations, he downplays their severity (e.g., \"sometimes,\" \"like shadows moving\") which may understate how distressing or frequent they are. - Amplification patterns: His repeated emphasis on losing control and fearing harm (\"scared I might do something bad or hurt myself or others\") suggests an amplification of worst-case scenarios driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Indirect language about his mental state (\"I think I need help because I\u2019m losing it\") indicates possible shame or reluctance to fully disclose the depth of his symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: The mention of his thoughts being \"all jumbled\" and difficulty in describing the timeline suggest some cognitive disorganization, affecting clarity and recall. - Family influence: The history of schizophrenia in his mother may contribute to internalized paranoia and reinforce fears, influencing responses to symptoms and their perceived severity.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be amplification due to anxiety-driven paranoia, combined with some minimization of detailed symptom content to protect himself emotionally. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his responses show genuine distress but are clouded by anxiety and disorganized speech, making it hard to fully assess symptom severity. - Areas most affected: His description of hallucinations and paranoia is most biased, likely exaggerated by anxiety, while his account of insight into his condition may be somewhat minimized. - Reliability: His self-report offers valuable insight but is likely influenced by emotional distress and cognitive disorganization, limiting full objectivity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the exact frequency, content, and context of hallucinations/shadows may be under- or over-represented; he may also hide the full extent of paranoia or agitation. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might be downplaying how severe his hallucinations or paranoia are, especially as he avoids specific details. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about losing control and hurting others are likely amplified by his anxiety, not necessarily reflective of current reality. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have worsened over the last two months, which aligns with the patient\u2019s report, but his emotional distress may cause him to perceive things as more severe or imminent than they objectively are.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: While Marcus has described hallucinations and shadows, I need to confirm the detailed content, frequency, and triggers, especially to distinguish among different psychotic diagnoses. I also want to assess his insight and whether he recognizes these as symptoms, which influences diagnosis and treatment approach. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm whether his hallucinations are true positive auditory and visual hallucinations consistent with schizophrenia, and rule out other causes like mood disorder with psychosis or substance effects. - Patient factors: His vague and emotionally loaded descriptions suggest he might be reluctant to disclose severity or specifics. Questions should be gentle, validating, and framed collaboratively to reduce defensiveness and elicit more detailed responses. - Interview phase goals: Clarify symptom content and impact, assess insight, and identify any red flags like increased agitation, risk, or cognitive issues that might affect diagnosis or safety planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about the specific features of hallucinations and shadows, their content, and timing. Also open-ended questions to explore his understanding and emotional reactions, alongside confirmatory queries about diagnostic criteria. - Information target: Frequency, content, emotional response, insight, safety concerns, and functional impact. - Communication approach: Use collaborative language, hypothetical or confirmatory phrasing, and reassure him about normalcy of discussing these symptoms to facilitate openness. - Expected value: Gather critical details to confirm or refute the diagnosis of schizophrenia, ensure safety, and prepare for treatment discussion with a clear understanding of his symptom profile.\nANSWER: \"Marcus, based on what you've shared so far, I\u2019d like to ask a few specific questions to understand more about these experiences. Can you tell me, how often do you hear voices or see shadows on any given day or week? Are they more present in certain situations or times, like at night or when you're feeling really anxious? When you hear the voices, what do they usually say? Are they talking to you directly, or about other people? Do you recognize that these are your experiences, or do you sometimes feel they might be real outside your mind? Also, how do these experiences affect your feelings\u2014do they make you scared, angry, or confused? It\u2019s important for us to understand exactly what you\u2019re going through so we can decide what\u2019s best for you moving forward.\"",
