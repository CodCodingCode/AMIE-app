Diagnosis: Hypertensive crisis (Hypertensive emergency or urgency)  \nJustification: The presence of pounding headaches and dizziness suggests elevated blood pressure, which could represent a hypertensive crisis causing neurological symptoms like headache and visual disturbances.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura  \nJustification: Headaches with visual disturbances and dizziness are characteristic of migraines, especially if episodic and associated with visual symptoms.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)  \nJustification: The slight weakness and dizziness could indicate transient cerebrovascular insufficiency, especially in a woman over 50.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Hypertensive retinopathy or other ocular pathology  \nJustification: Blurry vision and headaches in a hypertensive patient can relate to hypertensive ocular changes affecting vision.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Brain tumor or mass lesion (e.g., meningioma, glioma)  \nJustification: New-onset headaches, visual symptoms, and weakness could be caused by increased intracranial pressure from a mass lesion.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Intracranial hemorrhage or vascular malformation  \nJustification: Sudden pounding headaches and neurologic symptoms suggest possible hemorrhagic stroke or vascular malformation.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Cervical or intracranial vascular pathology (e.g., carotid stenosis, vertebral artery disease)  \nJustification: Dizziness and visual changes could be related to compromised blood flow due to vascular pathology.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus with possible microvascular complications  \nJustification: Blurry vision and neurological symptoms are common in diabetic microvascular disease, especially in middle-aged women.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disease  \nJustification: Although less common at this age, MS can present with optic disturbances and weakness, sometimes with vascular-like headaches.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Central nervous system infection (e.g., meningitis/encephalitis)  \nJustification: Headaches and neurological symptoms could suggest an infectious etiology, especially if other risk factors exist, though less likely in the absence of fever.\n\nANSWER:\n1.

Migraine with aura  \nJustification: The patient's episodic headaches accompanied by intermittent visual changes suggest migraine, especially if visual disturbances like blurry vision are associated with headaches.\n\n2. Tension-type headache  \nJustification: Persistent headaches are common in tension-type headaches, though they typically lack associated neurological symptoms like visual changes or weakness.\n\n3. Normal pressure hydrocephalus  \nJustification: Can cause headache, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive changes; some features might overlap with her symptoms, though less common at age 52.\n\n4. Brain tumor (such as meningioma or glioma)  \nJustification: Persistent headaches, visual disturbances, and neurological symptoms like weakness could indicate a space-occupying lesion increasing intracranial pressure or affecting specific brain regions.\n\n5. Hypertension-related headache  \nJustification: Elevated blood pressure can cause persistent headaches and visual changes; worth considering if hypertensive.\n\n6. Intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)  \nJustification: Common in women of her age, presenting with headache, visual disturbances, and sometimes nausea, often without a mass lesion.\n\n7. Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis)  \nJustification: Headache and visual symptoms in women over 50 raise suspicion; can cause ischemic optic neuropathy leading to visual disturbances.\n\n8. Occipital neuralgia  \nJustification: Causes persistent headache and sometimes associated visual symptoms, though less likely with nausea or weakness.\n\n9. Stroke or transient ischemic attack  \nJustification: Weakness and visual changes could suggest cerebrovascular pathology involving posterior circulation.\n\n10. Multiple sclerosis  \nJustification: Can present with neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances and weakness, especially if with relapsing episodes; though less common at her age without other features.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Migraine with aura \u2013 due to episodic headaches with visual disturbances and nausea.\n2. Tension-type headache \u2013 given persistent headache symptoms.\n3. Brain tumor (e.g., meningioma or glioma) \u2013 considering persistent symptoms and neurological deficits.\n4. Intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) \u2013 common in women over 50 with headache and visual symptoms.\n5. Temporal arteritis \u2013 given her age and headache with visual changes, risk of ischemic optic neuropathy.\n6. Stroke or posterior circulation ischemia \u2013 due to her weakness and visual disturbances.\n7.

Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The patient reports persistent, severe headaches with associated visual disturbances (flickering vision), which are characteristic of migraine with aura. Nausea and unilateral head pain support this consideration.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Tension Headache\nJustification: Chronic headache that is persistent and bilateral or unilateral, often associated with fatigue and stress, could be a component. However, the visual symptoms and neurological signs make this less likely as the sole diagnosis.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Episodic or Chronic Primary Headache Disorder\nJustification: Ongoing headache episodes that impact daily life with associated symptoms warrant considering primary headache syndromes such as cluster or chronic daily headaches.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: The presence of unilateral weakness and visual changes, especially in a woman over 50, raises suspicion for cerebrovascular events affecting the brain regions responsible for motor control and vision.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Brain Tumor (e.g., Glioma or Meningioma)\nJustification: Gradual onset of persistent unilateral headaches, new neurological deficits like weakness, and visual disturbances raise concern for a space-occupying lesion compressing or infiltrating brain tissue.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Intracranial Mass or Lesion causing Increased Intracranial Pressure\nJustification: Persistent headaches, visual symptoms, and fatigue could result from increased intracranial pressure, possibly due to a mass lesion.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The intermittent neurological deficits such as weakness and visual changes, especially in a woman in her 50s, indicate possible demyelinating disease like MS, which can cause episodic neurological symptoms.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Hypertensive Encephalopathy or Hypertensive Crisis\nJustification: Elevated blood pressure can cause headaches, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits, though no hypertension history is provided yet.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)\nJustification: This vasculitis affects older women, causing persistent headaches, visual symptoms (especially flickering vision), and possibly systemic symptoms like fatigue, and requires prompt diagnosis.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Sinusitis or Sinus Migraine\nJustification: While sinus issues can cause unilateral headaches and facial pain, the neurological deficits and visual disturbances suggest a more central pathology, but sinusitis remains in differential consideration.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Migraine with Aura \u2013 due to visual disturbances, nausea, and unilateral headache pattern.\n2. Tension Headache \u2013 considering lifelong or persistent headache, though less likely given neurological signs.\n3. Stroke or TIA \u2013 possible given unilateral weakness, visual changes, and age.\n4. Brain Tumor \u2013 symptom progression and focal deficits suggest intracranial mass lesion.\n5. Intracranial Mass / Increased Intracranial Pressure \u2013 headache and neurological symptoms support this possibility.\n6. Multiple Sclerosis \u2013 episodic neurological symptoms and visual disturbances align with demyelinating disease.\n7. Temporal Arteritis \u2013 age-related vasculitis causing headaches and visual complaints.\n8. Hypertensive Crisis \u2013 considering possibility if hypertension is confirmed.\n9. Sinusitis \u2013 differential diagnosis for unilateral headache with facial pain.\n10. Cluster or Primary Headache Disorder \u2013 persistent headaches, though neurological signs make this less primary.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient reports frequent, persistent headaches localized to the right side with occasional visual disturbances like flickering vision, which are characteristic features of migraines, particularly with aura. The intermittent nausea also supports this diagnosis. Migraines often cause associated neurological symptoms such as visual changes and can progressively impact daily functioning.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Chronic tension headaches are common in middle-aged women and can present as persistent, bilateral or unilateral headache, often described as a dull, pressing pain. Though less likely given the unilateral and visual symptoms, tension headaches can co-exist or mimic features, especially if stress or muscular tension is involved.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or minor cerebrovascular event\nJustification: The presence of intermittent visual disturbances, new-onset weakness in the left hand, and persistent headaches may suggest cerebrovascular insufficiency or TIA, especially considering the patient's age. TIAs often produce neurological deficits that resolve or fluctuate and require urgent evaluation.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating disorder\nJustification: The neurological symptoms, such as intermittent unilateral visual disturbances and weakness, could be attributable to demyelinating processes like MS, which typically cause relapsing neurological deficits in young to middle-aged adults. Fatigue and intermittent symptoms are also characteristic.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Neurovascular or intracranial pathology (e.g., intracranial mass, tumor, or vascular lesion)\nJustification: The persistent, unilateral headaches with neurological deficits and visual symptoms could be caused by an underlying intracranial mass or vascular abnormality (like an aneurysm or tumor). The progressive nature and new neurological findings increase concern for structural brain pathology.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications as above:\n1.

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient is a 52-year-old woman presenting with recent symptoms including frequent, persistent headaches lasting most of the day, especially on the right side; intermittent nausea; occasional blurry or flickering vision during worse headaches; increased weakness in her left hand affecting daily activities; and ongoing fatigue. She reports that symptoms have come on gradually and seem to be worsening over time.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Brain Tumor (e.g., Glioma or Meningioma)\nJustification: The patient's gradual onset of persistent, often unilateral headaches (right-sided), accompanied by neurological deficits such as weakness in the left hand, visual disturbances (flickering or blurry vision), and intermittent nausea suggests a mass effect within the brain. The progression over time and worsening symptoms align with a slow-growing intracranial lesion. The localization hints at possible cortical or adjacent mass affecting motor pathways and visual cortex areas.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The episodic nature of neurological symptoms\u2014such as weakness and visual disturbances\u2014is characteristic of demyelinating processes. MS often presents with relapsing-remitting neurological deficits often affecting motor function and vision. However, the gradual worsening might challenge this, but early MS can sometimes show insidious progression or ongoing subclinical activity.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: Headaches predominantly on one side with episodes of visual aura (flashing lights or flickering vision) and nausea are classic features of migraines with aura. However, the persistent and progressive neurological deficits (weakness, vision issues) are less typical unless a migraine complication or secondary process is suspected.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: The neurological deficits, especially weakness and vision changes, could represent ischemic events. However, the gradual progression over time is atypical for classic stroke or TIA, which usually have sudden onset, unless this indicates a slowly evolving ischemic process or small vessel disease.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Cerebral Vasculitis or Other Inflammatory/Autoimmune Conditions\nJustification: Some autoimmune or vasculitic conditions can cause ongoing neurological symptoms, including headaches, visual disturbances, and weakness, due to inflammation of cerebral vessels. The gradual worsening and multi-modal symptoms fit this pattern, especially if supported by systemic signs or lab findings.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications as above.\n1. Brain tumor (glioma or meningioma): The insidious, progressive neurological deficits with unilateral headaches and visual symptoms strongly suggest a mass lesion causing mass effect and local infiltration.\n2. Multiple sclerosis: The neurological deficits and visual disturbances could be due to demyelination, especially if episodes are recurrent, although the progression over time is less typical, still worth considering.\n3. Migraine with aura: The characteristic headache and visual aura align with migraine pathology, though persistent neurological deficits are less typical unless complicated.\n4. Stroke or small vessel ischemic disease: The focal weakness and visual symptoms could reflect ischemic injury, particularly if risk factors are present, though the gradual progression may argue against a classic event.\n5. Cerebral vasculitis or other inflammatory process: Chronic inflammation causing neurological impairment is feasible, especially if other systemic features or labs suggest an autoimmune etiology.\n\nFurther investigations\u2014brain MRI with contrast, blood tests (including autoimmune markers), and possibly lumbar puncture\u2014are essential to differentiate these conditions and confirm the diagnosis.",

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient is a 52-year-old woman with recent onset of symptoms including frequent, persistent headaches mostly on the right side that last most of the day; intermittent nausea; occasional blurred or flickering vision during worse headaches; increased weakness in her left hand affecting her ability to perform daily activities; and persistent fatigue. She reports that these symptoms have developed gradually over time and are progressively worsening, with some days better than others.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumor (e.g., meningioma, glioma)\nJustification: The gradually progressive, persistent unilateral headaches paired with visual disturbances and new-onset weakness suggest a mass lesion exerting local pressure or infiltration within the brain. The focal weakness, especially in the left hand, indicates a possible lesion in the right motor cortex. The patient's age and symptom progression make a tumor highly plausible, particularly a meningioma or glioma affecting areas related to visual processing and motor control.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: MS commonly presents in women around this age with episodic neurological symptoms that can become persistent over time. The unilateral headache is less characteristic but might be related to demyelinating lesions causing localized nerve irritation or optic neuritis. The intermittent visual disturbances, along with the progressive weakness, could reflect demyelination affecting the optic pathways and motor pathways. Fatigue and symptom progression align with MS, which often exhibits relapsing-remitting or progressive courses.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Intracranial Venous Sinus Thrombosis\nJustification: The persistent headache worse on the right side, along with visual changes and nausea, raises concern for increased intracranial pressure. This condition often presents with headache, nausea, visual disturbances, and sometimes focal neurological symptoms. Its subacute or gradual onset, especially in women with possible prothrombotic risk factors, makes it a relevant differential, although less common without risk factors.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Hypertensive or Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease\nJustification: The unilateral headache, new weakness, and visual symptoms could be linked to a cerebrovascular event, especially if blood pressure is elevated or if she has vascular risk factors. The gradual worsening suggests a possible small vessel ischemic process or hypertensive encephalopathy. The focal neurological deficit (left hand weakness) is consistent with a cerebrovascular cause affecting the right motor cortex or subcortical pathways.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura (Chronic Migraine)\nJustification: The patient's headache history, visual flickering or blurring, nausea, and fatigue could be consistent with chronic migraine, especially if episodes are recurrent and episodic with progressive fatigue. However, the persistent nature and associated weakness make this less likely as the primary diagnosis but still worth considering, particularly if no other neurological deficits were identified.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1.

She reports that these symptoms have developed gradually over time and are progressively worsening, with some days better than others.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Likely Medial Scleral or Optic Nerve Sinus Involvement pointing toward a diagnosis such as a giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) affecting ophthalmic vessels leading to ischemic optic neuropathy, or a compressive lesion like a tumor (e.g., meningioma) impacting the optic pathway and causing these progressive symptoms. The gradual onset of persistent headaches localized to one side, visual disturbances, and increasing weakness suggests a mass effect or vasculitic process. The persistent fatigue and progressively worsening symptoms further support a serious underlying condition impacting neurovascular structures. Given her age and symptomatology, giant cell arteritis is a high consideration. A mass or tumor compressing the optic nerves is also plausible. Additional investigations like temporal artery biopsy, MRI brain with contrast, ESR, CRP are necessary, but currently, the most probable diagnosis is a vasculitic process such as giant cell arteritis causing ischemia, or intracranial mass lesion.\n\nJustification: The patient's age and symptoms of persistent, severe unilateral headache, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits (left hand weakness) strongly suggest pathology involving intracranial or peri-arterial structures. The gradual progression and worsening over time favor an inflammatory or neoplastic process. The visual symptoms (blurring, flickering) combined with headache and weakness are characteristic of ischemic or compressive phenomena affecting the visual pathway and motor neurons. Sensory or other symptoms are not described, but the key features point toward a significant neurovascular or space-occupying lesion requiring urgent assessment.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No (additional diagnostics are necessary for confirmation)\n- No further clarification needed: No (more specific investigations are required to confirm diagnosis)\n\nANSWER:\nMost probable diagnosis: Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) with ischemic optic neuropathy or intracranial mass lesion such as a meningioma causing compressive symptoms.
