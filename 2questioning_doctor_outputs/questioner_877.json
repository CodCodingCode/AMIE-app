    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctival trauma (e.g., abrasion or irritation) Justification: Recent activity (soccer) with onset of redness, swelling, tearing suggests trauma-induced conjunctivitis or injury. Trauma is common with sports and accounts for acute unilateral eye redness and swelling.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are characteristic; viral is common and can follow exposure during sports. Usually mild and self-limited.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Presents with redness and swelling; may cause tearing. Less likely given the short duration and absence of purulent discharge, but still possible.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Common in young active individuals; causes redness and tearing, but often bilateral and associated with itching, which is not specified.  5. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma from playing soccer could cause a superficial corneal injury, leading to redness, tearing, and swelling; often painful, but not specified.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Presents with redness and tearing but usually associated with pain, photophobia, and decreased vision; less likely here due to brief onset after activity.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Causes eyelid swelling and redness, but usually associated with systemic signs like fever and pain on eye movement; no systemic symptoms are mentioned.  8. Diagnosis: Chalazion or hordeolum Justification: Causes eyelid swelling and redness but typically develops over weeks, less consistent with abrupt 2-day onset post-activity.  9. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Causes severe eye redness and pain, often worse at night; less likely without significant pain described.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Causes eye redness and pain, but typically presents with pain, halos, and increased intraocular pressure; no mention of pain or systemic symptoms.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged language (\"really scared,\" \"worried\") alongside specific symptom descriptions, indicating a blend of clinical concern and anxiety. She describes symptoms clearly but with emotional emphasis. - Information flow: She appears forthcoming about her core symptoms and concerns, providing organized, detailed responses, though her anxiety might lead to leaning heavily on emotional cues. - Response style: Generally elaborate, with detailed symptom descriptions. She occasionally seeks reassurance, evidencing her anxious temperament.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None clearly evident; she seems open. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her chest pain as \"just a dull ache,\" possibly minimizing discomfort to avoid alarm, or in her effort to remain strong. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated expressions of fear and worry may amplify her perceived danger, potentially leading her to overestimate the risk. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs; she openly discusses her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Timeline clarity suggests no significant confusion. - Family influence: Her mention of her father\u2019s heart attack suggests she perceives herself at higher risk, fueling her anxiety.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be reluctant to fully disclose episodes she perceives as less severe, or might omit brief, asymptomatic episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: She could understate the intensity of discomfort if she fears escalation, or if discomfort temporarily subsides. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about stroke and serious health consequences seem exaggerated relative to her actual clinical risk. - True timeline: The symptom progression appears consistent, but her fear may magnify her perception of worsening severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Given her current concern about her eye symptoms following recent activity, it\u2019s important to explore the details of what she\u2019s experiencing to differentiate among conjunctival trauma, conjunctivitis, or other ocular issues. - I need to gather more detail about her perception of the symptoms, their impact, and any associated sensations (pain, vision changes). - I want to encourage her to elaborate on her experience to build rapport and understand her perspective without leading her toward any particular diagnosis just yet. - Since her main concern seems to be her eyes and the recent onset, I will ask an open-ended question about her overall experience with these symptoms, focusing on her description, feelings, and any other associated factors.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise description of symptoms (pain, vision changes), possible other symptoms, and any prior eye issues. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether trauma, infection, or allergic causes are more likely based on her detailed account. - Patient factors: She appears expressive with detailed descriptions; my question should validate her experience while gently encouraging further elaboration. - Interview phase goals: To better understand how she perceives her symptoms, their progression, and functional impact, setting the stage for focused exploration later.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended. - Information target: Symptom description, timing, severity, associated sensations, and overall impact. - Communication approach: Gentle, supportive tone that invites her to share freely, respecting her emotional state. - Expected value: This will deepen understanding of her subjective experience, help confirm or rule out certain diagnoses, and build trust.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what you've been noticing with your eyes\u2014how they feel, what they look like, and how these symptoms have been affecting you day to day?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a three-week history of palpitations and dizziness, symptoms that have recently worsened. She reports experiencing eye sensations described as fluttering or blurry, though her descriptions are vague and potentially underreporting minor or intermittent visual disturbances. Her concern and focus are primarily on the cardiac symptoms, which appear to be prominent and distressing, likely consistent with episodes of irregular heartbeat and associated dizziness. The ocular complaints may be more frequent or severe than she indicates and could include transient visual phenomena such as flickering or light disturbances that are not fully disclosed. Anxiety appears to influence her perception and reporting, possibly amplifying severe symptoms and minimizing minor or temporary eye symptoms. Further assessment with detailed probing is necessary to clarify the full scope and nature of her ocular and cardiac symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular arrhythmia Justification: The primary symptoms of palpitations and dizziness over three weeks, with worsening, strongly suggest an arrhythmic cause. The patient's report of fluttering sensations aligns with irregular heartbeats, common in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, which are prevalent in adult females especially with age or cardiovascular risk factors.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety/panic disorder Justification: The patient's focus on symptoms and possible symptom amplification suggest a significant anxiety component, which can cause palpitations, dizziness, and perceived visual disturbances. Anxiety is common and may coexist or mimic cardiac arrhythmias.  3. Diagnosis: Vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension Justification: Dizziness related to episodes of arrhythmia or anxiety can be vasovagal in origin, especially if symptoms are positional or triggered by stress, though less likely given the three-week duration.  4. Diagnosis: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or transient vascular event Justification: The ocular sensations like blurring or flickering could indicate transient ischemic episodes affecting vision, especially if episodes are brief and associated with dizziness; however, no other neurological deficits are reported.  5. Diagnosis: Ocular or neurologic disorder (e.g., migraine aura) Justification: Visual disturbances may be due to migraines or other neuro-ophthalmic issues, particularly if the sensations are intermittent and stereotyped, though less likely as primary cause given prominence of cardiac symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Structural heart disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy) Justification: Could contribute to arrhythmia leading to symptoms, but less suspected initially without specific cardiac history or findings.  7. Diagnosis: Electrolyte abnormalities Justification: Electrolyte disturbances can precipitate arrhythmias causing palpitations and dizziness, though no specific evidence of such disturbances is provided.  8. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Anemia can cause dizziness and palpitations secondary to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity; less likely without other signs but still a consideration.  9. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism) Justification: Hyperthyroidism may cause palpitations, tremors, and ocular symptoms, but no evidence in this vignette.  10. Diagnosis: Medication or substance effects (e.g., stimulants) Justification: If applicable, certain substances can induce arrhythmias and visual disturbances, but no such history is given.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, emotionally charged language like \"really strange,\" \"fluttering,\" \"quivering,\" and \"dizzy,\" indicating she is quite aware of her symptoms but may also be affected by anxiety. When describing her eye sensations, she speaks vaguely (\"fluttering or maybe blurry\"), which could reflect uncertainty or an attempt to minimize less concerning issues. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer core symptoms promptly but shows some hesitance when discussing eye feelings, possibly to avoid dwelling on less certain or less severe issues. Her responses are mostly organized and focused, but her tone and gestures reveal emotional distress. - Response style: She is straightforward and detailed about severe symptoms, but her responses reveal tension and a desire for reassurance. She exhibits some hesitation when discussing minor or ambiguous symptoms, suggesting mild internal filtering of information.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitation and vagueness when describing eye symptoms suggest she might be hesitant to fully disclose minor or non-severe issues, possibly to avoid overcomplicating her presentation or due to uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Her vague description of eye sensations (\"fluttering or maybe blurry\") indicates she may be minimizing or unsure of these symptoms\u2019 significance. She emphasizes her cardiac symptoms, which she perceives as serious, but the eyes' symptoms are less emphasized. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes her fears and the severity of chest pain and dizziness, which she perceives as the most concerning. Her worry about strokes and the detailed description of symptoms reinforce her heightened concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There is no overt evidence of shame or embarrassment; her tone is anxious but open. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion, but some uncertainty in describing eye symptoms hints at mild ambiguity. - Family influence: Her mentioning her father's heart attack indicates awareness of familial risk, which might influence her health perceptions and anxiety levels.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate symptom minimization, especially regarding less specific symptoms like eye fluttering, due to uncertainty or perceived insignificance. - Severity: Moderate, since her main concern and vivid reporting are about serious symptoms, but some minor symptoms are understated or vague. - Areas most affected: The description of eye sensations and minor visual changes; these are minimized or described vaguely, possibly underreported. - Reliability: Her self-reporting of severe symptoms like chest pain and dizziness appears reliable, but minor symptoms should be interpreted cautiously as she may understate or mischaracterize them.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about less specific symptoms, such as eye fluttering, and any minor visual changes that she might not consider important. She may not fully disclose or recognize the significance of these symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Minor symptoms like eye fluttering or blurry vision may be downplayed, but they could be early or subtle signs of other issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about stroke and serious heart problems seem elevated, which could lead to heightened anxiety disproportionate to some of her actual symptoms. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms might have been more gradual over a longer period, but her recent worsening makes current severity appear more urgent. Her report suggests an awareness of recent change, but early symptoms may have been subtle and underreported.  In summary, her communication shows a pattern of openness regarding her primary concerns but some mild tendency to understate or be uncertain about minor or ambiguous symptoms, likely influenced by her anxiety and emotional distress.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Traumatic Foreign Body (e.g., eyelash, debris) Justification: The sudden onset of symptoms after playing soccer suggests possible trauma leading to foreign body deposition in the eye, provoking redness, swelling, and tearing. The close temporal relationship supports this initial suspicion, especially with physical activity that could cause a small object to enter the eye.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: It presents with redness and tearing, common in infectious or allergic conjunctivitis. Given the acute presentation and environmental exposure, conjunctivitis is common, although less likely to cause significant swelling without other systemic signs.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Sudden ocular symptoms following physical activity may be due to a corneal scratch, especially if the eye feels gritty or painful. This diagnosis is plausible because trauma during sports can cause superficial corneal injury, which presents with redness, tearing, and discomfort.  4. Diagnosis: Eyelid Contusion or Swelling Justification: The swelling and redness could be due to a direct impact injury causing eyelid hematoma or contusion, frequently seen in sports. This explains swelling and possible secondary conjunctivitis if the eyelid trauma irritates the eye.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely given the trauma history, allergies can cause redness and tearing. Still, the recent activity and trauma make this diagnosis lower priority but possible if symptoms persist or worsen without evidence of infection.

She sometimes minimizes (chest pain \"just a dull ache\") but also magnifies her concerns (fears about stroke, seriousness). Her communication reveals underlying anxiety impacting her reporting accuracy.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Occasional vagueness about symptom specifics; may be avoiding detailed descriptions of their frequency or severity, possibly due to fear or denial. - Minimization behaviors: Describes chest pain as \"just a dull ache,\" likely downplaying seriousness to avoid escalation or out of misunderstanding. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated expressions of worry, fear, and that symptoms are \"getting worse\" show emotional magnification, possibly overestimating the threat. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear indications, but initial concise responses may reflect discomfort with vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No obvious signs\u2014responses seem consistent. - Family influence: Awareness of her father's heart attack might heighten her anxiety, fueling exaggerated worries.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with eye redness, swelling, and tearing, which began approximately more than two days ago, potentially after playing sports. She reports intermittent sensations of fluttering, quivering, and blurriness in the eyes that can last from seconds to about a minute, occurring regardless of position. She also experiences palpitations and dizziness that started around three weeks prior, with recent increase in frequency. Although she minimizes the severity, clinical assessment suggests that her ocular symptoms\u2014including possible redness and mild discomfort\u2014may be more pronounced than she reports, and she may have additional symptoms such as pain, light sensitivity, or visual changes that are currently underdetected. Further evaluation of pain level, visual acuity, discharge, and impact on daily function is recommended to clarify the full clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Ocular migraine (visual migraine) Justification: The intermittent fluttering, quivering, and blurriness are characteristic of transient visual disturbances often seen in ocular migraines. Although she reports discomfort and redness, these can sometimes be associated with migraines or migraine equivalents. The symptoms can occur regardless of position and last seconds to minutes, aligning with typical aura phenomena, and her systemic symptoms like dizziness support a neurological or vascular dysregulation.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or allergic) Justification: The eye redness, swelling, and tearing are classic signs of conjunctivitis. If these symptoms follow recent physical activity or exposure, it could be an allergic or viral conjunctivitis. However, conjunctivitis alone does not explain the transient visual sensations, so it is likely a co-existing ocular surface issue.  3. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations and dizziness) Justification: Her systemic symptoms of palpitations and dizziness starting about three weeks ago and increasing suggest a potential underlying arrhythmic or autonomic dysregulation disorder, which may secondarily affect ocular blood flow or neural control, potentially contributing to her visual phenomena.  4. Diagnosis: Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., dysautonomia) Justification: The combination of systemic neurological symptoms (dizziness, palpitations) and ocular symptoms suggests a possible autonomic imbalance affecting multiple systems, including ocular circulation and neural control, exacerbating her visual symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Episodic benign intracranial hypertension or increased intracranial pressure Justification: Although less likely, symptoms of transient visual disturbances combined with ocular redness and swelling might reflect increased intracranial pressure affecting the optic nerve or ocular structures, especially if associated with systemic symptoms; however, there are no explicit signs of papilledema or headache described, so this is a lower-probability diagnosis.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and minimizing terms (\"just sort of happens,\" \"maybe a minute\"), which dilute the apparent gravity of her symptoms. Her emotional expressions (\"making me worried all the time\") reveal underlying concern. - Information flow: She responds openly to core symptom questions but adds extraneous details when probed, showing comfort in sharing basic info but some hesitance in elaborating further. - Response style: Her answers are relatively elaborated but contain qualifiers, indicating a degree of uncertainty and a tendency to soften or downplay.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she reports symptoms transparently but with qualifiers, possibly to avoid emphasizing severity. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" and \"maybe\" phrases suggests she may be downplaying the seriousness of her episodes. - Amplification patterns: No evidence of exaggeration; her expressed fears align with genuine concern over potential severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed. - Confusion/memory issues: Minimal; consistent reporting suggests good recall, though her uncertainty about exact duration hints at some difficulty in precise recall. - Family influence: Her mention of her father's heart attack demonstrates awareness of familial risk but doesn\u2019t appear to distort her current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as evidenced by her language choices and hesitance to directly quantify symptoms. - Severity: Mild, because her core symptoms are clearly communicated, but there is subtle downplaying. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and duration are most biased topics; may underreport how severe or frequent episodes are. - Reliability: Moderate; her core complaints are reliable, but some nuances regarding severity may be underestimated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true intensity, frequency, and impact of her episodes could be underestimated, risking underappreciation of severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be experiencing more persistent or severe episodes than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her expressed worry indicates genuine concern, possibly exaggerated by anxiety, but her actual medical risk may be less panic-inducing than perceived. - True timeline: Symptoms likely began around the reported time but may have escalated more rapidly or severely than she communicates, especially under emotional distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient's description of transient visual phenomena suggests episodes that are paroxysmal and episodic, characteristic of migraines, but the presence of ocular redness, swelling, and tearing indicates a possible surface pathology like conjunctivitis or inflammation. - She reports these symptoms happening \"just sort of happen\" with durations \"maybe a minute,\" indicating some uncertainty about timing and severity, and possibly minimizing effects. - To further differentiate between ocular migraine and conjunctivitis, I need details on associated symptoms such as pain, light sensitivity, discharge, and any correlation with systemic or ocular triggers. - Since systemic symptoms like palpitations and dizziness started earlier and have increased, exploring their relation to her ocular episodes could reveal autonomic or vascular contributions. - Clarification of the severity\u2014specifically whether her visual disturbances impair her function\u2014is essential for understanding the impact. - Her communication style, with qualifiers and minimalization, suggests I should phrase questions carefully to elicit accurate details without causing discomfort or defensiveness.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as evidenced by her language choices and hesitance to directly quantify symptoms. - Severity: Mild, because her core symptoms are clearly communicated, but there is subtle downplaying. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and duration are most biased topics; may underreport how severe or frequent episodes are. - Reliability: Moderate; her core complaints are reliable, but some nuances regarding severity may be underestimated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true intensity, frequency, and impact of her episodes could be underestimated, risking underappreciation of severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be experiencing more persistent or severe episodes than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her expressed worry indicates genuine concern, possibly exaggerated by anxiety, but her actual medical risk may be less panic-inducing than perceived. - True timeline: Symptoms likely began around the reported time but may have escalated more rapidly or severely than she communicates, especially under emotional distress.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with episodic ocular flickering and blurred vision lasting from seconds to approximately one minute, occurring regardless of positional changes. She reports concurrent palpitations and dizziness that began about three weeks ago, with increased frequency over time. She denies eye pain, light sensitivity, tearing, or ocular discharge during her current account. However, communication biases suggest her ocular and neurological symptoms may be more persistent or severe than she describes. Further detailed ophthalmologic and neurological evaluation is warranted to assess for underlying causes, and additional probing is needed to clarify the true extent of her visual and systemic symptoms.Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Cardiac Arrhythmia (e.g., paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague, hedging language (\"like,\" \"sort of,\" \"just\"), which diminishes perceived symptom severity. Her descriptions of visual symptoms are non-specific, potentially minimizing their importance or complexity. She displays some emotional language, indicating fear (\"I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s happening,\" \"I want to be honest\"), but coupled with minimization terms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to volunteer detailed information, offering only minimal responses unless specifically prompted. Her responses are organized but sparse, suggesting she filters or downplays details she considers less critical. - Response style: Responses tend to be concise and primarily answer direct questions without elaboration. She tends to avoid expanding on symptoms unless pressed, possibly to avoid eliciting concern or because of discomfort discussing her symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her minimal description of visual symptoms, use of vague language, and statement \"nothing I do seems to make it better or worse\" suggest inadvertent withholding of detailed symptomatology. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the significance of her visual flickers and the impact of symptoms, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the clinician, as seen in phrases like \"just, like\" and \"I don\u2019t really think.\" - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; her concern appears genuine but restrained. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her brief responses and hesitation could indicate discomfort or uncertainty about whether her symptoms are serious enough to warrant concern. - Confusion/memory issues: She appears clear about her experience but uncertain about durations (\"a few seconds,\" \"maybe a minute\"), consistent with avoiding overemphasis. - Family influence: Her mention of her father\u2019s heart attack indicates awareness of familial risks, but no evidence that her responses are overly influenced by family opinions or concerns.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization\u2014she appears to consciously or unconsciously downplay the severity and details of her symptoms, likely to reduce anxiety or fear. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her brief and vague responses suggest some underreporting, which could hinder thorough clinical assessment but does not seem intentionally deceptive. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of visual phenomena and their relationship to cardiac episodes; her tendency to not fully explain the duration, frequency, or context of symptoms limits clinical understanding. - Reliability: Her self-reporting may be somewhat reliable but incomplete; she is likely omitting details that are important for accurate diagnosis and management.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the true frequency, duration, and impact of her visual symptoms. She may also be underreporting episodes of dizziness or their severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: The seriousness of her visual flickers and their potential link to neurological events might be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her concern about her heart and worries about stroke are genuine but may overshadow the importance of exploring or describing other symptoms fully. - True timeline: Her symptom progression appears consistent but may be more severe or frequent than she reports, especially if she underestimates durations or dismisses mild episodes.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The key details missing are the true severity, frequency, and impact of her visual symptoms, as well as any possible associated neurological signs like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. Additionally, the connection between her ocular symptoms and systemic symptoms like dizziness or palpitations needs clarification to confirm or exclude serious causes such as TIA or arrhythmia. - Diagnostic priorities: We need to rule out transient ischemic events, cardiac arrhythmias, or other neurological causes. Clarifying the context and detailed characteristics of her eye episodes will help confirm or reject a diagnosis like TIA. - Patient factors: Her brief, vague responses and minimization suggest she may be withholding detailed information. She seems uncomfortable discussing symptoms that could be serious, perhaps to avoid alarm or because of uncertainty. - Interview phase goals: At this point, I want to obtain more precise descriptions of her visual episodes, their progression, and any accompanying systemic symptoms, while gently encouraging more detailed reporting. I also aim to assess her understanding and emotional readiness regarding potential serious diagnoses, so I can facilitate shared decision-making later.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused yet open-ended enough to allow elaboration without feeling interrogative. - Information target: Duration, frequency, severity, temporal patterns, triggers, alleviating factors, and associated symptoms of visual episodes; systemic symptom correlation; impact on function. - Communication approach: Use collaborative language to build trust and reduce her tendency to minimize or hedge, phrasing questions empathetically to encourage detailed responses. - Expected value: Clarifies whether her symptoms are consistent with TIA or other serious causes, and prepares her for eventual discussion about further testing and treatment options.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared so far, I want to understand more about these episodes. Can you tell me, in as much detail as you can, how often these flickering or blurry vision moments happen during the day, how long they usually last\u2014just a few seconds or longer\u2014and if there\u2019s anything that seems to bring them on or help make them go away? Also, do you notice if these visual changes ever happen along with your dizziness or palpitations, or other symptoms like weakness or difficulty speaking?\"",
