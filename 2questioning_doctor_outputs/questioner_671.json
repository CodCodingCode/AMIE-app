    "input": "The patient is a adult female presenting with a sudden onset of severe right eye pain and significant visual impairment, progressing rapidly over the past 24 hours. Examination findings include eye redness and swelling, with near-complete vision loss in the affected eye. Objective assessment suggests an acute ophthalmologic condition such as angle-closure glaucoma or optic neuritis, though her subjective report likely overstates symptom severity due to emotional distress. Earlier mild symptoms or discomfort may have been unnoticed or underreported, and additional inquiry regarding prior ocular history and associated systemic symptoms is necessary for accurate diagnosis.1. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Sudden severe eye pain, rapid visual impairment, eye redness and swelling, and near-complete vision loss are hallmark features. Common in middle-aged women and an ophthalmologic emergency.  2. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Eye redness, swelling, pain, and rapid progression suggest an infectious process, especially if systemic fever or signs of infection are present; it requires urgent diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Justification: Sudden painless vision loss can mimic this, but pain and redness are less typical, making it a slightly less likely but important to consider.  4. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis Justification: Rapid vision loss often with ocular pain (especially with eye movement), but less redness or swelling; it is less likely given the prominent ocular redness and swelling.  5. Diagnosis: Corneal Ulcer or Infectious Keratitis Justification: Severe eye pain and redness could indicate corneal infection, especially if there are risk factors like trauma; however, vision loss is less likely to be as rapid.  6. Diagnosis: Anterior Uveitis (Iritis) Justification: Causes eye redness and pain, often with photophobia, but typically less severe vision loss acutely, making it less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment Justification: Sudden vision loss, but usually less associated with pain and eye redness; less likely as the primary cause with these findings.  8. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Justification: Sudden vision loss, usually painless, but less likely here due to redness and swelling.  9. Diagnosis: Subacute or Chronic Glaucoma Justification: Typically presents with gradual symptoms, not sudden dramatic onset.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign body or trauma-related injury Justification: No reported trauma or foreign body exposure, making this unlikely in the current scenario.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs highly emotional, descriptive language, emphasizing severity with words like \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and \"unbearable,\" which intensifies her conveyed distress. While detailed, she also exhibits some minimization regarding her family history and perceived risk. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with detailed symptoms and fears but may prioritize emotional expression over factual clarity. Her responses are organized around her fears, with a tendency to elaborate on her distress rather than just clinical features. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate, emotionally charged, and sometimes hyperbolic, reflecting her anxiety-driven amplification of symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding; however, her minimization of prior risk and focus on severe symptoms suggest she might underreport earlier, milder symptoms or dismiss lesser signs. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying her perceived risk by stating she \"didn\u2019t think it would happen\" adds an element of minimization about her predisposition or early symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions of pain and vision loss are exaggerated, indicating emotional amplification likely linked to her anxiety and fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her distress and detailed fears may reflect vulnerability rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Her heightened concern and the framing of her fear are strongly influenced by her family medical history, which she perceives as a significant risk factor.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, due to her focus on severe symptoms and catastrophic fears. - Severity: Moderate to severe; her emotional state strongly influences her perception, possibly distorting the clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Severity of pain and risk perception are most biased; her warning signs are colored by anxiety and fear. - Reliability: While her report of symptoms is detailed and consistent, emotional amplification suggests her perception of severity may be somewhat exaggerated; clinical correlation is necessary.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early or mild symptoms, such as initial discomfort or less intense signs, are probably underreported. Her focus on severe symptoms may obscure a broader clinical picture. - Symptoms probably minimized: Mild, non-painful early signs are likely minimised or overlooked. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of blindness and the perceived immediacy of danger are heightened by her anxiety, possibly leading to an overestimation of threat. - True timeline: The progression was probably gradual, with worsening over days, but her emphasis on sudden onset and rapid deterioration might inflate the perceived speed of progression.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Given the severity and rapid progression of symptoms, focusing on the patient's narrative about how her eye pain and visual changes began and evolved is essential. - We need to explore any subtle or earlier symptoms she might not have initially reported, like mild discomfort, or warning signs she may have dismissed. - Since she is highly emotional and descriptive, phrasing questions delicately can encourage her to share detailed information without feeling dismissed or overwhelmed. - This inquiry helps identify the symptom timeline, associated systemic signs, and potential triggers, which are crucial for narrowing down the urgent diagnoses like angle-closure glaucoma versus other causes. - A broad, open-ended question about her experience can elicit rich information about her perceptions and the progression of her symptoms, aligning with early exploration goals.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Detailed timeline of symptom onset, any preceding mild symptoms, systemic signs, and prior eye or health history. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether symptoms developed suddenly or gradually, and check for associated features suggestive of infection or other ocular pathology. - Patient factors: Her emotional and expressive style suggests she may exaggerate symptoms or focus heavily on severe aspects; questions should be gentle to avoid heightening distress. - Interview phase goals: Establish a clear, detailed symptom narrative to inform differential diagnosis and assess her level of distress and understanding.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to allow comprehensive description. - Information target: Symptom onset, progression, any early warnings, associated systemic or eye symptoms, and previous ocular issues. - Communication approach: Sensitive, validating, to make her comfortable sharing potentially distressing details. - Expected value: Gathering a complete timeline and subtle clues about her experience, which facilitates prioritization of diagnosis and building rapport.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your eye pain and vision changes started? Were there any early sensations or discomfort before it became so severe? How did everything happen day by day?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Recent activity during soccer could have caused minor trauma leading to a superficial scratch on the cornea, explaining redness, swelling, tearing, and rapid symptom onset.  2. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Playing soccer increases risk of foreign objects entering the eye, causing irritation, redness, tearing, and swelling.  3. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or irritant) Justification: Common cause of red, watery eyes, especially in active individuals; however, less likely with recent trauma or activity-specific onset.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Presents with redness, tearing, and swelling, often bilateral; less likely given the recent physical activity, but plausible.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Involves eyelid redness and swelling; less acute but possible as secondary to other irritation.  6. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden redness and swelling can occur after physical activity, but typically presents as a well-demarcated hemorrhage without tearing, making it less likely as primary.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Would present with redness, swelling, possible pain, fever, and systemic symptoms; unlikely in absence of systemic features or trauma signs.  8. Diagnosis: Globe rupture Justification: A serious injury with eye redness and swelling; however, absence of penetrating injury signs makes this less probable.  9. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes redness and pain but typically presents with pain and photophobia over days; unlikely given acute post-soccer onset.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Presents with eye redness and increased intraocular pressure but usually involves pain and vision changes; less consistent with trauma-related symptoms.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient alternates between minimizing and amplifying her symptoms\u2014describing initial pain as \"just a little\" yet emphasizing how \"exploded\" and \"unbearable\" it became. This indicates fluctuating cues driven by emotional distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming when describing her symptoms but tends to highlight the rapid worsening and her fears, perhaps to elicit reassurance or because her anxiety motivates her to reinforce her perceived severity. - Response style: Her responses are emotionally charged and narrative-driven rather than purely clinical, often emphasizing her fears and the escalation, which reflects an anxious amplification pattern.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; she appears to share most relevant details but may downplay early mild symptoms, possibly due to not recognizing them or intentionally minimizing them. - Minimization behaviors: Describing initial pain as \"just a little,\" which might conceal a more serious early discomfort. - Amplification patterns: Her language about symptoms \"exploding\" and \"almost can't stand it\" suggests she is exaggerating her pain level to express urgency and concern, typical in anxiety-driven amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her rapid shift to intense descriptions could indicate discomfort with mild symptoms or fear of overreacting. - Confusion/memory issues: No obvious signs, response consistency suggests reasonable memory. - Family influence: Her references to family history significantly shape her perception of risk, possibly increasing her anxiety and exaggeration of severity.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-fueled amplification bias, as she tends to emphasize the seriousness to communicate urgency, driven by health anxiety and fear. - Severity: Moderate; her language and focus on worsening symptoms suggest a strong emotional influence, though her factual reporting of initial mild symptoms is relatively accurate. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity and timeline; her fears may distort the actual clinical course. - Reliability: Moderate; her reports are influenced by high anxiety, which may lead to overstatement of severity, but she provides consistent descriptions of her subjective experience.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early mild symptoms that she may have overlooked or dismissed; potential history of minor discomforts that didn't alarm her. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial pain levels and onset timeline; her \"just a little pain\" might mask a more significant early discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Risk of blindness and severity of infection; her fear-driven narrative likely overstates the actual danger. - True timeline: The actual progression was probably gradual initially, with the rapid worsening fueled by her anxiety, which may distort her perception of how quickly symptoms escalated.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has described a rapid increase in discomfort after playing soccer, emphasizing the severity and her fears. Given her emotional and narrative style, I need to gently explore her perception of the onset and what she experienced early on, including whether she noticed any initial mild symptoms she might have overlooked.

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with acute ocular symptoms characterized by redness, swelling, and severe vision impairment in one eye, developing over approximately two days. She reports initial mild irritation evolving into intense pain and near-total vision loss, with her subjective descriptions likely amplified by anxiety. Examination is needed to determine the level of ocular inflammation, the integrity of ocular structures, and to identify signs indicative of infectious or inflammatory processes such as keratitis, uveitis, or other serious pathology. Objective assessment will guide urgency and management, acknowledging that her perception of severity may not fully correlate with clinical findings.1. Diagnosis: Endophthalmitis Justification: The rapid onset of severe pain, redness, swelling, and near-complete vision loss strongly suggests intraocular infection, especially endophthalmitis, which can occur post-procedure, trauma, or hematogenously. The intense pain disproportionate to external findings and rapid deterioration are characteristic. Immediate consideration is warranted given its potential for rapid vision loss and intraocular destruction.  2. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Justification: Sudden, profound vision loss with pain is characteristic. Although painless retinal artery occlusion is more typical, associated ocular pain can occur especially if ischemia causes secondary inflammation or in cases where ocular hypertension and ischemia coexist. Rapid onset over days fits the pattern of vascular occlusion, especially if examination shows a cherry-red spot, pale retina, or arterial narrowing.  3. Diagnosis: Acute Uveitis (Anterior or panuveitis) Justification: Uveitis can cause redness, pain, and visual impairment. The rapid progression over days with significant intraocular inflammation can sometimes cause vision loss, especially if severe. However, the degree of vision loss here suggests either combined processes or a more destructive pathology, but uveitis remains a plausible component.  4. Diagnosis: Keratitis (Corneal Infection) Justification: Keratitis can cause redness, pain, and vision impairment. Typically, it involves ocular surface changes, corneal ulceration, or infiltrates. The severity and rapid progression to near-total vision loss are less typical unless complicated by corneal perforation, but it remains a consideration, especially if external signs predominate.  5. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Presents with ocular pain, redness, and vision loss, often with a mid-dilated pupil and haloes. Rapid onset over days is less common, but it remains a critical differential due to the urgency. However, the degree of vision loss described and the progression favor intraocular infectious or ischemic causes more strongly.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient mixes clinical descriptors with emotional exaggerations, often switching from mild (\"some irritation\") to intense (\"so badly,\" \"unbearable\"). This suggests an emotional amplification that might distort the clinical picture. - Information flow: Her responses reveal an initial tendency to minimize or soften early symptoms but shift to more intense descriptions when emphasizing current distress, indicating reactive exaggeration. - Response style: She is somewhat elaborate with emotional content but uses varying degrees of clinical detail, possibly to convey urgency while downplaying early signs.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding; however, initial underreporting of minor symptoms hints she might be reluctant to admit minor discomforts, possibly to justify seeking urgent care. - Minimization behaviors: Her early account of \"little soreness\" contrasts with her current intense descriptions, implying previous minimization. - Amplification patterns: The current emphasis on \"unbearable\" pain and rapid worsening indicates over-exaggeration likely driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not evident; her distress seems openly expressed. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: Mention of family ocular history may heighten her concern, subtly influencing her perception of severity.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias is emotional amplification, with her high anxiety leading to overstatement of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her exaggerated descriptions could lead clinicians to overestimate actual tissue damage, though her genuine distress must be acknowledged. - Areas most affected: Her pain and vision loss reports are most biased, possibly overstating current clinical severity. - Reliability: While her emotional state is authentic, her self-reporting of intensity and urgency should be interpreted with caution due to amplification bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early mild symptoms and the initial progression may be understated; she may have experienced milder discomfort that she minimized. - Symptoms probably minimized: The initial soreness and slight visual disturbances could be understated, leading to a skewed perception of rapid progression. - Concerns probably amplified: The fear of blindness and severity of infection are likely exaggerated, driven by her anxiety. - True timeline: The disease likely began mildly (like irritation) and then escalated rapidly, but her current descriptions intensify perceived severity more than the actual clinical picture, necessitating careful assessment to avoid misjudging urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Precise details about any initial sensations or changes that occurred before the severe symptoms began, such as mild discomfort or visual disturbances, are missing. Clarification about how quickly her vision deteriorated after initial symptoms, and whether there\u2019s any pattern (e.g., intermittent symptoms before worsening), is needed. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether early symptoms such as mild soreness or intermittent blurring existed to distinguish between infectious/inflammatory processes (e.g., endophthalmitis, uveitis) versus vascular occlusion or glaucoma. Understanding the symptom evolution helps determine acuity and possible triggers. - Patient factors: Her emotional amplification and fluctuating descriptions mean questions should be phrased carefully to distinguish her perception from clinical findings, emphasizing open-endedness but also gently guiding toward specific symptom details. - Interview phase goals: Focus on establishing a detailed timeline of symptom progression, exploring any early signs that might point toward less aggressive causes, and assessing associated features\u2014such as initial visual disturbances, external signs, or systemic symptoms\u2014to refine differential diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to explore initial symptoms and progression, alongside open-ended prompts for her perception and experiences. - Information target: Onset timing, early sensations, changes in vision or eye sensation, and any associated systemic or ocular signs at each stage. - Communication approach: Use gentle, patient-centered language\u2014\"Can you tell me more about how you first noticed anything different in your eye before it became so painful?\"\u2014to encourage honesty and reduce anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Expected value: Clarifies the true initial presentation, helps identify patterns suggestive of infection, ischemia, or inflammation, and guides urgency of management.\nANSWER: \"Earlier in the course\u2014before the pain became so severe\u2014did you notice any mild symptoms, like slight discomfort, light sensitivity, or some visual changes?

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with an acute onset of severe right eye pain, redness, swelling, and near-complete vision loss over approximately two days. Although she reports initial mild irritation and slight visual blurring, her descriptions suggest that her perception of symptom severity may be amplified, driven by anxiety and fear of permanent damage. The clinical presentation indicates an inflammatory or infectious ocular process requiring urgent assessment and intervention; however, her subjective reports likely overstate the rapidity and severity of symptoms. Early mild symptoms such as light sensitivity, tearing, or minor discomfort are probably underreported or unnoticed, and objective examination is necessary to determine the true extent of ocular pathology.1. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: The sudden severe eye pain, redness, rapid vision loss, and swelling are characteristic of angle-closure glaucoma, which often presents with abrupt intraocular pressure elevation causing severe symptoms. Although initial mild irritation might be underreported, the rapid progression to near-complete vision loss is typical of an intraocular pressure crisis.  2. Diagnosis: Endophthalmitis Justification: The rapid onset of severe pain, redness, swelling, and profound visual loss suggests possible intraocular infection, especially if there's a history of recent ocular surgery, trauma, or systemic infection. The degree of severity and quick deterioration are consistent with endophthalmitis, which is an emergent diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Anterior Uveitis (Severe or Hypertensive Uveitis) Justification: Uveitis can cause redness, pain, and decreased vision, often associated with inflammation behind the cornea. Although usually less acute with rapid vision loss, severe forms can mimic this presentation, especially if associated with complications like increased intraocular pressure.  4. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Justification: Sudden vision loss with ocular redness and swelling may indicate retinal ischemia, though pain is less prominent. The rapid, severe visual loss aligns with arterial occlusion, but the presence of significant pain and swelling favors other etiologies.  5. Diagnosis: Severe Corneal Ulcer or Keratitis Justification: Intense pain and redness can result from corneal infections leading to ulceration. However, near-complete vision loss is less typical unless corneal opacity is profound, making this less probable compared to intraocular or orbital pathologies but still possible in the differential.

Their responses are emotionally charged, possibly biased by fear. - Response style: They provide detailed, emotionally laden narratives when symptoms worsen, but initial mild symptoms are prone to being understated or not fully disclosed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent under-reporting of early, less severe sensations suggests possible withholding or minimization of initial mild symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Describing early discomfort as \"a little soreness\" or \"maybe irritation,\" perhaps to rationalize delayed care or to downplay initial severity. - Amplification patterns: Their current symptoms are described as \"excruciating,\" \"unbearable,\" and vision as \"nothing,\" which may be exaggerations in the context of actual progression. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit evidence, but the tendency to escalate symptoms might reflect discomfort in admitting initial minor issues. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are coherent and consistent, indicating clarity rather than confusion. - Family influence: They acknowledge family history honestly, but their emotional responses might be influenced by fears of inherited disease.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification of symptoms and emotional distress leading to possible overstatement of current severity and underreporting of early signs. - Severity: Moderate, as their exaggerated reports could distort clinical assessment of disease progression and urgency. - Areas most affected: The initial onset and progression timeline are most biased, with early mild symptoms minimized, and current symptoms exaggerated. - Reliability: Overall self-reporting should be considered with caution; current severity is likely overstated and early mild symptoms understated, affecting objective understanding.

Her account suggests that early symptoms were subtle and possibly underrecognized, with an initial gradual progression that she perceives as rapid and severe due to anxiety and emotional influence. This presentation warrants urgent ophthalmologic evaluation to determine the underlying cause, with consideration of inflammatory or infectious ocular processes such as uveitis or scleritis.Infectious scleritis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs a mix of specific and emotional language; notably, she downplays early symptoms with phrases like \"just a little uncomfortable\" but emphasizes current pain intensely. The contrast indicates potential minimization at onset and amplification now. - Information flow: She is fairly forthcoming in describing her current severe symptoms but possibly downplays initial sensations, which she describes as mild. Her responses are organized but colored by emotional distress, leading to potentially skewed emphasis. - Response style: She elaborates extensively about her current experience, but her descriptions of early symptoms tend to be vague and minimized, consistent with anxiety-driven responses.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The initial minimal description of early symptoms suggests she might be minimizing or withholding details about mild discomfort to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. - Minimization behaviors: Calling initial discomfort \"not that bad\" despite current severe pain indicates a tendency to understate early issues, perhaps to create a narrative that her condition escalated rapidly. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions of the current pain as \"excruciating\" and symptoms as \"so fast\" worsening point to exaggeration, likely fueled by anxiety and fear of serious outcomes. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her disclaimers about initial symptom severity may reflect subtle discomfort about how mild initially they were. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline appears consistent but may be influenced by distress. - Family influence: The family history appears to heighten her fears, possibly magnifying her perception of severity.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification with some initial minimization of early symptoms. Her emotional distress appears to skew perception of symptom severity and timing. - Severity: Moderate to severe bias; her current distress and exaggerated descriptions of pain support significant amplification. - Areas most affected: Her early symptom report; initial mild discomfort is likely underrepresented. Her current high anxiety amplifies her perception of severity. - Reliability: Her current description of symptoms and progression seems trustworthy, but her account of initial mild symptoms likely underestimates minor discomforts, which delays accurate understanding.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully acknowledge initial mild symptoms, like slight discomfort or light sensitivity, which are clinically relevant to understanding early disease onset. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early signs of mild discomfort and visual changes could be underreported; this affects accurate timeline assessment. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of blindness and severity are proportionate to her emotional state rather than purely objective clinical findings. - True timeline: The worsening appears rapid and consistent, but her anxiety-driven perception may overstate the speed of deterioration. Initial mild symptoms might have been more subtle and less alarming than she reports now.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need to clarify the presence or absence of any subtle or initial symptoms that might have been missed or minimized, such as light sensitivity, mild discomfort, or visual disturbances, which are important for differentiating types of ocular pathology. Additionally, understanding her perception of how rapidly her condition worsened helps establish the course. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming or refuting early mild symptoms could support a diagnosis like scleritis or uveitis, which often have insidious initial phases. The timeline can distinguish infectious causes that tend to progress quickly. Contacting her understanding of her symptoms\u2019 progression is crucial for diagnosis certainty. - Patient factors: Given her tendency to minimize early symptoms, I should phrase questions in a gentle, non-judgmental manner to encourage accurate recall. Her emotional distress may lead to overemphasis on current severity, so exploring past sensations carefully is key. - Interview phase goals: Final confirmation of the presence or absence of any mild initial symptoms, understanding her perception of symptom onset and progression, and ensuring no red flags have been overlooked.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions about early symptoms and timeline, followed by confirmatory prompts for specific findings. - Information target: Precise details about any mild sensations like discomfort, light sensitivity, visual changes, and their timing relative to her current severe symptoms. - Communication approach: Framing questions with sensitivity, acknowledging her distress, and encouraging detailed recall without judgment. - Expected value: Gather critical data to differentiate infectious (e.g., scleritis or keratitis) from other causes, confirm diagnostic timeline, and improve clinical certainty before discussing treatment options.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you\u2019ve shared about your current severe symptoms, I\u2019d like to understand more about what you experienced right around the time these started\u2014especially in the very early stages. Did you notice any mild discomfort, light sensitivity, slight visual changes, or any sensations that seemed different from normal when your eye first started bothering you? Can you tell me what those early sensations were like and how quickly they changed or worsened over time?\"",
