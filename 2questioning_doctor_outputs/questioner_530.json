    "input": "A female patient presents with a recent history of a cat scratch, now exhibiting a gradually enlarging, tender skin lesion at the scratch site, likely indicative of localized infection such as cellulitis or abscess. She reports fatigue and neck discomfort; systemic symptoms like fever or malaise are not explicitly communicated but may be present. The lesion's progression over approximately one week warrants evaluation for infection severity, with considerations for potential systemic involvement. Further inquiry into associated symptoms and emotional impact is necessary to fully assess her condition.1. Diagnosis: Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae infection) Justification: Recent cat scratch and a localized, tender, enlarging skin lesion strongly point to this common zoonotic infection, especially in a patient with systemic symptoms like fatigue.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis secondary to bacterial infection (e.g., Staphylococcus or Streptococcus spp.) Justification: The tender, enlarging skin lesion at the scratch site suggests bacterial cellulitis, a common complication of skin trauma in this context.  3. Diagnosis: Abscess at the scratch site Justification: Progressive enlargement and tenderness are characteristic of localized pus accumulation, a common complication of bacterial skin infections.  4. Diagnosis: Lymphadenitis related to regional infection (e.g., regional lymph node swelling, tender neck) Justification: Neck discomfort suggests regional lymphadenopathy, often associated with skin infections or cat scratch disease.  5. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV) infection Justification: Fatigue and neck discomfort could hint at mononucleosis, which can present with cervical lymphadenopathy; however, less likely without classic sore throat or splenomegaly and in absence of other systemic signs.  6. Diagnosis: Tularemia Justification: A zoonotic infection from animals or insects that can present with a skin ulcer and regional lymphadenopathy, though less common than cat scratch disease.  7. Diagnosis: Spirochetal infection (e.g., early Lyme disease) Justification: If the scratch was from a tick or in an endemic area, a skin lesion with regional lymph node involvement could suggest early Lyme borreliosis, though the history points more towards cat exposure.  8. Diagnosis: Cutaneous abscess caused by MRSA Justification: Rapidly enlarging, tender lesion following skin breach suggests possible MRSA abscess, which is common in skin infections.  9. Diagnosis: Herpetic infection (herpes simplex) Justification: Although less likely, herpetic lesions can present as tender skin eruptions, but history favors bacterial infection.  10. Diagnosis: Deep fungal infection (e.g., sporotrichosis) Justification: Sporotrichosis can result from plant material or soil contamination, causing nodular, ulcerative lesions along lymphatic channels; less likely given the recent cat scratch.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs mostly specific language regarding her physical symptoms but avoids detailed descriptions of her emotional state, indicating cautious openness. Her mentions of \"really tired\" and \"really sore\" are somewhat magnified due to concern but generally accurate. - Information flow: She is cooperative and volunteer details such as the timeline and symptom changes, suggesting an organized response style but with slight self-limitation regarding subjective feelings. - Response style: Responses are concise and direct, with minimal tangential elaboration, typical for her age and personality traits.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to disclose the full emotional impact of her symptoms, as she does not elaborate on how severely she feels beyond \"really tired\" and \"feverish,\" possibly to avoid worry. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the subjective experience of fatigue by using \"really tired\" rather than more intense descriptors; not mentioning the emotional distress associated with symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Limited; her report of swelling and tenderness appears fairly balanced. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; her response indicates comfort with physical symptoms but subtle avoidance of emotional details. - Confusion/memory issues: None apparent; her timeline appears logical and consistent. - Family influence: Not evidently distorting responses; her answers seem to stem from her own perceptions.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate information withholding, primarily regarding her subjective emotional state, likely influenced by her age and desire to appear cooperative or avoid worry. - Severity: Moderate, as she provides clear physical symptoms but may understate severity of feelings or fears. - Areas most affected: Emotional distress and perceived severity, which can affect clinical assessment. - Reliability: Moderately reliable\u2014physical symptoms are described adequately, but subjective emotional data could be underreported.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of emotional discomfort, fatigue severity, and fears, possibly due to embarrassment or desire to minimize her worries. - Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional distress and overall fatigue may be underreported; she might be more distressed than she indicates. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about the seriousness of the infection; she explicitly asks if it is serious, showing heightened concern. - True timeline: The progression of physical symptoms appears accurate but could be subtly condensed; early mild symptoms might be underemphasized or omitted.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Common cause of redness, tearing, and swelling; could be infectious (bacterial or viral), especially after outdoor activity; often bilateral but can be unilateral; typically develops over a few days.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Usually presents with redness, tearing, and discomfort, especially after trauma or playing sports; symptoms start quickly after injury, fitting the 2-day timeline.  3. Diagnosis: Eyelid contusion or trauma-related swelling Justification: Recent sports activity increases suspicion for eyelid trauma, causing swelling and redness; trauma can also lead to secondary infection or other injury.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious keratitis Justification: Eye trauma during sports could introduce pathogens leading to corneal infection; presents with redness, tearing, and pain, potentially with swelling.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Common eyelid margin inflammation causing redness, swelling, tearing; can flare-up after outdoor exposure, although less likely as primary in this context.  6. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Can cause redness, tearing, and swelling; occurs in response to environmental allergens, but less likely to be acutely triggered after sports unless allergen exposure.  7. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (angle-closure) Justification: Usually presents with acute eye redness and pain, but typically affects older adults; less likely given the recent activity and absence of other symptoms like visual disturbances.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes eye redness and tearing, but often associated with pain and photophobia; less likely without systemic symptoms or prior history.  9. Diagnosis: Globe rupture or intraocular foreign body Justification: Potentially vision-threatening, trauma during sports can cause globe injuries; need to identify red flags such as severe pain, visual loss, or deformity, but less certain without trauma specifics.  10. Diagnosis: Dacryocystitis Justification: Infection of the tear sac causes swelling and tearing, but usually presents with localized medial canthal swelling and acute redness, less likely immediately after sports without pre-existing nasolacrimal duct issues.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses words like \"just\" (\"I just feel tired\") and \"kind of\" (\"kind of red around it\"), which diminish the apparent severity. The phrase \"I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s because of the scratch\" indicates uncertainty and possible underreporting of symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant and hesitant, offering limited details unless directly asked. Her responses are brief, showing a tendency to withhold or minimize her experiences voluntarily. - Response style: The responses are minimal and somewhat guarded, with a tendency to keep information vague (\"sometimes I get chills,\" \"I don\u2019t really know\"), rather than elaborating on symptoms or concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The use of vague language and limited details suggest she may be leaving out or downplaying symptoms she perceives as embarrassing or minor, like the chills or her uncertainties. - Minimization behaviors: Her statement that she \"doesn't really know\" if the chills are related to the scratch or if she has a fever indicates she may be minimizing or questioning her own symptoms\u2019 importance. - Amplification patterns: There are no explicit overstatements; rather, her language minimizes or dismisses symptoms, which could mask the true severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her reluctance to specify symptoms (\"I don't really know,\" \"sometimes I get chills\") points to possible embarrassment or discomfort discussing the full extent of her experience. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline seems plausible but she admits uncertainty about the relation of symptoms to the injury. - Family influence: Slightly, as her response may be shaped by her desire to reassure her parents or avoid sounding overly alarmed, consistent with her emotional state.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization bias, primarily through vague language and reluctance to fully disclose symptoms she perceives as minor or embarrassing. - Severity level: Moderate, since her language suggests she unintentionally downplays more significant symptoms (chills, ongoing tiredness), potentially affecting clinical assessment accuracy. - Areas most affected: Subjective symptoms like chills and fatigue are most biased, as she avoids elaboration, and her self-report might underrepresent symptom severity. - Reliability assessment: Moderate; her responses are somewhat guarded, so clinicians should probe further to uncover possible understated severity.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be omitting or underreporting symptoms like ongoing fever, severity of chills, or the full extent of fatigue. She might also be minimizing emotional distress or other subtle symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her perception of her symptoms (\"sometimes I get chills,\" \"not that bad\") suggests she might actually be experiencing more intense or persistent symptoms than she reports, such as more significant fatigue or intermittent fever. - Concerns probably amplified: Less likely, as her communication appears conservative; she shows concern but not exaggerated worry. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms seems consistent, but her vague descriptions suggest her awareness of symptom severity or timeline might be limited, possibly underestimating how quickly or severely symptoms have developed.",

    "input": "The patient presents with a progressively enlarging and tender skin lesion at the site of a recent cat scratch, with associated systemic symptoms including fatigue, chills, and dizziness. The clinical picture suggests possible local infection or cellulitis, with a potential for systemic involvement, although patient-reported symptoms may be understated. Further objective examination and targeted questioning are necessary to clarify the severity of the local and systemic findings and to guide appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: The tender, enlarging skin lesion at a site of recent skin injury is characteristic of cellulitis, which involves superficial and potentially deeper skin layers with signs of inflammation like tenderness and warmth. Systemic symptoms like chills and fatigue support an active infectious process involving bacteria invading skin tissues; common organisms include Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species.  2. Diagnosis: Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae infection) Justification: The lesion originated after a cat scratch, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and chills are consistent with Bartonella infection. Although lymphadenopathy is typical, systemic symptoms without prominent lymphadenopathy still fit the clinical profile, especially with recent zoonotic exposure, making this a probable diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Abscess Justification: An enlarging, tender lesion could represent localized abscess formation, especially if there is a collection of pus within a confined space. Symptoms of fever and systemic malaise raise suspicion for abscess if the lesion is fluctuant or shows signs of fluctuation on examination.  4. Diagnosis: Impetigo Justification: Though classically more superficial and crusted, the lesion could represent an early or atypical impetigo, especially given the skin breach and bacterial inoculation. However, systemic symptoms are less typical of impetigo, rendering this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Necrotizing Fasciitis Justification: This condition is a critical consideration in systemic illness with skin infection, but the absence of characteristic features such as rapidly progressive pain out of proportion, skin necrosis, or crepitus makes it less probable. It remains on the differential due to systemic symptoms but is lower in likelihood without more severe findings.The communication pattern shows a tendency for the patient to minimize or withhold information about her symptoms, using vague terms like \"kind of tired\" and \"sometimes a bit dizzy.\" She responds briefly, hesitant, and questions whether her symptoms are normal, indicating possible discomfort or uncertainty. This behavior suggests she might be reluctant to share the full extent of her discomfort, possibly due to nervousness or embarrassment. Her responses are inconsistent, with initial mention of feeling unwell and later questioning if these symptoms are significant, demonstrating partial concealment or minimization of severity. Overall, she has a pattern of limited disclosure, driven by uncertain understanding and nervousness, which may affect clinical assessment accuracy.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The systemic symptoms' severity, duration, and specific characteristics are unclear; the extent of systemic involvement is not well-defined. The local lesion's features, such as whether there's fluctuation or signs of abscess, are not detailed. There's also limited information on other associated symptoms like swelling, lymphadenopathy, or signs of more serious infections like necrosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether systemic symptoms are mild or severe, check for signs of abscess or abscess formation, and assess for features pointing toward more serious infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Understanding the lesion's characteristics will help distinguish cellulitis from abscess or other skin infections. - Patient factors: The patient tends to minimize symptoms and provides brief responses, which suggests a need for gentle, clarifying questions that encourage more detailed disclosure without feeling confrontational. The questions should help her elaborate on her symptoms to overcome her hesitations. - Interview phase goals: To delineate the severity, duration, and impact of systemic symptoms; evaluate local lesion features to determine if there's fluctuation or signs of abscess; explore associated findings such as lymphadenopathy. This will refine the differential diagnosis and guide urgency of intervention.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, scenario-based questions to explore specific symptom features and associated findings. Open-ended follow-ups will help her elaborate, but targeted questions are necessary given her tendency to minimize or withhold details. - Information target: Nature and progression of systemic symptoms, local lesion characteristics (size, fluctuation, signs of abscess), presence of lymphadenopathy or other systemic signs, duration, and triggers or factors that worsen or improve her condition. - Communication approach: Frame questions with reassurance, validating her experience while gently encouraging elaboration, e.g., \"Sometimes when I hear about these sorts of symptoms, patients notice more about... Can you tell me if you've observed any of these in yourself?\" - Expected value: Clarify the seriousness of her systemic symptoms and local lesion, which will influence management urgency and diagnostic steps. It will also help identify features of abscess or more severe infections that may require urgent intervention.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that you've felt kind of tired and a bit dizzy at times. Could you tell me more about how these symptoms have been \u2014 for example, how often they've occurred, how long they've lasted, and whether they seem to get worse or better throughout the day? Also, since your lesion has been enlarging, have you noticed any swelling or changes around it, like it feeling more fluctuant or needing to be drained? Are you experiencing any new pain, or does the skin look different in any way, like becoming more red, warm, or swollen? And have you noticed any swollen lymph nodes in your neck or elsewhere? These details can help us better understand what's happening and decide the best next steps.\"",

    "input": "A female patient presents with an enlarging, tender, erythematous skin lesion at the site of a recent cat scratch, with associated regional lymphadenopathy. She reports intermittent afternoon fever episodes and persistent fatigue over the past week but minimizes the severity of her systemic symptoms. Examination would likely reveal signs of cellulitis or soft tissue infection, with possible additional systemic illness that appears more severe than her self-report suggests. Findings warrant further assessment of the extent of infection and systemic involvement to determine appropriate treatment.1. Diagnosis: Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae infection) Justification: The hallmark features include a tender, erythematous skin lesion (regional lymphadenopathy), recent cat scratch, and systemic symptoms like intermittent fever and fatigue. These are classic for cat scratch disease, which often presents with localized lymphadenitis and mild systemic symptoms, fitting this patient's presentation well.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis (Staphylococcus or Streptococcus) Justification: The erythematous, tender skin lesion at the site of injury suggests bacterial skin infection, which is common after scratches. Cellulitis is a frequent complication of skin breaches, especially if systemic symptoms are present, and can feature erythema, tenderness, and sometimes regional lymphadenopathy.  3. Diagnosis: Atypical mycobacterial infection (e.g., Mycobacterium marinum) Justification: Infections from skin trauma at aquatic environments or with exposure to contaminated water may cause granulomatous skin lesions with lymphadenopathy. Although less classic here, this remains a differential, especially if the lesion persists or worsens despite typical therapy.  4. Diagnosis: Tularemia Justification: Though less common, tularemia can occur after animal contact and present with skin ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy. The systemic symptoms may include fever and malaise. Still, less likely given the history points more toward Bartonella.  5. Diagnosis: Sporothrix schenckii infection (sporotrichosis) Justification: Usually causes nodular lesions following trauma involving plant material or soil, with lymphatic spread. Though less consistent here, it is considered in skin lesions with lymphadenopathy after environmental exposure, which may or may not be relevant.  STOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The girl's descriptions are generally vague and soft, using words like \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" and \"I guess,\" which downplay symptoms. Her emotional tone is subdued, indicating cautiousness rather than overt distress. - Information flow: She tends to answer questions directly but with qualifiers that suggest reluctance to fully disclose or emphasize the severity, thus limiting detailed information. - Response style: Her responses are concise, somewhat hesitant, and balanced between cooperative and reserved, which can hinder a comprehensive assessment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Frequent hedging and vague descriptions suggest she is withholding or minimizing the full extent of her symptoms, perhaps to avoid worry or because she feels unsure. - Minimization behaviors: She describes symptoms as \"not that bad\" or \"a little warm,\" indicating an attempt to lessen perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; instead, there\u2019s a tendency to tone down the presentation. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitations and vague language imply subtle discomfort or embarrassment, possibly about her health or symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant memory or timeline inconsistencies observed; responses are coherent. - Family influence: Her cautious language and framing could be influenced by her awareness of her mother's concerns, leading her to understate symptoms to avoid alarm.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias dominates, as she downplays symptom severity and avoids full disclosure. - Severity: Moderate, given she provides some information but filters or downplays parts of her experience. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity, especially fatigue, swelling, and systemic symptoms, are likely understated. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reporting provides a general picture but should be supplemented with objective findings, as she may not fully recognize or communicate the gravity of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The actual severity of fatigue, systemic symptoms, and swelling might be worse; she may not be fully aware of or willing to report worsening signs. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her fatigue and fever details could be understated, masking potential progression of infection. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of serious illness is genuine, but her language minimizes the actual risk, possibly leading clinicians to underestimate severity. - True timeline: The infection may be advancing faster or more severely than portrayed; patient\u2019s language suggests she is cautious, possibly hiding worsening symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: Information gaps persist regarding the current status and progression of her systemic and local symptoms, especially her fatigue, fever, and any new or worsening signs around the lesion. Exploring the exact timing, severity, and factors affecting these symptoms will help differentiate between diagnoses like a localized skin infection versus systemic illness. Given her cautious communication, I need to carefully probe for details she may not voluntarily disclose. Diagnostic priorities include confirming systemic involvement extent (fever, fatigue), assessing lesion characteristics (size, fluctuation, warmth, redness), and noting any new lymphadenopathy or systemic signs that may suggest an evolving or more severe infection. Her communication style, characterized by hedging and minimization, requires gentle, open-ended questions to elicit more accurate symptom descriptions. The interview phase goals here are to clarify the severity and progression of her symptoms, identify any concerning features that suggest worsening or systemic spread, and assess for associated findings that support or rule out specific diagnoses.  QUESTION STRATEGY: I need focused questions that gently explore her symptoms' intensity, duration, and triggers without leading her to minimize further. Asking about the timeline of the fatigue and fever, especially whether they've appeared suddenly or gradually worsened, and if there are specific times of day when symptoms are worse, will be helpful. Additionally, probing around the lesion for subtle changes\u2014like fluctuance, warmth, or the development of pus or discharge\u2014is critical. Addressing systemic symptoms systematically, I will ask about new or worsening lymph node swelling, additional systemic signs such as chills or malaise, and any impact on her daily activities. Given her communication style, phrasing questions in a non-judgmental, open-ended manner, such as \"Can you tell me how your fatigue has been changing over the past few days?\" or \"Have you noticed if your skin lesion feels different now compared to when it first appeared?\" will encourage more detail. This approach will help gather information to refine the differential diagnosis and assessurgency for treatment.\nANSWER: \"Since our last conversation, have you noticed if your tiredness or any other symptoms\u2014like feeling warm or feverish\u2014have gotten worse or changed in any particular way? For example, are these symptoms happening more often or lasting longer during the day? Also, since the lesion has been enlarging, have you seen any changes in its texture or appearance\u2014like it feeling more fluctuant, warmer, or having pus or fluid coming out? Have you noticed any new swelling or tenderness in your lymph nodes, or anything else about how you're feeling that has changed recently?\"",

While the patient describes only mild redness, warmth, and swelling of the lesion, communication patterns suggest these signs may be more severe. Physical examination is warranted to assess the true extent of erythema, warmth, swelling, and systemic illness, as her self-report likely underrepresents the severity. Clinical evaluation should focus on detailed assessment of local and regional signs and investigate for deeper or systemic infection.Cat Scratch Disease ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague words like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" and \"I think,\" which serve to soften her descriptions and avoid direct confrontation of the severity. Her tone reflects concern but also a desire not to overstate symptoms. She tends to be non-specific, which can obscure the true extent of her symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to volunteer detailed or complete information initially, preferring to answer questions in a guarded manner. She provides basic facts but withhedging, making her responses appear organized but somewhat cautious. - Response style: Her responses are concise and somewhat minimalistic unless prompted, reflecting a tendency to underreport or minimize symptoms.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of qualifying language (\"I think,\" \"maybe,\" \"kind of\"), brief responses, and hesitance to fully describe worsening symptoms point toward intentional or subconscious withholding of severity details. - Minimization behaviors: She reports feeling \"kind of\" more tired and observes \"maybe\" the bump is bigger, which suggests she underplays progression. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; her descriptions seem cautious rather than alarmist. - Embarrassment/shame signals: While no overt signs, her guarded language could hint at discomfort in fully revealing her concern for fear of causing worry or being seen as overly anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; her timeline appears consistent, but her cautious language indicates some uncertainty about symptom severity. - Family influence: The responses align with her trying to reassure her family, perhaps influenced by her mother's worries, leading her to downplay how serious she perceives her condition.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, driven by her cautious language and hesitation to provide full details without prompting. - Severity: Mild, since her responses are generally consistent but contain qualifying and hedging language that suggests underreporting. - Areas most affected: Her description of the swelling and redness; these might be more significant than she indicates. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report is probably accurate in basic facts but slightly understated regarding severity and progression due to her cautious response style.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be withholding the true intensity of swelling, redness, or pain, which are critical for diagnosis and management. - Symptoms probably minimized: The degree of enlargement, redness, warmth, or tenderness, which could suggest more advanced or systemic infection, might be underestimated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety and concern about getting seriously ill are genuine but may lead her to downplay actual severity. - True timeline: The actual worsening could be occurring more rapidly or intensely than her report suggests; her cautious language indicates she perceives herself as less affected.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The main missing details involve the extent of the lesion's physical characteristics (size, warmth, fluctuation), any signs of pus or discharge, and the presence of systemic symptoms such as high fever or malaise. Clarifying any recent progression in these features is crucial for diagnosis. - Diagnostic priorities: To confirm or exclude abscess formation, cellulitis, or systemic involvement, I need precise descriptions of the lesion\u2019s severity and any new systemic symptoms. - Patient factors: Her cautious communication style indicates she may understate her symptoms, so questions should be direct yet gentle to elicit more accurate information without causing discomfort or fear. - Interview phase goals: To obtain definitive data on lesion characteristics and systemic signs, assess symptom progression, and prepare for sharing diagnostic impressions and next steps.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions aimed at specifics of lesion features and systemic symptoms, with some confirmatory queries to clarify or verify her responses. - Information target: Key features include lesion size, warmth, fluctuation, signs of discharge, and any recent changes; also systemic symptoms like fever severity, sweating, chills, and fatigue. - Communication approach: Phrased assertively but empathetically, acknowledging her responses so far and gently probing possible underreporting. - Expected value: These questions will help confirm whether the lesion is progressing to abscess or cellulitis, informing whether urgent intervention is needed.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that\u2014you mentioned your lesion is getting bigger and feels warm\u2014could you tell me more specifically about its current size? Is it more than an inch across? Does it feel fluctuant or soft in the middle, like fluid might be building up? Also, have you noticed any pus or fluid coming out? And regarding systemic symptoms, have you experienced any high fevers or chills lately, or do you feel more unwell than usual, even if just in the afternoons? These details will help me understand how severe this is becoming.\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague words like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" and \"I think,\" which serve to soften her descriptions and avoid direct confrontation of the severity. Her tone reflects concern but also a desire not to overstate symptoms. She tends to be non-specific, which can obscure the true extent of her symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to volunteer detailed or complete information initially, preferring to answer questions in a guarded manner.
