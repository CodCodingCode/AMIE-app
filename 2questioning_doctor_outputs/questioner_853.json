    "input": "The patient is a male presenting with signs suggestive of significant anemia likely secondary to ongoing bleeding episodes. He reports fatigue, pallor, increased bruising, bleeding from cuts and the nose, abdominal fullness and tenderness on the left side, weight loss, and shortness of breath upon exertion. These symptoms are probably more severe than he openly acknowledges, with possible unreported episodes of frequent or severe bleeding and greater functional impairment. Additional concerns such as dizziness, weakness, and emotional distress may be present but are underreported due to communication patterns. The timeline of symptom progression suggests a potentially rapid decline, with systemic effects indicating a need for urgent further evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Leukemia (most likely acute or chronic) Justification: Signs of systemic illness, anemia, unexplained weight loss, pallor, bruising, bleeding, and splenomegaly suggest marrow infiltration by malignant cells, which is characteristic of leukemia.  2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin) Justification: The abdominal fullness, tenderness, weight loss, systemic symptoms, and bruising could be due to lymphadenopathy or splenic involvement, common in lymphoma.  3. Diagnosis: Hematologic malignancy (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome) Justification: The progressive anemia, bleeding, and systemic features could stem from marrow dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis.  4. Diagnosis: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Justification: Increased bruising and bleeding with anemia could suggest immune-mediated platelet destruction, though systemic symptoms are less prominent.  5. Diagnosis: Bleeding disorder (e.g., hemophilia or von Willebrand disease) Justification: Bleeding episodes, easy bruising, and bleeding from cuts/nose indicate a coagulation factor deficiency.  6. Diagnosis: Splenic pathology (e.g., splenic rupture, splenomegaly due to other causes) Justification: Abdominal fullness, tenderness on the left, possibly enlarged spleen contributing to sequestration or bleeding.  7. Diagnosis: Chronic liver disease with coagulopathy Justification: Liver pathology can cause bleeding, bruising, and anemia due to decreased synthesis of clotting factors.  8. Diagnosis: Malignancy with marrow infiltration (e.g., metastatic cancer) Justification: Weight loss and anemia with anemia and bleeding could suggest metastatic involvement affecting marrow or blood cell production.  9. Diagnosis: Aplastic anemia Justification: Pancytopenia leading to anemia, bleeding, and systemic symptoms; however, less likely without mention of cytopenias broadly.  10. Diagnosis: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Justification: Widespread bleeding, anemia, and systemic symptoms may suggest consumptive coagulopathy, especially if secondary to another underlying process.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses measured, sometimes vague language (\u201creally sick,\u201d \u201cfeeling tired,\u201d \u201cnot stopping very quick\u201d) that minimizes the perceived severity of symptoms. His phrases reflect an attempt to remain practical and resistant to displaying vulnerability. - Information flow: He responds directly when asked but tends to hold back additional details unless specifically prompted, indicating reluctance to fully disclose or elaborate. His responses are organized but intentionally limited, consistent with a tendency to downplay. - Response style: His style is straightforward and minimalistic, avoiding emotional elaboration. When describing symptoms like bleeding or fatigue, he emphasizes their persistence but doesn\u2019t express overt distress or concern, exemplifying emotional restraint.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity of his responses and lack of elaboration suggest he\u2019s withholding some emotional or contextual information, perhaps to maintain a tough exterior. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions such as \u201cjust tired\u201d or \u201cnot stopping very quick\u201d and failing to emphasize how drastically symptoms impact his life point to possible minimization of severity. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s little evidence of over-exaggeration; instead, he downplays symptoms, likely due to stoic traits, which reduces perceived urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame, but his pride in handling things himself may prevent full disclosure, especially regarding emotional or sensitive health issues. - Confusion/memory issues: The timeline seems logically consistent; no obvious signs of confusion. - Family influence: No mention of family or external pressure influencing responses; his tone suggests internal stoicism more than external concealment.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is symptom minimization combined with delayed care-seeking, influenced by stoic personality traits. This can lead to underestimation of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014he eventually sought care but is likely underreporting or minimizing the extent of his symptoms. His stoic attitude could delay appropriate urgent intervention. - Areas most affected: Fatigue, bleeding, and weight loss are most susceptible to understatement. Emotional distress may also be underarticulated. - Reliability: The self-report data should be interpreted with caution; objective measures are necessary, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for worse underlying pathology.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient probably masks the true severity of bleeding episodes, emotional impact, and the extent of functional impairment. His tendency to be stoic indicates he may not fully communicate the distress associated with symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Fatigue, bleeding, and weight loss may be more severe; he might not be fully aware of or willing to report the systemic impact. - Concerns probably amplified: His anxiety about serious illnesses like cancer may be heightened, but his stoic response can obscure this. - True timeline: Symptoms are likely worsening more rapidly than reported, especially given his hesitance to express distress and the cultural tendency toward stoicism, which can delay recognition of escalating severity.  In conclusion, this patient\u2019s communication demonstrates a clear pattern of stoic minimization, which requires sensitive exploration to ensure that critical symptoms are not underestimated or overlooked during assessment.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Rapid onset of redness, tearing, and swelling after physical activity suggests infectious conjunctivitis, which is common and often bilateral, especially in communal settings like sports.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are typical, and this often presents acutely post-exposure; it is highly prevalent and contagious but may be slightly less likely if signs point towards bacterial superinfection.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Though less likely given recent activity and acute onset, allergic reactions cause redness and tearing, and can be triggered by environmental exposure.  4. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or trauma Justification: Recent playing soccer raises suspicion of trauma, which can cause redness, swelling, tearing, possibly with pain or foreign body sensation.  5. Diagnosis: Keratitis Justification: An infection of the cornea, often presenting with redness, tearing, and pain, especially following trauma or contact lens use, needs prompt diagnosis to prevent complications.  6. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Inflammation of eyelid margins causes redness and swelling, often chronic but can acutely exacerbate.  7. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Mild, localized eye redness with minimal pain; less likely but considered in differential for eye redness.  8. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Severe swelling, redness, and potential proptosis, usually with systemic signs; less likely given the brief onset and lack of systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Recent activity increases the risk of a foreign body causing irritation, tearing, and redness.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Usually associated with sudden eye pain, headache, nausea, and visual disturbances; less likely based on described symptoms but included for thoroughness.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs straightforward, somewhat clinical language, focusing on physical symptoms without emotional elaboration.

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with systemic symptoms including fatigue, unintentional weight loss, easy bruising, and bleeding episodes such as nosebleeds and slow-healing cuts. They also report abdominal fullness and tenderness on the left side, along with shortness of breath at rest, suggesting possible anemia or underlying hematologic disorder. The patient describes mild ocular symptoms such as redness, swelling, and tearing with minimal discomfort, but communication bias indicates these symptoms may be more severe or impacting vision than reported. Overall, clinical suspicion should include a significant hematologic or systemic pathology, and further diagnostic work-up is warranted to ascertain severity, given the likelihood of underreported symptom burden.1. Diagnosis: Acute Leukemia Justification: The presentation of fatigue, weight loss, easy bruising, bleeding episodes, and anemia signs strongly suggests marrow infiltration by malignant cells typical of leukemia. The systemic symptoms and bleeding align with thrombocytopenia. The ocular symptoms may reflect bleeding or inflammation secondary to hematologic instability. Rapid onset symptoms indicate an acute process, and leukemia is a common cause in adults with these features.  2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma) Justification: Systemic symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal fullness, and tenderness suggest possible lymphadenopathy or organ involvement. Lymphomas can infiltrate marrow and cause constitutional symptoms, bleeding, and systemic signs. Though less specific, lymphoma remains high in differential given systemic and abdominal findings, especially if lymphoid tissue involvement is suspected.  3. Diagnosis: Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Justification: The combination of fatigue, bleeding, easy bruising, and unintentional weight loss could be explained by marrow dysplasia causing ineffective hematopoiesis, leading to cytopenias. MDS often presents in adults with such systemic findings and marrow failure, albeit less acutely than leukemia.  4. Diagnosis: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Justification: The mild ocular signs and systemic symptoms can fit with CLL, which often presents with fatigue, bruising, and sometimes splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. However, the acuity and severity lean somewhat away from CLL, which tends to have a more indolent course but remains possible.  5. Diagnosis: Hemophilia or Coagulopathy Justification: Bleeding episodes and easy bruising could hint at a bleeding disorder; however, systemic constitutional symptoms like weight loss and abdominal fullness are less typical for isolated coagulopathies. These are included as less probable causes given systemic involvement but considered due to bleeding prominence.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: They tend to use vague and understated language such as \"not really bothering me all the time,\" and downplay symptoms with phrases like \"kinda there\" or \"not that bad.\" When discussing their eye condition, they mention feeling \"a little more tired\" or their eyes being \"more swollen,\" but these descriptions lack urgency. - Information flow: Their responses are often brief, with a tendency to withhold details unless prompted directly. They seem reluctant to elaborate on symptoms that may carry emotional weight or cause embarrassment, such as bleeding or eye appearance. - Response style: Responses are generally minimal and direct but sometimes avoid full disclosure, signaling a preference to limit emotional exposure and possibly maintain a stoic facade. They tend not to volunteer extra details beyond what is asked.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent brevity and reluctance to expand on symptoms like eye discomfort or fatigue suggest withholding. The patient dismisses or soft-pedals symptoms, indicating possible denial or fear. - Minimization behaviors: They describe their symptoms as \"not really bothering me all the time\" and \"kinda there,\" which downplays their real discomfort, especially given their physical findings. - Amplification patterns: There are no clear signs of exaggeration; rather, their responses tend to understate severity, consistent with minimization bias. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The hesitance to discuss eye swelling or bleeding in detail suggests some discomfort or shame around these topics. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident timeline inconsistencies, but their brief responses may mask underlying uncertainty. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but their stoic demeanor suggests a cultural or personality-based tendency to self-manage and underreport.

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with systemic symptoms including fatigue, lightheadedness, unintentional weight loss, easy bruising, and bleeding episodes such as nosebleeds and slow-healing cuts. They also report persistent eye swelling and redness with mild increased tiredness, though they deny any vision changes or pain. Communication patterns suggest these symptoms may be more severe than described, potentially indicating underlying hematologic pathology such as anemia with bleeding tendencies. The timeline indicates these symptoms have been gradually worsening over recent weeks, but the patient perceives them as stable or mild, likely underestimating their true impact. Objective findings point toward a significant systemic process possibly affecting blood counts and vascular stability. Further diagnostic evaluation is necessary to determine the severity and underlying cause, with attention to potential concealed symptoms of anemia or ongoing bleeding that may not be fully reported.1. Diagnosis: Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) Justification: The prominent bleeding signs \u2014 easy bruising, nosebleeds, slow-healing cuts, and petechiae (implied by bruising) \u2014 suggest thrombocytopenia. The systemic features like fatigue and weight loss may relate to bone marrow suppression or immune-mediated destruction. The eye swelling and redness could be secondary to systemic bleeding or vasculitis. ITP is high on the differential given isolated thrombocytopenia with bleeding symptoms and absence of other coagulopathy signs.  2. Diagnosis: Hematologic Malignancy (e.g., Leukemia) Justification: Unintentional weight loss, fatigue, easy bruising, bleeding episodes, and progressive symptoms are classic features of leukemia. These patients often exhibit pancytopenia affecting all cell lines, leading to bleeding, anemia, and constitutional symptoms. The systemic nature and gradual progression over weeks support this.  3. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) Justification: Persistent eye swelling and redness with systemic symptoms could indicate vasculitis affecting small vessels, causing mucocutaneous bleeding and systemic involvement. Vasculitis can lead to hemorrhages, nasal bleeding, and constitutional symptoms. The eye findings and systemic signs fit this diagnosis.  4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Vitamin K deficiency, Liver disease) Justification: Bleeding tendency, easy bruising, and slow-healing cuts are typical. Fatigue and weight loss are less specific, but if liver dysfunction or nutritional deficiencies are suspected, coagulopathy should be considered. However, absence of explicit liver-related signs makes this less likely but still possible.  5. Diagnosis: Systemic Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) Justification: SLE can present with systemic fatigue, weight loss, hematologic abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, anemia), mucocutaneous bleeding, and eye involvement due to vasculitis or serositis. Given the multisystem involvement, autoimmune disease remains a plausible diagnosis, especially if other features or antibody evidence manifest.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He tends to use vague and mild descriptors, such as \"not really bothering\" or \"kind of steady,\" indicating an attempt to minimize discomfort and severity. He avoids detailed descriptions of worse symptoms, possibly out of embarrassment or a desire to appear stoic. - Information flow: Responses tend to be limited and minimal, with some hesitation to fully disclose the impact of symptoms. He only provides detailed information when prompted directly, suggesting controlled information sharing. - Response style: Usually concise and guarded, with a tendency to answer questions briefly and avoid elaboration unless explicitly pressed, which may limit understanding of the true symptom burden.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent understatement of symptom severity, trying not to alarm the clinician; reluctance to describe worsening or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Repeated phrases like \"not really bothering me,\" \"kind of steady,\" or \"doesn't really change,\" which downplay intensity, suggesting he perceives overemphasizing as a sign of weakness or overreaction. - Amplification patterns: None observed; the patient consistently minimizes rather than magnifies symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation when discussing eye swelling and bleeding, indicating possible discomfort or shame about these symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Not applicable; responses are internally motivated and self-controlled.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias dominates, as he appears intent on downplaying the severity of his symptoms and impact, perhaps to maintain independence or avoid worry. - Severity: Moderate, because underestimation of symptoms risks under-treatment; certain symptoms like bleeding and eye swelling may be more severe than he reports. - Areas most affected: Eye swelling and bleeding, which could indicate more significant pathology but are understated here. - Reliability: Moderate to low; clinical findings and further assessment are essential to verify his true condition, since self-report likely underrepresents actual severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The actual severity and impact of eye swelling and bleeding episodes, as he minimizes their significance. There may be more discomfort or functional impairment than he admits. - Symptoms probably minimized: Eye swelling, bleeding severity, and possibly fatigue levels, which might be more debilitating in reality. - Concerns probably amplified: His fear of serious illness (e.g., cancer) may be genuine, but he minimizes the physical burden to appear resilient. - True timeline: Symptoms are worsening over weeks, but underreporting hampers accurate understanding of progression. Clinical examination and lab data are necessary to clarify true severity and guide management.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's tendency to minimize symptoms and understatement of severity, I should ask a focused, yet sensitive question to clarify the true impact of eye swelling and bleeding episodes.

I need to understand if there are episodes of heavy bleeding or worsening eye symptoms that the patient might be downplaying, and I should explore triggers, associated discomfort, and functional impact to gather more precise data. Since the patient appears guarded, framing the question to prompt detailed, honest responses without making him feel judged will be important.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact severity and frequency of eye swelling and bleeding episodes, their impact on daily life, and whether there are episodes with increased intensity or related triggers. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating between benign versus serious causes\u2014significant bleeding may indicate severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, while eye vasculitis suggests vasculitis. - Patient factors: The patient's guarded and minimization attitude suggests questions should explicitly target worst episodes and functional limitations to elicit more complete information. - Interview phase goals: To clarify the true severity, duration, and impact of the eye and bleeding symptoms, ensuring that underreported symptoms are uncovered.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions that invite the patient to describe the severity, frequency, and impact, while prompting him to consider episodes he might not have mentioned. - Information target: Severity of eye swelling and redness, frequency and severity of bleeding episodes, impact on daily activities, and any triggers or factors that worsen or improve symptoms. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental phrasing, emphasizing understanding of how symptoms affect his life, and gently encouraging honest disclosure. - Expected value: Clarifies whether symptoms are more severe than reported; identifies episodes that could point to life-threatening or urgent conditions; helps refine differential diagnosis and urgency of further testing.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me if you've ever had an episode where your eye swelling or redness got significantly worse, maybe enough to impact your eyesight or make you feel unwell? Also, about your bleeding\u2014have there been times when it was heavier or lasted longer than usual, and how did that affect your day? I want to understand whether these situations are occasional or happen more often, and if there\u2019s anything that seems to make them better or worse, like certain activities or times of day. Even if you think these episodes aren\u2019t serious, please share any details that might help me understand how they\u2019re really affecting you.\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He tends to use vague and mild descriptors, such as \"not really bothering\" or \"kind of steady,\" indicating an attempt to minimize discomfort and severity. He avoids detailed descriptions of worse symptoms, possibly out of embarrassment or a desire to appear stoic. - Information flow: Responses tend to be limited and minimal, with some hesitation to fully disclose the impact of symptoms. He only provides detailed information when prompted directly, suggesting controlled information sharing. - Response style: Usually concise and guarded, with a tendency to answer questions briefly and avoid elaboration unless explicitly pressed, which may limit understanding of the true symptom burden.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent understatement of symptom severity, trying not to alarm the clinician; reluctance to describe worsening or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Repeated phrases like \"not really bothering me,\" \"kind of steady,\" or \"doesn't really change,\" which downplay intensity, suggesting he perceives overemphasizing as a sign of weakness or overreaction. - Amplification patterns: None observed; the patient consistently minimizes rather than magnifies symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation when discussing eye swelling and bleeding, indicating possible discomfort or shame about these symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Not applicable; responses are internally motivated and self-controlled.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias dominates, as he appears intent on downplaying the severity of his symptoms and impact, perhaps to maintain independence or avoid worry. - Severity: Moderate, because underestimation of symptoms risks under-treatment; certain symptoms like bleeding and eye swelling may be more severe than he reports. - Areas most affected: Eye swelling and bleeding, which could indicate more significant pathology but are understated here. - Reliability: Moderate to low; clinical findings and further assessment are essential to verify his true condition, since self-report likely underrepresents actual severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The actual severity and impact of eye swelling and bleeding episodes, as he minimizes their significance. There may be more discomfort or functional impairment than he admits. - Symptoms probably minimized: Eye swelling, bleeding severity, and possibly fatigue levels, which might be more debilitating in reality. - Concerns probably amplified: His fear of serious illness (e.g., cancer) may be genuine, but he minimizes the physical burden to appear resilient. - True timeline: Symptoms are worsening over weeks, but underreporting hampers accurate understanding of progression. Clinical examination and lab data are necessary to clarify true severity and guide management.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with systemic symptoms including fatigue, pallor, unintentional weight loss, easy bruising, and recurrent bleeding episodes such as nosebleeds and prolonged bleeding from minor cuts, occurring approximately once or twice weekly. They also report persistent, steady swelling and mild redness of the eyes, with no current vision changes or pain. Although the patient describes these symptoms as mild or manageable, communication patterns suggest they may be minimizing their severity, and actual symptom burden could be greater. The clinical picture indicates a likely underlying hematologic condition affecting blood counts and coagulation, with systemic and ocular manifestations that warrant further detailed evaluation through laboratory tests and specialist assessments.Acute or Chronic Leukemia ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses minimalistic, vague, and clinically neutral language, such as \"a little sometimes,\" \"not like I got anything bad,\" and \"nothing serious,\" which indicates an intent to downplay symptoms. The descriptions are straightforward but avoid emotional depth. - Information flow: The patient responds in a guarded, organized manner, providing just enough detail in response to direct questions but withholding fuller emotional or functional impacts. They seem reluctant to elaborate unless specifically prompted. - Response style: The responses are concise, minimally elaborated, and mostly factual, reflecting a tendency to avoid emotional disclosure and to focus on factual descriptions.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Consistent downplaying of symptom severity (\"small cuts,\" \"a little swelling\") suggests underreporting of the true clinical picture. - Minimization behaviors: The patient explicitly minimizes symptom impact, asserting they \"deal with it\" and symptoms are \"not that bad,\" which obscures the severity of their condition. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of over-worry or exaggeration; the patient maintains a calm, reserved demeanor, implying withdrawal from emotional expression rather than amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; their reluctance appears driven by stoicism rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of difficulty with timelines or facts. - Family influence: No apparent influence on responses, as they speak in a self-contained manner.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, based on the consistent downplaying of symptoms and avoidance of emotional impact. - Severity: Moderate, as this bias affects the clinical assessment but doesn\u2019t completely obscure the key clinical issues. - Areas most affected: Bleeding and eye symptoms are most minimized; this could lead to underestimation of disease severity. - Reliability: Moderate; self-reporting is biased toward underestimation, so clinical evaluation and objective testing are essential.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The full severity and frequency of bleeding episodes and eye symptoms, possibly indicating more serious or ongoing issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Bleeding could be more intense or frequent, and eye symptoms potentially more bothersome or affecting vision. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s fears are masked by stoicism; they might be more distressed or worried internally than they admit. - True timeline: Symptoms may have developed more rapidly or severely than reported, due to their tendency to understate or minimize issues. Overall, the patient\u2019s guarded communication style complicates accurate clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The patient's actual severity and frequency of bleeding episodes and eye symptoms, especially if they are minimized. Also, the patient's understanding of their symptoms and concerns about diagnosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming whether systemic bleeding symptoms and eye findings meet criteria for hematologic disorders like leukemia, which require threshold symptom severity and laboratory evidence. - Patient factors: The guarded, minimalistic communication style indicates a tendency to understate symptoms, so questions must be probing yet gentle to avoid pushing them away. - Interview phase goals: Obtain definitive details about symptom severity, impact, and patient's understanding to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis and prepare for management discussion.
