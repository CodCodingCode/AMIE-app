    "input": "An adult female presents with a one-week history of fever, fatigue, and severe right-sided facial pain described as stabbing and intense, with recent appearance of unilateral skin blisters on the affected area. These findings are consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), likely involving neuralgia and cutaneous lesions. While her report indicates significant discomfort and systemic symptoms, her communication suggests possible emotional amplification of symptom severity. No neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or visual changes have been reported, but targeted assessment is warranted to rule out complications. Further examination of skin lesions and neurological function is recommended to confirm diagnosis and evaluate for any neurological involvement.1. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Justification: Presence of unilateral skin blisters over facial area with severe stabbing pain and systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue strongly suggests herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve.  2. Diagnosis: Trigeminal Neuralgia Justification: Severe facial pain suggests neuralgia; however, the presence of skin blisters points toward herpes zoster rather than classical trigeminal neuralgia, making this less likely as primary diagnosis but worth considering if blisters are absent.  3. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or bacterial skin infection Justification: Unilateral skin erythema and blistering could be infected skin, but the pain quality and systemic symptoms favor herpes zoster.  4. Diagnosis: Dental abscess or odontogenic infection Justification: Facial pain can originate from dental issues; however, the skin blisters and fever align more with herpes zoster.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic dermatitis or contact dermatitis Justification: Could cause skin changes, but does not typically produce systemic symptoms like fever and severe neural pain.  6. Diagnosis: Bell\u2019s palsy with secondary infection Justification: Facial nerve paralysis is absent, and skin blisters suggest herpes zoster rather than Bell's palsy.  7. Diagnosis: Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome Justification: Rare facial swelling and pain, but typically involves recurrent facial paralysis and orofacial edema, less fitting here.  8. Diagnosis: Neurosyphilis Justification: Can cause facial pain, but systemic symptoms and skin lesions are less characteristic.  9. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis Justification: Can involve facial pain via neurogenic pathways, but skin blisters are not typical, making this unlikely.  10. Diagnosis: Herpetic Whitlow (less likely, as involves finger lesions) Justification: Skin lesions are on the face, not fingers; thus, less relevant.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally expressive, detailed language (\"excruciating,\" \"like stabbing with a hot poker\"). Her descriptions are specific regarding pain location and sensation, though she also states \"feeling really terrible,\" which, while intense, is somewhat vague compared to detailed pain descriptors. - Information flow: She responds promptly and in detail, voluntarily providing a clear timeline and symptom description, indicating openness and willingness to share. Her responses are organized, following a logical progression from initial symptoms to current discomfort. - Response style: Her responses are elaborated and direct when describing her symptoms, with evident emotional engagement. She occasionally interjects to express her worry, revealing her distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant evidence; she appears to volunteer comprehensive information. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal - she emphasizes pain severity rather than downplaying symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Some amplification in her emotional descriptors (\"terrible,\" \"excruciating\") which could reflect genuine distress or a tendency to focus on discomfort. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; she seems comfortable describing her symptoms openly. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight confusion expressed (\"feeling a bit confused, like my mind isn\u2019t quite clear\"), which may reflect true cognitive discomfort due to pain or anxiety, rather than forgetting or hiding details. - Family influence: Not evident in this interaction.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild amplification bias, driven by her anxiety and distress about her symptoms. She may overstate severity due to emotional distress but provides consistent details. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences her perception of severity, but her report is coherent. - Areas most affected: Her concern about neurological involvement and the severity of pain are possibly exaggerated influences of her anxiety. - Reliability: Fairly reliable; her detailed descriptions support her report but must be contextualized with her emotional state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully understand or may have heightened fears about nerve or brain involvement; her concerns about severity could be overestimated. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident\u2014she appears to describe her pain and symptoms comprehensively and vividly. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about brain or nerve damage may be disproportionate, influenced by her anxiety. - True timeline: The progression fits typical shingles presentation with post-herpetic neuralgia risk; no inconsistencies noted, but her emotional amplification may exaggerate her perceived severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: Using systematic reasoning, I recognize that the current clinical picture includes detailed information about her facial pain, systemic symptoms, and skin lesions suggestive of herpes zoster. However, to enhance diagnostic confidence and understand her overall experience, I need to explore how her symptoms have developed over time, her emotional response, and her understanding. Considering her expressive language and emotional distress, I should gently ask her to elaborate on how her symptoms have changed from the start, focusing on her perceptions and feelings, which will help establish rapport and gather more context. In terms of question type, an open-ended question that invites her to narrate her experience will be most effective at this stage, fostering trust and detailed elaboration. My goal is to understand her perspective on symptom progression and current concerns, which will inform both diagnostic considerations and her emotional well-being.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Open-ended, narrative-focused question - Target: Symptom timeline, emotional impact, her perception of severity, any recent changes - Approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing to respect her expressed distress and encourage elaboration - Expected value: Gaining insight into the course of her symptoms and her emotional state, clarifying the development and progression of her condition to support diagnosis and reassurance\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed since they first started, and how you've been feeling overall as this has progressed?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Recent trauma during soccer increases likelihood; presents with redness, tearing, possibly pain, common after foreign body injury during play.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Common cause of eye redness and tearing; can be viral or allergic; less likely acutely post-trauma but common in general.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic hyphema Justification: Eye swelling after trauma; blood in anterior chamber may cause redness and swelling; considered if pain or visual changes are noted.  4. Diagnosis: Globe rupture Justification: Serious emergency from trauma with eye redness, swelling, tearing; risk after sports injury, potential for vision-threatening complications.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness could indicate infection in the orbit; often associated with systemic symptoms, but less likely without fever or pain out of proportion.  6. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Trauma during soccer can result in foreign objects; causes redness, tearing, and discomfort; needs targeted examination.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Presents with redness, tearing, and pain; can occur idiopathically or due to trauma; somewhat less common acutely post-injury.  8. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Deep eye pain and redness; usually more persistent; less common acutely in sports-related trauma.  9. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Red eye and tearing; symptoms more often include pain, halos, and visual impairment; less likely without other signs.  10. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness of eyelids; may follow trauma; less likely if signs of deeper orbital involvement are absent.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses intense, emotionally charged words like \"excruciating,\" \"like someone\u2019s stabbing me,\" indicating genuine pain and distress. She uses \"just\" when describing the location, which may minimize complexity but not the severity. Overall, her language balances specific clinical descriptors with emotional emphasis. - Information flow: She offers a clear, chronological account of symptoms without much prompting, showing an organized and forthcoming response style. She appears to volunteer relevant details indicating openness but frames her narrative to highlight her distress. - Response style: She answers directly but emphasizes her pain and discomfort with emotional descriptors. Her responses are elaborate when describing pain but concise regarding the timeline, which suggests focus on her main concern\u2014severe pain.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There's minimal evidence of withholding here; she seems open but cautious.

    "input": "The patient presents with a one-week history of fever and fatigue, followed by the development of severe right-sided pain described as stabbing and increasing in intensity, with blister formation on the right side several days prior to presentation. The patient reports experiencing unusual sensations in the eye, but details are vague; further assessment is needed to determine any visual or neurological deficits. Communication patterns suggest that some neurological or ocular symptoms may be underreported or minimally described, indicating the need for detailed examination and gentle, targeted questioning to uncover potential underlying issues.1. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Justification: The development of severe, stabbing pain localized to one side, along with blister formation on the right, is characteristic of herpes zoster involving a dermatomal distribution. The vague eye sensations may indicate ocular involvement (herpes zoster ophthalmicus), which is common with trigeminal nerve involvement. The timeline of symptoms, including blistering several days prior to presentation, supports reactivation of varicella-zoster virus affecting nerve and skin tissues.  2. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus Justification: Unusual eye sensations, although vague, raise concern for ocular involvement due to herpes zoster affecting the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. This condition can cause ocular pain, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or uveitis, and is a serious complication that warrants consideration given the neurological sensory symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial Superinfection of Blisters (e.g., Cellulitis or Impetigo) Justification: The blister formation could be superinfected skin lesions, especially if the patient scratched or if bacteria colonized the vesicles. This remains a consideration, although the primary presentation aligns more strongly with herpes zoster.  4. Diagnosis: Vasculitis or Autoimmune Skin/Nerve Disease Justification: Less likely but possible; systemic autoimmune conditions can cause vascular inflammation leading to skin ulcerations or nerve symptoms. However, these typically have a more chronic course and less of the rapid blistering pattern described here.  5. Diagnosis: Peripheral Neurogenic or Neurological Causes (e.g., Nerve Compression) Justification: The vague sensations and localized pain could be from nerve compression or other neurological causes. Nonetheless, the presence of blistering and the specific pain pattern make infectious etiologies more probable.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged words like \"really terrible,\" \"excruciating,\" \"weird stuff,\" indicating strong distress but also some vagueness to possibly mask specifics. Her emphasis on severity (\"really bad,\" \"excruciating\") suggests amplification of pain, whereas her vague mention of eye symptoms hints at possible minimization or embarrassment. - Information flow: She tends to initially withhold details, offering brief, non-specific responses (\"not quite myself,\" \"weird stuff with my eye\") unless prompted, which indicates reluctance or discomfort. During direct questioning, responses are concise and sometimes vague, showing limited spontaneous disclosure. - Response style: Her responses are straightforward but sometimes non-committal (\"I noticed some weird stuff\"), with occasional hesitation, especially about sensitive topics like ocular sensations. She tends to answer questions directly but avoids elaboration unless pressed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal elaboration about her eye symptoms despite prompting, indicating possible embarrassment or uncertainty about their relevance, or fear about revealing neurological issues. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying or vague descriptions of neurological sensations (\"some weird stuff,\" \"not quite myself\") suggest she might be minimizing or uncertain regarding these aspects. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity of pain (\"really bad,\" \"excruciating,\" \"worse than before\") to communicate distress, which could be genuine or intended to ensure the doctor perceives the seriousness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation to mention eye symptoms and initial reluctance to describe her overall feeling suggests some discomfort or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: Her description of the timeline appears consistent, but her vague descriptions of \"weird stuff\" could indicate some uncertainty or mild confusion about neurological sensations. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence affecting responses; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate under-reporting of neurological symptoms due to possible embarrassment, combined with amplification of pain to highlight distress. - Severity: Moderate, as she tends to conceal details of neurological symptoms and emphasizes pain severity\u2014potentially over-exaggerating pain but underplaying other neurological concerns. - Areas most affected: Neurological and ocular symptoms are the most biased areas, given reluctance to fully disclose eye sensations and potential neurological involvement. - Reliability: Moderate; her reports are consistent regarding pain severity but may be incomplete or understated concerning neurological and ocular symptoms, affecting full clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about neurological symptoms like vision changes, dizziness, weakness, or nausea are probably underreported, because she hesitates or dismisses them as \"weird stuff\" or \"not quite myself.\" - Symptoms probably minimized: Neurological signs, especially those related to brain or nerve involvement, may be understated. Her discomfort in discussing eye symptoms could mask significant neurological findings. - Concerns probably amplified: Pain descriptions are likely accurate or slightly exaggerated due to her emotional distress, but her concern about \"worse\" pain and fear of neurological damage may be overemphasized. - True timeline: The major symptoms (fever, pain, blisters) likely align with her report, but the neurological symptoms might have been more significant than expressed; her vague reports suggest potential unspoken issues.",

    "input": "An adult female presents with a one-week history of systemic symptoms including fever and fatigue, followed by the development of sharp, stabbing right-sided facial pain and localized skin blistering. She reports mild ocular discomfort characterized by occasional blurriness and redness, and feelings of being \"not quite herself,\" including cognitive fog, but denies significant visual loss, double vision, light sensitivity, or pain. Communication suggests she may be minimizing or withholding more severe ocular or neurological symptoms, such as subtle visual field deficits, cranial nerve involvement, or sensory disturbances. The clinical picture warrants thorough neurological and ophthalmologic evaluation to assess for possible underlying neuro-ophthalmologic or central nervous system involvement, considering that her guarded responses may obscure the true extent of her neurological status.1. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus Justification: The combination of recent systemic symptoms, followed by facial pain with a vesicular rash localized to the ophthalmic dermatome, and mild ocular discomfort suggests herpes zoster involving the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The skin blistering supports reactivation of varicella-zoster virus, and ocular symptoms indicate possible ocular surface or anterior segment involvement, common in ophthalmic zoster. The neurological symptoms such as foggy cognition are likely nonspecific or due to systemic illness, but ocular involvement is a key discriminator.  2. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster (general, without ocular involvement) Justification: The systemic symptoms with a unilateral vesicular rash on the face are characteristic of herpes zoster. The presence of facial pain prior to or with rash is typical. The mild ocular symptoms could represent early ocular involvement before more significant ophthalmic complications develop.  3. Diagnosis: Viral encephalitis (possible herpes simplex virus) Justification: The systemic symptoms, cognitive fog, and systemic prodrome raise concern for central nervous system viral infection. Given herpes simplex virus's propensity for encephalitis, especially in the early stages, this must be considered. However, lack of focal neurological deficits or severe confusion reduces immediacy, but it's still plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Bell's Palsy or trigeminal neuralgia Justification: While facial pain and possible cranial nerve involvement could suggest neuralgic conditions, the vesicular rash is not characteristic of Bell's or trigeminal neuralgia alone. The vesicles strongly suggest herpes zoster.  5. Diagnosis: Bacterial facial cellulitis Justification: Although facial skin infection can cause pain and erythema, the vesicular rash and systemic symptoms point away from typical bacterial cellulitis. Vesiculobullous skin findings support a viral etiology over bacterial cellulitis.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague and mild descriptors (\"kind of itchy,\" \"a little red,\" \"sort of uncomfortable\") when discussing her eye symptoms, which reduces perceived seriousness. Her pain description is vivid and emotional, emphasizing distress. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant, offering limited details about her eye unless pressed, indicating withholding. Her responses are concise and somewhat guarded, with organized but minimal explanations. - Response style: She provides direct answers but qualifies or minimizes her symptoms, showing restraint to avoid over-appearing vulnerable, likely out of concern or embarrassment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her explicit statement about not wanting to say much about her eye suggests active withholding of neurological symptoms that may be critical. Her vague descriptions further support this. - Minimization behaviors: Describes her eye issues as \"kind of itchy\" and \"a little red,\" which may under-represent potential neurological or ocular severity. - Amplification patterns: Her depiction of pain as \"excruciating\" and likening it to a stabbing indicates emotional exaggeration, possibly driven by fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation to discuss her eye symptoms fully hints at discomfort or shame, possibly feeling vulnerable about neurological issues. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports feeling \"not quite myself\" and \"kind of foggy,\" supporting some mild cognitive or neurological discomfort that might be more significant than she's comfortable sharing. - Family influence: Not directly observable but her worries about her health affect her tone; she appears to want to manage disclosures carefully.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is *minimization*, especially regarding neurological symptoms, compounded by emotional distress that might distort her perception of severity. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 she underreports her eye symptoms, which are potentially serious, although her pain and confusion are appreciable and consistent. - Areas most affected: Neurological symptoms like eye discomfort and cognitive fog, as she underplays and withholds details, are most biased. - Reliability: Moderate; her pain reports are credible, but neurological signs need cautious interpretation due to active minimization and reluctance to disclose fully.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully disclosing neurological signs such as vision changes, more severe eye pain, or cognitive deficits, which are crucial for assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her eye symptoms could be more significant, indicating CNS involvement, but she dismisses or downplays these. - Concerns probably amplified: Her pain and confusion seem emotionally magnified, perhaps out of fear, but may lead to overestimation of severity. - True timeline: The background sequence seems accurate but may not capture subtle neurological progression; her reluctance skews the clarity of the actual severity and evolution.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: To accurately distinguish herpes zoster ophthalmicus from other viral or neurological conditions, I need details about the characteristics of her eye symptoms, particularly whether she has experienced vision changes, ocular pain, or other signs of ocular involvement.

Her pain description is vivid and emotional, emphasizing distress. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant, offering limited details about her eye unless pressed, indicating withholding. Her responses are concise and somewhat guarded, with organized but minimal explanations. - Response style: She provides direct answers but qualifies or minimizes her symptoms, showing restraint to avoid over-appearing vulnerable, likely out of concern or embarrassment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her explicit statement about not wanting to say much about her eye suggests active withholding of neurological symptoms that may be critical. Her vague descriptions further support this. - Minimization behaviors: Describes her eye issues as \"kind of itchy\" and \"a little red,\" which may under-represent potential neurological or ocular severity. - Amplification patterns: Her depiction of pain as \"excruciating\" and likening it to a stabbing indicates emotional exaggeration, possibly driven by fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation to discuss her eye symptoms fully hints at discomfort or shame, possibly feeling vulnerable about neurological issues. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports feeling \"not quite myself\" and \"kind of foggy,\" supporting some mild cognitive or neurological discomfort that might be more significant than she's comfortable sharing. - Family influence: Not directly observable but her worries about her health affect her tone; she appears to want to manage disclosures carefully.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is *minimization*, especially regarding neurological symptoms, compounded by emotional distress that might distort her perception of severity. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 she underreports her eye symptoms, which are potentially serious, although her pain and confusion are appreciable and consistent. - Areas most affected: Neurological symptoms like eye discomfort and cognitive fog, as she underplays and withholds details, are most biased. - Reliability: Moderate; her pain reports are credible, but neurological signs need cautious interpretation due to active minimization and reluctance to disclose fully.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully disclosing neurological signs such as vision changes, more severe eye pain, or cognitive deficits, which are crucial for assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her eye symptoms could be more significant, indicating CNS involvement, but she dismisses or downplays these. - Concerns probably amplified: Her pain and confusion seem emotionally magnified, perhaps out of fear, but may lead to overestimation of severity. - True timeline: The background sequence seems accurate but may not capture subtle neurological progression; her reluctance skews the clarity of the actual severity and evolution.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Traumatic conjunctivitis/eyelid contusion ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Prefers vague, hedging language like \"kind of\" and \"a little,\" likely to avoid alarming the clinician or out of embarrassment, yet uses emotionally charged descriptors for pain. - Information flow: Tends to wait for direct questions, with selective disclosure on sensitive topics like eye and neurological issues; overall responses are organized but tentatively expressed. - Response style: Slightly minimal and cautious, often elaborating only when prompted, indicating reluctance to fully share.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitant about describing visual or neurological symptoms, possibly to avoid drawing attention or due to uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Use of qualifiers (\"just sort of,\" \"kind of\") when discussing symptoms, suppressing perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: Emphasizes pain (\u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cexcruciating\u201d), heightening pain severity to communicate distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance or scant details about eye discomfort and neurological concerns suggests discomfort discussing these topics. - Confusion/memory issues: Mild disorientation is acknowledged with vague language, consistency is maintained, but the emotional tone suggests genuine concern. - Family influence: No clear influence found.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Predominantly information withholding and mild minimization, driven by anxiety, worry, and embarrassment about neurological symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as she withholds some details but provides enough for clinical suspicion. - Areas most affected: Neurological and ocular symptoms are tainted with caution and understatement, which could underestimate disease severity. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are influenced by emotional state and tendency to downplay, so objective assessments are essential.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of her neurological and eye symptoms, potentially underreporting severity or specific deficits. - Symptoms probably minimized: The neurological and visual disturbances may be more severe than reported, risking underdiagnosis or delayed intervention. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about CNS involvement might cause her to focus on worst-case scenarios, leading to emotional over-worrying. - True timeline: The progression is probably more intense; her cautious responses suggest she might be experiencing more profound or persistent neurological symptoms than she admits.  This detailed analysis underscores the importance of corroborating her subjective report with objective neurological examination and possibly neuroimaging, given her guarded communication style regarding sensitive neurological symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's tendencies to hedge and minimize symptoms, I need to ask focused, clarifying questions that help confirm or rule out neurological and vision-related criteria pertinent to my leading diagnosis. I want to gently probe for specific signs such as visual disturbances, neurological deficits, the onset and course of symptoms, as well as how her symptoms impact her daily function. Since she hesitates or minimizes, framing questions that acknowledge her discomfort while encouraging frank disclosure is essential. Additionally, exploring any previous neurological or eye issues will inform diagnostic confidence. Confirming whether her symptoms are sudden or gradual, persistent or intermittent, helps differentiate possible diagnoses. I should also assess her understanding and concerns, and make her comfortable with discussing sensitive topics directly related to neurological symptoms.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise description and severity of neurological, visual, or sensory symptoms; timing and progression; functional impact; previous history of similar issues. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm presence or absence of neurological deficits, visual changes, and symptom onset characteristics to differentiate neurological causes from other eye or systemic conditions. - Patient factors: Her hesitancy and minimization suggest the need for gentle, non-judgmental framing, encouraging openness without pressure. - Interview phase goals: Gather final confirmation on neurological and visual symptoms, assess the potential severity or red flags, and gauge her comfort level with discussing symptoms before moving to diagnosis and management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about specific neurosensory symptoms, timing, and functional impact. Use open-ended prompts initially, then very targeted closed questions to clarify critical points. - Information target: Onset, duration, character, severity, and impact of neurological and vision symptoms; previous episodes; any associated systemic symptoms. - Communication approach: Frame questions empathetically to reduce anxiety and maximize honest disclosure, perhaps referencing her reluctance, e.g., \"I want to make sure I understand everything clearly, so I may ask you about some specific symptoms.\" - Expected value: Clarify the presence and gravity of neurological symptoms, strengthening diagnostic certainty, and guiding appropriate further testing or reassurance.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that. Have you noticed whether your vision changes happen suddenly, like blacking out or seeing double quickly, or do they come on gradually over time? Also, have you experienced any new weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs, or any trouble with your coordination or balance? I want to understand if you've noticed any persistent or worsening neurological symptoms, even if you haven\u2019t mentioned them before.\"",
