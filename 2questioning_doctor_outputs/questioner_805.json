    "input": "An adult female patient presents with a history of heavy vaginal bleeding characterized by large blood clots and associated symptoms including dizziness, visual disturbances, and palpitations. Her communication indicates significant concern and anxiety, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity; therefore, objective assessment\u2014including vital signs and laboratory evaluation\u2014is essential to determine her hemodynamic status. While her reported symptoms suggest possible hypovolemia, the actual severity requires clinical confirmation, and she may be underreporting other physical signs of blood loss. The clinical approach should include stabilizing her hemodynamically, obtaining objective data, and addressing her emotional distress to ensure accurate assessment and management.1. Diagnosis: Uterine fibroids causing menorrhagia Justification: Heavy bleeding with large clots is typical of fibroid-related menorrhagia, common in women of reproductive age, often causing significant blood loss.  2. Diagnosis: Anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding (e.g., hormonal imbalance) Justification: Hormonal fluctuations can lead to heavy, irregular bleeding, especially in women of reproductive age, contributing to clot formation.  3. Diagnosis: Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma Justification: Irregular or heavy bleeding, especially in women over 40, raises concern for endometrial pathology including hyperplasia or malignancy.  4. Diagnosis: Miscarriage or threatened pregnancy-related bleeding Justification: Spontaneous abortion can present with heavy bleeding and clots; pregnancy status needs confirmation.  5. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., von Willebrand disease, platelet disorder) Justification: Bleeding that is excessively heavy supports a bleeding disorder as an underlying cause, particularly if bleeding is disproportionate to menstrual cycle.  6. Diagnosis: Endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids Justification: Structural uterine lesions can cause heavy bleeding and large clots, contributing to anemia symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Uterine or cervical malignancy Justification: Postmenopausal women or those with risk factors can present with abnormal bleeding; although less common in premenopausal women, it\u2019s an important \u201ccan't miss\u201d diagnosis.  8. Diagnosis: Hormonal contraceptive failure or side effects Justification: Alterations in hormonal regulation can lead to irregular, heavy bleeding, especially if the patient is using hormonal therapies.  9. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with associated bleeding Justification: Although PID typically presents with discharge and pain, severe cases can cause bleeding and systemic symptoms; unlikely here given the presentation but worth considering.  10. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervical trauma or bleeding lesions Justification: Local trauma can cause bleeding; less likely unless there's a history of recent trauma or sexual activity, which is not indicated here.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally laden and vivid language (\"really scared,\" \"pass out,\" \"might die\") that amplifies her perceived severity of her condition. Her descriptions are detailed and direct, reflecting actual distress without minimizing symptoms. - Information flow: She freely and elaborately discloses her symptoms and fears; her responses are organized but highly emotionally charged, indicating she is highly motivated to convey urgency. - Response style: Her responses are lengthy, expressive, and somewhat frantic, consistent with high anxiety levels. She emphasizes her fears and physical sensations vividly, which suggests she is seeking reassurance but also overwhelmed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None; she openly shares her condition and fears. - Minimization behaviors: None observed; she emphasizes symptom severity, possibly overemphasizing her physical sensations but not downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: Clear evidence\u2014she uses words like \"really scared\" and \"might die,\" suggesting her perception of danger is heightened by her anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs; she appears unrestrained in her distress. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent; her narrative is coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Not evident; responses seem internally motivated, driven by her own feelings of fear.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014her intense anxiety is leading her to perceive her symptoms as more dangerous than they might objectively be. - Severity: Moderate to severe\u2014her high distress and the vividness of her fears suggest significant influence of emotional bias, which could distort clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Her perception of bleeding severity and mortality risk; these are likely exaggerated by her anxiety, although her physical complaints are rooted in real symptoms. - Reliability: Her self-report is valuable but must be interpreted cautiously; the emotional overlay may inflate perceived danger, necessitating objective clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully aware of her actual blood loss volume and hemodynamic status, potentially overestimating her instability. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical severity of bleeding could be more critical than she reports; anxiety may exaggerate her sense of faintness. - Concerns probably amplified: Her death anxiety and fears of transfusion or surgery are heightened by emotional response rather than purely symptom-driven; these fears may be more psychological than physical. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent, but her perception of rapid deterioration may be influenced by her high anxiety, which can skew her sense of symptom evolution.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's highly emotional presentation and vivid description of severe symptoms, it is essential to gently explore her experience in a way that encourages detailed elaboration without increasing her distress. Since her perception of severity and danger appears amplified, I need to understand her actual symptom timeline, how she perceives her condition, and any physical or emotional factors influencing her state. To do this, I should ask her to describe her experience in her own words, focusing on when her symptoms started, how they've changed, and how she's feeling now. This will help clarify the true severity and guide further assessment.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact timeline, physical findings, and her understanding of her condition. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify symptom progression and confirm physical signs to assess danger realistically. - Patient factors: Her heightened anxiety and vivid language require a calming, open-ended approach. - Interview phase goals: Elicit detailed history about symptom onset, sequence, and impact, building rapport and trust.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, exploratory question. - Information target: Onset, progression, her current state, and understanding. - Communication approach: Sensitive, non-judgmental phrasing to encourage sharing without increasing distress. - Expected value: Will help differentiate between actual physiological severity and perceived danger, informing next steps.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about when you first noticed these symptoms and how they have changed over time? I'm interested in hearing how things have been since you first started feeling this way.\"",

    "input": "A postpartum female patient reports experiencing heavy vaginal bleeding characterized by large blood clots since the first day after delivery, with reported worsening over the past 24 hours. She describes associated symptoms including dizziness, visual spots, and rapid heartbeat, expressing significant concern over blood loss and potential life-threatening complications. Physical examination and vital signs are pending but are necessary to objectively assess her hemodynamic status. Her communication indicates high emotional distress, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity; therefore, clinical evaluation should include vital sign measurement, physical examination for pallor, tachycardia, or signs of hypovolemia, and laboratory testing to determine hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The clinical picture suggests postpartum hemorrhage with signs potentially consistent with hypovolemia, but her subjective reporting is likely influenced by anxiety. Further objective assessment is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony Justification: The heavy bleeding with large clots since the first day after delivery, worsening over 24 hours, strongly suggests uterine atony, which is the most common cause of PPH. Symptoms of hypovolemia and the timeline support this.  2. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture Justification: While less common, ongoing heavy bleeding with sudden worsening and postpartum context warrant considering uterine rupture, especially if prior uterine surgery; clinical signs can be similar.  3. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue (retained products of conception) Justification: Can cause significant postpartum bleeding and clots; typically associated with delayed bleeding, but can be an immediate cause.  4. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the uterus Justification: Delayed or incomplete uterine contraction leading to continued bleeding; may be inferred if bleeding persists beyond initial postpartum hours.  5. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation) Justification: Coagulopathies can cause abnormal bleeding; however, they are less common in uncomplicated postpartum unless there's pre-existing or acquired bleeding disorder.  6. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta spectrum disorder Justification: Abnormal placental adherence can cause excessive bleeding at delivery; less likely if no mention of abnormal placental attachment or prior uterine surgeries.  7. Diagnosis: Hematologic disorder (e.g., bleeding diathesis) Justification: Rare but possible, especially if bleeding is severe and disproportionate to bleeding source; check for personal or family bleeding history.  8. Diagnosis: Uterine inversion Justification: An obstetric emergency presenting with heavy bleeding and shock; less likely unless there was obstetric manipulation or abnormal uterine tone.  9. Diagnosis: Lacerations or cervical/vaginal tears Justification: Local bleeding sources can cause postpartum bleeding; associated with trauma; physical exam needed.  10. Diagnosis: Placental site bleeding (normal postpartum bleeding) Justification: Usually less heavy and more controlled; unlikely to cause large clots or significant anemia unless complicated.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs specific symptom descriptions (\"big blood clots, like golf balls,\" \"dizzy,\" \"spots in front of her eyes\") which suggest she\u2019s sharing detailed information. However, her language is heavily emotional (\"really scared,\" \"might die,\" \"feel so dizzy\"), indicating amplification of her distress rather than objective reporting. She uses urgent and catastrophic phrasing, focusing on worst-case scenarios. - Information flow: She volunteers foundational details about her symptoms, responding to questions with elaborate descriptions. Yet, her focus remains on her fears, possibly leading her to emphasize the severity rather than provide measured details. Her responses are highly organized around her emotional state rather than clinical facts. - Response style: Her replies are lengthy and emotionally expressive, with frequent pauses and tremors in her voice; she tends to elaborate extensively about her feelings and symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she appears open but possibly overly emotional. - Minimization behaviors: Little sign of downplaying symptoms; she consistently emphasizes their severity. - Amplification patterns: Strongly evident\u2014she states she is \u201creally scared,\u201d describes her symptoms as \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cworse,\u201d and uses catastrophic language (\"might die\"), suggesting overexaggeration of her situation for emphasis. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not clearly observed; she seems openly distressed. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant confusion; her timeline seems consistent, starting shortly after delivery, with clear worsening. - Family influence: No direct signs, but her focus on her own distress suggests she\u2019s primarily self-focused; no evidence of outside pressure impacting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be **distress-driven amplification**\u2014she overstates her symptoms and fears due to high anxiety, seeking reassurance and help. - Severity: **Severe**, because her emotional distress drives her narrative, potentially overestimating danger levels. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and risk of death are most biased; her expressed urgency may be exaggerated. - Reliability: While her physical symptoms are real, her subjective report may be overly magnified by her anxiety, reducing the reliability of her perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be underreporting contextual details, such as past medical history or subtle clinical findings, focusing instead on her fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual physical severity might not match her expressed desperation; she may be overestimating her condition\u2019s danger. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of dying and needing transfusions is exaggerated relative to clinical reality, driven by her high anxiety. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent but emotionally colored; her perception of worsening might be influenced by her distress rather than solely clinical escalation.  Overall, her communication is heavily emotionally charged, with signs of amplification anxiety that may skew her perception of the severity. This warrants careful clinician reassurance alongside objective assessment to determine her true clinical status.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Need more details about her emotional response, family or social support, understanding of her condition, and specific fears to gauge her anxiety and reassure appropriately. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether her bleeding and symptoms are purely postpartum hemorrhage or if other obstetric complications or underlying issues are contributing. Understanding her emotional state is also vital. - Patient factors: Her high distress and expressive language suggest she may rely heavily on emotional cues; questions should be gentle, validating, and open to her experience. - Interview phase goals: Foster trust, explore her subjective experience deeply, assess her understanding, and gently gauge her emotional state to guide reassurance and further assessment.

    "input": "The patient is a postpartum female presenting with heavy vaginal bleeding characterized by large blood clots starting the day after delivery and worsening over the past 24 hours. She reports associated symptoms including dizziness, visual spots, and a rapid heartbeat, expressing significant distress and concern about life-threatening hemorrhage. Physical examination and vital signs are pending but are necessary to objectively assess her hemodynamic stability. Given her high emotional distress, her perception of bleeding severity is likely amplified, and clinical evaluation will be crucial to determine actual blood loss, signs of hypovolemia, and need for urgent intervention.1. Diagnosis: Uterine Atony Justification: Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, especially within the first 24 hours after delivery. The large blood clots and heavy bleeding align with uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract effectively, leading to persistent bleeding. The symptom onset shortly after delivery and progression support this diagnosis, and it explains the signs of hypovolemia, dizziness, and tachycardia.  2. Diagnosis: Retained Placental Tissue Justification: Retained placental fragments can cause continued bleeding after delivery, particularly if the placenta did not fully expel. The bleeding's persistence and worsening over 24 hours, along with large clots, suggest incomplete placental separation. This diagnosis is highly probable given the timing, though uterine atony remains more common.  3. Diagnosis: Vaginal or Cervical Laceration Justification: Traumatic injury during delivery can cause ongoing bleeding, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone. The presence of large blood clots and heavy bleeding could be from lacerations. Its likelihood depends on delivery details, but it's a differential to consider, especially if bleeding is localized or excessive despite firm uterine tone.  4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation or Other Bleeding Disorder) Justification: Clotting disorders can exacerbate bleeding postpartum, especially if bleeding is severe and unresponsive to uterotonics. While less common, this remains a possibility, particularly if bleeding is disproportionate or ongoing despite uterine contraction, pending labs.  5. Diagnosis: Placenta Accreta or Invasive Placentation Justification: Abnormal placentation can cause postpartum hemorrhage and is more likely in patients with prior cesarean or uterine surgery, though not specified here. It may be less probable if this is a first delivery without risk factors, but cannot be excluded without further history.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged language (\"terrible,\" \"worst,\" \"afraid,\" \"faint\") which amplifies her perceived severity. She also employs some vague terms (\"just,\" \"a little\") that could minimize her actual experience or serve as verbal anchors for her fears. Her descriptions of symptoms are vivid, but her focus on worst-case scenarios suggests amplification. - Information flow: She offers extensive details when discussing her fears and symptoms, indicating a forthcoming but emotionally driven reporting style. She readily shares her fears of dying and needing surgery, but may under-communicate regarding less dramatic aspects, possibly to keep focus on her urgent concerns or maximize sympathy. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, often interrupted by her distress, with a tendency to emphasize danger, which indicates amplification of symptom severity rather than an attempt to conceal information.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding; she appears eager to describe her experience but may selectively emphasize the most alarming aspects. - Minimization behaviors: Occasional use of words like \"not that bad\" or \"just\" suggest some effort to downplay her symptoms, though overall she seems to accentuate them. - Amplification patterns: Her frequent use of words like \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and expressing fears about dying suggest a strong tendency to overstate the severity of her condition. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame; her distress is openly expressed. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; her timeline and descriptions are consistent. - Family influence: Not overt, but her focus on her health to caregivers might reflect concern about her family\u2019s perception or her role as a caregiver.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias, driven by anxiety, as indicated by her emotive language and focus on worst-case scenarios. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as her exaggerations are prominent and central to her narrative, affecting clinical interpretation. - Areas most affected: Her perception of bleeding severity and life-threatening risk are most biased. She may be overestimating her actual medical risk. - Reliability: Her self-report is biased toward overstatement, so clinical findings should be corroborated with objective assessments to gauge true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might underreport subtle symptoms of stability or improvement that could temper her fears, or minimize less dramatic physical signs in an effort to highlight her crisis. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be glossing over any stable or improving signs to maintain the perception of emergency; her focus on worst fears can overshadow signs of stabilization. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of dying and needing transfusion are consistent but exaggerated; understanding her anxiety-driven magnification is crucial to calm her. - True timeline: The progression is likely more gradual than she emphasizes; her focus is on the recent escalation, possibly skipping over earlier mild symptoms, making her report more alarmed than the objective course.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: While she describes heavy bleeding with large clots starting after delivery, I need to gather more precise details about the amount of bleeding, any previous episodes, and specific factors like uterine tone and presence of lacerations. I also need to clarify her vital signs and physical findings to assess hemodynamic status, as her distress might overstate severity. - Diagnostic priorities: Distinguishing whether the bleeding is primarily due to uterine atony, retained tissue, or trauma (lacerations) will guide urgent management. Examining for signs of coagulopathy or abnormal placentation can also help refine the diagnosis. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and amplification of symptoms suggest she might be emphasizing worst-case scenarios, so questions should be gentle, specific, and aimed at clarifying facts without dismissing her concerns. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the differential by getting concrete details about blood loss, physical signs (like uterine firmness and presence of bleeding at laceration sites), and her vital signs to determine urgency.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about specific symptoms and signs, timeline, and physical findings. - Information target: Exact amount of bleeding, presence of localized bleeding, uterine tone, and associated symptoms like dizziness or vision changes. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, clarifying she understands details to better assist her. - Expected value: These answers will help confirm or refute causes like uterine atony versus trauma or bleeding disorder, guiding immediate management.\nANSWER: You mentioned heavy bleeding, and I understand how frightening that must be. To help determine how serious this is, can you tell me approximately how much blood you've passed \u2014 for example, how many large blood clots, or if you've soaked through pads quickly? Also, are you noticing any specific areas where the bleeding seems more intense, like from your vagina or elsewhere? And as you\u2019ve been bleeding more, have you experienced any feeling of weakness, sweating, or dizziness? Lastly, have your uterine contractions been strong, or does the uterus feel soft and relaxed?",

    "input": "The patient is a postpartum female presenting with heavy vaginal bleeding, passing multiple large blood clots, and rapidly soaking through pads. She reports symptoms consistent with hypovolemia, including dizziness, visual spots, tachycardia, weakness, and sweating. Physical examination and vital signs are pending but are necessary for objective assessment. Her subjective report indicates high distress and anxiety, which may lead to an overestimation of bleeding severity. Physical findings, particularly uterine tone and stability, will guide the clinical management and determine if she requires urgent intervention.1. Diagnosis: Uterine Atony Justification: The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, characterized by a soft, boggy uterus and heavy bleeding with clots. The patient's rapid bleeding, large clots, and symptoms of hypovolemia strongly suggest uterine atony as the primary cause. This explains her symptoms and the urgency for intervention.  2. Diagnosis: Retained Placental Tissue Justification: Persistent bleeding and large clots may indicate incomplete placental separation. If the uterus is firm and tender rather than soft, retained products are more likely, but this remains a key differential. It is ranked second as it often coexists with or follows uterine atony.  3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture or Trauma Justification: Although less common, trauma (lacerations, cervical tears, uterine rupture) can cause significant bleeding postpartum. This diagnosis is considered if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone or if active bleeding persists despite uterine contraction, emphasizing the importance of uterine examination.  4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) Justification: If bleeding is severe and unresponsive to uterine management, systemic bleeding disorder may be involved. Although less likely initially, it remains a consideration, especially if bleeding continues despite addressing uterine causes.  5. Diagnosis: Placental Abnormalities (e.g., Placenta Accreta) Justification: Usually associated with prior cesarean or placental attachment issues, leading to abnormal adherence and postpartum bleeding. While possible, this is less probable without history suggestive of placental implantation abnormalities, but should be considered if bleeding persists or is disproportionate.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Sarah uses a mix of specific details (number and size of clots) and vague, emotionally charged language (\"so dizzy,\" \"might pass out\"). She tends to amplify her fears while using minimal precise quantification, suggesting emotional overlay. - Information flow: She is openly expressive about her fears and symptoms, providing detailed descriptions when prompted, though often with emotional embellishments. Her responses are organized but heavily processed through her anxiety. - Response style: Her communication is elaborate, emotionally driven, and somewhat scattered, with frequent overstatement of symptoms driven by her distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she's eager to share her fears and symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Use of uncertain qualifiers (\"maybe,\" \"like,\" \"I don\u2019t know\") and approximate counts imply some degree of downplaying or difficulty recalling exact details. - Amplification patterns: She consistently exaggerates her symptoms (\"so dizzy,\" \"heart racing,\" \"pass out at any second\") and outcome fears, which indicates heightened anxiety influencing her perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minor, mainly evident in hesitance to assign exact quantities or detailed descriptions\u2014possibly due to discomfort with the severity, but not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Slightly inconsistent specifics (*\"five or six big clots,\"* approximate timing), likely reflecting her distressed mental state rather than true cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not directly indicated; her responses seem self-driven by her emotional panic rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, as her intense fears and emotional language distort her perception of physical symptoms. - Severity: Moderate to severe, because her emotional distress potentially clouds clinical objectivity, possibly leading to overestimation of danger. - Areas most affected: Her reporting of bleeding severity and symptoms are most biased; these are heavily colored by her anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; her symptoms are real but her perception of their severity is likely exaggerated by her emotional state, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be providing an accurate picture of uterine tone, blood flow rate, or actual volume of bleeding, either due to distress or perception distortion. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs that might suggest stability could be underappreciated, but her emotional overlay suggests her fear is warranted; the clinical severity must be confirmed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of dying and needing transfusions are likely exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed\u2014her anxiety heightens her perception of threat. - True timeline: The worsening postpartum hemorrhage pattern is likely genuine, but her emotional amplification may make the situation appear graver than the objective findings.  Overall, her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety, amplifying the perceived severity of her symptoms, though she does convey actual physical distress that requires urgent evaluation.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need more precise details about her current physical examination findings, especially uterine tone, ongoing bleeding amount, and vital signs. Clarification on whether her bleeding has improved or worsened over time is essential. - Diagnostic priorities: The differential hinges on whether the bleeding is due to uterine atony, retained tissue, or trauma. Patterns of bleeding, uterine firmness, and associated symptoms will help distinguish these possibilities. - Patient factors: Given her high emotional distress and exaggeration of symptoms, careful, supportive questioning is needed to get accurate descriptions without escalating her anxiety. - Interview phase goals: To refine the diagnosis by clarifying the severity, duration, and nature of bleeding; assess her hemodynamic status; and understand if symptoms have improved or worsened, guiding urgent management if necessary.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions on physical signs, timeline, and volume of bleeding, with some confirmatory queries about symptoms she previously described. - Information target: Uterine tone, bleeding pattern over time, vital signs, associated symptoms like dizziness or weakness, and any changes since her last description. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently, acknowledging her feelings, avoiding alarmism, and encouraging honest reporting to get clear data. - Expected value: To obtain objective evidence of her current condition that can confirm or adjust the working diagnosis, especially distinguishing between uterine atony and other causes.\nANSWER: \"Sarah, since we last talked, have you noticed if your bleeding has become lighter, the same, or worse? And while you've been bleeding, has your uterus been feeling soft and relaxed or firm and tight when you touch it or when the doctor examines? Also, have you been feeling any different physically\u2014like more dizzy, weak, or sweaty\u2014or has anything changed with your heartbeat or blood pressure since you started bleeding heavily?\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Sarah uses a mix of specific details (number and size of clots) and vague, emotionally charged language (\"so dizzy,\" \"might pass out\"). She tends to amplify her fears while using minimal precise quantification, suggesting emotional overlay. - Information flow: She is openly expressive about her fears and symptoms, providing detailed descriptions when prompted, though often with emotional embellishments. Her responses are organized but heavily processed through her anxiety. - Response style: Her communication is elaborate, emotionally driven, and somewhat scattered, with frequent overstatement of symptoms driven by her distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she's eager to share her fears and symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Use of uncertain qualifiers (\"maybe,\" \"like,\" \"I don\u2019t know\") and approximate counts imply some degree of downplaying or difficulty recalling exact details. - Amplification patterns: She consistently exaggerates her symptoms (\"so dizzy,\" \"heart racing,\" \"pass out at any second\") and outcome fears, which indicates heightened anxiety influencing her perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minor, mainly evident in hesitance to assign exact quantities or detailed descriptions\u2014possibly due to discomfort with the severity, but not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Slightly inconsistent specifics (*\"five or six big clots,\"* approximate timing), likely reflecting her distressed mental state rather than true cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not directly indicated; her responses seem self-driven by her emotional panic rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, as her intense fears and emotional language distort her perception of physical symptoms. - Severity: Moderate to severe, because her emotional distress potentially clouds clinical objectivity, possibly leading to overestimation of danger. - Areas most affected: Her reporting of bleeding severity and symptoms are most biased; these are heavily colored by her anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; her symptoms are real but her perception of their severity is likely exaggerated by her emotional state, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be providing an accurate picture of uterine tone, blood flow rate, or actual volume of bleeding, either due to distress or perception distortion. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs that might suggest stability could be underappreciated, but her emotional overlay suggests her fear is warranted; the clinical severity must be confirmed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of dying and needing transfusions are likely exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed\u2014her anxiety heightens her perception of threat. - True timeline: The worsening postpartum hemorrhage pattern is likely genuine, but her emotional amplification may make the situation appear graver than the objective findings.  Overall, her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety, amplifying the perceived severity of her symptoms, though she does convey actual physical distress that requires urgent evaluation.",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Traumatic conjunctival injury/subconjunctival hemorrhage ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged, amplifying language (\"feel like I might pass out,\" \"might die\"), with some vague descriptors (\"like five or six big clots\"). Her speech blends objective details with intense emotional expressions, which heightens perceived severity. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with her distress and symptoms, often elaborating with emotional context, indicating a tendency toward detailed self-reporting driven by anxiety. - Response style: Usually elaborative, often emphasizing worst-case scenarios; responses are passionate, sometimes tangential, emphasizing fears rather than neutral facts.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence of hiding critical info; her responses are overt, though her focus may omit some physical examination details. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; she tends to magnify rather than downplay symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Clear, as she repeatedly emphasizes fears of death, severe bleeding, and weakness, possibly exaggerating to communicate urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No apparent signs; she appears historically open but overwhelmed emotionally. - Confusion/memory issues: Some vagueness in quantifying blood volume and time course; likely due to distress rather than actual cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not directly indicated, but her emotional state suggests her internal distress is prioritized over external influences.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Catastrophizing, driven by her anxiety about health and her children's future, leading to overestimation of severity. - Severity: Severe, because her dominant mode is emotional exaggeration, possibly compromising objective assessment. - Areas most affected: Her perceived blood loss volume and fears about death are most biased; physical symptoms are likely to be overemphasized. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014genuine distress is apparent, but her disproportionate fears may distort clinical judgment.

    "output": "THINKING: - The patient's emotional state and exaggeration suggest she may be overestimating the severity of her bleeding and symptoms. - To confirm or refute a serious condition such as a miscarriage or significant hemorrhage, I need to gather specific details on clinical signs like bleeding amount, uterine tone, and additional symptoms like dizziness or weakness. - Since she describes passing clots and fears passing out or dying, I need targeted questions that clarify the clinical severity and physical findings. - Her tendency toward emotional exaggeration means I should phrase questions carefully to elicit factual, concrete information without dismissing her distress. - The goal here is to confirm whether her presentation meets criteria for urgent intervention or if her fears may be amplified, to guide treatment decisions collaboratively.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused questions to specify quantity and features of bleeding, physical symptoms, and stability signs. - Gentle, clarifying prompts to validate her descriptions and ensure no critical signs are missed. - Explore her understanding and concerns about her condition to foster shared decision-making.\nANSWER: \"Sarah, I appreciate how distressing this has been for you, and I want to understand exactly how things are right now. Can you tell me more about the amount of blood you've passed today\u2014specifically, have you soaked through more than one pad in an hour, or do you notice large clots like a few inches in size? Also, have you been feeling dizzy, faint, or overly sweaty? When I examine your uterus, does it feel soft and relaxed, or firm and tight? Finally, do you feel weak or like you might pass out?\"",
