    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with reports of persistent emotional distress characterized by feelings of depression, hopelessness, and emotional overwhelm, alongside episodes of heightened energy and impulsivity. She describes mood fluctuations including episodes of sadness and low energy, as well as periods of increased activity and restlessness. Although she expresses concern about losing control and previous mental health issues, she does not provide specific details about recent suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or risky behaviors, which may be underreported. Communication patterns suggest she may amplify her distress while withholding certain risky behaviors or symptoms. Objective assessment indicates a clinical picture consistent with bipolar disorder, involving mood stability issues, emotional lability, and impulsivity, with potential underestimation of severity and associated risks. Further inquiry is needed to clarify recent behaviors, safety concerns, and detailed mood episode characteristics.1. Diagnosis: Bipolar I Disorder Justification: Presence of mood fluctuations from depression to episodes of increased energy and impulsivity suggests bipolar disorder, especially if mood episodes are separated by periods of euthymia; age and symptom pattern align with typical onset.  2. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder Justification: Mood episodes include depression and hypomanic-like episodes with elevated energy and impulsivity, but without severe mania; important to distinguish from Bipolar I.  3. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder Justification: Persistent feelings of hopelessness, emotional distress, and low energy align with clinical depression; however, the episodic increased energy and impulsivity suggest bipolar disorder as the primary diagnosis.  4. Diagnosis: Cyclothymic Disorder Justification: Chronic fluctuating mood states with periods of hypomania and depression over at least two years; less severe mood episodes, common in adult presentation.  5. Diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder Justification: Emotional lability, impulsivity, feelings of hopelessness, and distress could suggest BPD; prevalence is high, and symptoms can mimic bipolar mood swings, but the episodic pattern favors mood disorder diagnosis.  6. Diagnosis: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Justification: Episodes of heightened energy and impulsivity; although more common in youth, adult presentation can include mood fluctuations and impulsivity, but less likely given emotional distress as predominant.  7. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Mood Disorder Justification: Substance use can cause mood fluctuations; no mention of substance use, but still considered given impulsivity and mood swings.  8. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other trauma-related disorders Justification: Emotional distress and impulsivity may be linked to trauma; lack of direct trauma history details limits this.  9. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: Emotional overwhelm and distress are common; but less likely the primary cause considering mood fluctuation episodes.  10. Diagnosis: Personality Disorders (e.g., Narcissistic or Histrionic) Justification: Emotional amplification and distress could be personality pathology; less likely as primary due to episodic mood features.

Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged but imprecise language, with vague descriptors (\"feel like I\u2019m losing it,\" \"really down\"). She balances emotional intimacy with avoidance of detailed specifics, likely to protect herself while seeking reassurance. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming about emotional states but reluctant to provide detailed or concrete behavioral information, indicating guardedness or shame. Her responses are somewhat scattered, emphasizing her distress over specifics. - Response style: She tends toward elaboration on feelings rather than behaviors, possibly to avoid admitting severity. Her responses are more emotional and rambling than structured, reflecting discomfort or inability to articulate precise details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague explanations and lack of specific behavioral details suggest reluctance to fully disclose her impulsivity and risks, perhaps due to shame or fear of judgment. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays impulsivity (e.g., describing shopping as \"buying stuff I don\u2019t need\") and emotional severity (\"really down,\" \"like I\u2019ll never be okay\") rather than explicit symptoms like suicidal ideation or dangerous behaviors. - Amplification patterns: The emotional language used could partially exaggerate distress, serving as a plea for help or to have her feelings validated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her avoidance of detailed behaviors hints at possible shame, especially regarding impulsivity and hopelessness. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs detected. - Family influence: She mentions her mother\u2019s bipolar disorder, which might influence her self-perception or openness about her symptoms but currently doesn't show overt influence in responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Over-Emotional Amplification combined with Symptom Minimization; she amplifies emotional distress but minimizes specific behaviors, likely due to shame or fear. - Severity: Moderate\u2014distress is genuine, but lack of concrete details limits full assessment of risks. - Areas most affected: Impulsivity and suicidal ideation\u2014these are likely more severe than conveyed, but she conceals specifics. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her emotional honesty aligns with her distress, but her tendency to vague or downplay details reduces full trustworthiness of her disclosures.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about impulsive behaviors, suicidal thoughts or plans, substance use, or self-harm details. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of impulsivity, actual attempts, or risk behaviors, which she underplays possibly to avoid shame. - Concerns probably amplified: Her feelings of hopelessness and the fear of relapse, which she may overstate because of current distress. - True timeline: Uncertain; her vague descriptions suggest her current episode may be more severe or prolonged than she reports, and she may be experiencing earlier or more intense episodes that she's hesitant to detail.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The information gap focuses on clarifying the specific nature of her mood episodes, any recent behaviors that could indicate risk, and her current safety state. - Diagnostic priorities include understanding the episodic pattern, severity, impact on functioning, and safety concerns related to impulsivity or hopelessness, which are central to differential diagnoses like bipolar disorder versus borderline personality disorder. - The patient communicates in emotionally charged, vague language, so gentle, open-ended questions can help her elaborate without feeling judged. - Since she has shared emotional distress and mood fluctuations, I want to explore her recent experiences in more detail, especially recent episodes, behaviors, and her concerns about her current state, to inform diagnosis and safety assessment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - An open-ended question is needed to encourage detailed elaboration on recent mood and behavior patterns. - The focus will be on recent mood episodes and associated behaviors, emphasizing her subjective experience. - The phrasing should be compassionate and nonjudgmental, acknowledging her distress and encouraging honesty. - This will help to gather nuanced information about her patterns, possible risk behaviors, and impact, moving us toward identifying the core features of her mood episodes.\nANSWER: Tell me more about how you've been feeling lately\u2014what's been going on with your moods and energy levels over the past few weeks, and how that's been affecting your day-to-day life.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with mood instability characterized by fluctuating episodes of depression, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion, alongside periods of increased energy, restlessness, and impulsivity. While she reports ongoing distress over several weeks, her communication suggests possible underestimation of symptom severity, with minimal disclosure of recent risky behaviors or suicidal thoughts. Clinical features are consistent with bipolar disorder, involving mood swings, emotional lability, and impulsive actions, with actual severity potentially greater than reported. Further detailed inquiry is warranted to assess safety, recent behaviors, and the full scope of her mood episodes.1. Diagnosis: Bipolar I Disorder Justification: The presentation includes mood swings with episodes of depression and periods of increased energy and impulsivity, consistent with bipolar disorder. The fluctuating mood states and impulsive behaviors support this diagnosis, which is common in adults presenting with such cyclical mood changes.  2. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder Justification: Similar mood instability with depressive episodes and hypomanic symptoms (e.g., increased energy, impulsivity) without full-blown mania. The patient's lack of disclosure about severe risky behaviors doesn't exclude hypomania.  3. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Mood Instability Justification: Recurrent depressive episodes with emotional exhaustion; however, the presence of episodic increased energy and impulsivity suggests a mood disorder with cycling, making bipolar more likely.  4. Diagnosis: Cyclothymic Disorder Justification: Chronic fluctuating mood symptoms involving hypomanic and depressive symptoms over at least two years, which could present as mood instability; however, the episode durations and severity are unclear.  5. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: Restlessness and emotional exhaustion can be features; however, the primary mood symptoms with episodic depression and impulsivity point more towards a mood disorder.  6. Diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder Justification: Mood instability, impulsivity, and emotional exhaustion are characteristic; however, episodic mood swings lasting weeks are less typical, and the lack of relational instability data makes this less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Mood Disorder Justification: Substance use can produce mood fluctuations, but no mention of substance use is provided in the vignette.  8. Diagnosis: Thyroid Disorder (e.g., Hyperthyroidism) Justification: Symptoms like restlessness, irritability, and emotional exhaustion may be related; without lab data, this remains a differential but less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Postpartum or Hormonal Mood Disorder Justification: No specific indication of recent pregnancy or hormonal triggers, making this less probable.  10. Diagnosis: Medical conditions (e.g., neurological disorders) Justification: Less likely without neurological symptoms; psychiatric presentation is more prominent.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her use of vague language (\u201cprobably nothing,\u201d \u201ca little while\u201d) and brief responses imply she may be withholding the full magnitude of her symptoms or emotional state, possibly out of shame or fear. - Minimization behaviors: Words like \u201cprobably,\u201d \u201ca little,\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d suggest she\u2019s minimizing her symptoms, perhaps to protect her self-image or to avoid appearing overly vulnerable. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of over-exaggeration; her tone and language suggest under-reporting rather than over-worrying. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The choice to keep descriptions vague and her reluctance to elaborate point to some level of discomfort or shame about the severity of her symptoms, common in patients who fear judgment or stigma. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs in this response; her timeline is generalized, but not obviously inconsistent. - Family influence: She mentions her mother has bipolar disorder, which could influence her to consider her own symptoms less seriously or to downplay them due to familiarity or learned behaviors, but this is more inferential.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as evidenced by her language choices and brief responses aimed at downplaying the severity of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, because her responses systematically tend to minimize rather than exaggerate, which risks leading to underestimation of her current risk and symptom severity. - Areas most affected: Her reporting of emotional distress and mood fluctuations are likely biased toward underreporting, especially given her attempts to keep descriptions vague. - Reliability: Caution is warranted. Her self-report probably underestimates her true level of distress and functional impairment, meaning clinicians should corroborate with behavioral observations and other data.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully disclosing the extent of her suicidal thoughts, impulsivity, or the impact on her daily functioning. Her tendency to minimize indicates she might hide severity of her depressive or manic symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of mood episodes, suicidal risk, and functional impairment are likely underestimated by her report. - Concerns probably amplified: She might be at higher risk of relapse or self-harm than she admits, so her anxiety about \u201cslipping back\u201d may be an underestimation if she\u2019s not fully honest. - True timeline: Her actual patient experience might be more rapid and severe than she describes, as her responses suggest a deliberate or subconscious effort to appear less impaired or vulnerable.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a pattern of mood instability characterized by recurrent depressive symptoms\u2014including feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion\u2014and episodic periods of increased energy, restlessness, impulsivity, and emotional lability. She reports these fluctuations ongoing over the past several weeks; however, her self-report may underestimate the full severity of impulsivity and associated risks. While she describes significant distress and impact on her daily life, details regarding the occurrence of risky behaviors or suicidal ideation are unclear, potentially being minimized or undisclosed. Further comprehensive evaluation is necessary to assess the full scope of her mood episodes, associated behaviors, and safety risks.1. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder Justification: This patient exhibits recurrent depressive episodes with episodic periods of increased energy, restlessness, impulsivity, and emotional lability, consistent with hypomanic episodes characteristic of bipolar II disorder. The ongoing mood fluctuations over weeks suggest episodic shifts rather than pervasive personality-related instability. The episodic nature of heightened energy, combined with depressive states, aligns with bipolar II, especially if these hypomanic episodes are recent and shorter than full manic episodes.  2. Diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder Justification: The mood instability described could also be characteristic of BPD, which involves rapid mood swings, emotional lability, impulsivity, and distress impacting daily functioning. Although the patient does not report pervasive unstable relationships or self-injury, these features are not explicitly excluded. The episodic mood swings over weeks could reflect BPD's affective instability, especially if mood changes are more rapid and reactive to interpersonal stressors, which although not detailed, remains a consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Cyclothymic Disorder Justification: The patient's mood symptoms may fit a pattern of chronic fluctuating mood states with periods of hypomania and depression over at least two years, but the case lacks sufficient duration data. Nonetheless, if mood swings are frequent, relatively mild, and persistent, cyclothymic disorder could be considered, particularly if the episodes do not meet criteria for full MDD or hypomania.  4. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Mood Instability Justification: While depressive symptoms are prominent, the episodic periods of increased energy and impulsivity suggest these are not solely unipolar depression. Still, if mood fluctuations are limited or predominantly depressive with some reactive elements, MDD with significant mood reactivity might be considered, although less fitting given the episodic hypomanic features.  5. Diagnosis: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Justification: Impulsivity and restlessness are features of ADHD, but in this context, the episodic mood states, feelings of hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion suggest mood rather than purely neurodevelopmental origins. However, if impulsivity and restlessness are longstanding, ADHD could be a concomitant factor but less likely primary given the current mood instability pattern.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a pattern of mood instability characterized by persistent depressive symptoms, including feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emotional exhaustion, over the past several weeks. She reports experiencing brief episodes of increased energy and restlessness lasting a few hours to a day, during which she feels impulsive and engages in behaviors such as shopping and staying awake. These periods are followed by episodes of profound sadness, emptiness, and fatigue, which may be more severe and longer-lasting than she describes. Communication patterns suggest she may be minimizing the severity and duration of her symptoms and possibly withholds information regarding risky behaviors or suicidal ideation. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate for underlying mood disorder, risk behaviors, and safety concerns.1. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder Justification: The patient exhibits long-standing persistent depressive symptoms with brief episodes of increased energy and impulsivity lasting hours to a day, fitting the criteria for hypomanic episodes. These episodes are shorter and less severe than full manic episodes, consistent with bipolar II. The mood instability pattern and impulsive behaviors during episodes, along with possible minimization and safety concerns, support this diagnosis over unipolar depression or other mood disorders.  2. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder Justification: The persistent depressive symptoms\u2014feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and fatigue\u2014are characteristic of major depression. However, the episodic increases in energy are less typical for unipolar depression, making this a less comprehensive explanation unless the mood swings are better characterized as part of bipolar spectrum.  3. Diagnosis: Cyclothymic Disorder Justification: Cyclothymia involves numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet full criteria for hypomania or major depression. The brief hypomania-like episodes could suggest this, but the severity and duration of the depressive episodes implied are more consistent with bipolar II, making cyclothymia less likely unless further symptom history supports frequent subthreshold mood swings.  4. Diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder Justification: Mood instability is a core feature, but the pattern described\u2014longer depressive episodes with brief impulsive hypomania\u2014is more consistent with bipolar spectrum disorders. No explicit mention of interpersonal instability or identity disturbance that strongly supports BPD.  5. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Mood Disorder Justification: No current evidence is provided for substance use. Therefore, this is a less probable explanation, though it should be considered if further history reveals substance involvement.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of reluctance to fully acknowledge severity, indicated by phrases like \"probably nothing,\" and vague timing (\"a few hours or a day\"). - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with words like \"just\" and \"only,\" suggesting she might be minimizing the impact of her mood swings and impulsivity. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of hopelessness, fear of relapse, and descriptors like \"crushing sadness\" could be exaggerating the emotional impact, potentially amplified by distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Reluctance to admit the full extent of impulsivity or suicidal thoughts; she might be internalizing stigma around episodes. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in timeline descriptions; her vague estimations imply difficulty in precise recall. - Family influence: The mention of her mother's bipolar disorder may influence her response style, possibly leading to internalized stigma or normalization of severe symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias\u2014she tends to downplay her symptom severity and functional impairment, possibly to maintain a semblance of control or avoid judgment. - Severity: Moderate\u2014the underlying issues likely are more severe than she admits, but her narrative underrepresents their intensity. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity, especially mood swings and impulsivity; her functional status may be worse than portrayed. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her self-report is influenced by minimization and emotional state, so clinical judgment should incorporate collateral information and observations.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of depressive severity, impulsivity consequences, and risk behaviors (including suicidal ideation or self-harm) are probably understated. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient's depressive depth and potential manic episodes are more intense than described. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of relapse and losing control might be heightened by her emotional distress, but actual risk behaviors could be more serious. - True timeline: Her progression may be more rapid and severe, with episodes overlapping and fluctuating more intensely than she reports, suggesting a need for close monitoring and collateral data.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need more precise details about her hypomanic episodes\u2014specifically their duration, severity, and whether she experiences distinct periods of elevated mood, as well as how often they occur relative to depressive episodes. We also should explore her safety concerns and impulsive behaviors during these episodes to assess risk. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the pattern and characteristics of her mood episodes to differentiate between bipolar II and other mood disorders. Determine if her hypomanic episodes meet criteria (e.g., duration, impairment) and assess whether her depressive episodes are persistent enough to fit major depression or suggest cyclothymia. - Patient factors: Given her tendency to minimize and qualify symptoms, questions should be focused, specific, and nonjudgmental, encouraging honesty while validating her experience. Confirmatory questions can help verify details without making her feel scrutinized. - Interview phase goals: Fine-tune understanding of her mood episode characteristics, evaluate risks, and gather sufficient detail to refine the differential diagnosis, especially to confirm or rule out hypomanic episodes indicative of bipolar II.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and clarifying questions, as she has provided a broad overview with potential minimization, aiming to elicit concrete details about episodes. - Information target: Episode duration, intensity, frequency, triggers, impact on functioning, safety concerns, and behaviors during mood swings. - Communication approach: Frame questions to gently probe specifics, normalize the experience, and promote honest disclosure, perhaps by asking about typical days during episodes or what makes her feel more impulsive or low. - Expected value: These questions will help distinguish cyclic patterns characteristic of bipolar II from unipolar depression or other diagnoses, and assess safety and severity.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your periods of feeling more energetic and impulsive last a few hours to a day. Can you tell me more about what those times are like? For example, what specific things do you notice during those episodes\u2014do you feel more confident, restless, or engage in particular activities? Also, during these times, do you find yourself behaving differently\u2014such as shopping impulsively, staying awake longer, or taking risks? And how often do these episodes happen in relation to your feelings of sadness or fatigue\u2014are they separated by periods of feeling more normal, or do they overlap? Lastly, during these elevated periods, do you notice any worries or thoughts about losing control or feeling overwhelmed, and have you taken any actions that concerned you afterward?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Subconjunctival hemorrhage ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and cautious language (\"kind of restless,\" \"stuff I don\u2019t need,\" \"try to survive\"), which minimizes her behaviors, alongside emotional expressions (\"scared I\u2019ll do something I regret\"). This indicates an attempt to downplay symptoms while still conveying distress. - Information flow: She appears somewhat reluctant to fully disclose the severity of her episodes, opting for controlled responses that avoid explicit detail. Her responses are organized but filtered. - Response style: Her answers tend to be elaborative but with qualifiers that suggest self-censorship. She shifts between describing behaviors and minimizing their impact, possibly to avoid feeling overwhelmed or shameful.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Downplaying the frequency/intensity of impulsive episodes and mood swings, e.g., \"not all the time,\" \"sometimes,\" \"try to survive.\" - Minimization behaviors: Describing impulsivity as \"stuff I don\u2019t need\" and episodes lasting \"a few hours or a day,\" which may understate actual duration and severity. - Amplification patterns: Expressing intense fears of losing control or hurting herself, which might be heightened to elicit reassurance or due to genuine distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Likely reluctance to admit the full extent of impulsive behaviors and mood instability, indicating possible shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence, but vague descriptions of episodes suggest possible difficulty in precise self-assessment. - Family influence: Acknowledgment of mother's bipolar disorder may influence her perception, possibly heightening concern or internalized stigma.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional and minimization bias\u2014hyperfocused on her distress but reluctant to fully acknowledge severity, potentially to maintain control or avoid shame. - Severity: Moderate\u2014self-report appears controlled; actual symptoms may be more intense. - Areas most affected: Impulsivity and mood fluctuation perceptions, as she downplays their severity. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014information is partially trustworthy but likely to underestimate the true extent of her symptoms due to conscious or unconscious filtering.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The full scope and severity of impulsive episodes, risk of risky behaviors, and actual mood instability are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Impulsivity, severity of mood swings, and rapid cycling may be more intense. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of losing control and hurting herself might be exaggerated for reassurance; true risk may need further assessment. - True timeline: Actual symptom progression might involve more overlapping episodes and faster shifts than she perceives, given her cautious description.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient\u2019s responses indicate some level of minimization and cautious disclosure, especially regarding impulsivity and mood swings. Since she reports episodes lasting only a day or less and seems concerned about losing control, I need to clarify whether her experiences meet criteria for bipolar disorder, particularly rapid cycling or mixed features. - Important to explore the severity, frequency, and impact of these episodes more precisely to differentiate between mood disorders with impulsivity and other conditions, such as borderline personality disorder or recurrent depression. - Language suggests she might be underreporting true severity\u2014so questions should be carefully phrased to elicit more detailed, concrete descriptions without making her feel judged. - My goal is to confirm if the symptoms meet the threshold for a bipolar diagnosis and assess her understanding and concerns about it to prepare for treatment discussion. - I should focus on specific behaviors, thoughts, and emotional changes during episodes, including any risky behaviors, self-harm thoughts, or rapid mood shifts that might point toward bipolar disorder.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused but open enough to gather rich detail about episode characteristics. - Information target: Duration, severity, behaviors, thoughts, impact, and perceived triggers during episodes. - Communication approach: Gentle, collaborative framing to reduce defensiveness\u2014e.g., \u201cBased on what you\u2019ve told me, I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about what goes on during those times when you feel more energetic or impulsive\u2026\u201d - Expected value: Clarifies whether her pattern aligns with bipolar episodes, differentiates from borderline features, and informs diagnosis with precision.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing that. To help me better understand these periods when you feel more energetic or impulsive, can you describe in more detail what you're experiencing during those times? For example, do you notice specific thoughts, feelings, or behaviors\u2014like taking risks, acting differently, or feeling confident\u2014that stand out? And during these episodes, do you sometimes find it hard to control what you do, or do your symptoms overlap with periods when you're feeling more down or tired? Knowing these details will help us get a clearer picture of what your mood and energy swings look like over time.\"",
