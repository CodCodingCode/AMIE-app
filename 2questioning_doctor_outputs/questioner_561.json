    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old woman presenting with acute symptoms including disorientation and palpitations occurring approximately one hour after increased cannabis use. She expresses significant distress and fears of fainting or a heart attack. The clinical picture suggests a transient episode of anxiety or panic likely triggered by recent substance intake. Physical examination and vital signs are needed to further assess for any potential cardiovascular issues, but current symptoms are consistent with a benign, self-limited panic response. Additional information on her medical history, prior episodes, baseline anxiety levels, and substance use is required for comprehensive evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Cannabis-Induced Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Symptoms of disorientation, palpitations, distress, and timing shortly after increased cannabis use suggest a panic attack precipitated by cannabis consumption, which is common among young adults and can cause transient psychiatric and sympathetic symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder (e.g., Panic Disorder) Justification: The symptom pattern may reflect an underlying anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by recent cannabis use, especially given the acute distress and concern about fainting or cardiac symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis or Psychiatric Reaction Justification: Cannabis can cause transient psychotic or dissociative symptoms in some individuals, especially with higher doses or increased use, leading to disorientation and perceptual disturbances.  4. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia (e.g., Supraventricular Tachycardia) Justification: Palpitations and disorientation could indicate arrhythmia; although less likely acutely triggered solely by cannabis, rapid onset warrants consideration, especially if underlying heart issues.  5. Diagnosis: Neurovascular Event (e.g., Transient Ischemic Attack) Justification: Sudden neurological changes can cause disorientation; however, in a 29-year-old woman with no prior history, this is less common but still important to keep in mind.  6. Diagnosis: Acute Cannabis Toxicity Justification: Excessive cannabis intake can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, tachycardia, and disorientation, supporting a toxicity diagnosis.  7. Diagnosis: Cardiac Panic Syndrome (Panic Attack with Cardiac Symptoms) Justification: Panic attacks mimic cardiac events, presenting with palpitations and fear of cardiac death; stress and anxiety are common triggers, but the primary pathology remains psychological.  8. Diagnosis: Seizure or Post-Ictal State Justification: Disorientation could suggest a seizure; however, lack of other seizure features makes this less likely unless additional signs are present.  9. Diagnosis: Neurological Disorder (e.g., Migraine with Aura or Other Epochs) Justification: Sudden neurological symptoms can occur with migraines or other neurological conditions, but absence of typical aura or headache makes this less likely.  10. Diagnosis: Structural or Organic Brain Lesion (e.g., Stroke) Justification: While important \"can't miss\" diagnosis, less likely in this demographic and presentation; further testing needed if red flags emerge.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use emotionally charged and somewhat vague language, emphasizing distress (\"terrible,\" \"unbearable,\" \"really scared\") which may amplify her perceived severity. - Information flow: She freely volunteers information about her cannabis use and subjective experiences, indicating openness driven by fear, but her descriptions are focused on emotional impact rather than detailed symptom analysis. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, expressive, and driven by emotional tone, reflecting her anxiety and desperation for reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear withholding; she seems motivated to share her experience extensively. - Minimization behaviors: She admits to underestimating her initial response (\"I thought I\u2019d be okay\"), but overall, she emphasizes severity. - Amplification patterns: Exhibits clear emotional amplification, describing symptoms as \"terrible\" and \"unbearable,\" indicative of heightened distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None apparent; she appears forthcoming about her cannabis use and symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Her statements about difficulty remembering words and feeling disoriented align with her symptoms, not necessarily with deliberate concealment. - Family influence: Limited data; no evident influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as she emphasizes distress and fears, possibly inflating perceived severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her overt emotional expression and fear may lead her to overstate her symptoms' seriousness. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity and health dangers are most biased, potentially exaggerating risk. - Reliability: While her subjective report is consistent, emotional bias suggests caution when interpreting perceived severity; her distress may distort objective assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about her full substance use history, prior episodes, or coping strategies; also, possible underreporting of baseline symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her usual anxiety levels and previous substance reactions may be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of life-threatening conditions or losing control are likely heightened by emotional reaction rather than factual basis. - True timeline: Symptoms seem closely linked to recent cannabis consumption; emotional distress may amplify her perception of ongoing severity compared to actual progression.  Overall, her communication is characterized by emotional amplification and expressive detail focused on her fear and distress; these factors should be considered when assessing her clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The current context indicates the patient is reporting an acute episode with prominent distress, likely triggered by recent cannabis use. To further understand her experience and differentiate potential diagnoses like panic attack, anxiety, or substance effects, I should explore her symptom history more broadly, including prior episodes, baseline mental health, and her perception of this event. Since she is very expressive and emotionally charged, open-ended questions that allow her to elaborate are most appropriate at this stage. I want to encourage her to describe how she felt overall, what happened just before and after her symptoms, and how this compares to her usual state.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Past psychiatric history, previous similar episodes, baseline anxiety levels, personal understanding of her symptoms, and context of her substance use. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether this is a first-time panic-like event, recurrent episodes, or part of a broader anxiety disorder. Also, consider whether substances or other factors contributed uniquely. - Patient factors: Her expressive style and emotional amplification suggest a need for gentle, open-ended prompts that do not invalidate her feelings but allow her to tell her full story. - Interview phase goals: Establish rapport, gather a detailed narrative of her subjective experience, and identify key features of her episode.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, narrative focus, to promote elaboration. - Information target: Description of her overall experience, what preceded, during, and after the episode, as well as her usual mental state. - Communication approach: Sensitive and non-judgmental, encouraging her to share her perception and feelings without leading. - Expected value: This will provide richer context for her symptoms, aid in identifying whether her presentation aligns more with panic, anxiety, substance effects, or another condition, and support rapport-building.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how you were feeling overall during this event\u2014what was going on for you before it started, what you experienced while it was happening, and how you\u2019re feeling now? I\u2019d like to understand what this episode was like for you from your own perspective.\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Common presentation with redness, tearing, and swelling following recent activity; often viral and contagious, especially in young active individuals.  2. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid or ocular surface injury Justification: Recent soccer play suggests possible trauma, leading to swelling and redness; eye trauma is common and can cause secondary conjunctival irritation.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Recent physical activity with eye redness and tearing; trauma can cause superficial corneal injury presenting with redness, tearing, and possibly pain.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden eye redness and swelling after exertion or minor trauma; usually painless and localized, but relevant due to recent activity.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Common in young individuals; symptoms include redness and tearing, with possible swelling, especially if exposed to allergens during outdoor activities.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less likely but possible; causes redness and tearing with potential pain, photophobia, or visual changes, although typically less acute.  7. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Recent outdoor activity raises suspicion; can cause redness, tearing, and discomfort, especially if a foreign object entered the eye during play.  8. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Less likely in the absence of fever or systemic symptoms, but presents with eyelid swelling and redness; requires prompt recognition to prevent vision loss.  9. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Causes sectoral redness and mild swelling; usually painless or mildly uncomfortable and less common after trauma.  10. Diagnosis: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (ocular manifestation) Justification: Rare without systemic signs; usually presents with chronic uveitis, less likely in acute setting post-sports activity.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally intense and vivid descriptions (\"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" \"so strange\") that reflect high distress but also risk exaggerating severity. - Information flow: She freely volunteers details about her substance use and feelings, demonstrating openness but with an emotional tone that can bias her report. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and somewhat rambling, often attempting to seek reassurance through detailed descriptions of her symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant signs; she appears communicative. - Minimization behaviors: Unlikely; she emphasizes severity rather than downplaying symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Her frequent use of strong emotional descriptors suggests potential exaggeration driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; her openness about cannabis use indicates no shame in that topic. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports cognitive fuzziness and disorientation, aligning with her account but possibly influenced by her emotional state. - Family influence: Not evident; her responses seem self-motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification bias, with her emotional state causing overestimation of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate, as her distress actively influences her perception, but not necessarily indicating physical danger. - Areas most affected: Severity assessment, perceived threat of medical emergencies, and timeline understanding. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional distress may inflate her symptom severity, but her report aligns with her anxious state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Context on her usual baseline functioning and past episodes; she might not fully disclose her usual coping capacity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical symptoms\u2019 underlying severity might be overestimated; her anxiety could be exaggerating sensation intensities. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of serious health issues (heart attack, psychosis) seems heightened beyond actual risk, influenced by her panic. - True timeline: Rapid onset after heavy cannabis use is consistent, although her perceived duration and severity are likely influenced by her emotional reaction, possibly overestimating how long or intense the event was.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need to clarify how she perceives her recent eye symptoms' impact on her day-to-day life, and whether she has experienced similar episodes before. Her vivid emotional descriptions may also mean her perception of severity is heightened; understanding whether this is typical or an escalation is helpful. - Diagnostic priorities: Since trauma and infection are common after recent physical activity, exploring any recent injury or trauma details is essential. Also, assessing her understanding and concerns about possible serious causes like infection or injury is important. - Patient factors: Her expressive, emotionally intense style suggests that she may respond cautiously but also need reassurance. Framing questions in an empathetic, open-ended manner will help her feel safe to provide accurate information. - Interview phase goals: Encourage detailed description of her current symptoms, explore the onset and progression, and understand her perception of how these symptoms are affecting her life without leading her to specific conclusions.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, to build trust and allow her to describe her experience fully. - Information target: Symptom impact, progression, any prior similar episodes, and her interpretation of the cause. - Communication approach: Gently probe for details about her daily functioning, ensuring sensitivity given her emotional tone. - Expected value: Gaining insight into her subjective experience and functional impact, which informs differential diagnosis and guides further focused inquiry.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how these eye symptoms have been affecting you day-to-day?

    "input": "The clinical picture suggests an acute anxiety or panic episode possibly triggered or intensified by recent heavy cannabis consumption, accompanied by perceptual disturbances and physical symptoms consistent with anxiety. Underlying mood or cognitive vulnerabilities may be present but are not fully disclosed. The patient's communication style indicates a tendency to emotionally exaggerate current distress while potentially underreporting baseline or recurrent symptoms. Further detailed history is needed to clarify any chronic issues and to inform appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Anxiety/Panic Attack Justification: The recent heavy cannabis consumption is a strong precipitant for panic and anxiety episodes; the temporal relationship suggests causality. Symptoms such as perceptual disturbances and emotional exaggeration are common in cannabis-induced episodes. This diagnosis explains the acute onset, emotional intensity, and possible exacerbation of underlying anxiety tendencies.  2. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or underlying anxiety disorder Justification: The patient's tendency to amplify distress hints at possible underlying anxiety pathology, which can be precipitated or worsened by cannabis. Although not explicitly detailed, recurrent or chronic anxiety may be underlying, contributing to the severity of this episode.  3. Diagnosis: Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: Cannabis, especially in heavy use, can cause perceptual disturbances or hallucinations in susceptible individuals. The perceptual disturbances described may represent transient psychotic phenomena induced by cannabis, distinguished from primary psychosis by their acute, substance-related onset and likely resolution.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Stress Reaction Justification: The patient's emotional exaggeration and distress could be part of an acute stress response to substance effects or situational factors. Though less specific, it fits the transient nature and emotional intensity of the episode.  5. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Brief Psychotic Episode) Justification: Less likely given the context and recent substance use; primary psychosis usually persists beyond acute episodes and lacks clear precipitant. However, perceptual disturbances warrant consideration, particularly if psychotic features persist or recur independently of substance use.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and emotive language, such as \"kinda shaky\" and \"really bad,\" mixing mild descriptors with intense feelings. Her descriptions often lack precise details but emphasize distress. - Information flow: She tends to provide limited, somewhat scattered information initially, often only elaborating when prompted, indicating guardedness or difficulty articulating details. - Response style: Her responses are somewhat rambling, brief, and emotionally charged, exhibiting a tendency to emphasize her distress over concrete facts, which may hinder precise assessment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her uncertainty and vagueness when describing symptoms, especially about daily routines, hint at possible withholding or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"kinda,\" \"kind of,\" suggests she may minimize her symptoms\u2019 actual severity. - Amplification patterns: Descriptive words like \"super anxious\" and \"really bad\" could exaggerate her distress, influenced by emotional state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her vagueness may be driven by internal discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear evidence of cognitive disorientation, with her difficulty recalling words and keeping track of her activities. - Family influence: Not directly evident from her speech, but her hesitant tone could reflect internal conflict or external influences.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is a mixture of minimization and emotional exaggeration\u2014she minimizes some subjective aspects but amplifies her distress. - Severity: Moderate; her ambivalence and vagueness could obscure true symptom severity, though her emotional expression indicates significant distress. - Areas most affected: Estimations of symptom severity and baseline functioning are compromised; her fear-driven perceptions may distort the assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report provides valuable emotional context but is limited by vagueness and possible distortion of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details of her baseline mental state, frequency, and variability of symptoms are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her morning sensations and cognitive impairments might be worse than described. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current distress appears heightened by fear, possibly overestimating immediate danger. - True timeline: Symptoms may fluctuate more than she reports, possibly beginning milder and increasing, but her narrative emphasizes current distress, which might overshadow earlier states.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The current description is vague; we need more specifics about the eye symptoms, their timing, and associated features to differentiate between possible causes like anxiety, substance effects, or psychosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether the eye symptoms are visual, perceptual, or physical sensations, and whether they have features typical of substance-induced psychosis or anxiety-related visual phenomena. - Patient factors: The patient's emotionally exaggerated language suggests a tendency to amplify distress; questions should be gentle, specific, and clarifying to obtain accurate information. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the differential by pinpointing key features of the eye symptoms, understanding their context, onset, and any associated triggers or relief factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions about the nature and characteristics of the eye symptoms. - Information target: Quality (visual distortions, hallucinations, sensations), timing (when they began, how they evolve), triggers, and whether they occur with anxiety or substance use. - Communication approach: Use plain, non-judgmental language, acknowledging her distress while gently requesting more detail. - Expected value: Helps to differentiate between anxiety-related perceptual disturbances, substance-induced perceptual phenomena, or other neuropsychiatric causes, thereby refining the differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about the eye symptoms you\u2019ve been experiencing\u2014are you seeing things that aren\u2019t there, or maybe noticing different shapes or colors?

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with acute perceptual disturbances, including visual flickering and shapes, along with physical sensations such as dizziness, shakiness, and a rapid heartbeat, occurring shortly after increased cannabis use. She reports waking with shakiness and visual distortions, which she associates with heightened anxiety. Her communication pattern indicates significant distress and possible symptom overstatement, but objective signs and prior history are not yet available. Further assessment of physical symptoms, history of similar episodes, and baseline mental health is necessary to differentiate between a transient anxiety/panic episode and other potential underlying conditions.1. Diagnosis: Panic Attack / Acute Anxiety Episode Justification: The sudden onset of visual flickering, shapes, dizziness, shakiness, rapid heartbeat, and distress following cannabis use strongly suggests an acute anxiety or panic attack. The symptoms' timing with cannabis intake and the physical sensations align with known transient anxiety reactions, especially as they appear upon waking with tremors and visual disturbances that can occur during heightened anxiety states.  2. Diagnosis: Cannabis-Induced Anxiety or Toxicity Justification: Cannabis can exacerbate or induce anxiety, especially in susceptible individuals or following increased use. The temporal association between increased cannabis use and symptom onset supports this as a direct cause, making it a probable diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Primary Psychiatric Disorder (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder with Provoked Episode) Justification: Although the episode appears situational, the patient's pattern of distress and physical symptoms could signify underlying anxiety disorder exacerbated by cannabis, especially if similar episodes occur or if baseline anxiety is present.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder (rare but possible) Justification: Cannabis, especially with increased use, can rarely induce psychotic-like perceptual disturbances. The visual flickering and shapes could suggest mild perceptual changes, but without other psychotic features or a longer history, this is less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Neurological Conditions (e.g., Seizures, Migraine Aura) Justification: While visual disturbances can be caused by neurological events such as seizures or migraines, the acute context following cannabis use and associated physical sensations favor a psychiatric or substance-related diagnosis over a primary neurological pathology in this scenario.The patient\u2019s responses reveal a pattern of heightened anxiety and distress, with language heavily laden with emotional concerns about serious health issues. She describes her symptoms vividly, indicating genuine discomfort, but also appears to focus intensely on worst-case scenarios, which might lead her to overstate the severity at times. Her use of vague and emotional language, coupled with a somewhat disorganized response pattern, suggests she might be amplifying her symptoms due to her anxiety, seeking reassurance but also possibly hiding or minimizing certain details out of fear or shame. Her reports of visual disturbances and feelings of disorientation are consistent with her presenting anxiety, but the emotional tone suggests her perception is heavily influenced by her fear of danger or loss of control. Overall, her communication indicates significant anxiety-driven bias, with potential overestimation of the seriousness of her symptoms, which could impact accurate clinical assessment if not gently countered.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient has already described visual distortions, physical sensations, and a temporal relationship with cannabis, which points toward anxiety/panic or substance-related effects. - Still, there are gaps regarding previous episodes, baseline mental health, and any past neurological or psychiatric history, which are essential to distinguish between transient episodes and underlying disorders. - Clarification is needed on symptom duration, specific triggers beyond cannabis, and the presence of any associated features like fear of losing control or derealization which can distinguish panic from other conditions. - Considering her distressed communication style, I should phrase questions carefully to validate her experience while gently exploring details that could clarify diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Use focused questions targeting core features of panic episodes versus neurological or psychotic phenomena. - Target the timeline\u2014Are these episodes new or recurrent? - Ascertain specific associated features like fear of dying or losing control\u2014key to panic diagnosis. - Explore her baseline mental health and past similar episodes to gauge if this is an isolated incident or part of a pattern. - Address the impact on daily functioning and triggers beyond cannabis to refine differential.\nANSWER: You mentioned waking up with shakiness and vision changes after increased cannabis use and feeling very anxious. Can you tell me if these kinds of episodes have happened before, perhaps at different times or with different triggers, or is this the first time you've experienced something like this?

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with recent-onset perceptual disturbances, including visual flickering and shapes, along with physical sensations such as dizziness, shakiness, and tachycardia, occurring shortly after an increase in cannabis use. She reports waking with symptoms and feelings of losing her mind, with heightened anxiety and fears of passing out or a heart attack. While these symptoms are consistent with an acute panic or anxiety episode, her communication pattern suggests possible symptom exaggeration and heightened emotional distress. She does not report prior episodes of similar severity but indicates occasional mild anxiety. Objective assessment and further history are necessary to confirm the diagnosis, differentiate from medical causes, and evaluate her baseline mental health and substance use patterns.Acute Panic Attack ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs emotionally charged, exaggerative language like \"terrible,\" \"losing my mind,\" indicating high distress; she often uses vague descriptions (\"weird,\" \"things that aren\u2019t there\") which limit specificity and may conceal exact experiences. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer extensive, emotionally laden details to seek reassurance, but sometimes avoids discussing previous episodes or implications, showing a pattern of over-sharing driven by anxiety but possible subtle withholding out of shame. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate, rambling, and tangential, reflecting her anxious state and difficulty focusing, with fluctuating directness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Possible reluctance to acknowledge prior similar episodes (\"not like this,\" \"not exactly\"), possibly to avoid emphasis on past vulnerability. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the chronicity of her symptoms, suggesting this is unprecedented, possibly to reduce shame or avoid appearing overly fragile. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity (\u201cworst,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cpass out,\u201d \u201cheart attack\u201d) to highlight her distress, which may exaggerate her actual physiological severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her avoidance of discussing early or mild symptoms might suggest sensitivity about her experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports difficulty focusing, remembering, and feeling disconnected, consistent with her descriptions, possibly amplified under anxiety. - Family influence: She mentions limited contact with family due to anxiety, and no direct evidence of family influence affecting responses during the session, but her fearfulness might be influenced by concern about how others perceive her.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification, as her description of symptoms and fears are exaggerated, driven by intense anxiety and panic. - Severity: Moderate to severe, because her distress appears to distort her perception of the situation, although her reports are consistent overall. - Areas most affected: Her perception of the severity and permanence of her symptoms, especially fears of losing control or experiencing a medical emergency. - Reliability: While her account is emotionally truthful, her intense anxiety likely inflates her symptom severity, so some details\u2014especially about the urgency\u2014should be interpreted cautiously.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport past mild episodes of anxiety or panic that she viewed as less serious, and she might not fully disclose the extent of her cannabis use or feelings of shame around it. - Symptoms probably minimized: If she experienced similar episodes before but minimized them, her current complaints may be more intense than previous. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of imminent medical catastrophe (heart attack, psychosis) are likely magnified by her panic, making her most distressing symptoms seem worse than they are. - True timeline: The initial onset coincides with cannabis use, but the persistence and severity of symptoms could be compounded by her ongoing anxiety, possibly exaggerating how long symptoms have lasted or how intense they are.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to refine the diagnosis\u2014it's necessary to confirm whether the episodes fit the criteria for panic attacks and to rule out medical causes or other psychiatric conditions. The patient tends to exaggerate distress, so I need focused questions that clarify the nature, duration, and context of her symptoms, especially regarding her subjective experiences and triggers. Since her current state suggests high anxiety, exploring her baseline anxiety levels, past episodes, and her understanding will help assess diagnostic certainty and guide treatment considerations. It\u2019s also important to gently address her emotional responses and ensure she feels supported to discuss her concerns openly.  QUESTION STRATEGY: I want a focused, clarifying question targeting her most recent episodes and their features, aiming to differentiate panic attacks from other causes (e.g., medical, substance-induced). It should help confirm if her symptoms meet typical panic attack criteria and explore her awareness or misconceptions. This will advance understanding of her diagnostic profile, confirm or refute panic disorder, and prepare her for treatment options.\nANSWER: \u201cBased on what you've described about waking up with shakiness, vision changes, and feeling like you're losing control, can you tell me if these episodes happen suddenly and reach a peak very quickly\u2014within a few minutes\u2014is that correct? Also, during these times, do you notice any physical sensations like a racing heart, sweating, or feeling dizzy, and do these symptoms last for a few minutes before easing? I\u2019d like to understand if they happen suddenly, involve certain physical feelings, and how long they typically last, to see if they match what we look for in panic attacks.\u201d",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs emotionally charged, exaggerative language like \"terrible,\" \"losing my mind,\" indicating high distress; she often uses vague descriptions (\"weird,\" \"things that aren\u2019t there\") which limit specificity and may conceal exact experiences. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer extensive, emotionally laden details to seek reassurance, but sometimes avoids discussing previous episodes or implications, showing a pattern of over-sharing driven by anxiety but possible subtle withholding out of shame. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate, rambling, and tangential, reflecting her anxious state and difficulty focusing, with fluctuating directness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Possible reluctance to acknowledge prior similar episodes (\"not like this,\" \"not exactly\"), possibly to avoid emphasis on past vulnerability. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the chronicity of her symptoms, suggesting this is unprecedented, possibly to reduce shame or avoid appearing overly fragile. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity (\u201cworst,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cpass out,\u201d \u201cheart attack\u201d) to highlight her distress, which may exaggerate her actual physiological severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her avoidance of discussing early or mild symptoms might suggest sensitivity about her experiences. - Confusion/memory issues: She reports difficulty focusing, remembering, and feeling disconnected, consistent with her descriptions, possibly amplified under anxiety. - Family influence: She mentions limited contact with family due to anxiety, and no direct evidence of family influence affecting responses during the session, but her fearfulness might be influenced by concern about how others perceive her.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification, as her description of symptoms and fears are exaggerated, driven by intense anxiety and panic. - Severity: Moderate to severe, because her distress appears to distort her perception of the situation, although her reports are consistent overall. - Areas most affected: Her perception of the severity and permanence of her symptoms, especially fears of losing control or experiencing a medical emergency. - Reliability: While her account is emotionally truthful, her intense anxiety likely inflates her symptom severity, so some details\u2014especially about the urgency\u2014should be interpreted cautiously.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport past mild episodes of anxiety or panic that she viewed as less serious, and she might not fully disclose the extent of her cannabis use or feelings of shame around it. - Symptoms probably minimized: If she experienced similar episodes before but minimized them, her current complaints may be more intense than previous. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of imminent medical catastrophe (heart attack, psychosis) are likely magnified by her panic, making her most distressing symptoms seem worse than they are. - True timeline: The initial onset coincides with cannabis use, but the persistence and severity of symptoms could be compounded by her ongoing anxiety, possibly exaggerating how long symptoms have lasted or how intense they are.",
