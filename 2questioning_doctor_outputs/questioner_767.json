    "input": "OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: a young child, Emma, of unspecified age and gender. Chief complaint: Progressive neurological decline, including inability to hold up her head, seizures, and abnormal eye movements, with recent worsening over months. Present illness: Emma exhibits significant neurological symptoms such as inability to maintain head support, seizures, and abnormal eye appearance, which are clearly observable. These symptoms are likely more severe than reported, given her emotional distress may lead to exaggeration. Symptoms possibly underreported include subtle behavioral changes, mood shifts, or less obvious neurological deficits. The timeline suggests gradual worsening over several months, though the perception of rapid decline may be influenced by caregiver distress. Associated symptoms such as excessive fatigue and irregular breathing episodes are noted, but the severity and frequency are undetermined. Confidence assessment indicates high confidence in the presence of prominent neurological deficits, medium confidence that emotional distress may inflate symptom perception, and low confidence regarding the full extent of behavioral or subtle neurological changes. Additional information is needed regarding seizure characteristics, detailed behavioral and mood assessments, and the exact timeline of symptom progression.1. Diagnosis: Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome) Justification: Progressive neurological decline with hypotonia, seizures, abnormal eye movements, and respiratory irregularities are characteristic features; mitochondrial disorders are common in children with neurodegeneration.  2. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Batten disease or other lysosomal storage disorders) Justification: Gradual decline, seizures, and neurodegeneration suggest a lysosomal storage disorder affecting neuronal integrity over time, common in early childhood.  3. Diagnosis: Metabolic disorder (e.g., Wilson's disease, or organic acidemias) Justification: Metabolic derangements can cause progressive neurological deterioration, seizures, and movement abnormalities; Wilson's disease is rare but important to consider.  4. Diagnosis: Structural brain abnormality (e.g., cortical malformation, atrophy, or post-infectious gliosis) Justification: Structural causes can lead to progressive neurological deficits and seizures; previous infections or developmental anomalies may underlie the features.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune encephalitis Justification: Subacute onset with seizures, abnormal movements, and neurological decline can suggest autoimmune causes, especially if other signs of inflammation are present.  6. Diagnosis: Infectious encephalitis (viral, bacterial, or parasitic) Justification: Progressive course with seizures and neurological signs can be infectious, particularly in endemic areas; however, the subacute timeline favors certain viruses.  7. Diagnosis: Leukodystrophy (e.g., adrenoleukodystrophy) Justification: Demyelinating diseases cause progressive neurological decline, abnormal eye movements, and motor impairment, commonly presenting in childhood.  8. Diagnosis: Cerebral tumor or mass effect Justification: Could produce gradual neurological decline and seizures, though the progressive worsening over months without acute features makes this less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Toxic or drug-induced encephalopathy Justification: Less likely given the chronic progressive course but possible if there's exposure to neurotoxic substances.  10. Diagnosis: Psychogenic movement disorder Justification: Least likely but included as differential considering the mention of emotional distress possibly exaggerating symptoms; however, objective neurological signs argue against this being the primary cause.Emma's responses are direct but influenced heavily by her emotional distress and her caregiver's cues. She reports significant symptoms clearly but may be prone to amplifying fears or underreporting certain discomforts due to limited verbal understanding or emotional modulation. Her communication pattern suggests some degree of emotional amplification, especially as her narrative emphasizes her fears (\u201cmy head hurts,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t move my legs\u201d), which could be accentuated by her distress rather than purely objective symptom severity. Her tendency to mirror her caregivers\u2019 concerns or anxieties may lead to an overestimation of some symptoms, although her straightforward language suggests she is providing honest, if emotionally charged, information.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: The precise onset and progression timeline of Emma\u2019s neurological symptoms, seizure characteristics, behaviors, mood changes, and any recent triggers or events are unclear. Details about the severity, frequency, and duration of seizures and specific behavioral or mood symptoms are missing. Additional context about any prior developmental issues or illnesses is also needed. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify how the symptoms evolved, particularly the seizure activity and eye movements, to differentiate between neurodegenerative or metabolic causes. Understanding behavioral or mood changes will help identify autoimmune or psychiatric contributors. - Patient factors: Emma is a young child with emotional distress influencing communication; caregiver input may significantly shape her responses. Questions need to be open, gentle, and tailored to her developmental level, ensuring she feels safe to share. - Interview phase goals: Explore the timeline and pattern of neurological and behavioral symptoms, assess severity and functional impact, and gain insight into what concerns Emma and her caregiver most.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended questions to explore symptom evolution and associated features. - Information target: Onset, progression, seizure details, behavioral and mood symptoms, functional impact. - Communication approach: Use simple, child-friendly language and reassure Emma; involve the caregiver for clarification when necessary. - Expected value: Build a detailed symptom timeline, identify key signs for differential diagnosis, and establish rapport for ongoing discussion.\nANSWER: \u201cEmma, can you tell me more about when you first noticed these problems and how they\u2019ve changed over time? For example, was there a moment when things suddenly got worse, or have they been slowly getting worse without any clear reason?\u201d",

    "input": "A young child, Emma, presents with notable neurological deficits evidenced by inability to maintain head support, seizure activity, and abnormal eye movements. The timeline of symptom progression is uncertain, with her history indicating a gradual worsening over several months, though emotional distress and confusion may obscure the precise onset and severity of symptoms. Physical examination and caregiver reports confirm significant neurological impairment, although additional details regarding seizure characteristics, behavioral, or mood disturbances require further investigation. The communication pattern suggests that certain subtle or episodic symptoms may be underreported or undetected, emphasizing the need for detailed questioning, physical assessment, and corroborative caregiver input to accurately characterize her condition.1. Diagnosis: Leukodystrophy (e.g.,metachromatic leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease) Justification: Progressive neurological deficits, seizures, and abnormal eye movements in a young child suggest a neurodegenerative disorder affecting myelin, common in leukodystrophies, which often present with motor decline over months.  2. Diagnosis: Structural brain lesion (e.g., hemispheric cortical atrophy or intracranial mass) Justification: Gradual worsening with neurological deficits and seizures can be caused by a cyst, tumor, or cortical atrophy compressing or destroying neural tissue; need to consider intracranial pathology.  3. Diagnosis: Mitochondrial disorder (e.g., mitochondrial encephalopathy) Justification: Mitochondrial diseases can present in children with progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and eye movement abnormalities, often with a subacute course.  4. Diagnosis: Autoimmune or inflammatory process (e.g., autoimmune encephalitis) Justification: Seizures, neurological decline, and eye movement abnormalities can occur with autoimmune encephalitis, which sometimes mimics degenerative diseases but may wax and wane.  5. Diagnosis: Metabolic disorder (e.g., Lysosomal storage disease other than leukodystrophy) Justification: Metabolic conditions can cause progressive neurodegeneration with seizures in children, often with subtle early signs.  6. Diagnosis: Cerebral palsy (dyskinetic or mixed type) Justification: Although typically non-progressive, some forms with underlying neurodegeneration or evolving pathology might show gradual worsening; less likely given recent progression and seizures.  7. Diagnosis: Neurocutaneous syndrome (e.g., Sturge-Weber syndrome) Justification: Can cause seizure activity and neurological deficits, though typically associated with skin findings (port-wine stain) not specified here.  8. Diagnosis: Infectious encephalitis (e.g., viral) Justification: Certain infections can cause progressive or relapsing neurological symptoms in children, but usually present acutely or subacutely, making this less likely unless chronic infection.  9. Diagnosis: Epileptic encephalopathy with developmental regression Justification: Seizures and neurological decline could reflect an epileptic encephalopathy, although the gradual course and additional neurological deficits point more to structural or degenerative causes.  10. Diagnosis: Vitamin deficiency or nutritional disorder (e.g., B12 deficiency) Justification: Might cause neurological deficits, but gradual progression over months without specific risk factors or dietary info makes this less probable.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emma\u2019s language is vague and non-specific (\"kind of just kept getting worse,\" \"I don't know when it started\"), suggesting difficulty in articulating or discomfort in sharing precise details. She exhibits emotional indicators such as fear and confusion through her minimal responses. - Information flow: Her responses are reluctant and limited, showing a tendency to withhold details, possibly to avoid distress or because of memory impairment. Her answers are organized but minimal, with little elaboration. - Response style: She is minimal and somewhat evasive about important historical details, likely reflecting emotional discomfort or cognitive limitations rather than intentional withholding.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her admission of uncertainty about timing, not recalling specific details, indicates withholding or inability to access detailed memories. - Minimization behaviors: Slightly downplaying her understanding and possibly her symptom severity, as she avoids specifics. - Amplification patterns: No clear evidence of exaggeration; her tone and words reflect concern but not overstatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her difficulty in discussing the timeline may suggest subconscious discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear from her statement; she admits to not knowing when symptoms started and that they just kept worsening. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but her reliance on caregiver memory could influence her vague recall.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: *Memory/confusion bias*, negatively affecting accurate historical description. - Severity: Moderate, as her uncertainty impacts the historical accuracy but likely reflects genuine memory gaps. - Areas most affected: The timeline and progression of symptoms, critical for diagnosis and management. - Reliability: Moderate with caution; her reported history is likely incomplete or imprecise due to emotional and cognitive load.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact onset and sequences of symptom progression, which are essential for clinical staging. - Symptoms probably minimized: Acute episodes or severity may be underreported due to her difficulty recalling details. - Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional distress may heighten worries or fears about her health, skewing perceptions. - True timeline: Possibly more abrupt or variable deterioration than she reports; her memory impairment and emotional state could distort the actual course.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to explore Emma\u2019s experience of her symptoms more deeply, focusing on how she perceives changes over time. - Given her vague responses and difficulty recalling specifics, open-ended questions that invite elaboration without pressure are appropriate. - It's important to connect with her on how her symptoms affect her emotionally and physically, reinforcing trust and understanding her perspective. - Since her history indicates gradual worsening, I should gently probe into her recent experiences, daily functioning, and any behaviors or episodes she or her caregivers might have noticed. - This will help fill gaps in the timeline and symptom characteristics, aiding in differentiating among potential diagnoses such as neurodegeneration, structural brain issues, or metabolic processes.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Open-ended question to encourage Emma or her caregiver to describe her recent experiences and any noticeable changes. - Target: Symptom progression, emotional impact, daily functioning, and any episodes or events that stand out. - Communication: Framed gently, with reassurance, to make Emma comfortable sharing possible difficulties or concerns. - Value: This will clarify how her symptoms have evolved, contribute to building rapport, and guide further focused questions.\nANSWER: \"Emma, can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing lately?

    "input": "The patient is a young child presenting with significant neurological impairment characterized by inability to maintain head support, recent seizure activity, abnormal eye movements, and reported fatigue and episodes of rapid breathing. Her symptoms have reportedly worsened gradually over the past several months, although exact onset and progression are unclear due to emotional distress and limited communication. Objective findings include seizure episodes, motor weakness, and abnormal ocular movements. Subtler signs such as behavioral changes or less noticeable seizure types may be underreported; therefore, further assessment\u2014including caregiver history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing\u2014is necessary to accurately determine the underlying etiology and extent of neurological decline.1. Diagnosis: Mitochondrial neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Leigh syndrome) Justification: The presentation of neurological decline with motor weakness, abnormal eye movements, seizures, and episodes of rapid breathing is characteristic of Leigh syndrome, a mitochondrial disorder commonly presenting in infancy or early childhood with neurodegeneration, regression, and metabolic crises. The gradual progression aligns with classic mitochondrial decline, and the respiratory irregularities may reflect brainstem involvement.  2. Diagnosis: Leukodystrophy (e.g., Central Pontine Myelinolysis or other demyelinating process) Justification: The neurological deterioration with motor impairment and abnormal eye movements could be explained by demyelination of central pathways, especially if progression is gradual. It accounts for motor and cerebellar signs with possible autonomic or brainstem features.  3. Diagnosis: Organic acidemia or other inherited metabolic disorder (e.g., Glutaric Aciduria type I) Justification: Metabolic illnesses often present with progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and episodic breathing irregularities due to metabolic crises. This would be consistent with a slowly worsening pattern and neurological signs, especially if precipitated by stress or illness.  4. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Wilson\u2019s disease or other hereditary neurodegeneration) Justification: Although rarer in very young children, hereditary neurodegenerative diseases can manifest with motor decline, abnormal eye movements, and seizures, especially if involving basal ganglia or cerebellar regions, with a gradual course.  5. Diagnosis: Brainstem or cerebellar stroke or ischemic injury (less likely due to gradual progression) Justification: Focal lesions could cause some of these signs, especially abnormal eye movements and motor issues, but the gradual worsening over months makes this less probable compared to degenerative or metabolic causes.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emma uses straightforward, emotionally charged language, focusing on her sensations (\"head hurts,\" \"can't move my legs\"). Her descriptions are brief, indicating distress, but she does not elaborate beyond her immediate experience. She refrains from technical or detailed explanations, likely due to age and emotional state. - Information flow: She tends to respond directly to questions about current symptoms, not volunteering extraneous details unless specifically asked, suggesting a reactive rather than proactive communication style influenced by her emotional discomfort. - Response style: Her responses tend to be minimal and focused on her perceived problems. She answers succinctly, reflecting her understanding and emotional state, with limited elaboration, which might hinder detailed clinical assessment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; her direct statements about symptoms suggest she is sharing her current feelings openly, though her limited elaboration may reflect age-related limitations or emotional overload rather than intentional withholding. - Minimization behaviors: There are no apparent signs; her descriptions of her symptoms\u2014heavy legs, seizures, fatigue\u2014are consistent with her physical presentation, though she may lack awareness of some subtle symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional distress could lead to some amplification of her fatigue or discomfort, but nothing overtly exaggerated beyond her observable symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of reluctance or embarrassment; her tearfulness and open distress suggest she\u2019s primarily overwhelmed rather than ashamed. - Confusion/memory issues: Her uncertainty about when symptoms began (\"I don\u2019t know when it started\") indicates some confusion regarding timeline, typical for her age and neurological status. - Family influence: Her responses are centered on her own sensations; no evidence suggests external influence shaping her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional distress bias is most prominent\u2014her anxiety and fear may influence her reporting, possibly emphasizing severity, but her descriptions align well with clinical observations, reducing concern for significant distortion. - Severity: Moderate, mainly due to her age and emotional state affecting clarity and recall; her responses are honest but limited, which could obscure a full understanding. - Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy and subjective experiences\u2014her inability to specify when symptoms started limits precise history. - Reliability: Fair for current symptoms and observable behaviors, but less reliable for detailed historical or subjective internal states, owing to age and emotional distress.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific details about symptom progression, onset, and internal sensations that she cannot articulate. There may also be unreported subtle symptoms not apparent to her or visible behaviors. - Symptoms probably minimized: Intensity of her fatigue and distress could be underappreciated if she cannot articulate all experiences or if emotional distress suppresses some communication. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety and fear might lead her to overstate discomfort or the severity of recent changes, especially in her tearful and distressed presentation. - True timeline: Likely more insidious than she reports; her gradual decline might have involved unnoticed or unremembered early signs, with the current focus on her distress overshadowing detailed history.  Overall, her responses reflect significant emotional distress impacting clarity; they are reliable for current physical symptoms but limited for historical detail.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The current focus should be on the specifics of Emma's recent symptoms and how they\u2019ve evolved, since her distress and limited communication may obscure details about onset and progression. - Given her neurological decline pattern, understanding the timing, triggers, and fluctuations in her symptoms could help distinguish between metabolic, degenerative, or demyelinating processes. - Her emotional distress might influence her responses, so targeted questions should gently explore areas she\u2019s less able to articulate, such as subtle symptom changes, associated behaviors, or episodic variations. - This stage aims to clarify the timeline and severity, especially the pattern of worsening, and gather information about symptoms that could point toward metabolic vs neurodegenerative causes.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - The question needs to be focused on recent changes and fluctuations, phrasing gently to accommodate her distress while eliciting specific details about symptom progression. - Targeted toward understanding if her symptoms are persistent or episodic, and if there are specific times or triggers that make her feel worse or better, which could point toward certain conditions. - Use simple, reassuring language to facilitate honest and detailed responses while remaining sensitive to her emotional state. - The expected value is to get clearer information about the pattern of symptom progression, and possibly identify any fluctuating or episodic features that could narrow the differential diagnosis further.\nANSWER: \u201cEmma, I know this is hard, but can you tell me if your legs or head feel worse at certain times or situations, like when you\u2019re tired or after playing?

    "input": "Patient demographics: young female child. Chief complaint: Progressive neurological deterioration with seizures, weakness, and abnormal eye movements, with associated fatigue and episodes of rapid breathing, likely more severe than reported. Present illness: The patient exhibits ongoing seizure activity, with features including motor weakness\u2014particularly difficulty maintaining head support and heaviness in the legs\u2014and abnormal ocular movements. Her symptoms have reportedly worsened gradually over the past several months, although exact onset and progression are uncertain due to emotional distress and limited communication. She describes feeling more fatigued, especially after activity, with episodes of tiredness and shortness of breath, which may be underreported in severity. She indicates that her condition fluctuates with activity and fatigue but may be minimizing the full extent of her impairment. Additional associated symptoms such as cognitive or behavioral changes, or further seizure types, are not clearly articulated but are suspected given the neurological picture. The communication pattern suggests that her symptoms may be more severe and rapidly progressing than indicated; further objective assessment, caregiver reports, and diagnostic testing are warranted to clarify her condition.1. Diagnosis: Leigh Syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) Justification: The progressive neurological deterioration with seizures, motor weakness (heaviness in legs, difficulty supporting head), abnormal eye movements, and episodic rapid breathing are characteristic of Leigh syndrome, a mitochondrial disorder affecting the brainstem and basal ganglia. The gradual progression over months aligns with the typical course, and metabolic disturbances often lead to respiratory irregularities and neurodegeneration.  2. Diagnosis: Mitochondrial Cytopathy (general) Justification: Similar to Leigh, broader mitochondrial dysfunction can cause multisystem neurologic decline with seizures, weakness, and respiratory irregularities. The metabolic underpinning explains the systemic fatigue and episodes of rapid breathing, supporting this category.  3. Diagnosis: Leukoencephalopathy (e.g., Van der Knaap disease or other leukodystrophies) Justification: The progressive neurological deterioration with involved white matter could suggest a leukodystrophy; abnormal eye movements and weakness are features, although the timeline tends to be slower, but rapid progression can occur. The focus on white matter pathology fits the child's clinical picture.  4. Diagnosis: Progressive Neurodegenerative Disorder (e.g., Niemann-Pick Type C or other storage diseases) Justification: These conditions can present in childhood with neurodegeneration, seizures, motor decline, and eye movement abnormalities. The episodes of fatigue and breathing issues might reflect systemic involvement, making this a plausible differential.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune or Demyelinating Disorder (e.g., Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis or other inflammatory processes) Justification: While less likely given the months of steady decline, the possibility of an evolving autoimmune or demyelinating process cannot be fully excluded without further testing. The gradual worsening and multiple neurological signs warrant keeping this differential open, especially if acute exacerbations are involved.

Additional diagnostic evaluation and caregiver input are necessary to precisely characterize her seizure activity and neurological decline.Autoimmune Encephalitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Emma uses vague and emotionally laden language (\u201ca little while,\u201d \u201cfunny inside,\u201d \u201cheavy,\u201d \u201csad\u201d), which may obscure the full picture of her symptoms. - Information flow: She tends to respond only when directly asked, with minimal elaboration, indicating possible withholding or limited insight. - Response style: Her replies are concise with occasional emotional expressions, showing discomfort or fear, possibly avoiding detailed discussions of her experiences.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids detailed descriptions of pre-seizure feelings and the exact nature of episodes, suggesting reluctance or difficulty elaborating. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"a little while\" or \"most times I just feel tired\" could understate severity. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of \"really tired,\" \"scared,\" and \"funny inside\" could reflect genuine distress but may also serve to emphasize her needs or elicit concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs, but brief responses hint at possible discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Admits to limited recall about pre-seizure sensations, indicating some cognitive or emotional confusion. - Family influence: Responses appear internally consistent, with no evident external influence shaping her answers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization of symptom intensity and frequency, with some emotional amplification. - Severity: Moderate, because her concise responses and vague language may compromise full disclosure. - Areas most affected: Seizure details, pre-symptomatic feelings, and the degree of fatigue are most biased. - Reliability: While her responses are consistent, they may underestimate her actual suffering, so clinical interpretation should consider potential underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Emma\u2019s actual seizure characteristics, severity, and nightly or daily impact, due to reluctance or limited understanding. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of her fatigue, seizure severity, and emotional distress is likely greater. - Concerns probably amplified: Her expressions of fear and sadness are genuine but may be heightened; she might be more distressed than she conveys. - True timeline: Her condition may be progressing more rapidly or severely than indicated, given her brief and guarded responses, and the emotional tone.  Overall, Emma's communication reveals some underreporting and emotional amplification, necessitating careful clinical probing and corroboration from caregiver observations.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We still need to clarify the specific features of Emma\u2019s seizure episodes, including pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal sensations, as well as any recent changes in episode frequency or affect. Her responses suggest possible underreporting or limited insight, so targeted questions are necessary to confirm criteria for autoimmune encephalitis, such as seizures with certain semiology, neurological deficits, or behavioral symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm seizure characteristics consistent with autoimmune etiology, rule out other causes (e.g., primary neurological or metabolic issues), and assess for red flags such as rapid progression or new neuropsychiatric symptoms. - Patient factors: Emma\u2019s minimal elaboration, emotional cues, and vague language indicate she might be reluctant or frightened, affecting the depth of her disclosure. Questions should be gentle, clear, and supportive, inviting elaboration while respecting her emotional state. - Interview phase goals: Finalize diagnostic confirmation by gathering detailed, specific symptom information, gauge her understanding and concern, and prepare her for treatment discussion.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and clarification questions to delineate seizure features and symptom timeline. - Information target: Duration, frequency, nature of episodes, pre-seizure sensations, and post-seizure effects; assessment of recent changes; understanding her perception of her condition. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, phrasing questions in a neutral, collaborative way to minimize defensiveness. - Expected value: Clarify diagnostic criteria, uncover underreported features, and establish a foundation for shared decision-making about management.\nANSWER: \"Emma, based on what you've shared so far, I want to make sure I understand your experiences clearly. Can you tell me more about what happens during your seizures\u2014like what you notice just before they start, what you feel or see during the episode, and how you feel afterwards? Also, have you noticed if these episodes are becoming more frequent or longer over time, or if they happen differently after you've been active or tired? Sometimes, people don\u2019t remember all the details, so I want to hear everything you can tell me, even if it feels small or hard to describe.\"",
