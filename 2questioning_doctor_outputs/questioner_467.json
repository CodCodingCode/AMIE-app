    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or allergic) Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are common in conjunctivitis; recent activity could lead to exposure or allergy, and it's a common, easily accessible diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or superficial corneal injury Justification: Contact or trauma during soccer can cause abrasions, presenting with redness, tearing, and discomfort, often with a rapid onset.  3. Diagnosis: Blepharitis or eyelid dermatitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can result from inflammation of eyelid margins, common in ocular surface irritation.  4. Diagnosis: Traumatic hyphema Justification: Blunt trauma from soccer could cause blood collection in the anterior chamber, presenting with redness and swelling, especially if a history of trauma is significant.  5. Diagnosis: Globe rupture or ocular trauma Justification: Although less specifically described, any recent trauma raises concern for globe injury, which is vision-threatening and considered a \"can't miss\" diagnosis.  6. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Can present with redness, swelling, tearing, and ocular pain; however, typically associated with rapid onset of pain and headache, making it less likely based solely on initial presentation.  7. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Common during outdoor activity, especially with tearing and swelling; less likely if onset is rapid following trauma.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Can cause redness and tearing, though less common acutely post-trauma and more associated with pain and photophobia.  9. Diagnosis: Preseptal cellullitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness without intraocular involvement; can result from trauma or local infection.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Severe swelling and redness, potentially with pain and systemic signs; less likely without systemic symptoms but important to distinguish from preseptal cellulitis.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria employs vague quantifiers (\"a little,\" \"a few weeks\") and minimizing phrases (\"just tired\") that may obscure symptom severity. Her emotional expressions (\"worried about me and the babies\") reveal distress but also serve to emphasize her concern. - Information flow: She appears forthcoming with her symptoms, volunteering details about how she feels and the impact on her daily life. Her responses are organized around her core worries, though she may withhold the full extent of her physical limitations due to emotional discomfort. - Response style: She uses a combination of concise, emotion-laden statements with some hurried, anxious speech, which may reflect her overwhelmed state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; she openly reports her symptoms but downplays their intensity subtly through language (\"just tired,\" \"a little short of breath\"). - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"just\" and non-specific descriptors suggest she is downplaying how significantly her symptoms affect her. - Amplification patterns: Her heightened emotional concerns\u2014fearing fainting and harm to her babies\u2014indicate emotional amplification, possibly inflating the perceived severity of her condition. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs; her tearfulness and hurried speech suggest discomfort, but she does not seem ashamed. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of factual inconsistencies. - Family influence: Her focus on her babies dictates her concern, possibly amplifying her emotional response and willingness to present her symptoms as urgent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification of health fears, with some mild symptom minimization\u2014common in pregnant patients anxious about their health. - Severity: Moderate bias, as her communication is influenced heavily by emotional state, likely affecting perception accuracy. - Areas most affected: Perceived severity and urgency of symptoms; emotional concern could lead to overestimating risks. - Reliability: Generally reliable in reporting symptoms, but emotional bias suggests her perception of severity may be inflated, requiring objective assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be fully conveying how incapacitating her fatigue and dyspnea are, possibly underestimating the need for urgent intervention. - Symptoms probably minimized: She downplays the impact of her physical limitations, which may be more severe than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about fainting and harm to the babies are heightened, possibly driven by anxiety rather than the current symptom severity alone. - True timeline: Symptoms have worsened over weeks as described, but emotional distress may cause her to perceive the progression as more alarming than it might be objectively.

    "input": "The patient is a woman presenting with a primary complaint of persistent fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, and a sensation of rapid heartbeat ongoing for several weeks. She reports experiencing dizziness and blurry vision, but describes these symptoms in non-specific terms and appears hesitant, which suggests they may be more severe or frequent than indicated. Objective signs are not detailed at this stage; however, the clinical picture warrants further investigation into possible underlying systemic or neurological conditions, considering the likelihood of underreported episodic episodes or deficits. Additional assessment should focus on detailed symptom characterization and exploration of neurological and ocular symptoms to determine the true severity and urgency of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, dizziness, and blurred vision are classic features of anemia, which is common and may cause hypoxia leading to increased heart rate and breathlessness.  2. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., atrial or ventricular) Justification: Rapid heartbeat and dizziness could suggest arrhythmias, which can cause similar symptoms, especially if episodic or persistent.  3. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism) Justification: Thyroid disorders can produce fatigue, palpitations, and visual or neurological symptoms; they are common endocrine causes of such a presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Cardiac ischemia or heart failure Justification: Exertional breathlessness and fatigue can be cardiac in origin, especially if there is underlying coronary artery disease or ventricular dysfunction.  5. Diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension or autonomic dysfunction Justification: Dizziness and blurred vision may be linked to blood pressure regulation issues, especially if symptoms worsen with position changes.  6. Diagnosis: Diabetes Mellitus with hypoglycemia or autonomic neuropathy Justification: Dizziness, blurred vision, and fatigue may be related to blood glucose fluctuations impacting autonomic and neurological functions.  7. Diagnosis: Primary neurological disorder (e.g., vestibular issues or seizure activity) Justification: Blurred vision and dizziness may arise from neurological causes; these need consideration given associated symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic disorder Justification: Rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and subjective visual disturbances can be psychogenic, especially in the context of hesitation or hesitancy in reporting symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Vestibular disorders (e.g., benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) Justification: Dizziness and visual symptoms are common in vestibular pathologies; less likely but possible.  10. Diagnosis: Rare systemic conditions (e.g., adrenal insufficiency) Justification: Fatigue and hypotensive symptoms could suggest systemic endocrinopathies, though less common in initial presentation without more specific signs.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and non-specific language such as \"kinda dizzy and blurry\" and \"nothing specific, just kind of weird,\" avoiding precise symptom descriptions. This indicates a tendency to downplay or minimize her discomforts. - Information flow: She answers directly but with hesitation, offering minimal elaboration when asked about her eyes, and quickly shifting focus to her general feeling of dizziness. Her responses seem organized but restrained, which might reflect discomfort or deliberate withholding of details. - Response style: Her responses are moderate in length, with some hesitations. She provides enough information to be understood but stops short of detailed descriptions, indicating a cautious or guarded communication style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague descriptions and use of \"kind of\" suggest she might be holding back fuller details about her symptoms, perhaps to avoid alarming the clinician or due to uncertainty about her symptoms\u2019 significance. - Minimization behaviors: She states there's no difference or feeling in her eyes, despite symptoms that could suggest ocular or neurological compromise, possibly minimizing the potential severity. - Amplification patterns: The evidence doesn't show overt exaggeration; rather, she under-reports symptoms, which could be an unconscious bias or an attempt to avoid worry or hospital interventions. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame, but slight hesitations might imply discomfort discussing symptoms perceived as serious or alarming. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion; responses are consistent with her own description of symptoms and timeline. - Family influence: No explicit indications, but her concern for her children and her health might be making her lean towards understated reporting to avoid additional worry.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as she appears to downplay or understate the severity of her symptoms (e.g., describing dizziness as \"kinda dizzy\" and \"nothing specific\"). - Severity: Moderate, because her vague descriptions could mask underlying serious issues like severe anemia, but her overall tone suggests she is somewhat aware that her symptoms are concerning. - Areas most affected: Vision changes and neurological symptoms are most biased, as she minimizes or doesn't recognize their potential seriousness. - Reliability: Moderate; she provides core symptoms but with understatements and vagueness, so her self-report may underestimate severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: A detailed account of her episodes of dizziness, vision disturbances, or weakness which she might be reluctant to disclose fully. She may not be fully aware of or willing to admit neurological or ocular symptoms that could indicate hypoxia or anemia severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Neurological symptoms such as dizziness and blurry vision could be more severe than she reports, especially considering her risk factors and anemia background. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about her overall health and her babies might lead her to underreport symptoms, but she does express concern and seeks help, so some exaggeration of fear could be present. - True timeline: Duration reported (a few weeks) matches her internal sense, but the progression may be more rapid or severe than she perceives due to minimization.

    "input": "A pregnant female presents with persistent fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, and sensations indicative of tachycardia occurring over several weeks. She also reports episodes of dizziness and visual disturbances, which are described non-specifically but are likely more frequent and severe than her account suggests. She exhibits communication patterns consistent with symptom minimization and emotional concern, which may obscure the true extent of her condition. Physical signs and further diagnostic evaluation are necessary to assess for anemia, cardiovascular compromise, or neurological issues, with particular attention to the possibility of unreported falls or loss of consciousness.1. Diagnosis: Iron-deficiency anemia Justification: The persistent fatigue, exertional dyspnea, tachycardia, dizziness, and visual disturbances are classic signs of anemia, which is common in pregnancy due to increased iron requirements. Anemia would explain systemic fatigue and cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia) seen in this patient. The symptoms' duration over several weeks fits the timeline typical of iron deficiency developing or worsening during pregnancy.  2. Diagnosis: Cardiovascular decompensation (e.g., anemia-induced high-output heart failure) Justification: The exertional shortness of breath and tachycardia suggest that her cardiovascular system is compensating for decreased oxygen delivery, possibly due to anemia. Pregnancy increases blood volume and cardiac workload, raising the risk for cardiac strain, especially if anemia is present. Dizziness and visual disturbances further suggest systemic hypoperfusion.  3. Diagnosis: Preeclampsia or hypertensive disorder of pregnancy Justification: Although not explicitly stated, visual disturbances and dizziness could be related to hypertensive episodes. However, the absence of reported hypertension or proteinuria makes this less likely as a primary diagnosis but still a differential to consider given pregnancy context and neurological symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Neurological causes (e.g., vasovagal episodes or orthostatic hypotension) Justification: Dizziness and visual disturbances could be a result of orthostatic hypotension or vasovagal episodes, especially considering emotional concern or symptom minimization. Yet, they are less probable than anemia given the systemic symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (e.g., hyperthyroidism) Justification: Hyperthyroidism can cause tachycardia, fatigue, and heat intolerance, but the symptom pattern and the context in pregnancy favor anemia-related causes. Nonetheless, it remains a differential diagnosis due to overlapping features like increased metabolic rate and tachycardia.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and non-specific phrases (\"nothing specific,\" \"kind of weird\"), which suggest guarding or a tendency to understate her symptoms. Her emotional language (\"worried,\" \"more and more\") conveys anxiety but within a cautious framing. - Information flow: She shares spontaneously about her dizziness, but her descriptions are somewhat guarded, possibly to avoid appearing overly vulnerable. - Response style: Her responses are succinct but sometimes supplemented with emotional qualifiers; she balances openness with mild minimization.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids detailed descriptions of severity, hinting at reluctance to fully disclose how bad her symptoms might be. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"nothing specific\" and \"just kind of weird\" serve to trivialize symptoms, perhaps to prevent seeming overly fragile or to avoid alarm. - Amplification patterns: When describing episodes (\"like I might fall over\"), she emphasizes danger, possibly overestimating the impact due to fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her cautious language indicates a desire to minimize perceived weakness. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant issues; her timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: Her concern about chores and caring for children suggests her social role influences her expressed distress, possibly magnifying her sense of urgency.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be mild to moderate minimization combined with emotional amplification\u2014she minimizes how severe symptoms are but also emphasizes danger due to anxiety. - Severity: Moderate; her language indicates real concern but within a framework that may hide the true extent. - Areas most affected: Her perceived symptom severity and danger assessment; this impacts how urgently her condition might be perceived. - Reliability: Her self-reporting is generally honest but somewhat guarded, so actual symptoms might be underappreciated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact severity and impact of dizziness and fatigue; she may be underreporting how disabling these episodes are. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her description suggests her anemia and related symptoms could be more severe, with higher risks of fainting or further complications. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about falling and harm to her babies are valid, yet her framing might overstate immediate danger or urgency. - True timeline: Worsening over weeks aligns with clinical progression, but her self-report likely understates the severity at each point.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Clinical reasoning: - Information gaps: Precise characterization of dizziness episodes (frequency, duration, triggers), severity of visual disturbances, and any associated neurological symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if dizziness and visual symptoms are orthostatic, vasovagal, or suggest other neurological or cardiovascular causes; assess for anemia severity and impact. - Patient factors: Since she tends to minimize symptoms and express emotional concern, questions should be sensitive, non-judgmental, and confirmatory. - Interview phase goals: Obtain detailed symptom description to distinguish between differential diagnoses and assess the true impact on her functioning. - Questioning strategy: - Type: Focused questions targeting timing, circumstances, and associated features. - Information target: Frequency, severity, triggers, and relation to position changes or emotional states. - Communication: Use empathetic, straightforward language to validate experiences while encouraging detailed responses. - Value: Will help determine if episodes are consistent with orthostatic phenomena, vasovagal syncope, or neurological events, refining diagnostic direction.\nANSWER: You mentioned that your dizziness feels like it might cause you to fall over sometimes.

    "input": "A pregnant woman in her third trimester presents with ongoing fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and episodes of transient dizziness. While she reports these dizziness episodes as brief and infrequent, communication biases suggest they may be more frequent and severe, potentially involving near-falls or unreported falls. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the extent of her symptoms and identify underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Iron-deficiency anemia Justification: Fatigue and exertional dyspnea are hallmark symptoms of anemia, common in pregnancy due to increased iron demand. Episodes of dizziness may represent transient cerebral hypoxia from hemoglobin deficiency, especially if severity fluctuates unnoticed by the patient. This condition is highly prevalent in third-trimester pregnancy and aligns with the pervasive symptoms described.  2. Diagnosis: Gestational hypertensive disorder (e.g., preeclampsia or gestational hypertension) Justification: The presence of exertional dyspnea and dizziness can be associated with hypertensive states in pregnancy, which can cause episodes of hypotension or hypertensive crises leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Although high blood pressure isn't explicitly reported, these disorders are common and may initially present subtly, explaining episodic symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., sinus arrhythmia, AV nodal or ventricular arrhythmias) Justification: Transient dizziness episodes suggest potential episodic cerebral hypoperfusion from arrhythmias. Pregnancy increases cardiac workload, and arrhythmias can develop, causing sudden drops in cerebral blood flow, especially during exertion, aligning with her symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension Justification: Given the pregnancy-related hemodynamic changes, autonomic fluctuations may lead to orthostatic hypotension, contributing to brief dizziness and unreported falls. Although her specific blood pressure readings are not provided, this is a plausible cause considering her symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism Justification: While less likely given the episodic and less severe nature of symptoms, pregnancy predisposes to thromboembolic events. Dyspnea and dizziness could be signs of a PE, especially if episodes are more severe than reported. This diagnosis ranks lower but remains important to consider given her pregnancy status and symptomatology.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses vague, non-specific terms (\"kind of dizzy,\" \"nothing special,\" \"kinda weird\") which obscure the actual severity. She expresses emotional distress less through direct language and more through hesitant, uncertain phrases. - Information flow: Tends to be reluctant and guarded, giving brief, somewhat vague responses unless further prompted. She waits for questions and minimizes her symptoms, indicating possible discomfort or fear of judgment. - Response style: Responses are generally minimal and hedged, showing a tendency toward underreporting. She is cooperative but cautious, likely aiming to avoid alarming the doctor or revealing the full extent of her distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her use of speculative language (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\") and downplaying symptoms suggests she is withholding or minimizing the true extent of her dizziness and fatigue. - Minimization behaviors: Describing dizziness as only \"sometimes\" and \"brief\" likely understates the severity, possibly to avoid appearing overly fragile. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of feeling \"really dizzy\" and \"like I might fall,\" indicate genuine distress, though her vagueness may subtly underrepresent the actual frequency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: She admits to feeling \"kinda dizzy and blurry\" with uncertainty, suggesting some discomfort discussing symptoms that may seem to reflect weakness. - Confusion/memory issues: Her responses are consistent and logically sequenced; no clear signs of confusion. - Family influence: Her desire to care for her children and fear of falling may motivate her to minimize symptoms to maintain a sense of control.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate underreporting/minimization bias, driven by emotional discomfort and desire not to alarm. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her vague language and reluctance to specify details could lead to underestimation of her anemia severity. - Areas most affected: Dizziness frequency, severity, and triggers, as her answers are non-specific. - Reliability: Self-report is somewhat compromised; clinical assessments and investigations are necessary to gauge the true extent of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about her dizziness episodes, including exact frequency, duration, and severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Dizziness severity and perhaps her overall energy level, which may be more compromised than she reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about falling and her ability to care for children, which reflect genuine fears but may be more intense than medically indicated. - True timeline: Progressive worsening over weeks is consistent, but her vagueness may underestimate the speed and severity of deterioration, emphasizing the need for objective testing.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient's vague descriptions of dizziness (\"kind of dizzy,\" \"nothing special\") and tendency to minimize or hesitate suggest her true symptoms may be more severe or frequent than reported. To clarify diagnosis, I need to explore the characteristics of her dizziness more specifically, including duration, triggers, and associated symptoms. - Given her pregnancy context, consideration of anemia, orthostatic hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias is important. I also want to distinguish if her dizziness is more positional, episodic, or continuous, and if she experiences other signs like palpitations, chest pain, or visual changes that could support specific diagnoses. - The communication style indicates she might underreport severity, so asking targeted, concrete questions with empathetic phrasing can help elicit more accurate information while maintaining rapport. - The goal here is to gain detailed understanding of her dizziness episodes to refine suspicion of anemia versus other causes, and evaluate associated features to guide further testing or management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions targeting the details of the dizziness episodes\u2014timing, triggers, duration, associated symptoms. - Information target: Characteristics of dizziness (e.g., positional, sustained, episodic), severity, impact on daily activities, other related symptoms (vision changes, chest pain, palpitations). - Communication approach: Phrase questions sensitively and clearly to encourage honest, detailed responses, acknowledging her cautious style. - Expected value: Clarifying these details will help differentiate between possible diagnoses like anemia, orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmia, or hypertensive episodes, and guide appropriate testing.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing that.

    "input": "A pregnant woman in her third trimester reports ongoing fatigue and exertional shortness of breath, along with brief episodes of dizziness characterized as lightheadedness and sensations of passing out. She describes these dizziness episodes as lasting a few seconds and occurring more frequently when she is tired or after walking. She also reports associated symptoms of visual blurriness and chest pounding or tightness. While she denies actual falls or sustained loss of consciousness, her concern about near-falls is noteworthy. Her symptom descriptions may be emotionally amplified, and actual frequency or severity likely exceeds her reporting. Further assessment is needed to quantify the true extent of episodes, evaluate for potential underlying causes such as cardiac or hematologic issues, and determine safety risks.Orthostatic hypotension or cardiovascular etiology ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs both vague and emotional language, often hedging (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\"), which reflects discomfort but also a desire to convey her experience without seeming overly alarmed. Her descriptions of symptoms are detailed but sometimes exaggerated, e.g., feeling \"like I might fall.\" - Information flow: She's somewhat forthcoming when asked specific questions, but her responses include qualifiers that may indicate reticence or difficulty in fully trusting her own perceptions or fear of judgment. She avoids fully committing to certain details, possibly to prevent overreaction. - Response style: She is cooperative and provides elaborations when prompted, but her narrative is marked by inconsistencies in certainty and intensity, showing emotional overlays like anxiety that influence her reporting.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She withholds some specifics about symptom frequency and triggers, probably out of fear of appearing too fragile, which could influence clinical judgment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptom duration (\"a few seconds\") and severity (\"doesn't last very long\") suggest she\u2019s minimizing to avoid concern or because she perceives her experience as less critical. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions of fainting, dizziness, and that feeling like \"gonna pass out\" reflect anxiety-driven exaggeration, aimed perhaps at seeking reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation when explaining her symptoms and nervous tone indicate some embarrassment about her health status. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs, but her use of vague descriptors might mask uncertainties or difficulty in articulating her experiences precisely. - Family influence: Her concern about caring for her children and chores hints at internal pressures affecting her responses, possibly complicating her self-assessment.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be emotional amplification combined with mild minimization; her anxiety elevates her perception of danger while she downplays some symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences her report but does not entirely distort the core clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Dizziness and fainting episodes, where her exaggeration might lead clinicians to overestimate risk; fatigue is stated plainly but might be somewhat underestimated in severity. - Reliability: Her self-report provides valuable information, but emotional factors mean that clinical interpretation must consider potential exaggeration or minimization biases to avoid misjudging the true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact frequency, duration, or specific triggers of episodes could be underreported, impacting risk assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be downplaying how disabling her fatigue truly is or how often episodes occur. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety might cause her to overstate her fears of fainting or harm, leading clinicians to over-prioritize some risks. - True timeline: Symptom progression is accurate but emotionally exaggerated; the physiological worsening is real but possibly perceived as more urgent due to her anxiety.  (End of analysis.)",
    "output": "THINKING: Given her emotional amplification and possible minimization, it\u2019s important to gather specific, objective details about her episodes to clarify their true nature. Since she describes the dizziness with vague durations and triggers, and also reports visual and cardiovascular symptoms, I should explore the timing, frequency, and associated factors in a focused way. Her concern about near-falls suggests safety is a priority, so confirming whether she has experienced actual falls or loss of consciousness will be crucial. I also want to gently assess her understanding and concerns to help prepare her for possible diagnosis and management, ensuring she feels heard and supported.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Focused questions that clarify episode specifics and physical findings - Target: Frequency, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, and safety risks - Approach: Sensitive, collaborative phrasing to respect her emotional state and encourage accurate reporting - Value: These details will help confirm or refute diagnoses like orthostatic hypotension or cardiac causes, and guide safety assessments\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing all that. To help me understand better, can you tell me how often these dizziness episodes actually happen during the day\u2014are they daily or a few times a week? When they occur, how long do they usually last? For example, do they last just a few seconds or longer? Also, do you notice if they happen more when you\u2019re standing up quickly or after walking? Have you ever felt like you actually were going to fall or even lost your balance, or is it mostly just feeling faint? And besides the dizziness, are there times when you see blurry vision or feel your heart pounding while these episodes happen? Understanding these details helps me make sure we\u2019re covering everything to keep you safe.\"",
