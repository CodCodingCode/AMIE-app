    "input": "The patient is an unspecified age and gender who presents with facial swelling, pain localized to the cheeks and jaw, accompanied by fever and headache, with symptoms having worsened over the past day. Physical examination is needed to assess the extent of swelling, presence of erythema, warmth, and signs of local infection or abscess formation. Vital signs should be recorded to evaluate systemic involvement, and examination of the ears, throat, and neck should be performed to identify potential sources of infection or airway compromise. Further diagnostic measures, including imaging, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause and extent of the pathology.1. Diagnosis: Odontogenic Cellulitis or Abscess Justification: Common cause of facial swelling and jaw pain; pain localized, fever present; often related to dental infections, especially considering facial and jaw involvement.  2. Diagnosis: Maxillary Sinusitis Justification: Presents with facial pain and swelling, especially over cheeks; associated headache; could be secondary to sinus obstruction or infection.  3. Diagnosis: Cellulitis of the Facial Skin Justification: Characterized by facial swelling, erythema, warmth; fever suggests infection; could be secondary to skin breach or spreads from underlying sources.  4. Diagnosis: Ludwig\u2019s Angina Justification: A rapidly progressing cellulitis of the submandibular and submental spaces; presents with swelling, pain, fever, and risk of airway compromise; considered a serious \"can't miss\" diagnosis.  5. Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis of the Maxilla or Mandible Justification: Bony infection can cause facial swelling and pain; often from dental infections; may have insidious onset but can be acute if complicated.  6. Diagnosis: Meningitis Justification: Headache and fever are prominent; facial swelling less typical, but severe infections can present with headache and systemic signs; urgent to rule out.  7. Diagnosis: Herpes Zoster (Facial Neurotropic) Justification: Can cause unilateral facial pain and swelling; usually associated with vesicular rash, which is not described but remains differential.  8. Diagnosis: Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Disorder Justification: Jaw pain localized to the cheek/jaw; usually associated with jaw movement; less likely to cause systemic fever.  9. Diagnosis: Facial Cellulitis secondary to Erysipelas Justification: Skin infection presenting with facial redness, warmth, swelling; systemic symptoms like fever are common; erysipelas tends to involve superficial dermis.  10. Diagnosis: Imaging or neoplasm (as unlikely but possible) Justification: Less likely given the acute presentation but considered for persistent or atypical cases; may show mass or bone destruction on imaging.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam uses specific terms like \"swollen,\" \"hurts so bad,\" and \"head hurts really bad,\" indicating detailed symptom reporting. He employs emotional words such as \"really sick,\" \"super tired,\" and \"scared,\" which highlight his distress. His language is direct and expressive, with little use of vagueness or medical jargon. This suggests openness but also high emotional arousal influencing his descriptions. - Information flow: He responds in a straightforward manner when describing his symptoms. His responses are concise but emotionally charged, indicating that he seems willing to share details, though his expressions of worry and fear dominate his narrative. He does not appear to withhold key details openly, but his emotional state might color his perception of severity. - Response style: His statements are primarily short but emotionally rich. He expresses distress clearly, with some whininess, which is typical for his age and emotional state, but doesn't hide symptoms intentionally. His focus is on pain, swelling, and fear, and he readily asks questions about severity and future outcomes.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is no clear evidence of withholding information; Liam discusses prominent symptoms openly, although his emotional distress may cloud his perception of severity. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident here; he consistently describes his symptoms as very bad and worsening, not downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: His description of symptoms as \"really bad,\" \"hurt so much,\" and \"terrible headache\" could be influenced by fear, possibly exaggerating his discomfort. His questions about how serious it might be suggest some concern that may lead him to perceive his condition as more severe than it objectively is. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No indications; he openly discusses his symptoms and fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; his timeline (started three days ago, got worse yesterday and today) appears consistent and appropriate. - Family influence: There is no direct evidence that family responses are influencing his statements, but his emotional state may be partially driven by parental concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias; Liam's high distress and fear are likely amplifying his perception and description of symptoms, making him report severity that may be partly influenced by anxiety rather than purely physiological severity. - Severity: Moderate. His explicit expressions of worry, combined with his description of severe pain and swelling, suggest genuine distress, but emotional factors could be exaggerating his perception of severity. - Areas most affected: His description of pain and swelling are probably accurate, but his expressed concern about illness seriousness and fears of complications may be somewhat amplified. - Reliability: Fairly high for describing the physical symptoms, but caution is needed in interpreting the perceived severity and emotional impact, as his anxiety may exaggerate how seriously he perceives his illness.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: As a young child, Liam may not fully understand or articulate the chronicity or progression of his symptoms. He might not be aware of the natural course or underlying causes, so some details may be oversimplified or emotionally skewed. He could be under-reporting subtle symptoms like earache or mild malaise, focusing only on his most distressing sensations. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical symptoms such as initial mild swelling or early fever might have been more subtle initially but are being perceived as severe now due to emotional distress. Conversely, he may overemphasize the pain and swelling because of his fear. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about getting very sick or having serious complications, like brain problems or deafness, are common child responses but may magnify his perception of danger beyond what the clinical signs warrant. - True timeline: His reported timeline seems consistent, but emotional amplification might cause him to perceive the worsening as more rapid or severe than the physical reality. His concerns about \u201cfeeling worse yesterday\u201d are plausible but might be influenced by his distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need details about how Liam's symptoms began, what he was doing when they started, whether he notices triggers or relief factors, and if he has any other associated symptoms or recent exposures. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the timeline and progression of symptoms, explore possible sources of infection or trauma, and identify any additional symptoms that could suggest severity or alternative diagnoses. - Patient factors: Liam is a young child with expressive and emotionally charged language, which suggests the importance of gentle, open-ended questions that allow him to describe his experience freely without feeling pressured or overwhelmed. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, encourage elaboration, gather detailed symptom onset and progression data, and explore Liam\u2019s emotional response to his illness to assess distress and understanding.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to promote detailed narratives about onset and course. - Information target: How the symptoms started, what Liam noticed first, changes over time, and any specific triggers or alleviating factors. - Communication approach: Use simple language, gentle tone, and concrete prompts to ensure Liam feels comfortable sharing his story. - Expected value: Establishes a clear timeline, uncovers potential causative factors, and enhances understanding of symptom dynamics, aiding differential diagnosis and establishing trust.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your face started to feel or look different?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Acute onset after playing soccer suggests possible trauma from a ball or elbow, leading to epithelial disruption causing redness, tearing, and discomfort.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Common after contact sports, presenting with eye redness, tearing, and swelling; usually bilateral but can be unilateral initially.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Characterized by redness, tearing, and swelling, especially in patients with atopy, though less likely to be triggered specifically after playing sports.  4. Diagnosis: Traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Trauma during sports can cause blood vessel rupture leading to localized redness and swelling, often painless.  5. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Sudden onset after playing sports raises suspicion of an eyelash, dirt, or debris foreign body causing local irritation, redness, and tearing.  6. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Inflammation of eyelid margins causes redness, swelling, and tearing; can be triggered or worsened by environmental exposure.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Presents with redness and tearing, although usually associated with pain and photophobia; less common immediately after trauma but important to consider.  8. Diagnosis: Acute glaucoma (angle-closure) Justification: Presents with redness, tearing, and visual disturbances; typically involves severe pain and halos\u2014less likely without mention of pain.  9. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness after trauma could signify infection extending into the orbit; usually with pain, fever, and systemic signs.  10. Diagnosis: Hyphema Justification: Traumatic injury from sports can cause bleeding into the anterior chamber; presents with red eye and visual disturbance; important to recognize as urgent.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam uses emotional words like \"really bad,\" \"hurts so much,\" and \"worse,\" which highlight his distress.

    "input": "A male adult presents with facial swelling and discomfort, accompanied by fever and headache. The patient reports symptoms beginning with mild facial soreness that progressively worsened over approximately one day to notable swelling, particularly in the cheeks and jaw area. While subjective reports describe rapid deterioration and significant pain, clinical assessment has yet to confirm the severity; physical examination details are pending. The current presentation suggests an inflammatory or infectious process involving facial soft tissues, with symptoms consistent with cellulitis or sinusitis, although the exact severity requires physical confirmation. The patient's emotional distress may have heightened perceived severity, warranting a comprehensive physical exam and further diagnostic evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Cellulitis of the face Justification: The rapid development of facial swelling and pain with systemic symptoms like fever strongly suggests cellulitis, which is inflammation/infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The progression over one day indicates an acute infectious process, likely bacterial, most commonly streptococcal or staphylococcal. The facial region involved and the presence of systemic signs support this diagnosis as the most probable.  2. Diagnosis: Sinusitis Justification: Headache and facial swelling in the cheek and jaw area may be secondary to sinus infection, especially maxillary sinusitis, contributing to facial discomfort and swelling. Fever and headache are common features. Sinusitis can sometimes extend to cause facial cellulitis, making it both a primary and complicating diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Odontogenic infection/abscess Justification: The involvement of jaw and cheek regions raises suspicion of a dental origin, such as an abscessed tooth, leading to facial swelling and pain. Dental infections often present with localized swelling, discomfort, and systemic signs, fitting this patient's presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Dacryoadenitis or other lacrimal gland inflammation Justification: Although less likely given the prominent cheek and jaw swelling, lacrimal gland inflammation can cause facial swelling and discomfort, especially near the orbit. The presence of systemic infection makes this less probable but still consideration in facial swelling differential.  5. Diagnosis: Necrotizing fasciitis Justification: This is a severe, rapidly progressing soft tissue infection, but typically accompanied by skin necrosis, crepitus, and systemic toxicity, which are not currently detailed in the vignette. Still, it must be considered given the rapid progression and systemic symptoms, though less likely in initial presentation without skin necrosis or other signs.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam's responses are characterized by vague but emotionally charged language such as \"really bad,\" \"hurts so much,\" and \"so much.\" He uses simple, direct language with minimal clinical terminology, favoring emotional descriptors over precise details. For example, he describes his head as \"pounding\" but doesn't specify when or how it started; he quickly emphasizes his fears about getting sicker. His language shows he is overwhelmed and distressed, focusing more on his feelings than on detailed factual information. - Information flow: His responses are forthcoming but heavily centered on expressing his distress. He tends to elaborate on how badly he feels, but he does not volunteer extensive background details unless prompted. Responses are organized around his emotional state, often repeating concerns about severity and his suffering. - Response style: Liam tends to give minimal to moderate elaboration, sticking to short sentences that emphasize his discomfort. He is direct when describing pain but less detailed about the timeline or other health history, possibly due to anxiety or difficulty articulating specifics. His pattern suggests he is primarily seeking reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is no clear evidence of intentional withholding, but Liam's focus on pain and worry may overshadow attempts to share relevant but less distressing details. His statements are predominantly about severity, which might lead him to omit less alarming aspects. - Minimization behaviors: There is little evidence of genuine minimization; instead, Liam seems to exaggerate his symptoms, possibly as a way to communicate his distress effectively. For instance, repeatedly emphasizing how \"bad\" it is suggests amplification rather than minimization. - Amplification patterns: The boy frequently uses words like \"really bad,\" \"hurts so much,\" and \"pounding,\" which indicate he might be amplifying his discomfort to gain attention or reassurance. His highlighting of severe pain and fear suggests emotional amplification of his symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None are evident; Liam is open about his fears and symptoms, displaying no reluctance or discomfort about discussing his health. - Confusion/memory issues: Minor timeline inconsistencies (e.g., initial feeling \"kinda okay\" followed by rapid worsening) are typical for an anxious child but don't strongly indicate confusion. It may reflect emotional distress more than memory issues. - Family influence: The responses don't overtly show influence from family, but his focus on distress could be reinforced by caregiver concern or reassurance attempts, which are not fully detailed here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be emotional amplification \u2013 he is over-reporting severity driven by anxiety and fear. There\u2019s also a tendency toward narrative embellishment, emphasizing pain and worry. - Severity: Moderate, as his emotional state significantly influences reporting patterns, inflating his symptoms' severity but not necessarily fabricating details. - Areas most affected: His descriptions of pain intensity and worries about serious complications are most biased, as emotional distress likely amplifies these perceptions. Details about initial onset are less emphasized, possibly minimizing early subtle symptoms. - Reliability: Self-reporting is somewhat skewed by emotional factors; his reports reflect high distress levels, likely exaggerating symptom severity. Therefore, clinical assessment should corroborate with objective findings.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about initial mild symptoms or any prior unnoticed issues are probably underreported or minimized; he might also dismiss earlier, less severe discomforts as insignificant. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early or less intense symptoms such as mild fever or initial cheek discomfort might be underplayed, as he mainly emphasizes the current severe pain. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about severe complications and lifelong consequences are likely exaggerated due to anxiety, possibly overestimating the seriousness of his condition. - True timeline: The progression might be more gradual, with less severe early symptoms, but the child perceives and reports rapid worsening, driven by anxiety rather than actual symptom escalation.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Periorbital (Preseptal) Cellulitis Justification: The rapid onset of eyelid swelling, redness, and tearing following physical activity suggests an infectious process, likely superficial, involving skin and soft tissue around the eye. It is common after minor trauma or insect bites, and playing soccer could facilitate bacterial entry from skin abrasions or environmental exposure. The lack of proptosis or pain with eye movement favors preseptal cellulitis over orbital cellulitis.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (Viral or Allergic) Justification: Tearing and redness are hallmark features of conjunctivitis, especially given the recent activity which could have exposed to infectious agents or allergens. Although less likely as the sole cause of eyelid swelling, conjunctivitis often co-occurs with eyelid inflammation and can cause tearing and discomfort after physical exertion or exposure to environmental irritants.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic Eyelid Hematoma or Contusion Justification: Playing soccer can result in direct trauma, leading to swelling, redness, and tearing. The acute presentation within two days is typical of mechanical injury. Swelling localized to eyelid supports this, but absence of mention of visible trauma or ecchymosis makes this slightly less probable but still relevant.  4. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Although less likely due to the absence of systemic symptoms or eye pain with movement, severe orbital cellulitis typically causes pain, proptosis, and vision changes. The recent activity and swelling could point towards an orbital process if symptoms worsen or if there are signs of deeper infection, but with current data, it's lower in probability.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic Keratoconjunctivitis Justification: Allergic reactions can cause tearing and redness, particularly after outdoor activity. However, the acute onset and swelling are more characteristic of infectious or traumatic causes. Still, allergy remains a consideration given tearing.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally intense language (\"super bad,\" \"hurts really bad,\" \"so much\") highlighting distress; some vague phrases like \"kinda okay,\" which may obscure accurate severity. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming and detailed, but driven by emotional expression; appears motivated to share symptoms thoroughly. - Response style: Elaborate, with an emphasis on describing sensations and feelings; responses are direct but laced with emotional qualifiers.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; the patient seems eager to share, though possibly underreporting milder symptoms or minimizing initial severity. - Minimization behaviors: Limited; rather, there is amplification, suggesting they might be emphasizing discomfort to convey urgency. - Amplification patterns: Strong; multiple expressions of \"super bad,\" \"worst,\" and \"so much\" indicate exaggerations driven by anxiety or fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; the patient is open about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Minor; some uncertainty in describing the onset, but generally consistent. - Family influence: Not explicit, but the expressed anxiety could be compounded by parental concern, possibly encouraging expressive distress.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as the patient seeks reassurance by emphasizing symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; the distress appears genuine but likely exaggerates the severity, especially regarding pain and concern over complications. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of pain and fears of severe outcomes are biased upwards, potentially overstating the clinical picture. - Reliability: Self-report is emotionally truthful but may overstate severity; clinical assessment should consider this bias for accurate evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle or less distressing symptoms (mild discomfort, initial mild swelling) might be underreported or minimized; the patient focuses on current severe pain. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early stages or less intense sensations may be downplayed to highlight current distress. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of serious complications and overall severity is exaggerated, necessitating reassurance and thorough medical evaluation. - True timeline: Likely consistent, with actual worsening aligning with reported progression; emotional distress may inflate perceived urgency, but the pattern suggests rapid clinical deterioration.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: We need to clarify if the eye symptoms are unilateral or bilateral, because this helps distinguish between infections like conjunctivitis (which can be bilateral) and preseptal cellulitis (usually unilateral). Also, whether there are any vision changes or pain with eye movement can differentiate orbital cellulitis from preseptal cellulitis. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm awareness of eye pain severity, associated systemic symptoms, and any signs of deeper orbital involvement. Explore recent trauma or exposure, as well as associated symptoms suggesting allergic or infectious causes. - Patient factors: The patient is quite expressive and emotionally intense, so phrasing questions gently and specifically will help obtain accurate, nuanced information. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the differential further by distinguishing between superficial and more serious orbital or deep infections, and between infectious, traumatic, or allergic causes.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about visual symptoms, pain characteristics, and associated systemic signs. - Information target: Symptom lateralization, pain quality and intensity, vision changes, systemic manifestations, and specific triggers or aggravators. - Communication approach: Ask with sensitivity to ensure the patient feels comfortable clarifying or elaborating, especially given emotional expression. - Expected value: Gather pivotal details that help differentiate preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, conjunctivitis, or trauma\u2014key to directing urgent management or reassurance.\nANSWER: Liam, you mentioned that your face feels really bad and that it hurts a lot, which is very concerning. Can you tell me if your vision is blurry or if you're having any trouble seeing out of your affected eye? Also, is the pain in your eye or around your eye worse when you move it, and is there any part of your eye that feels more painful or uncomfortable? Have you noticed if your eye looks different\u2014like if it is bulging, or if your eyelid is sticking or drooping? And lastly, are you experiencing any fever, chills, or other symptoms like headache or nausea? This will help me figure out how serious it might be.",

    "input": "The patient is a likely adolescent male presenting with a two-day history of worsening facial swelling and pain, predominantly in the cheeks and jaw region, accompanied by fever, sore throat, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and chills. Objective findings suggest facial asymmetry, warmth, and tenderness in the affected areas. There are no current signs of ocular structural abnormalities or pain around the eyes, though early ocular symptoms may have been underreported. The patient's description indicates a severe infectious process, potentially cellulitis or abscess, but the true severity may be slightly overestimated due to emotional distress influencing reporting. Further examination to assess ocular involvement, systemic infection, and possible abscess formation is required, along with a more detailed history of early or mild symptoms.Acute bacterial facial cellulitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The child uses emotionally charged descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"super tired,\" \"so much pain\") that emphasize distress, while also employing vague phrases (\"kinda okay,\" \"feel so sick\") that might obscure precise symptom severity or onset. - Information flow: Responses tend to be concise and reactive, mainly answering direct questions without spontaneously elaborating. The child appears focused on conveying their current state but hesitant to share initial or less severe symptoms proactively. - Response style: Responses are generally direct but influenced by emotional content, with a pattern of emphasizing pain and fears repeatedly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little apparent withholding; the child answers questions straightforwardly, but may avoid elaborating on less severe or initial symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal, as initial mild discomfort was acknowledged, but the focus thereafter is on worsening and severity. - Amplification patterns: Clear exaggeration of distress, e.g., \"really bad,\" \"super bad,\" reflecting emotional amplification rather than deception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; responses reflect open expression of fear and pain. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; responses are consistent and aligned with the timeline provided. - Family influence: Not overtly influenced; responses seem centered on the child's perception.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014child magnifies their distress to communicate urgency and concern. - Severity: Moderate\u2014while emotional language emphasizes the severity, it does not distort facts significantly, but it may inflate perceived urgency. - Areas most affected: Expressions of pain intensity and concerns about severe complications, which are emphasized strongly. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014self-reports are emotional and vivid, which may lead to slight overestimation of discomfort and fears but are generally trustworthy in descriptive content.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early, milder symptoms or initial stages of illness; particularly, subtle signs of less severe disease may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: No strong evidence of symptom minimization; however, initial discomfort could have been less severe than described. - Concerns probably amplified: Fears about severe outcomes (vision loss, brain problems) are likely exaggerated relative to actual risk, influenced by emotional distress. - True timeline: Likely gradual worsening from mild symptoms, but the child's focus on current pain may overshadow recognition of earlier stages, leading to a perception of rapid deterioration.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: We still need to clarify whether there were any initial mild symptoms that might differentiate between early signs of cellulitis, abscess, or other diagnoses, and whether neurological or vision changes have occurred or are imminent. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm criteria for severe facial cellulitis with possible ocular involvement, distinguish from other conditions such as orbital cellulitis, abscess, or even systemic infections. - Patient factors: The child's responses are emotionally expressive but concise; questions should be direct yet sensitive, ensuring comfort and clarity. - Interview phase goals: To finalize diagnostic certainty by confirming specific symptoms, progression, and signs of complications, and to assess the child's understanding and concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and confirmatory questions to clarify specific features. - Information target: Early symptoms, onset timeline, progression of pain, ocular symptoms, neurological involvement, and any previous similar episodes. - Communication approach: Frame questions simply and empathetically to facilitate detailed responses, avoiding leading or ambiguous phrasing. - Expected value: Clarify whether features suggest orbital or periorbital involvement, or systemic spread, and refine differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"Liam, you mentioned that the pain and swelling started about two days ago and have gotten worse. Before that, did you notice any mild tenderness or discomfort earlier, maybe even a little bump or soreness that seemed like it was starting? Also, when you look at your face now, do you see any changes in your eye or around it\u2014like it looks different than usual, feels more bulgy, or if you notice anything unusual when you blink or move your eye? Have you experienced any vision problems, like blurriness or trouble seeing? And in the last day or so, have you noticed if your eye or the area around it has become more painful or more swollen, especially when you look in different directions? These details will help us decide how serious this might be and what needs to be done.\"",
