    "input": "A clinical vignette would describe a patient, likely middle-aged or older, presenting with physical findings of enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical and axillary regions, which have been gradually increasing in size over several months. The patient reports systemic symptoms including night sweats and weight loss, though the severity of these symptoms may be overemphasized due to anxiety. Physical examination findings confirm lymphadenopathy; systemic signs are suggestive of a possible lymphoproliferative disorder, but further assessment is needed. Emotional distress related to health concerns is probable but may not be fully articulated, warranting sensitive exploration. Additional details regarding symptom timeline, associated symptoms like fatigue or pain, and emotional impact are essential for a thorough evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Typical presentation of painless, progressive lymphadenopathy in cervical and axillary regions; systemic \"B\" symptoms like night sweats and weight loss highly suggest Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which is common in middle-aged adults.  2. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Similar lymphadenopathy pattern and systemic symptoms; however, non-Hodgkin subtypes are slightly more common and may present similarly.  3. Diagnosis: Metastatic Cancer Justification: Enlarged lymph nodes can be secondary to metastasis from primary epithelial tumors (e.g., breast, lung); systemic symptoms reinforce need to exclude solid tumor metastases.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis Justification: Can cause diffuse lymphadenopathy, mainly in younger adults, with systemic symptoms; however, usually associated with acute infection signs, less common in older patients.  5. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Lymphadenitis) Justification: Chronic lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms like weight loss and night sweats; often involves cervical nodes, especially in endemic areas.  6. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis Justification: Causes non-caseating granulomatous lymphadenopathy, often with systemic symptoms that include weight loss; commonly involves thoracic nodes but can involve others.  7. Diagnosis: Castleman\u2019s Disease Justification: Presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, systemic inflammatory symptoms, and constitutional complaints; more rare but relevant.  8. Diagnosis: Leukemia (e.g., Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) Justification: Can present with lymphadenopathy, especially in older adults; systemic symptoms like weight loss occur, and peripheral smear may reveal abnormal lymphocytes.  9. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Lymphadenopathy Justification: Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can cause enlarged lymph nodes with systemic symptoms, but usually with additional signs of autoimmunity.  10. Diagnosis: Drug Reaction or Benign Reactive Lymphadenopathy Justification: Less likely given chronicity and systemic symptoms, but should be considered if other causes are ruled out; typically more transient.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific, emotionally charged language emphasizing severity (\"getting bigger,\" \"drenched in sweat,\" \"losing weight\") to convey urgency. She avoids overly technical terms, opting for straightforward descriptions, but her tone indicates significant concern. - Information flow: She responds directly but with restrained details, possibly withholding emotional or contextual information unless asked. She readily shares her main physical symptoms, indicating openness about physical discomforts, but may be less forthcoming about emotional distress unless prompted. - Response style: Her reply is concise yet informative, with a focus on symptoms that she perceives as most critical. Her patterns suggest she aims to communicate her distress clearly but keeps some emotional nuances subdued, likely to maintain composure.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding here, but her reserved demeanor and potential discomfort with emotional disclosure may delay full understanding of her psychological state. - Minimization behaviors: She does not explicitly minimize her symptoms but could be downplaying the emotional impact, as her focus remains on physical symptoms and their progression. - Amplification patterns: Her emphasis on \"getting bigger,\" \"waking drenched,\" and \"losing weight\" indicates she may be amplifying her concern to prompt immediate attention, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her reserved speech and cautious tone suggest possible embarrassment or shame about discussing her emotional vulnerability or fears of cancer. - Confusion/memory issues: She presents a clear timeline, so no significant confusion is evident. - Family influence: No clear evidence, but her concern about serious illness could stem from family experiences or media, influencing her perception.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven overemphasis and possible emotional underdisclosure, leading to an amplification of physical symptoms and concern about severity. - Severity: Moderate, as her anxiety influences her perception and expression of symptoms but does not distort facts overtly. - Areas most affected: Her emotional state and perception of severity, with physical symptoms being largely reported accurately but perceived as more urgent. - Reliability: Her report of physical symptoms appears trustworthy; however, her emotional overlay suggests some degree of distortion in perception of risk due to anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully disclose her emotional distress or fears of diagnosis, which could be relevant for holistic assessment and management. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her emotional suffering might be understated, but her physical symptoms are likely accurately described. - Concerns probably amplified: She greatly fears serious illness, possibly overestimating the immediate danger, leading to heightened anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have progressed over months; however, her emotional impact might cause her to perceive this progression as more rapid or severe than it actually is.",

    "input": "A middle-aged female patient presents with a two to three-month history of gradually enlarging, painless lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions. She reports systemic symptoms including night sweats and fatigue. She indicates weight loss, which she describes as minor, though objective measurement may reveal it to be more significant. Her emotional distress suggests anxiety that could influence her symptom reporting, potentially leading to amplification of distress or underreporting of certain symptoms, such as pain or fever. The clinical picture is consistent with lymphadenopathy of unclear etiology, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation to determine cause and severity.1. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Painless, persistent lymphadenopathy in cervical and axillary regions with systemic B symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, fatigue) strongly suggests lymphoma, which can have a gradual onset in middle-aged adults and often presents without pain.  2. Diagnosis: Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Similar presentation with painless lymphadenopathy and B symptoms, especially if lymph nodes are mediastinal or cervical. Typically affects young to middle-aged adults and can present with systemic symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) Justification: Chronic lymphadenopathy in middle age with systemic symptoms such as fatigue and night sweats; CLL/SLL can present with painless lymph nodes and is common in this demographic.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV) Justification: Though more common in younger adults, EBV can cause persistent lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and systemic symptoms; however, the duration (2-3 months) makes this less typical.  5. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Lymphadenitis) Justification: Can cause painless lymphadenopathy, especially in endemic areas, with systemic symptoms like night sweats and weight loss; usually associated with exposure history.  6. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Lymphadenopathy (e.g., Sarcoidosis, SLE) Justification: Can present with painless enlarged lymph nodes and systemic symptoms such as fatigue; less common but important to consider.  7. Diagnosis: Metastatic Malignancy Justification: Lymphadenopathy from regional metastatic cancers (e.g., breast, lung) can present with painless nodes; systemic symptoms less prominent unless advanced.  8. Diagnosis: Cat Scratch Disease Justification: Usually causes localized lymphadenopathy associated with a history of cat exposure, often painful; less likely given chronicity and lack of pain reported.  9. Diagnosis: Reactive Lymphadenopathy from Other Infections Justification: Often painful and transient; persists less than 2 months typically, which makes this less likely given the chronic course.  10. Diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma Justification: Less likely as it primarily presents with bone pain, anemia, and hypercalcemia, not isolated lymphadenopathy.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses straightforward but emotionally charged language (\"so tired,\" \"soaked through sheets,\" \"feeling so strange\"). She slightly minimizes her weight loss but amplifies her distress. - Information flow: She volunteers detailed symptom descriptions early, indicating high anxiety and a need to express her concerns. Her responses are organized around her emotional experience, with clear emphasis on worsening and severity. - Response style: She responds with sincerity but with emotional emphasis, making her descriptions more dramatic than clinical. Her responses are somewhat elaborative due to her distress, though generally direct about the timeline and symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None; she openly shares her main symptoms but minimizes some aspects. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying her weight loss (\"not that bad\" despite significant loss), indicating possible reluctance to acknowledge this symptom\u2019s gravity. - Amplification patterns: Heightening her distress through intense descriptions (\"soaked through sheets,\" \"feeling so strange\"). - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild; her tearfulness and overwhelmed tone suggest vulnerability but not explicit shame. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; her timeline seems consistent. - Family influence: Not apparent from her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014her anxiety influences her report, exaggerating her distress, but she remains relatively accurate in her timeline. Some signs of minimization of severity (weight loss). - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014her distress impacts how she describes her symptoms, but her core facts are accurate. - Areas most affected: Emotional expression regarding night sweats and fatigue; possible underreporting of weight loss severity. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; her emotional distress may inflate perceived severity but her timeline and key symptoms are consistent.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be underreporting the extent of her weight loss or focusing on emotional impact rather than the objective severity of certain symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her description of weight loss minimizes its seriousness, though objectively significant. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of cancer and the severity of her symptoms are heightened by her emotional state. - True timeline: Symptoms have likely been progressing over two to three months, as she states, though her distress may influence her perception of their rapid worsening.",
    "output": "THINKING: The information gathered so far includes her description of lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and emotional distress. However, she emphasizes emotional impact and distress, which could influence her perception and reporting. To further explore her experience and build trust, I should invite her to elaborate on her overall experience and how she perceives her health changes. This helps deepen rapport and may reveal additional nuances. Since she mentions feeling \u201cso strange,\u201d I can inquire about what that means to her personally, encouraging her to describe her feelings and any other symptoms she may have noticed but not yet mentioned. It\u2019s also important to gently explore her understanding of her symptoms and her worries to address her emotional state constructively. This will help clarify her perspective and gather vital contextual details for differential diagnosis.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Specific details about her overall feelings of health, additional symptoms she might be experiencing, and her personal interpretation of \u201cfeeling so strange.\u201d - Diagnostic priorities: Differential symptoms related to systemic illnesses like lymphoma, infections, or autoimmune conditions. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and tendency to elaborate suggest she wants to be heard; questions should be gentle and validating. - Interview phase goals: Deepen understanding of her subjective experience, assess her emotional response, and begin to explore her own understanding of her symptoms.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage detailed description about her overall health perception. - Information target: Personal experience of health, feelings of being unwell, any additional subtle symptoms, and her emotional response. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental phrasing that validates her feelings, e.g., \u201cCan you tell me more about how you've been feeling overall lately?\u201d - Expected value: This question will help understand her subjective health status, gauge her emotional impact, and identify any additional symptoms or concerns not yet expressed.\nANSWER: \"That sounds like it\u2019s been really overwhelming for you.

    "input": "A middle-aged female presents with a two to three-month history of enlarging, painless lymphadenopathy involving cervical and axillary regions. She reports systemic symptoms including night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue; however, her descriptions are cautious and suggest these symptoms may be more severe than she discloses. She also reports feeling \"kinda down\" and consistently tired, though these emotional symptoms may be underreported. The progression appears gradual, but the true severity of her systemic and emotional symptoms could be more significant. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate the extent of her systemic illness and emotional well-being, with attention to possible underrecognized symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Classic presentation of painless, progressive lymphadenopathy in cervical and axillary regions with systemic B symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss; age group can fit middle-aged adults; systemic symptoms and lymph node involvement favor this diagnosis; B symptoms are prominent and typical.  2. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Similar lymphadenopathy pattern and systemic symptoms, especially in middle-aged individuals; possible more widespread nodal or extranodal involvement; distinguishes itself from Hodgkin lymphoma in some histological and clinical features, but clinically overlaps significantly.  3. Diagnosis: Tuberculous Lymphadenitis (Scrofula) Justification: Chronic, painless lymphadenopathy involving cervical nodes; systemic symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss could be consistent; however, less common axillary involvement in TB; requires consideration given systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy.  4. Diagnosis: Viral Lymphadenopathy (e.g., EBV or CMV) Justification: Usually involves posterior cervical nodes; systemic symptoms such as fatigue and malaise are common; usually self-limited, but prolonged course over months makes this less likely; does not fully explain systemic B symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) Justification: Can present with lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, fatigue, and mood disturbances; however, the prominent and isolated lymphadenopathy with B symptoms makes this less probable without other specific features.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her responses suggest she is deliberately or subconsciously minimizing her emotional distress (\"kinda down,\" \"I think\"), perhaps to avoid admitting vulnerability. - Minimization behaviors: Use of unassertive language (\"kinda,\" \"like I can't shake it\") indicates she might be downplaying how severe her symptoms truly are. - Amplification patterns: She does not exaggerate her symptoms; responses are restrained, balancing between honesty and minimization. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Lack of explicit embarrassment, but the guarded tone hints she might feel uncomfortable fully revealing emotional vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence. - Family influence: None apparent in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild emotional minimization bias\u2014she appears to understate her mood and fatigue, possibly to avoid further anxiety or because she lacks the language to fully express her emotional state. - Severity: Mild, as her responses are overall honest but understated. - Areas most affected: Her emotional state and perceived severity of fatigue are somewhat biased. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her reporting provides useful info but is likely conservative regarding her true distress level.

    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: We need more detailed information on her emotional symptoms, their impact, and whether she has experienced similar episodes before, to clarify if mood disturbances are primary or secondary. - Diagnostic priorities: Explore symptoms that can help distinguish depression, lymphoma-related fatigue, or other systemic illnesses, focusing on emotional and physical aspects. - Patient factors: Her guarded tone and tendency to minimize emotional distress suggest the need for gentle, open-ended questions that encourage her to share more comfortably. - Interview phase goals: Further clarify the severity and functional impact of emotional symptoms, uncover any history of similar mood issues, and identify triggers or alleviating factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions that gently probe her emotional experience and daily functioning. - Information target: Depth of emotional symptoms, duration, impact on life, previous episodes, and any associated emotional triggers or reliefs. - Communication approach: Phrase questions sensitively and tentatively, acknowledging her guarded responses (\"You mentioned feeling 'kinda down', can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally, and how that has affected your daily life?\"). - Expected value: This will help determine whether her emotional symptoms are consistent with depression, a reaction to her physical illness, or other psychological factors, refining her differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned feeling 'kinda down' and that you can\u2019t quite shake it.

    "input": "A middle-aged female presents with a two to three-month history of enlarging, painless lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions. She reports systemic symptoms including night sweats, unintended weight loss, and severe fatigue, which appear consistent with her descriptions but may be understated emotionally. She describes feeling \"kinda down\" and lacks motivation, yet her language suggests she may be minimizing the severity of her emotional distress; her emotional state could be more significant than disclosed. The physical symptoms suggest a systemic process such as lymphoma or another malignancy, with lymphadenopathy likely indicative of underlying pathology. Her communication indicates potential emotional impairment, including depression or anxiety, which may be underrecognized due to guarded responses. Further assessment is needed to explore her psychological well-being and confirm the physical diagnosis.1. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: The primary consideration given the painless, progressive lymphadenopathy in multiple regions alongside constitutional symptoms like night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. These are classic \"B symptoms\" of lymphoma, and the duration matches typical presentation. The absence of pain and localized features supports this diagnosis over infectious causes.  2. Diagnosis: Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: Also presents with painless lymphadenopathy and B symptoms; however, typically involves cervical nodes more prominently initially. The diffuse pattern and duration favor a broader non-Hodgkin process, but Hodgkin lymphoma remains a differential given overlapping features.  3. Diagnosis: Chronic Infectious Lymphadenitis (e.g., Tuberculous Lymphadenitis) Justification: Chronic enlargement of lymph nodes can sometimes stem from infections like tuberculosis or other granulomatous diseases. However, the systemic \"B symptoms\" are more characteristic of lymphoma, making infection less likely unless other risk factors or exposures are identified.  4. Diagnosis: Metastatic Solid Tumor Justification: While possible, especially from breast or other regional malignancies, the absence of a primary tumor or other specific features makes this less probable based on current data.  5. Diagnosis: Depression with Somatic Manifestations Justification: The patient's report of \"feeling down\" and low motivation, possibly understated emotional distress, suggests depression or anxiety. While mental health issues could contribute to perceived physical symptoms, they do not fully explain the lymphadenopathy and constitutional signs, but may coexist.

She provides organized but limited responses, especially about emotional well-being. - Response style: Responses are generally minimal and cautious, especially regarding emotional topics, with occasional elaboration when physically describing symptoms. Her answers are deliberate and sometimes hesitant, with pauses indicating anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal emotional disclosure, vague descriptions of mood, and hesitation imply she conceals the depth of her emotional distress. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying her emotional suffering (\"I guess I\u2019m just overwhelmed now\") and using vague language show effort to minimize her internal struggles. - Amplification patterns: Her vivid descriptions of physical symptoms (night sweats, weight loss) suggest an attempt to convey urgency, possibly to ensure these issues are acknowledged, but emotional concerns are downplayed. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The reluctance to fully discuss her emotional state and slight evasiveness suggest feelings of shame or embarrassment about vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Family history is acknowledged but not evident as influencing her responses beyond factual context.  BIAS ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is **minimization and emotional withholding**, with an emphasis on physical symptoms over emotional well-being. - Severity: **Moderate to severe**, as her emotional distress is significantly underreported, impacting comprehensive assessment. - Areas most affected: Psychological and emotional areas, with potential underestimation of depression, anxiety, or motivation issues; physical symptoms are communicated more openly. - Reliability: Physical symptom reporting is likely reliable; emotional state data is less trustworthy due to guarded responses and vague language.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper emotional issues such as depression, anxiety severity, and functional impairment are probably underdisclosed. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her emotional suffering and psychological impact are more severe than indicated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about cancer and physical deterioration may be exaggerated, driven by underlying anxiety, which might distort her perception. - True timeline: Physical symptoms align reasonably with her timeline; emotional deterioration may be more rapid or severe but is underreported.",

The physical symptoms are consistent with a systemic illness such as lymphoma, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation. Her psychological symptoms warrant thorough assessment due to possible response bias, as she appears to minimize or withhold the extent of her emotional suffering.Lymphoma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and minimization language, such as \"kind of down,\" \"not myself,\" and \"a little tired,\" which may obscure true emotional severity. Her responses are often qualified (\"I guess,\" \"kind of\") indicating discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose feelings. Emotional language appears limited, possibly due to shame or fear.  - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant, providing only surface-level details unless explicitly prompted. Her responses are organized but sparse, often deflecting or minimizing, which suggests a guarded communication style. She tends to withhold deeper emotional context.  - Response style: Her responses are minimal and somewhat cautious, avoiding elaboration on feelings. When discussing emotional impact, she prefers to stay vague and avoid potential emotional exposure.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her hesitation, use of vague language, and minimal elaboration on emotional topics indicate reluctance to fully share mental health status. She avoids direct discussion of her emotional impact unless asked directly about feelings.  - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her emotional distress (\"not that bad,\" \"kind of down\") and hesitates over expressing true feelings, possibly to avoid vulnerability or stigma.  - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s little evidence of exaggeration; rather, she underreports emotional pain relative to her physical suffering, indicating minimization rather than amplification.  - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her reluctance to detail emotional struggles and qualifying language suggest discomfort or shame about emotional vulnerability.  - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion or memory issues are present; responses are consistent.  - Family influence: No evident influence from family or others seen here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias is Response Bias toward Emotional Minimization, driven by discomfort or shame, leading to underreporting emotional distress. - Severity: Moderate, as she openly reports physical symptoms but underdiscloses emotional suffering, which could be significant. - Areas most affected: Emotional state explanations are most biased, potentially hiding severity of emotional distress. - Reliability: Their self-report on emotional well-being is somewhat limited, so it should be supplemented with observation or clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The full extent of her emotional suffering, potential depression, or anxiety is probably underreported. She may be experiencing more profound emotional impact than indicated. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her emotional distress appears understated; she may be feeling worse internally than she expresses. - Concerns probably amplified: Her physical symptoms are real, but her emotional response may be less intense than she reports, or she may avoid discussing mental health issues altogether. - True timeline: Emotional difficulties could be more longstanding or more acute than she admits, given her reluctance to fully share her feelings.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need to clarify the patient's true emotional state, as she tends to minimize or qualify her feelings, which could obscure underlying depression or anxiety. Also, understanding how her physical health influences her mood and vice versa is important for diagnosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Explore whether symptoms meet criteria for clinical depression or an anxiety disorder, given her systemic illness and emotional presentation. Also, assess emotional impact related to her physical health to differentiate primary mood disorder from somatic symptom-related distress. - Patient factors: Her guarded and minimization style suggests she may be hesitant to fully disclose emotional issues, so questions should be gentle, nonjudgmental, and open-ended to encourage honest discussion. - Interview phase goals: Confirm or rule out depression and/or anxiety, assess the severity of emotional symptoms, and determine if they are attributable to her physical illness or a separate mental health issue. Prepare her for the possibility of diagnosis while respecting her communication style.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and open-ended questions to elicit detailed emotional responses without triggering defensiveness. - Information target: The depth and duration of emotional symptoms, their impact on her daily functioning, and her own interpretation of these feelings. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, empathetic language, emphasizing that many physical illnesses can affect mood and that understanding her experience fully is helpful for her care. - Expected value: This will help determine if her emotional symptoms meet criteria for depression or anxiety, clarify the relationship with her physical symptoms, and prepare her for potential treatment plans.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, I want to understand more about how you've been feeling emotionally overall, especially since you mentioned feeling 'kinda down.' Sometimes, physical health issues can influence mood, but it's also important to see if you're experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, worry, or low interest that might be more than just a reaction to physical illness. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally over the past few months\u2014like, are there days or times when you feel more overwhelmed or distressed, and how this has been affecting things like your motivation, sleep, or enjoyment in activities?\"",
