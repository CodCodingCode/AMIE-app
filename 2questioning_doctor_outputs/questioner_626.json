    "input": "A 62-year-old male presents with an objectively sudden onset of intense, tearing, and burning pain localized to the lower extremity, extending toward the groin. He reports accompanying systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and an increased heart rate. Despite reports of worsening pain with activity and initial inability to walk, the degree of underlying tissue or neurological impairment needs to be confirmed through physical examination. Symptoms are consistent with an acute vascular or neurological event, but patient-reported severity and emotional focus may exaggerate perceived risk. Objective assessment is necessary to evaluate for neurological deficits, vascular compromise, and systemic signs to guide urgent management decisions.1. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Sudden onset of tearing, intense pain radiating toward the groin, systemic symptoms such as sweating, nausea, tachycardia, all are classic features of an acute aortic dissection, especially in an older male. The location and nature of pain strongly support this diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Iliac Artery Occlusion Justification: The pain radiating to the groin and lower extremity ischemia signs could suggest arterial occlusion, possibly secondary to dissection or embolism. Systemic symptoms align with acute vascular compromise.  3. Diagnosis: Acute Peripheral Arterial Thrombosis Justification: Sudden limb pain with systemic signs could be due to thrombosis within peripheral arteries; however, less likely given the radiating, tearing pain typical of dissection.  4. Diagnosis: Lumbar Radiculopathy Justification: Radiculopathy can cause radiating limb pain, but it usually has a more gradual onset, lacks systemic symptoms, and doesn\u2019t cause tearing pain.  5. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis Justification: DVT could cause leg pain and systemic symptoms, but the description of tearing, burning pain, and radiation toward the groin points more toward arterial pathology.  6. Diagnosis: Critical Limb Ischemia Justification: Presents with severe limb pain; however, often in chronic or subacute settings, and doesn't typically involve sudden tearing pain or systemic symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Neurogenic Pain or Spinal Cord Ischemia Justification: Could cause limb pain, but less likely given the description of tearing, intense pain, and systemic symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or Soft Tissue Infection Justification: Associated with systemic symptoms, but typically causes localized swelling, redness, and doesn\u2019t present with tearing or radiating pain.  9. Diagnosis: Acute Musculoskeletal Injury Justification: Sudden limb pain could suggest this, but systemic symptoms and pain quality do not fit typical musculoskeletal causes.  10. Diagnosis: Acute Compartment Syndrome Justification: Severe pain out of proportion and systemic symptoms could suggest this, but the presentation lacks definitive swelling or limb pallor, and tearing pain is less typical.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vivid, emotional language (\"terrible,\" \"burning,\" \"tearing\") to convey urgency, and emphasizes onset (\"all at once, out of nowhere\") to highlight severity. - Information flow: They communicate openly, volunteering detailed symptom descriptions and emotional concerns, indicating a readiness to share information but also driven by anxiety for reassurance. - Response style: Responses are detailed and somewhat dramatic, focusing on symptom intensity and emotional impact, possibly to elicit concern and validation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; patient appears forthcoming with current symptoms. Slightly hesitant when discussing fears, but overall willing to share. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; they articulate symptoms strongly, emphasizing severity, so signs of downplaying are limited. - Amplification patterns: The detailed and emotive language suggests some emotional amplification, possibly driven by anxiety, but not necessarily exaggerating beyond reality. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; patient openly discusses symptoms and fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusions; the timeline and symptom description are consistent. - Family influence: Not evident directly; however, family history seems to influence their worry level, fueling anxiety.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as the patient emphasizes the severity and urgency of symptoms due to anxiety, which is typical in acute vascular concerns. - Severity: Moderate, since their descriptive responses are accurate but possibly heightened by emotional distress. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity and urgency, potentially amplifying fears about limb loss or death. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy, but emotional bias could slightly inflate perceived threat levels, warranting careful clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Patient may underreport milder or chronic symptoms, or dismiss less dramatic aspects of health history, due to focus on the acute episode. - Symptoms probably minimized: No significant evidence of minimizing; their descriptions are vivid and prioritize serious signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Yes, their fear and anxiety seem to amplify the perceived threat, possibly leading to overestimating danger severity. - True timeline: The reported sudden onset aligns with clinical likelihood, but emotional distress might make the timeline seem more dramatic than reality.  In summary, the patient communicates openly but with emotional amplification, mainly driven by anxiety, which influences their perception of severity.

    "input": "A 62-year-old male presents with an acute onset of severe, sharp, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity extending toward the groin, accompanied by systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and tachycardia. He reports worsening pain with activity and an inability to walk, suggestive of a potentially urgent vascular or neurological process. Given communication patterns indicating symptom amplification and limited background disclosure, further examination and history are necessary to assess for underlying vascular compromise, neurological deficits, and prior similar episodes. Physical assessment and diagnostics are critical to guide appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Tearing, severe chest/abdominal pain radiating to the groin, systemic symptoms like sweating and tachycardia suggest acute aortic dissection, especially in older males with risk factors. The pain's character and radiation are classic.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Iliac or Femoral Arterial Occlusion Justification: The presentation with sharp leg pain, inability to walk, and systemic symptoms indicates limb ischemia secondary to arterial occlusion; frequently caused by embolism or thrombosis.  3. Diagnosis: Spinal Cord Ischemia or Cauda Equina Syndrome Justification: Neurological deficits with severe leg pain and inability to walk point toward neurological compromise; systemic symptoms less typical, but vascular causes could affect spinal cord blood supply.  4. Diagnosis: Peripheral Arterial Disease Exacerbation / Acute Limb Ischemia Justification: Chronic PAD can acutely worsen, leading to limb ischemia presenting with severe pain, pallor, and inability to walk, especially in older males with atherosclerosis.  5. Diagnosis: Lumbar Radiculopathy (e.g., Sciatica) Justification: Sharp leg pain radiating towards groin with activity worsens pain, but systemic symptoms like sweating and tachycardia are less typical; less likely as primary cause.  6. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis Justification: Presents with leg pain and swelling; however, the described symptoms of tearing pain and systemic features are less characteristic, making this less probable.  7. Diagnosis: Acute Musculoskeletal Injury Justification: Sudden severe pain could suggest injury, but systemic symptoms and radiation toward groin point less toward purely musculoskeletal causes.  8. Diagnosis: Myocardial Ischemia Referred Pain Justification: Systemic symptoms may include sweating and tachycardia; however, the location and radiation favor lower extremity or vascular causes over cardiac referral.  9. Diagnosis: Spontaneous Hematoma or Bleed Justification: Severe pain suggests bleeding, but systemic symptoms like nausea and tachycardia with no trauma history make this less likely.  10. Diagnosis: Intra-abdominal or Pelvic Mass or Abscess Justification: Could cause systemic symptoms, but less consistent with the sudden, severe, tearing pain radiating to the groin; lower on differential.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific, emotional descriptors like \"terrible,\" \"tearing,\" and \"burning\" for current pain, indicating vivid, expressive language, but he refrains from detailed contextual info unless prompted. - Information flow: He shares immediate, pressing symptoms openly but is reluctant to volunteer comprehensive background or past episodes unless asked, reflecting an \"information withholder\" tendency. - Response style: Responds with detailed symptom descriptions when describing current pain but avoids elaborating on less immediate personal health details; responses are consistent but somewhat guarded in breadth.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited personal health background, minimal mention of prior pain episodes or triggers, suggesting reluctance or discomfort in sharing full history. - Minimization behaviors: Not clearly evident; he emphasizes severity rather than downplaying. However, by withholding background, he might be minimizing the relevance of past health issues. - Amplification patterns: The vivid descriptions of pain and associated symptoms suggest genuine distress; he emphasizes the urgency, consistent with actual concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but slight hesitations imply possible discomfort with discussing health details or private issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; responses are coherent, chronological, and consistent. - Family influence: Acknowledges family history but without emotional overstatement, likely just factual.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: \"Information withholder\" due to selective sharing of medical info, possibly driven by discomfort or privacy concerns. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 consistent symptom reporting but incomplete medical background limits comprehensive understanding. - Areas most affected: Past medical episodes, triggers, and detailed health history, which may influence risk assessment. - Reliability: Fair; current symptoms are accurately described, but some history may be underreported, adding some uncertainty.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about prior similar episodes, lifestyle factors, medication adherence, and emotional or psychological context. - Symptoms probably minimized: Underlying chronic issues or potential comorbidities may be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient appears genuinely distressed, possibly amplifying fears of severity, but this aligns with fear rather than exaggeration. - True timeline: Rapid onset and current description are likely accurate, though retrospective interpretation may be influenced by anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps focus on prior similar episodes, risk factors, and medical history to differentiate between vascular, neurological, or musculoskeletal causes. - Diagnostic priorities include ruling out aortic dissection, limb ischemia, and spinal cord compromise, given the urgency implied by the presentation. - Patient communication suggests a tendency to focus on current symptoms and avoid broad background details, necessitating gentle, open-ended exploration to elicit more information without provoking defensiveness. - Immigration is to deepen understanding of symptom context, prior episodes, and contributing factors at this stage, fostering trust and comprehensive data collection.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Use open-ended questions to encourage sharing of relevant background and context. - Focus on exploring past health issues, triggers, and impact on daily life, while maintaining patient comfort. - Phrase questions in a way that emphasizes understanding and support, avoiding medical jargon. - Collectting this info early helps triangulate the current symptoms within the patient's overall health history to guide differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me whether you've ever experienced similar pain or symptoms in the past, or if this is something entirely new for you?\"",

    "input": "A 62-year-old male presents with an acute onset of severe, sharp, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity extending toward the groin, accompanied by systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and tachycardia. He reports no previous history of similar pain, although underreporting or lack of awareness of prior minor symptoms cannot be ruled out. The current presentation suggests a possible vascular or neurological emergency, such as an arterial occlusion or nerve compression. Further assessment, including detailed history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostics, is necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide urgent management.1. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: The acute onset of severe, tearing pain radiating toward the groin, combined with systemic signs like sweating, nausea, and tachycardia, strongly suggests an aortic dissection expanding from the thoracic to abdominal aorta, possibly involving the iliac arteries, leading to limb ischemia and systemic sympathetic activation. The pattern of pain and systemic symptoms aligns with this life-threatening vascular emergency.  2. Diagnosis: Iliac or Femoral Arterial Occlusion Justification: The sharp, tearing, and burning pain extending toward the groin, with rapid onset, suggests an arterial occlusion distal to the abdominal aorta, such as iliac or common femoral artery obstruction, possibly embolic in origin. Systemic symptoms correlate with ischemia and sympathetic response, but absence of prior vascular disease signs makes this slightly less probable than dissection.  3. Diagnosis: Spinal Cord or Nerve Root Compression (Radiculopathy) Justification: Although less likely given systemic symptoms, nerve compression or radiculopathy can produce sharp, burning pain radiating toward the groin. However, the severity and systemic signs are less typical, making this a lower probability.  4. Diagnosis: Peripheral Arterial Embolism Justification: An embolic event occluding pelvic or lower limb arteries could cause sudden pain and ischemia. Its likelihood depends on risk factors like atrial fibrillation or prior vascular disease, which are unspecified. Still, acute onset pain supports this possibility.  5. Diagnosis: Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Justification: Can cause severe abdominopelvic pain with systemic symptoms. However, the primary symptom here is limb pain radiating toward the groin, making mesenteric ischemia less directly plausible but still a differential consideration given systemic signs.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs emotional descriptors such as \"terrible,\" \"like something's ripping inside,\" indicating heightened concern. Descriptions are vivid but not overly clinical, blending emotional and symptom-specific language. Responses are direct when describing the onset and nature of symptoms but tend to lack detailed past medical history unless prompted, which suggests hesitance in full disclosure. - Information flow: The patient is forthcoming about the immediate presentation\u2014onset, nature, and associated symptoms\u2014but shows reluctance or difficulty when asked about previous similar episodes or past medical details. They tend to answer straightforwardly but may avoid elaborating on past health issues unless specifically queried. - Response style: Responses are generally concise when addressing symptom description but avoid in-depth personal or past health information unless asked. They focus on the current crisis, which may imply discomfort with broader disclosure or a tendency to \"tell just enough\" to communicate severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient avoids discussing prior episodes of similar pain despite the question about history, possibly indicating reluctance to reveal prior mild symptoms or a lack of awareness. This may be motivated by fear of implications or embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: They do not explicitly downplay symptoms but focus heavily on the severity and sudden onset, which suggests an attempt to emphasize urgency rather than minimize. - Amplification patterns: The vividness of descriptions (\"tearing, burning feeling,\" \"like something's ripping\") shows emotional amplification of symptoms, likely driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs of shame or embarrassment are evident; the patient seems primarily anxious, with the detailed verbalization of distress pointing more toward fear than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: The patient accurately reports their experiences without evident confusion but avoids elaborating on previous health history, possibly due to uncertainty or discomfort. - Family influence: The mention of family history suggests awareness but no direct indication of family influence on current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be an information withholding pattern, likely influenced by anxiety or fear, leading to selective sharing\u2014particularly withholding details about past episodes. - Severity: Moderate\u2014while the patient communicates symptoms clearly, they omit or avoid discussing the broader medical history, which could provide vital clinical context. - Areas most affected: Past medical history and prior symptom episodes are most biased, potentially limiting accurate assessment of frequency, severity, or prior similar events. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014current symptom descriptions are detailed and emotionally charged but the incomplete medical history suggests some caution in interpreting their self-report as fully comprehensive.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient probably has a history of prior milder symptoms or related health issues that they are reluctant to disclose fully, which could influence diagnostic considerations. - Symptoms probably minimized: They may not be intentionally minimizing but are less forthcoming about prior episodes or lesser symptoms, possibly underplaying chronic or previous discomforts. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's focus on the severity and suddenness may overemphasize the immediate crisis, which could lead to heightened concern or anxiety influencing their perception. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms is likely rapid and severe, consistent with the description, but their narrative might omit mild or longer-standing symptoms that could clarify the overall clinical picture.",

Also, clarification on past medical conditions related to vascular health, which might influence susceptibility. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify for features differentiating vascular emergencies (like dissection or arterial occlusion) from neurological causes such as radiculopathy, especially since systemic symptoms and severe pain are present. - Patient factors: The patient tends to focus on the current crisis and avoids discussing past episodes or health history, indicating potential discomfort or fear. Questions should be crafted to gently explore previous similar events without causing defensiveness. - Interview phase goals: Narrow differentials by pinpointing symptom characteristics, onset, aggravating or relieving factors, and past symptoms.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: The symptoms of redness and tearing are classic signs of conjunctivitis, which can be infectious or allergic. The recent onset (2 days ago) aligns with acute conjunctival inflammation, possibly triggered or worsened by outdoor activity and exposure during soccer. Swelling may reflect conjunctival chemosis or response to irritation. This is the most common cause of such ocular symptoms in this context.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body or abrasion Justification: Playing soccer increases risk of contact with foreign objects or minor trauma, which can cause conjunctival or corneal injury presenting with redness, tearing, and swelling. The onset after play supports trauma-related origin. Pain may be minimal or absent, but even mild irritation suggests superficial injury.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely given recent trauma, allergic reactions can cause redness, tearing, and swelling. If the patient has a history of allergies or recent exposure to allergens, this becomes plausible. Symptoms typically include bilateral redness and itching, which may overlap with current presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Episcleritis presents with localized eye redness and mild swelling without significant pain, often associated with systemic inflammatory conditions. Its occurrence after activity is less typical but remains in differential due to conjunctival hyperemia.  5. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Eye redness and tearing can be symptoms, but typically accompanied by severe pain, vision changes, halos, and a mid-dilated pupil. Given the brief presentation and lack of severe pain or visual disturbance, this remains less probable but should be considered if symptoms progress or if other signs develop.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: His language oscillates between clinical descriptions (\"sharp,\" \"burning,\" \"tearing\") and qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") that reflect attempts to be precise but also to soften or hedge. - Information flow: Responds primarily when prompted, showing reluctance to volunteer additional details about past symptoms indicating possible withholding. - Response style: Responses are concise, with some elaboration when expressing emotional distress, but generally straightforward.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: His inability to recall or acknowledge prior mild symptoms suggests he may be hiding or is unaware of earlier episodes. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying past sensations (\"kind of dull ache\") and emphasizing the new, severe onset indicates he might be underreporting previous minor issues. - Amplification patterns: Use of vivid, intense descriptors (\"ripping,\" \"sharp\") may be driven by fear and an attempt to communicate urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: His self-perceived oversight (\"I can't really remember...\") hints at possible shame about health awareness or suspicion about the significance of his prior health history. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs, responses are consistent. - Family influence: His concern is heightened by family history but not directly affecting his responses.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Insight into previous minor episodes of leg discomfort, numbness, or intermittent pain, which could be warning signs of pre-existing vascular issues, is probably absent. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might be concealing or unaware that some earlier, milder symptoms could be relevant, thus underestimating risk. - Concerns probably amplified: His focus on the sudden, intense pain and associated fears may heighten his perception of danger beyond what is physically justified, increasing anxiety. - True timeline: The current event is clearly acute, but prior minor symptoms may have been unnoticed or dismissed, meaning the actual progression likely involved more gradual warning signs before escalation.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Traumatic conjunctivitis or eyelid swelling ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs mostly direct, factual language, avoiding elaboration or emotional descriptors (\"nothing like this,\" \"no numbness or tingling\"). This suggests an attempt to be straightforward but may also reflect minimization or discomfort discussing prior minor symptoms. - Information flow: His responses are concise and to the point; he waits for specific prompts rather than volunteering additional details, indicating he might refrain from sharing information unless explicitly asked. - Response style: Responses are minimal and consistent, with little elaboration, which helps maintain control but could obscure underlying issues.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient\u2019s repeated denial of any past similar symptoms, even after explicit questioning, signals possible reluctance or unawareness of mild or earlier episodes, suggestive of self-protection or minimization. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying previous sensations as \"nothing like this\" or \"kind of dull ache\" reflects an effort to dismiss or minimize minor or fleeting abnormal sensations. - Amplification patterns: The patient does not seem to exaggerate concerns; rather, he underreports past symptoms, which might lead to an underestimate of his baseline or prior issues. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There are no clear signs of embarrassment, but his brief, guarded responses to questions about past episodes hint at a possible reluctance to discuss minor discomforts, perhaps feeling they are unimportant or irrelevant. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent and logical, indicating good recall but possible underrecognition of minor symptoms. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence on responses, though his family history is acknowledged; he does not seem to be influenced by others\u2019 opinions during this interview.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The dominant bias appears to be minimization, as evidenced by his consistent denial of previous symptoms and efforts to dismiss or downplay prior sensations. - Severity: Moderate, given that the patient might be unaware or unwilling to report subtle symptoms, leading to potential underestimation of past episodes that could influence diagnosis. - Areas most affected: Past episodes of numbness, tingling, or mild discomfort are most likely underreported, which could skew understanding of symptom progression. - Reliability: While he appears truthful regarding recent severe symptoms, the reliability of his history about minor or episodic symptoms is limited, and some small issues may be underrecognized or intentionally withheld.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be acknowledging mild neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness) in the past, which can be sentinel signs of vascular or neurovascular pathology. - Symptoms probably minimized: Mild symptoms, such as transient discomfort or sensations in limbs, are likely underreported, possibly due to unawareness or downplaying. - Concerns probably amplified: His focus on the pain\u2019s severity and suddenness suggests genuine concern, but he may not be fully aware of or may be minimizing the likelihood of prior, less severe episodes. - True timeline: The actual onset of symptoms may include intermittent or unnoticed prior episodes, and his current presentation might be the culmination of a longer, subtle problem, but he perceives it as entirely new and sudden.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Since the patient tends to minimize or underreport minor past symptoms, I need to confirm whether he has experienced any sensations like numbness, tingling, weakness, or discomfort in the past, even if subtle or brief. This is crucial because such episodes could be relevant for neurological or vascular diagnoses. - Diagnostic priorities: Determine if there\u2019s a history of episodic neurological symptoms that might suggest transient ischemic attacks or other neurovascular issues, which are essential to establish for diagnostic certainty. - Patient factors: The patient\u2019s straightforward, concise communication style and tendency to downplay or dismiss prior symptoms mean I should frame questions carefully, avoiding leading or overly detailed prompts, to elicit honest responses. - Interview phase goals: Confirm or refute the presence of prior neurological episodes, assess their characteristics, and explore whether any subtle symptoms were overlooked or unrecognized. This will help clarify the timeline and nature of his condition before moving toward diagnosis and treatment planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, yes/no or clarifying questions, to verify the existence or absence of specific prior symptoms, given the patient\u2019s minimal responses. - Information target: Past episodes of numbness, tingling, weakness, discomfort, or other abnormal sensations, and their frequency, duration, and similarity to current symptoms. - Communication approach: Phrase questions neutrally and collaboratively, emphasizing that understanding all past sensations is important for his care, to encourage openness despite his guarded responses. - Expected value: Confirming or ruling out prior similar episodes will help determine if current symptoms are truly new or part of a pattern, refining the diagnosis and guiding appropriate management.\nANSWER: \"Since you mentioned this is your first experience of such severe symptoms, I\u2019d like to ask: have you ever noticed any mild numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or groin area before, even if it only lasted for a short time or seemed minor? Sometimes, people might not see these as important, but they can be relevant to understanding what\u2019s going on. Could you tell me if you\u2019ve ever had episodes like that in the past?\"",
