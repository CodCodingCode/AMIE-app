    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a several-day history of leg swelling, warmth, and persistent throbbing, consistent with a suspected deep vein thrombosis. She initially experienced mild soreness in the leg, which she minimized, but symptoms have progressed to involve more notable swelling and warmth. Her concern is heightened by a personal history of previous blood clots and a family history of thrombotic events. She did not report additional symptoms such as skin discoloration, systemic signs, or sudden onset of shortness of breath. Further examination and diagnostic testing are indicated to confirm the presence of a deep vein thrombosis and to evaluate risk factors comprehensively.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis Justification: Classic presentation of unilateral leg swelling, warmth, and throbbing; risk factors include previous clots and family history; symptoms have progressed over days, consistent with thrombosis formation.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Leg warmth and swelling can result from bacterial skin infection; however, lack of skin erythema or systemic signs makes this less likely.  3. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal strain or injury Justification: Mild soreness initially suggests a possible strain; persistent symptoms and swelling are less typical, but still considered.  4. Diagnosis: Chronic venous insufficiency Justification: Can cause leg swelling and warmth; usually more gradual and associated with other signs such as skin changes, which are not described here.  5. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Presents with limb swelling, often bilateral, and may be persistent; less likely given rapid progression and warmth, rather than non-pitting swelling typical of lymphedema.  6. Diagnosis: Superficial thrombophlebitis Justification: Causes localized redness, warmth, tenderness; less likely without visible superficial vein inflammation.  7. Diagnosis: Heart failure (right-sided) Justification: Can cause bilateral leg swelling, warmth is less typical; absent systemic signs suggest lower likelihood.  8. Diagnosis: Renal or hepatic causes of edema Justification: Usually bilateral and associated with other systemic features; unlikely given unilateral presentation.  9. Diagnosis: Baker\u2019s cyst rupture Justification: Can cause swelling and warmth if ruptured; more common in knees, and typically associated with cyst history.  10. Diagnosis: Malignancy-related edema Justification: Can cause swelling, but less consistent with acute, painful presentation and without other constitutional symptoms.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, symptom-focused language combined with emotional descriptors (\"really worried,\" \"kind of throbs\"), illustrating a balance of factual detail and anxiety. She minimizes her initial soreness by calling it \"just a little soreness,\" possibly to avoid sounding overly alarmed but still communicates her concern clearly. - Information flow: She volunteers her main symptoms and pertinent history straightforwardly, demonstrating an open, organized response pattern. She does not seem reluctant to share; instead, she responds directly to the initial question. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative but focused, with a tendency to include relevant personal history. She maintains eye contact and shows concern through gestures, supporting a cooperative and transparent communication style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There's little evidence of withholding; she clearly states her symptoms and relevant history without hesitation. - Minimization behaviors: She minimizes her initial symptom (\"just a little soreness\") but clarifies that it has worsened, which suggests some initial mild downplaying possibly to avoid overreacting\u2014or to gauge the doctor's reaction. - Amplification patterns: Her fear of serious complications, including pulmonary embolism, reflects genuine concern, not exaggeration, though she may slightly amplify her worry by emphasizing her previous blood clots and family history. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of discomfort or shame are evident; she seems open about her symptoms and fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No disorientation or inconsistency in her account; her timeline and details are coherent. - Family influence: Her mention of family history shows she is influenced by her relatives' health issues but does not indicate responding out of undue influence or bias.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be emotional amplification driven by anxiety about her health risks. She is visibly concerned, which could lead to heightened perception of risk, but her responses are consistent with genuine worry rather than malingering or denial. - Severity: Moderate, as her anxiety influences her emotional state and possibly her perception of symptom severity, but she remains communicative and detailed. - Areas most affected: Her concern about blood clots and potential for a pulmonary embolism is most amplified. Her description of symptoms aligns with clinical signs but is also heavily colored by her fear, possibly exaggerating the urgency in her mind. - Reliability: Her self-reporting seems fairly reliable, given the specificity of her symptoms, her history, and her open communication. Her anxiety may heighten perceived severity but doesn't obscure factual details.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be underreporting the initial mildness of her symptoms for fear of seeming overly anxious or because she downplayed the early soreness. She might also be unaware of lesser symptoms or attributes them to normal fatigue. - Symptoms probably minimized: The minor soreness initially experienced could have been more significant than she admits, or early signs of clot development. Her focus on severe pain and swelling suggests she recognizes these as serious, but her initial mild description might reflect some minimization at onset. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about a recurrent clot or PE seem heightened, possibly influenced by her understanding of her history, leading her to perceive her symptoms as more dangerous than they might be at the moment. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent\u2014starting mildly and worsening over a week\u2014but her emotional state likely heightens her perception of urgency and severity beyond the actual clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the clinical context of a suspected deep vein thrombosis, it's important to explore her full experience with the symptoms, including any other changes or concerns she might have not yet mentioned. The goal now is to understand how these symptoms have affected her daily life and to identify any other associated or recent factors. Since she has a history of blood clots and is worried about PE, her current perception of her condition could influence her reporting. To build rapport and gather more detailed information, an open-ended question focusing on her overall experience and any additional symptoms or impacts would be appropriate. This also sets the stage for discussing her emotional response, which can be relevant for her understanding and management.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about her entire symptom experience, associated features, and current impact. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the extent of symptoms, rule out other causes of leg swelling, and understand her concerns. - Patient factors: Her detailed and focused responses suggest openness; using an empathetic, open-ended question will reinforce trust. - Interview phase goals: Obtain a broad, detailed narrative about her current state and the effects on her life, setting a foundation for deeper exploration.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage comprehensive sharing. - Information target: Her overall experience, additional symptoms, functional impact, emotional concerns, and any recent changes. - Communication approach: Gentle, compassionate framing to facilitate sharing without feeling pressured. - Expected value: Will provide richer context, help identify subtle symptoms, and assess how her perception of severity influences her reporting.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how these symptoms have been affecting you overall\u2014what else have you noticed, and how is this situation impacting your daily routines or things that are important to you?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a several-day history of unilateral leg swelling, warmth, and persistent pain described as deep ache. She reports the symptoms have gradually worsened. Her history includes previous episodes of blood clots and a family history of thrombotic events, which heighten her concern for deep vein thrombosis. Despite her anxiety and emotional focus on symptoms, physical findings of swelling and warmth are objective, though the severity may be emotionally magnified. She did not report systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, skin discoloration, or respiratory complaints. Diagnostic testing, including a duplex ultrasound and laboratory evaluation, is indicated to confirm the presence of a DVT and to evaluate for additional risk factors or complications. Further assessment should include targeted inquiry about subtle signs, systemic symptoms, and recent activities or immobilization, with a supportive approach to address her concerns objectively while avoiding bias.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: The patient exhibits classic signs of DVT\u2014unilateral swelling, warmth, persistent deep ache, and the presence of risk factors such as prior thrombotic episodes and family history. The gradual worsening over days supports thrombosis formation rather than acute injury.  2. Diagnosis: Superficial Thrombophlebitis Justification: Presents with localized tender, erythematous, and indurated superficial veins; while less deep than DVT, her warmth and swelling could relate, especially if lesions are superficial.  3. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Presents with unilateral warmth, swelling, tenderness; absence of systemic symptoms like fever makes it less likely but still possible.  4. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Chronic swelling, typically non-pitting, may be unilateral; her history does not specify prior surgeries or radiation, but it remains a consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Baker's cyst rupture Justification: Usually causes posterior knee swelling and pain, which might mimic DVT; less likely without systemic or local signs.  6. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal strain or soft tissue injury Justification: Causes localized pain and swelling, but less likely given the duration and severity, and absence of trauma report.  7. Diagnosis: Venous insufficiency Justification: Common in chronic cases, but less typical for this many days of abrupt, unilateral swelling without prior varicosities.  8. Diagnosis: Post-thrombotic syndrome Justification: A potential sequelae of prior DVT; less likely without previous episodes noted, but plausible given her history.  9. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or skin infection (less likely) Justification: Usually presents with systemic symptoms or skin changes, which she does not report.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism Justification: A serious complication of DVT, but her current presentation is localized to the leg, with no respiratory symptoms reported.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific descriptions (\"swollen and warm,\" \"deep ache\") but emphasizes her worries with phrases like \"really worried\" and \"keeps thinking,\" indicating emotional concern. Her language is clear and direct about symptoms but somewhat magnified by her anxious state. - Information flow: She volunteers her main symptoms actively, focusing on her fears due to her history. She responds comprehensively when asked about her symptoms but may overemphasize the seriousness, possibly due to anxiety. - Response style: Her responses are detailed and emotionally charged, with some reiteration of her fears, indicating a tendency to magnify concerns rather than minimize.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she openly discusses her symptoms and fears. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; she appears to acknowledge the severity of her symptoms directly. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated emphasis on her blood clot history and worry about danger suggest some symptom magnification driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; she appears comfortable sharing her fears and symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indicators; her timeline of symptoms (\"about a week ago,\" \"getting worse\") seems consistent. - Family influence: Strong influence evident; her concerns are heavily shaped by her family history, which amplifies her worries.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias due to anxiety and familial history leading her to overestimate the severity of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her concerns are valid but possibly exaggerated emotionally, which may influence her perception. - Areas most affected: Her appraisal of symptom seriousness and her fears of recurrence or complications like PE. - Reliability: Generally reliable about her physical sensations but emotionally driven; her emotional state may distort her perception of risk.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might under-report other contributing factors like recent activities or subtle symptoms, and her focus on blood clots might overshadow other explanations. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be overestimating how severe or dangerous her current symptoms are due to anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of a serious clot or PE are likely exaggerated by her emotional distress. - True timeline: The symptom progression seems consistent, but her concern about getting worse might be amplified emotionally, potentially overstating the urgency.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a one-week history of progressively worsening unilateral leg swelling, warmth, and deep aching pain. Physical examination reveals objective signs of limb swelling and warmth, consistent with a possible deep vein thrombosis. She reports no systemic symptoms like fever or chills and denies skin discoloration. Her history includes previous episodes of blood clots and a family history of thrombotic conditions, indicating a higher risk profile. Further diagnostic evaluation, including duplex ultrasonography and laboratory tests, is necessary to confirm the presence of a DVT and assess for additional risk factors or complications. Additional assessment of systemic symptoms, recent activities, and risk factors is recommended to guide management.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: The clinical presentation of unilateral leg swelling, warmth, and deep aching pain, along with objective signs of limb swelling and warmth, is characteristic of DVT. The patient's history of previous blood clots and familial thrombotic tendencies heightens the likelihood. The pattern of progressive worsening over a week further supports this diagnosis, and duplex ultrasonography will confirm or exclude it.  2. Diagnosis: Superficial thrombophlebitis Justification: Unilateral limb swelling with warmth can sometimes be caused by superficial vein inflammation. However, the deep aching pain and significant swelling are more characteristic of DVT. This remains a differential, especially if ultrasound findings show superficial vein involvement.  3. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Cellulitis can cause warmth, redness, swelling, and pain, but typically presents with skin discoloration and possibly systemic symptoms like fever. The absence of skin discoloration and systemic signs makes this less likely, but it remains in the differential, especially if infection ensues.  4. Diagnosis: Heart failure-related lower limb edema Justification: Heart failure can cause bilateral edema and limb swelling, but the unilateral presentation, warmth, and pain are less supportive. No mention of systemic symptoms or other signs of heart failure reduces its likelihood.  5. Diagnosis: Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst) Justification: Baker's cyst can cause swelling and discomfort behind the knee, but it usually presents as a localized swelling without warmth or skin changes and tends to be less painful and not associated with systemic thrombotic risk factors, making it less probable in this context.Emily uses language that minimizes her physical symptoms\u2014saying \"kind of sore,\" \"a little soreness\"\u2014which suggests she might be downplaying potential severity. She reports her symptoms as starting \"about a week ago,\" but without detailed progression, possibly indicating some uncertainty or self-protection from alarm. Her repeated focus on her fear of blood clots and her past history reveals emotional amplification, possibly overestimating risks relative to current findings. She shows signs of anxiety, such as fidgeting and avoidance of detailed symptom descriptions like skin changes beyond warmth, which might hint at some withholding or selective disclosure of concerns. Overall, her responses reflect a mix of emotional concern and possible symptom minimization, influencing the reliability of her self-reporting, especially regarding physical signs she perceives less threatening.",

Her description of pain as \"kind of sore\" is vague; understanding the precise nature, intensity, and timing is key for differential. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether signs suggest superficial thrombophlebitis versus deep venous involvement, and rule out cellulitis or other causes. Since she has a history of blood clots, this impacts risk assessment. - Patient factors: Her tendency to minimize symptoms and her anxieties about blood clots suggest sensitivity to reassurance and potential understatement of findings. Questions should be gentle, clarifying without increasing anxiety or appearing dismissive. - Interview phase goals: Pinpoint whether symptoms are consistent with DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, or other causes, and gather more specifics about the symptom course, associated systemic features, and her concerns.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a one-week history of unilateral leg swelling and warmth, with a deep aching sensation that is likely more severe than her subjective description suggests. Physical examination would likely reveal limb swelling and warmth consistent with deep vein thrombosis, although she reports no skin discoloration, redness, or bumps. She notes increased fatigue but denies fevers or chills. Communication patterns indicate she may underreport symptom severity and overlooked signs, thus the true clinical picture may involve more intense pain and subtle systemic or skin changes. Additional assessment is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for potential complications.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: Unilateral leg swelling and warmth over a week suggest venous thromboembolism, especially given the deep aching sensation. The absence of skin discoloration does not exclude DVT; subtle signs can predominate early. Fatigue may reflect systemic effects or consequence of venous stasis. The pattern of symptoms aligns with DVT, which can present with limb swelling and warmth, and may initially lack overt skin changes.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Although lacking overt redness or skin bumps, early cellulitis can sometimes present with swelling and warmth. The absence of systemic signs like fever or chills diminishes likelihood but does not exclude it. The localized warmth and swelling could reflect an early or atypical presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Baker\u2019s Cyst Rupture or Swelling Justification: Baker\u2019s cyst, especially if large, can cause unilateral swelling and discomfort. However, warmth without history of swelling or known cysts makes this less likely. Still, it remains a differential, particularly if imaging confirms cyst formation.  4. Diagnosis: Inflammatory or Autoimmune Conditions (e.g., vasculitis) Justification: Fatigue without systemic symptoms makes primary autoimmune vasculitis less probable, but localized vasculitis could present with limb swelling. Still, less likely in absence of skin color changes or systemic signs.  5. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Chronic or secondary lymphedema can cause swelling, but usually develops gradually and over a longer period. Sudden or subacute onset over a week points more toward venous causes like DVT; thus, lymphedema is less probable but considered.  STOP HERE.The language Emily uses is straightforward but includes vague terms like \"kind of sore,\" \"maybe,\" and \"kind of a deep ache,\" which suggest she may be minimizing the severity. She emphasizes that she hasn't noticed redness or bumps, and her reassurance of no fever or chills could be an attempt to downplay more systemic symptoms. Her comments about feeling more tired than usual could be an understated sign of systemic illness that she doesn't fully recognize or is reluctant to highlight. Her response pattern\u2014to state facts simply and avoid elaborating on other possible symptoms\u2014implies she might be selectively sharing what she perceives as relevant, possibly to avoid sounding overly concerned or to keep the focus on her main worry of blood clots recurring. She appears cooperative but slightly guarded, perhaps subtly minimizing the extent of her symptoms, or unsure of what is truly important to share. Her consistent description of her symptoms as staying the same, without additional physical signs, shows selective reporting that might mask more serious issues.

Since her communication might understate severity, questions need to gently elicit more detailed experiential information to avoid underrecognition of severity.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise character of pain, presence of subtle skin changes, progression pattern, possible systemic symptoms, triggers, or recent activities. - Diagnostic priorities: Distinguish between DVT and cellulitis, assess for signs of systemic involvement or alternative causes. - Patient factors: Her tendency to underreport severity necessitates empathetic, specific questioning to encourage more descriptive responses. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the diagnostic possibilities, clarify symptom characteristics, and identify any hidden signs pointing toward more urgent issues.

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged female presenting with a one-week history of unilateral leg swelling and warmth, with a deep, dull, throbbing ache that appears to be more severe than initially described. She reports no overt redness, skin discoloration, or bumps, and denies systemic symptoms such as fevers or chills, but reports increased fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell. Physical signs that may have been understated include limb tenderness and subtle skin changes; further examination is necessary to identify these features objectively. Her concerns about recurrence are valid given her history but may be influenced by anxiety, and physical findings should be corroborated through detailed examination to determine the true severity of her condition.Deep vein thrombosis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"kind of sore,\" \"a little tired,\" and \"really worried,\" which indicates a tendency to soften descriptions but also demonstrates genuine concern. - Information flow: She voluntarily provides core symptoms but avoids details about other physical signs unless specifically asked. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. - Response style: Her responses are concise and somewhat cautious, with easy triggers to emotional expression, which may reflect underlying anxiety and a tendency to to focus on worst-case scenarios.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She emphasizes not noticing redness, bumps, or color change but does not mention other subtle signs like skin texture or pulse changes, indicating possible reluctance or forgetfulness. - Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms with \"kind of sore,\" \"a little tired,\" and \"maybe\" suggests downplaying the physical severity. - Amplification patterns: Repeated emphasis on her worry, especially about blood clots and severe outcomes, indicates emotional exaggeration of threat perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signals, but her nervous touch (fidgeting, touching her face) may point toward discomfort discussing health fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant evidence. - Family influence: Her concern is significantly driven by family history, which likely heightens her anxiety and influences her perception of symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification and mild symptom minimization, influenced by her prior experiences and family history. - Severity: Moderate, since her fears are genuine but may cause her to overinterpret or misjudge the severity of physical signs. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and concern over potential dangerous outcomes, which could lead to overestimation of risk. - Reliability: Her self-report is trustworthy regarding basic symptoms but biased by emotional factors, thus certain subtle physical findings or contextual details may be underreported or overemphasized.

It\u2019s important to clarify physical signs that might indicate other causes, such as superficial thrombophlebitis or cellulitis, and to confirm absence of systemic features suggesting infection or embolism. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming the presence or absence of signs like skin discoloration, tenderness texture, distal pulses, and systemic signs that help differentiate DVT from other conditions. Her emotional state and concern about serious outcomes suggest need for reassurance and understanding of her physical exam findings. - Patient factors: Given her guarded responses and tendency to minimize or soften symptoms, questions should be gentle, specific, and focused, encouraging her to share details without feeling judged or alarmed. - Interview phase goals: To gather concrete physical findings, clarify her current symptoms, ensure her understanding, and assess whether her symptoms align strongly with DVT or suggest alternative diagnoses.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and clarifying questions to elicit specific physical findings, and open-ended to explore her understanding and concerns. - Information target: Skin changes (color, texture), physical signs (tenderness, pulse), systemic symptoms, timing, and severity of symptoms. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, patient-centered language that reassures her and invites honest responses. - Expected value: Clarifies physical signs, alleviates anxieties by normalizing certain findings, and helps confirm or rule out DVT with greater certainty.\nANSWER: \"Emily, I appreciate you sharing how you've been feeling. To get a clearer picture, can we go over some details about your leg? Have you noticed any subtle changes in your skin color or texture, like slight discoloration or hardness? Also, when you press around your leg, do you feel tenderness or soreness that\u2019s worse than just feeling sore overall? And have you noticed if your pulse in that leg feels different or weaker compared to the other side? Lastly, besides the warmth and swelling, have you experienced any other symptoms like fever, chills, or feeling unusually tired or out of sorts since this started?\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"kind of sore,\" \"a little tired,\" and \"really worried,\" which indicates a tendency to soften descriptions but also demonstrates genuine concern. - Information flow: She voluntarily provides core symptoms but avoids details about other physical signs unless specifically asked. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. - Response style: Her responses are concise and somewhat cautious, with easy triggers to emotional expression, which may reflect underlying anxiety and a tendency to to focus on worst-case scenarios.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She emphasizes not noticing redness, bumps, or color change but does not mention other subtle signs like skin texture or pulse changes, indicating possible reluctance or forgetfulness. - Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms with \"kind of sore,\" \"a little tired,\" and \"maybe\" suggests downplaying the physical severity. - Amplification patterns: Repeated emphasis on her worry, especially about blood clots and severe outcomes, indicates emotional exaggeration of threat perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signals, but her nervous touch (fidgeting, touching her face) may point toward discomfort discussing health fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant evidence. - Family influence: Her concern is significantly driven by family history, which likely heightens her anxiety and influences her perception of symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification and mild symptom minimization, influenced by her prior experiences and family history. - Severity: Moderate, since her fears are genuine but may cause her to overinterpret or misjudge the severity of physical signs. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and concern over potential dangerous outcomes, which could lead to overestimation of risk. - Reliability: Her self-report is trustworthy regarding basic symptoms but biased by emotional factors, thus certain subtle physical findings or contextual details may be underreported or overemphasized.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible subtle physical signs or systemic symptoms she's unaware of or choosing not to mention, notably skin color changes or additional symptoms like tenderness or pulses. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical subtlety such as skin discoloration or firmness may be underreported; her focus on pain and warmth could overshadow other important signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of recurrence or severe complications like PE are overemphasized due to prior experiences and family history. - True timeline: The progression over a week seems consistent with typical DVT, but her emotional focus could distort her perception of urgency or severity, affecting clinical decision-making.",
