    "input": "OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult woman, unspecified age. Chief complaint: Recurrent abnormal uterine bleeding and persistent pelvic discomfort. Present illness: The patient reports increased intermenstrual bleeding and ongoing pelvic ache over the past few months. The physical symptoms are clearly described but may be more severe than reported due to guarded communication. She may be withholding or downplaying emotional reactions or additional systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight changes, or urinary issues. The timeline suggests recent or worsening symptoms without precise duration, but likely over the last three months. Associated symptoms: No additional systemic symptoms are explicitly reported; however, there is a risk that fatigue, weight fluctuations, or urinary disturbances are present but undermentioned. Emotional distress related to potential diagnosis remains likely but is understated. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s physical symptoms of abnormal bleeding and pelvic pain are reliably reported. - Medium confidence: The emotional concerns and systemic symptoms may be underreported or understated. - Low confidence: The full extent of symptom severity and emotional impact remains uncertain due to guarded communication. - Missing information: Further details are needed regarding emotional state, impact on daily life, presence of other systemic symptoms, and specific duration and pattern of the bleeding and pain.1. Diagnosis: Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) Justification: Very common in women with abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic discomfort; often causes intermenstrual bleeding and pelvic mass or pain.  2. Diagnosis: Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma Justification: Recurrent abnormal bleeding, especially in women beyond reproductive age, raises concern for endometrial pathology, including hyperplasia or malignancy.  3. Diagnosis: Adenomyosis Justification: Can cause persistent pelvic pain and heavy or irregular bleeding; more common in women aged 30-50, compatible with her complaints.  4. Diagnosis: Endometrial polyp Justification: Can lead to irregular and intermenstrual bleeding; often located within the uterine cavity and cause localized bleeding.  5. Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst or neoplasm Justification: Pelvic discomfort and abnormal bleeding can be related to ovarian masses; functional cysts or neoplasms could present with these symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Hormonal imbalance (e.g., estrogen excess) Justification: Cyclical or irregular bleeding with pelvic discomfort may result from estrogen dominance or other hormonal irregularities, especially if other causes are excluded.  7. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other infection Justification: Less likely given chronicity without systemic symptoms, but potential if underlying infection causes irregular bleeding with pelvic pain.  8. Diagnosis: Bleeding disorder Justification: Recurrent bleeding may be due to coagulopathies; however, systemic symptoms are not described, making this less probable initially.  9. Diagnosis: Endometrial or cervical neoplasm Justification: Less likely in the absence of external symptoms, but must be considered given persistent abnormal bleeding; especially if age or risk factors suggest.  10. Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion or other acute surgical process Justification: Usually presents with acute severe pain rather than chronic symptoms; less compatible with this presentation.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses mostly specific, straightforward descriptions of symptoms, indicating a tendency toward clarity. There is a slight emotional undertone with worry but no overt exaggeration or minimization. - Information flow: He is forthcoming with key symptoms, volunteering relevant details without prompting, which suggests openness but with a cautious tone. - Response style: His responses are concise and consistent, showing a preference for honest reporting but possibly limited elaboration on his emotional state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; he presents the core symptoms openly. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; he acknowledges the severity (\"more than just a little spot\"), so unlikely to be downplaying significantly. - Amplification patterns: Not apparent; his concern about seriousness aligns with his descriptions. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None detected; he's willing to discuss sensitive symptoms plainly. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of confusion; timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: Not evident in this interaction.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Overall, communication appears reliable, with a slight cautiousness possibly leading to underreporting of emotional fears but not of symptoms. - Severity: Mild bias, mainly related to cautiousness and concern, not intentional distortion. - Areas most affected: Emotional reporting may be somewhat restrained; physical symptoms are described clearly. - Reliability: High; his account seems accurate for clinical assessment, but emotional fears might be underexpressed.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper fears, emotional distress, and possibly the impact of symptoms on quality of life. - Symptoms probably minimized: None overt, but he might be hesitant to express the full extent of his anxiety about a serious diagnosis. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about cancer is explicit, but the level of concern may be more intense internally. - True timeline: Gradual onset over three months appears accurate based on his report.  Overall, his responses are direct and mostly reliable, with some cautiousness that might slightly understate emotional distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given that the patient has already identified a main concern with abnormal bleeding and pelvic discomfort, I want to further understand how these symptoms are affecting his daily life and how he perceives them. This will help clarify the severity and the emotional impact, and may reveal additional details that have not been explicitly shared. An open-ended question focusing on the personal experience and impact will help build rapport while gathering nuanced information.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Emotional impact, functional impairment, specific details about how symptoms interfere with daily activities. - Diagnostic priorities: Understanding symptom severity and impact to prioritize differential diagnoses such as fibroids, hyperplasia, or neoplasia. - Patient factors: He communicates clearly but cautiously; gentle, open-ended questions can ease him into elaborating more emotionally and functionally. - Interview phase goals: Expand on the effect of symptoms, explore emotional response, and obtain richer context for further assessment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, focusing on the patient's lived experience. - Information target: Impact on daily routine, emotional reaction, concerns about the symptoms. - Communication approach: Sensitive and nonjudgmental framing to encourage honesty. - Expected value: Revealing the extent of how symptoms affect his life and gathering subtle cues about emotional distress, guiding further exploration.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about how these symptoms\u2014your bleeding and pelvic discomfort\u2014are affecting your daily life and how you\u2019re feeling about everything.\"",

    "input": "A woman presenting with increased irregular intermenstrual bleeding and ongoing pelvic discomfort, likely related to a uterine pathology such as fibroids or endometrial abnormalities, with symptoms that are probably more severe and systemic effects more significant than indicated by her cautious report. Her communication pattern suggests possible underreporting of symptom severity, especially regarding bleeding volume, systemic symptoms, and emotional distress. Further detailed inquiry into bleeding quantification, systemic symptoms, and emotional impact is warranted to fully characterize her clinical status.1. Diagnosis: Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) Justification: Common cause of irregular intermenstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort in women of reproductive age; often causes mass effect and bleeding abnormalities, with possible underreporting of severity.  2. Diagnosis: Endometrial hyperplasia Justification: Irregular bleeding, especially with systemic significance, suggests endometrial proliferation; risk increases with hormonal imbalance or anovulatory cycles.  3. Diagnosis: Endometrial carcinoma Justification: Postmenopausal bleeding or irregular bleeding in women over 40 raises concern for malignancy; systemic effects may be more subtle but significant, making this a crucial diagnosis to exclude.  4. Diagnosis: Uterine sarcoma Justification: Rare but aggressive uterine tumor presenting with abnormal bleeding and pelvic pain; warrants consideration if symptoms are disproportionate or persistent.  5. Diagnosis: Adenomyosis Justification: Causes painful, heavy, irregular bleeding with pelvic discomfort; typically occurs in women aged 30-50, and symptoms can be underreported.  6. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Justification: Pelvic discomfort and irregular bleeding could arise from infection, especially if there are systemic signs; however, usually associated with infectious symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst or mass Justification: Can cause pelvic discomfort and occasionally irregular bleeding if affecting hormonal regulation; less common but relevant in differential.  8. Diagnosis: Bleeding disorder (e.g., coagulopathy) Justification: Systemic effects and irregular bleeding may suggest a bleeding disorder, particularly if bleeding is severe or disproportionate to clinical findings.  9. Diagnosis: Endometrial polyp Justification: May cause irregular bleeding and is common in women with other endometrial abnormalities; typically benign but can cause significant bleeding.  10. Diagnosis: Malignancy of cervix or other pelvic malignancy Justification: While less likely based on initial presentation, persistent abnormal bleeding warrants consideration of cervical or other pelvic cancers, especially in older women or with red flags.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He uses straightforward language with some vagueness and mild emotional indicators. His descriptions are simple and factual but show underlying concern. For example, \u201cmore than just a little spot\u201d and \u201ckind of thin\u201d are non-specific, possibly minimizing the severity. - Information flow: Responses are generally organized but contain some reluctance to share details unprompted. He tends to answer directly but waits for questions to elaborate, indicating reticence or discomfort. - Response style: He offers relevant information but limits elaboration; responses are concise and cautious, reflecting a reserved style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: He does not explicitly withhold information but shows hesitance to expand on how symptoms impact him daily, possibly underreporting severity. - Minimization behaviors: His careful descriptions suggest possible downplaying of symptoms or severity, especially with vague qualifiers. - Amplification patterns: His expressed worry about \u201csomething serious\u201d and \u201ccancer\u201d indicates anxiety could be amplifying his perception of danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but his reserved communication hints at some discomfort with discussing intimate symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: None apparent; he provides a consistent timeline. - Family influence: Minimal evident, though close relationships might influence his concern level.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification of symptoms and concern about severity, coupled with possible mild minimization of symptom impact. - Severity: Moderate\u2014his emotional state influences the detail and tone of his reporting. - Areas most affected: His perception of the seriousness and impact of symptoms, possibly overestimating risks due to health worries. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; his account is coherent but emotionally influenced, so some details may be exaggerated or understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: How symptoms affect his mental health, daily functioning, or social interactions beyond discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Subtle or less obvious symptoms such as emotional distress or functional limitations may be underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of cancer and serious illness are heightened and could lead to overestimating danger. - True timeline: The symptom progression appears steady; his perception of worsening is consistent but possibly amplified by anxiety.  Overall, Robert's communication reflects a cautious, anxious patient who reports symptoms coherently but with mild emotional bias and some possible under- or overstatement influenced by concern.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify what essential details are still needed: specifics about the bleeding, systemic symptoms, emotional impact, and the course of the symptoms. Priorities include clarifying the severity and nature of bleeding, checking for any other symptoms like weight change or fatigue, and understanding how these issues are affecting his life and worries. Since the patient seems somewhat reserved and anxious, questions should be empathetic and allow him to share comfortably. The goal is to build rapport while gathering key information to refine the differential diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: An open-ended question aimed at exploring the patient\u2019s overall experience, focusing on how symptoms influence his daily life and emotional state, encouraging elaboration without leading him toward any specific answer. This approach helps reveal the full scope of his concern and symptoms, including subtle or unarticulated worries.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how these symptoms\u2014like the bleeding and pelvic discomfort\u2014are affecting you beyond the physical sensations?

    "input": "An adult woman presents with irregular intermenstrual bleeding and ongoing pelvic discomfort. Although she describes the bleeding as more than a small spot and the pain as a dull ache, these reports may underestimate the severity and impact of her symptoms. She appears to be minimizing the extent of bleeding\u2014potentially moderate to heavy with clots\u2014and the discomfort may be more intense or disabling than indicated. Systemic effects such as fatigue or anemia are not explicitly acknowledged but could be present. Her communication suggests potential underreporting, necessitating further detailed inquiry into bleeding quantification, systemic symptoms, and emotional distress to fully assess her clinical condition.1. Diagnosis: Uterine fibroids Justification: The patient's heavy, irregular bleeding with clots and pelvic discomfort are classic signs of leiomyomas, which are common benign tumors causing such symptoms. The dull ache aligns with fibroid-related pressure or degeneration.  2. Diagnosis: Endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma Justification: Irregular intermenstrual bleeding, especially if prolonged or heavy, raises concern for hyperplastic or malignant endometrial processes, especially in women older than 40 or with risk factors.  3. Diagnosis: Bleeding disorder (e.g., coagulopathy) Justification: If the bleeding is more severe or difficult to control, an underlying bleeding disorder could be contributing. Although less likely given the localized pelvic discomfort, it remains part of the differential, especially if bleeding pattern is unusual or longstanding.  4. Diagnosis: Endometriosis Justification: While endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain, it typically causes cyclical pain and dysmenorrhea rather than heavy intermenstrual bleeding, but it remains a differential for pelvic discomfort.  5. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease Justification: Less likely without infectious signs like fever or abnormal vaginal discharge, but pelvic discomfort could be related to chronic inflammation. It would be more probable if systemic symptoms or risk factors for STI were present.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague, hesitant language, such as \"kind of a lot\" and \"kind of a thing,\" which mask the full severity of symptoms. They also tend to use simple, clinical terms without emotional elaboration. - Information flow: Responses are guarded and minimal, providing just enough info when asked, indicating reluctance to share details voluntarily. - Response style: They respond in a restrained, straightforward manner, avoiding elaborate explanations or emotional disclosures unless probed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal elaboration on symptom impact, refraining from describing how symptoms interfere with daily activities or emotional wellbeing. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptom severity through phrases like \"kind of a lot\" instead of more alarmed descriptions. - Amplification patterns: No overt exaggeration; responses tend to lean toward understatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight avoidance of eye contact and reserved posture suggest discomfort but not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent issues; responses are consistent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Underreporting/minimization bias, as the patient seems cautious about fully emphasizing symptoms' severity. - Severity: Moderate bias, because the patient's responses likely underestimate physical and emotional impact. - Areas most affected: Quantitative aspects of bleeding and pain severity; emotional distress levels. - Reliability: Moderate; some critical details might be understated, so self-reporting should be supplemented with objective findings.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of bleeding volume, pain intensity, and how symptoms are disrupting daily life. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of bleeding and pain; they may be more intense than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's emotional anxiety appears genuine, though they are cautious about expressing panic. - True timeline: Symptom progression might be more rapid or severe; their tendency to soften descriptions may delay recognition of urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The exact severity, quantification, and impact of bleeding; associated systemic symptoms like fatigue or dizziness; emotional distress; previous similar episodes; and the timeline of symptom progression. - Diagnostic priorities: Determining if bleeding is heavy enough to cause anemia, exploring signs suggestive of fibroids versus endometrial pathology, and assessing systemic effects that could point towards coagulopathy or other underlying issues. - Patient factors: The patient employs vague language and minimizes symptoms. Questions should be sensitive, help her feel comfortable sharing more detailed and concrete information without feeling judged. - Interview phase goals: Clarify the extent of bleeding (quantity, presence of clots), severity and character of pelvic discomfort, any associated systemic symptoms, and emotional or functional impact, to better differentiate among the differential diagnoses. QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to quantify bleeding, clarify pain intensity, and uncover systemic or emotional effects. - Information target: Bleeding volume, pain characteristics, systemic symptoms, impact on daily activities. - Communication approach: Gentle, non-judgmental, encouraging elaboration, framing questions to help her accurately describe symptoms. - Expected value: Obtaining more precise data on symptom severity and impact will help refine the differential diagnosis and identify red flags for urgent issues.\nANSWER: \"You've mentioned that your bleeding is 'kind of a lot' and your pelvic discomfort as a 'dull ache.' Can you tell me more specifically about how much you're bleeding\u2014like, do you notice large clots or soaking through pads quickly?

    "input": "The clinical presentation involves a woman experiencing irregular intermenstrual bleeding and persistent pelvic discomfort. Although she reports the bleeding as more than a small spot occurring between periods and describes the pain as a dull ache that is progressively worsening, these accounts likely underestimate the severity, as heavier bleeding with clots and significant systemic effects such as fatigue or anemia may be present but unreported. Her communication pattern suggests emotional distress and concern about serious conditions like cancer, which influence her reporting. Further detailed assessment, including quantification of bleeding, systemic symptom inquiry, and evaluation of daily functional impact, is necessary to accurately characterize her clinical status.1. Diagnosis: Endometrial Carcinoma Justification: The irregular intermenstrual bleeding, especially if more than a small spot, and persistent pelvic discomfort in a woman of potentially postmenopausal age (information not specified but suspected from the concern about cancer), strongly suggest endometrial carcinoma. It often presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which may be heavy and irregular, and can cause associated pelvic pain as the disease progresses or due to local invasion.  2. Diagnosis: Endometrial Hyperplasia Justification: Irregular bleeding and pelvic discomfort can be early signs of endometrial hyperplasia, especially with abnormal estrogen stimulation. It is a common precursor to endometrial carcinoma. This diagnosis ranks high because it shares many clinical features with malignancy but is less advanced.  3. Diagnosis: Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroid) Justification: Uterine fibroids can cause irregular, heavy bleeding with clots and pelvic pressure or discomfort due to mass effect. Though not typically associated with persistent pain unless degenerating, fibroids are common causes of abnormal bleeding and can produce a dull ache, making it a pertinent differential.  4. Diagnosis: Cervical Dysplasia or Cervical Carcinoma Justification: Persistent abnormal bleeding and discomfort could originate from cervical pathology, especially if the bleeding is intermenstrual. The emotional concern about cancer aligns with cervical malignancy or high-grade dysplasia, which often presents with irregular bleeding, sometimes with pelvic discomfort.  5. Diagnosis: Ovarian Neoplasm (Cyst or Tumor) Justification: Ovarian masses can cause pelvic discomfort and abnormal bleeding if affecting the uterine or cervical areas, or if associated with hormonal activity. Although less specific, persistent pelvic pain and bleeding warrant consideration of ovarian pathology, especially if other gynecologic causes are not confirmed.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague and minimization language, such as \"just a little spot\" and \"kind of a lot,\" possibly to reduce their perceived severity or because of discomfort discussing sensitive issues. They do acknowledge worsening and express worry, indicating emotional undercurrents. - Information flow: Responses are organized but somewhat guarded, offering basic information and holding back specifics until prompted. They rarely volunteer detailed descriptions of volume or impact unless asked. - Response style: Their answers are concise, tentative, and somewhat hesitant, with signs of reluctance to elaborate, probably to protect themselves from worry or shame.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The underreporting of bleeding volume, discharge specifics, and daily impact suggests deliberate or subconscious minimization. They avoid explicit details about the severity. - Minimization behaviors: Using qualifiers like \"just a little spot\" and \"not really regular\" diminishes the perceived seriousness of symptoms, possibly to cope emotionally or avoid alarming themselves. - Amplification patterns: Their fears about cancer and statements like \"getting worse\" reflect genuine concern, but they might be overestimating the gravity due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight avoidance of eye contact and hesitations when describing symptoms indicate discomfort with subject matter, possibly shame or shame-related anxiety. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident issues - Family influence: Indirectly, their concern might be influenced by family members' opinions or their desire to be responsible, but this is not explicitly evident.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be a tendency towards minimization and emotional suppression, aiming to appear composed. - Severity: Moderate, because although they acknowledge symptoms and worries, details are half-hearted and understated, risking underestimation of actual severity. - Areas most affected: Volume and impact of bleeding, emotional response details\u2014these are likely underreported, impairing full assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; their self-reporting is honest but filtered through emotional and behavioral biases, so some severity may be overlooked.

She reports increased bleeding between periods, soaking through pads more quickly during episodes, and a progressively worsening dull lower abdominal ache over several weeks. Although she denies systemic symptoms such as dizziness or tiredness, clinical suspicion suggests that heavier bleeding and possible anemia may be present but underreported.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: He hesitates to specify amounts, severity of bleeding, or emotional impact unless specifically asked, suggesting reluctance or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Downplays bleeding volume (\"soak through a pad pretty quick\"), reports no big clots, and denies systemic symptoms like dizziness, indicating possible underestimation. - Amplification patterns: He expresses worry and concern about serious disease (\"worried it might be cancer\") but does not demonstrate overt anxiety or catastrophizing behaviors, indicating his concern may be more rational than exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited; he uses straightforward language and does not obvious show embarrassment, perhaps to maintain composure. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; response timeline aligns logically. - Family influence: Mentions close relatives, but responses do not suggest they influence his disclosure significantly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias appears strongest; he understates symptom severity and impact, possibly due to discomfort discussing illness or inner wish to avoid worsening concerns. - Severity: Moderate bias, as he reports notable symptoms but tends to soften the perceived seriousness. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and emotional impact, especially regarding bleeding and pain levels. - Reliability: Moderate; while his responses are consistent, the tendency to minimize suggests some information may be underrepresented.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He probably underreports the true volume or impact of bleeding and may not fully disclose emotional distress, which could influence severity assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical severity (bleeding amount, pain intensity) appears understated; systemic symptoms like fatigue or anemia signs are not reported but could be present. - Concerns probably amplified: His worries about cancer seem genuine but may be influenced by general anxiety; he may overemphasize fears without recognizing the full clinical picture. - True timeline: The progression is likely more rapid or severe than conveyed; persistent worsening suggests possible escalation not fully acknowledged.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, clarifying questions to address remaining uncertainties about the severity and specifics of the bleeding and discomfort, ensuring that key diagnostic criteria are met or ruled out. Given the patient's tendency to soften details, questions should be focused yet gentle, encouraging honest disclosure. Exploring symptom severity, progression, and impact will also help clarify the likelihood of significant underlying pathology, such as anemia or fibroids, and prepare for shared decision-making about next steps.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact volume and pattern of bleeding, presence of large clots, severity of pain, and any associated systemic symptoms like dizziness or fatigue. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm the extent of bleeding to assess for anemia risk and rule out other causes like malignancy if applicable. - Patient factors: Patient responses are measured and somewhat reserved; questions should be conversational but specific. - Interview phase goals: Finalize assessment of symptom severity and impact, confirm diagnosis criteria, and gauge readiness for treatment discussion.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions emphasizing severity, frequency, and impact. - Information target: Bleeding quantity, pain level, systemic symptoms, timeline progression. - Communication approach: Gentle, yet direct, framing questions as collaborative to encourage openness. - Expected value: Clarifies diagnostic picture, identifies potential red flags, and lays groundwork for treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that you soak through a pad pretty quickly and haven\u2019t noticed passing large clots, but just to be sure, about how many pads do you typically go through during a heavy day? Do you ever feel very tired, dizzy, or short of breath, especially after bleeding? And thinking about your pelvic discomfort, on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is severe, how would you rate it right now? Has the level of discomfort changed over the past few weeks\u2014gotten better, worse, or stayed the same?\"",
