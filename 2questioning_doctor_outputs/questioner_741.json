    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are classic; recent activity may predispose to bacterial conjunctivitis or viral conjunctivitis.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or foreign body Justification: Acute onset after playing soccer suggests trauma causing corneal injury or foreign body, leading to redness, tearing, and discomfort.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden redness after activity can indicate minor vascular rupture; typically painless but can appear dramatic.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye redness and tearing are typical; less likely given recent activity, but possible if exposed to allergens.  5. Diagnosis: Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness over the eyelid following activity could suggest infection, especially if associated with skin disruption.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: More severe; symptoms include eyelid swelling, pain with eye movement, and possibly vision changes. Less likely without systemic signs but important to consider.  7. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid hematoma or contusion Justification: Swelling and redness can result from blunt trauma; history of recent activity supports trauma.  8. Diagnosis: Globe rupture Justification: Eye trauma after sports could cause globe rupture; look for signs such as decreased vision, a teardrop-shaped pupil, or extrusion of intraocular contents. Less likely if no specific trauma signs.  9. Diagnosis: Insect bite or sting Justification: Could cause localized swelling and redness, particularly if an insect was involved during play; less common.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital fracture Justification: Blunt trauma from sports activity can cause orbital floor or orbital rim fracture leading to swelling, ecchymosis, or enophthalmos; less likely without other trauma signs.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally loaded phrases such as \"really need help,\" \"so much worse,\" and \"scared,\" emphasizing her anxiety and urgency rather than clinical objectivity. This shows an emotional, amplificatory language style. - Information flow: She provides a concise but emotionally driven statement, clearly expressing her fears but not detailed medical history or observations unless prompted. Her response is organized around her emotional state, suggesting a tendency to prioritize emotional expression over factual detail. - Response style: The response is relatively brief but highly expressive, focusing on her fears and perceptions of worsening symptoms\u2014indicative of an anxious amplifier bias. She does not understate her distress, and her language is more emotive than clinical descriptions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding information at this initial point; she seems eager to express her concern. However, her focus on emotional distress may obscure or mask more detailed or factual information that she perceives as less relevant or more anxiety-provoking. - Minimization behaviors: Limited; she does not minimize symptoms, rather she emphasizes their worsening and severity. - Amplification patterns: Strong evidence; she describes her symptoms as \"so much worse,\" \"really,\" \"scared,\" and uses phrases like \"got so much worse,\" indicating magnification of severity. Her concern seems to be heightened artificially, likely driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed at this initial statement. - Confusion/memory issues: Not apparent here; her timeline (\"in just a couple of weeks\") appears straightforward and consistent. - Family influence: She mentions her family history but does not display undue influence; her worries seem personally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is anxiety amplification, evidenced by her emphasis on rapid worsening, severity, and fearfulness. Her emotional language and concern suggest she is over-dramatizing her symptoms due to anxiety. - Severity: Moderate to severe, considering her high emotional distress, active fear, and rapid symptom escalation\u2014these biases likely influence her perception notably. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and progression, and her fears of malignancy or loss (e.g., \"am I going to lose my arm?\"). Her narrative mainly centers on anxiety-driven exaggeration rather than calm factual assessment. - Reliability: Her self-reporting appears influenced heavily by emotional state; thus, while her symptoms are real, perceptions of severity and progression should be interpreted with awareness of bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific clinical details such as precise size, texture, and characteristics of the lump besides her description, past examinations, or medical history details that could clarify objectivity. She may be withholding or unaware of additional symptoms or details that could refine assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possibly downplaying or underemphasizing any atypical features (e.g., absence of systemic symptoms, prior medical evaluations). She focuses on pain and growth but may not mention other subtle signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of malignancy, potential for spread, and limb loss seem exaggerated given the clinical context, driven by her anxiety. Her concern about \"seriousness\" may be influenced by her emotional state rather than clinical evidence. - True timeline: The progression is likely consistent with her report, but her perception of rapid growth might be magnified by worry; objectively, two weeks is a relatively short timeframe for certain tumors, but her emotional lens might amplify this.",
    "output": "THINKING: The existing information indicates she is anxious and worried about a growing lump and worsening symptoms, with a focus on emotional expression. To develop rapport and gather comprehensive details, I should encourage her to describe her experience in her own words, especially relating to her symptoms\u2019 onset and how she perceives their progression. Since her emotional distress is prominent, framing questions gently and open-endedly will help her share more objectively and reduce her anxiety-driven amplification. Exploring her perception of the lump\u2014its size, appearance, and any associated sensations\u2014will clarify clinical features. Presently, there's a need to understand her current functional impact and her broader worries.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about the lump's appearance, texture, symptoms like tenderness or changes, prior evaluations, and overall health status. - Diagnostic priorities: Ruling out malignancy, infections, or other growths; understanding whether any neurological or systemic symptoms are present. - Patient factors: Her emotional language and amplification necessitate careful, empathetic open-ended questions to obtain factual information without heightening anxiety. - Interview phase goals: Establish trust, encourage detailed symptom description, explore her perceptions and concerns, and subtly assess severity and onset.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to elicit a detailed narrative. - Information target: Details about the lump\u2019s characteristics, progression, associated symptoms, and emotional impact. - Communication approach: Gentle, validating, curiosity-driven language that fosters safety and openness. - Expected value: Gather rich descriptive data to inform differential diagnosis and build rapport, providing her space to express her experience comprehensively.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about when you first noticed the lump, what it looked like or felt like to you, and how it has changed since then?\"",

    "input": "The patient presents with a rapidly enlarging, hard, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm, which has increased in size over two weeks from a small, painless lump to a golf ball-sized lesion. The patient reports increasing pain and swelling, particularly with movement or pressure. While subjective reports suggest significant distress and concern about serious causes, objective assessment is needed to evaluate signs of infection, trauma, or neoplasm, and to determine the precise nature of the lesion. Further clinical examination and diagnostic studies are indicated to clarify the underlying pathology.1. Diagnosis: Soft tissue sarcoma Justification: Rapid enlargement, hard and rubbery consistency, recent growth over two weeks, increasing pain\u2014all suggest an aggressive neoplasm like sarcoma, which can present as a painless or painful lump with rapid growth.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious abscess or necrotizing fasciitis Justification: Increasing pain, swelling, and rapid expansion raise suspicion for infection, especially if there is systemic infection or signs of skin involvement; however, the lesion's initial painless nature makes abscess less likely but remains a differential.  3. Diagnosis: Hematoma from trauma Justification: Rapid growth and firmness could be from bleeding into tissues; trauma history is not specified, but hematoma can enlarge and become tender.  4. Diagnosis: Benign soft tissue tumor (e.g., lipoma or giant cell tumor) Justification: Usually slow-growing, but very rare cases can enlarge rapidly; less likely given the recent rapid change and pain.  5. Diagnosis: Impending or early osteosarcoma or bone tumor extension Justification: If underlying bone involvement occurs, lesions may develop on soft tissue; less likely without bone signs but considered.  6. Diagnosis: Pseudotumor or reactive lesion Justification: An inflammatory or reactive process may produce a mass, but less common in this presentation.  7. Diagnosis: Metastatic lesion Justification: Less likely without known primary tumor elsewhere; can present as soft tissue mass.  8. Diagnosis: Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Justification: Typically seen in immunocompromised patients and presents as purple patches; less likely in this presentation.  9. Diagnosis: Myositis or inflammatory pseudotumor Justification: Usually associated with systemic inflammatory features; less likely given the firm, enlarging mass.  10. Diagnosis: Neurofibroma or schwannoma Justification: Usually slow-growing, benign nerve sheath tumors; rapid growth and pain make these less likely.

Since she reports rapid growth and severe pain, it\u2019s important to understand how this is affecting her daily life and emotional well-being, which can inform both diagnosis and therapeutic rapport. The next question should invite her to elaborate on her feelings and the broader impact, helping to explore her perspective and identify additional symptoms or concerns she might have overlooked or not mentioned.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Emotional response, functional impact, and any additional symptoms (e.g., systemic signs, changes in sensation). - Diagnostic priorities: Assessing severity signs, systemic symptoms, and psychological stress. - Patient factors: She is emotionally expressive and seems motivated to share her distress; questions should be sensitive and validating. - Interview phase goals: Deepen understanding of her personal experience and minimize her anxiety while gathering more contextual data.

    "input": "Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified. Chief complaint: Rapidly enlarging, hard, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm, with increasing size and pain over two weeks. Present illness: The lesion has increased in size from about the size of a grape to a golf ball within two weeks. It is described as hard and rubbery, with progressive pain that worsens with movement and pressure. The patient reports swelling and soreness, and expresses significant fear and distress about the lesion. Objective evidence of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, or constitutional signs is not available based on reported history; physical examination details are pending. Likely, the actual lesion\u2019s growth and pain may be less rapid or severe than patient perceives, and the concern about critical, life-threatening conditions might be exaggerated due to anxiety. Possible causes include benign reactive processes such as hemorrhage or cyst, but further clinical evaluation and diagnostics are required to confirm the nature of the lesion and exclude malignancy or infection. Additional information on any trauma, systemic symptoms, or other associated signs is needed for comprehensive assessment.1. Diagnosis: Soft tissue sarcoma Justification: Rapid growth over two weeks with a hard, rubbery consistency and increasing pain strongly suggests a malignant soft tissue tumor such as sarcoma. The size increase from a grape to a golf ball indicates aggressive proliferation. No systemic signs are present, but the pattern of rapid enlargement and firmness are classic malignant features, making this the most probable diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Hematoma Justification: A rapidly enlarging, painful mass can be caused by hemorrhage within tissues, especially if trauma is involved. The hardness and rubbery texture could reflect organized blood products. While trauma history isn't specified, spontaneous hemorrhages can occur, especially in vascular lesions or coagulopathies, which should be considered. This ranks second given the rapid growth and pain.  3. Diagnosis: Infectious process (e.g., abscess or cellulitis) Justification: Infection can cause painful, enlarging soft tissue masses, especially if abscess formation occurs. Although no systemic signs are reported, localized infection remains possible. The hard, rubbery consistency can be seen in organized abscesses or granulomatous infections, but the rapid, progressive enlargement favors neoplastic processes more.  4. Diagnosis: Benign soft tissue tumor (e.g., lipoma, cyst) Justification: Benign tumors like lipomas are typically soft and slow-growing, but some cystic or benign tumors can enlarge rapidly or become painful if inflamed or hemorrhaged, thus remaining a lower likelihood but still within differential considerations.  5. Diagnosis: Reactive or inflammatory process (e.g., traumatic bursitis, granulomatous reaction) Justification: An inflammatory mass due to trauma or other benign causes may enlarge and cause pain; however, the rapid and significant growth over two weeks without trauma history makes this less probable but still worth considering.  STOP HERE.THINKING: The patient's responses show strong signs of anxiety-driven catastrophizing and amplification bias. She clearly emphasizes the sudden onset and rapid growth of the lump, as well as her fears of it being deadly or causing significant harm. Her language is emotionally charged, and her responses suggest a tendency to focus on worst-case outcomes, likely exaggerating the dangers in her mind. She is not intentionally withholding information but is very overwhelmed by her fears, which distort her perception of the situation. This indicates a significant anxiety bias affecting her communication, leading her to overestimate the seriousness of her symptoms and potential outcomes.  COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotive, dramatic language (\"so much worse,\" \"so painful so fast,\" \"something deadly,\" \"taking over my whole arm\"), indicating high emotional involvement and possible catastrophizing. She rarely uses clinical or neutral descriptions, instead focusing on feelings and fears. - Information flow: She is highly forthcoming about her fears and perceptions, often volunteering extensive detail about her worries. Her answers are organized around her emotional response, though she may neglect some factual details (e.g., specific prior injury history or systemic symptoms) due to her anxious focus. - Response style: She responds with elaborate, emotionally laden answers, emphasizing worst-case possibilities, showing a tendency toward amplification rather than minimization. She is also visibly distressed during responses, which reinforces her high level of anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None outright, but her focus on worst-case scenarios may cause her to neglect or underemphasize some factual details or context she might otherwise share. - Minimization behaviors: There is little evidence of them; instead, she magnifies symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated focus on how fast symptoms worsen, fears of spreading, losing limb, or death points to exaggeration driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs, though her intense emotional response might obscure subtle discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Her timeline appears consistent but heavily filtered through her emotional state; no specific confusion. - Family influence: Her mention of family history seems straightforward but might heighten her fears, indicating family history amplifies her concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification / catastrophizing, as evidenced by her emotive language, focus on worst-case outcomes, and quick escalation of concern. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given the extent of her emotional distress and the way she magnifies symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity, potential danger, and prognosis; her fears of losing her arm or it being malignant may be overestimated. - Reliability: While her factual descriptions of the lump are likely accurate, her emotional responses and fears are probably exaggerated by her underlying anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not adequately communicate her understanding of benign causes or acknowledge reassurance about no systemic symptoms, possibly underreporting her insight or confidence. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her report aligns with her fear; she's likely overestimating how dangerous or aggressive the tumor is, possibly ignoring reassuring details. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about malignancy, spreading, and losing her arm are likely disproportionate to the actual risk given the diagnosis. - True timeline: The reported rapid growth and severity might be accurate, but her perception of threat is heightened by her anxiety, possibly leading her to see it as more alarming than it clinically is.  Overall, her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety, leading to overestimation of danger and emotional distress, which needs to be addressed in management.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a soft tissue mass on the arm that has increased in size over approximately two weeks from about a grape to a golf ball in size. The lesion is described as firm, rubbery, and associated with constant dull pain, occasionally sharp, which worsens with movement and pressure. No systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or weight loss are reported. The patient reports swelling and soreness around the lesion and expresses significant anxiety and fear regarding the lesion, which may amplify her perception of the severity and rapidity of progression. Physical examination and diagnostic evaluation are necessary to determine the precise nature of the lesion, including its growth rate, consistency, and any associated systemic findings.1. Diagnosis: Soft Tissue Sarcoma Justification: The rapid increase in size over two weeks, firm and rubbery consistency, and associated pain are highly suggestive of a malignant soft tissue tumor such as a sarcoma. The lesion's growth pattern, especially its swift enlargement, raises concern for malignancy. Pain worsening with movement may indicate infiltration into surrounding tissues, and the absence of systemic symptoms does not exclude a malignancy. Sarcomas often present as painless or painful enlarging masses that grow quickly.  2. Diagnosis: Liposarcoma Justification: Among soft tissue sarcomas, liposarcoma is a common subtype that presents as a deep, painless, but sometimes painful mass if compressing nerve or surrounding tissues. Its presentation as a rapidly enlarging, firm mass aligns with this possibility. The rubbery feel may reflect fatty tissue components, although the rapid growth is more characteristic of higher-grade tumors.  3. Diagnosis: Benign Soft Tissue Tumor (e.g., Lipoma or Fibroma) Justification: Although benign tumors such as lipomas tend to grow slowly, their initial presentation may mimic malignant tumors in early stages. Rapid growth suggests a less typical growth pattern for benign lesions but cannot be completely excluded without further imaging. Their consistency as soft and rubbery can overlap with the current findings, but the quick enlargement makes them less probable.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Process (e.g., Abscess) Justification: Infection could cause a tender, enlarging mass, sometimes associated with warmth and systemic symptoms, which are absent here. The two-week rapid growth without fever or systemic signs makes abscess less likely, but initial suspicion should include this possibility until ruled out by imaging or labs.  5. Diagnosis: Hematoma or Vascular Lesion Justification: Hematoma could present as a rapidly enlarging, tender mass following trauma, but no history of injury has been provided. Vascular malformations or hematomas generally have different physical characteristics and evolution, making them less likely in this scenario.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs emotionally charged language (\"really hurts,\" \"cry,\" \"overwhelming\"), focusing on pain and fear more than clinical details. Despite some vague terms, she provides specific descriptions of growth and pain. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about her symptoms and emotional impact, volunteering rich detail about pain, progression, and worry. Responses are organized around her concerns, with minimal reluctance. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate and emotionally laden, reflecting her anxious state, with consistent emphasis on severity and fear.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None explicitly observed; she appears eager to share her worries and symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Limited; she largely emphasizes severity, but may avoid mentioning any prior reassuring assessments or less alarming explanations. - Amplification patterns: Strong evidence\u2014she vividly describes her pain as \"really hurts,\" \"sharp,\" \"horrible,\" and states feelings like \"cry.\" She over-emphasizes the urgency and threat, consistent with heightened anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear evidence. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about the timeline and the nature of the lump's appearance, likely due to emotional distress rather than actual memory problems. - Family influence: She mentions family history but does not seem to be overly influenced or denying information; her distress appears internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification, as her emotional reactions and exaggerated descriptions suggest her concern is fueling perceptions of severity. - Severity: Severe, since her emotional state appears to potentially distort her perception of symptoms, possibly leading her to overinterpret benign signs as indications of malignancy. - Areas most affected: Perception of pain severity, size change, and threat level; these are likely overestimated. - Reliability: While her physical descriptions may be accurate, her emotional overlay likely inflates the perceived danger, so her self-report is somewhat biased by anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not disclose any prior normal evaluations or reassurance, or details that could temper her fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any less alarming signs she might have dismissed or overlooked are probably submerged beneath her acute anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of cancer, spreading, and losing her arm are likely exaggerated due to emotional distress, impacting her perception of risk. - True timeline: The objective progression may be more gradual, but her emotional state likely magnifies her sense of rapid growth and increasing pain, creating a perception of sudden crisis.  This analysis suggests her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety, which amplifies her perceptions of severity, though her factual descriptions appear consistent. Nonetheless, her emotional bias needs consideration in clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The current details describe the growth and pain but do not clarify whether she has experienced any similar episodes in the past, or if she has noticed systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Also, the lesion's skin characteristics (redness, warmth) are not detailed. - Diagnostic priorities: To distinguish between malignancy (e.g., sarcoma), benign tumors, or abscess/infection, I need more about associated features (e.g., skin changes, systemic symptoms), previous similar episodes, and possible risk factors. - Patient factors: Given her high anxiety and emotional distress, questions should be gentle and reassuring, encouraging clarity without increasing her worry. Her descriptions are emotionally charged, so phrasing must acknowledge her feelings while gathering precise data. - Interview phase goals: Narrowing down features that support or rule out malignancy, infection, or benign lesions; exploring history for past episodes or similar lesions; evaluating for systemic signs; and assessing triggers or associated symptoms.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions about systemic symptoms, past medical history, skin changes, and risk factors. Also, confirmatory questions to clarify details she's already mentioned. - Information target: Skin features (redness, warmth), prior episodes, systemic symptoms, family history of cancer or soft tissue tumors, trauma history, and any recent changes in activity or exposures. - Communication approach: Use empathetic and clear wording; for example, \"I understand this has been very upsetting. To help understand better, can you tell me if you've noticed any redness, warmth, or oozing from the lump? Have you ever had anything similar before?\" - Expected value: Filling in gaps to better differentiate between malignant and benign causes, and verifying her perception against clinical signs.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned that the lump is enlarging quickly and hurts quite a bit. Have you noticed any redness, warmth, or signs of infection around the area? Also, in the past, have you had any similar lumps or swellings before, or was this your first time? And do any other family members have a history of cancer or soft tissue tumors?\"",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a firm, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm, approximately the size of a golf ball, that has enlarged over approximately two weeks from a smaller size. The lesion is associated with persistent dull pain, sometimes sharp, which worsens with movement and pressure. The patient denies redness, warmth, or systemic symptoms such as fever or chills. Physical examination and diagnostic evaluation are required to determine if subtle signs of inflammation are present and to assess the lesion's characteristics and growth pattern more accurately.Soft tissue sarcoma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged and sometimes vague language, emphasizing her fears (\"I\u2019m so scared to death,\" \"horrible twinge\") while attempting to downplay certain physical signs (\"not red or warm or anything\"). Her descriptions are detailed when expressing distress but may omit or minimize physical findings. - Information flow: She volunteers emotional distress and emphasizes her anxiety more than precise clinical details initially, although responds clearly to direct questions about physical signs. Her responses are organized but heavily biased by emotion. - Response style: Elaborate when discussing her fears and pain, often emphasizing negative aspects, but may underreport physical signs to avoid admitting severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Possible downplaying of physical signs like redness, warmth, or systemic symptoms; her focus is on pain and rapid growth, possibly neglecting subtle inflammatory signs. - Minimization behaviors: She states \"not that bad\" about certain signs, which may mask more serious underlying pathology. - Amplification patterns: Her repeated reports of rapid worsening, intense pain, and fears of limb loss are likely exaggerated, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No direct evidence but her heightened emotional expression suggests vulnerability rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies in timeline (\"last few days\" vs. \"really fast\") indicate possible distress affecting clarity. - Family influence: Her mention of family history may be influencing her heightened concern, but she maintains that this case appears different.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification; she tends to exaggerate severity, growth rate, and potential outcomes due to fear. - Severity: Severe; her emotional responses significantly bias her presentation, likely inflating her perception of danger. - Areas most affected: Her pain perception, growth speed, and fears about malignancy; responses are heavily colored by her anxiety. - Reliability: Self-report is influenced by high emotional distress, so clinical findings and investigations are necessary to accurately assess the condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully disclose subtle signs of infection, systemic symptoms, or mild signs of inflammation. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs that suggest less severe causes might be underreported although her emphasis misleads. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of malignancy and limb loss are likely exaggerated compared to the diagnostic risk. - True timeline: The real progression is probably more gradual; her emotional reaction magnifies her perceived rapid worsening.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify remaining diagnostic details needed to confirm the nature of the soft tissue mass, distinguish between benign and malignant causes, and assess the severity of her presentation. The focus should be on clarifying subtle signs that could suggest inflammation or infection, evaluating her understanding and fears, and gathering practical information for management. Given her emotional distress, questions should be sensitive yet targeted to avoid missing critical clinical clues. The goal is to confidently move toward diagnosis, ensuring she feels understood and prepared for possible next steps.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Specific physical signs such as warmth, redness, or systemic symptoms; precise characteristics of pain; any prior similar episodes; her understanding of diagnoses; and personal or family medical history relevant to soft tissue tumors. - Diagnostic priorities: Ruling in or out infection, inflammatory processes, or malignancy; examining for subtle inflammatory signs or systemic involvement. - Patient factors: Her high emotional state and tendency to exaggerate symptoms necessitate gentle, clarifying questions that validate her concerns while obtaining accurate information. - Interview phase goals: Confirm diagnostic features for soft tissue sarcoma, explore her fears, assess physical signs, and clarify her understanding to support shared decision-making.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying, and confirmatory questions targeting physical signs, pain details, and history. - Information target: Signs of inflammation or systemic symptoms, pain characteristics, prior episodes, and her understanding or misconceptions. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, collaborative language to validate her distress and gently guide her toward accurate information. - Expected value: Obtaining critical clinical clues that might suggest benign vs. malignant processes, thereby solidifying diagnostic certainty and easing patient anxiety.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared about the rapid growth and the pain worsening with movement and pressure, I want to ask a few more detailed questions to make sure we understand all the signs. Have you noticed any redness, warmth, or swelling around the lump, or does it look the same as before? Also, apart from the pain, have you experienced any fever, chills, or feeling generally unwell? Finally, do you recall any previous lumps or similar issues before this one, or is this the first time something like this has happened?\"",
