    "input": "The patient is a child presenting with concerns of intermittent difficulty speaking and understanding, characterized by word-finding problems, comprehension difficulties, and performing tasks incorrectly when given instructions. The child's descriptions are vague and hesitant, indicating possible emotional discomfort or embarrassment, which may lead to underreporting of symptom severity. Objective assessment suggests that language and cognitive communication difficulties are present, with potential functional impairment that may be more substantial than the patient admits. The timeline of these symptoms is reported as longstanding but worsening. Additional probing is required to clarify specific situations where difficulties occur, emotional impact, onset, and progression. There is no information yet on associated social or emotional symptoms, but these should be explored further due to the communication style pointing to possible underlying psychosocial factors.1. Diagnosis: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) / Developmental Language Disorder\nJustification: The child's longstanding, gradually worsening language difficulties with word retrieval and comprehension issues fit typical features of developmental language delay, especially if no neurological deficits are noted.\n2. Diagnosis: Learning Disorder with Impairment in Reading or Written Expression\nJustification: Difficulties performing tasks and language deficits could reflect a comorbid learning disorder affecting language skills, particularly if literacy-based challenges are prominent.\n3. Diagnosis: Anxiety-Related Speech and Language Difficulties\nJustification: Vague, hesitant descriptions and emotional discomfort may suggest social or generalized anxiety affecting communication, especially if the child's emotional state exacerbates language issues.\n4. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)\nJustification: Communication difficulties, especially with pragmatic language, and possible social emotional concerns could be indicative of ASD, which commonly presents with language and social impairments.\n5. Diagnosis: Speech Sound Disorder or Articulation Disorder\nJustification: These often involve difficulty producing speech, but typically less about comprehension and more about articulation; unlikely to fully explain complex word-finding and comprehension issues.\n6. Diagnosis: Formal Neurodevelopmental Disorders (e.g., Intellectual Disability)\nJustification: If cognitive impairment is present, it might contribute to language difficulties, although no broad intellectual deficits are mentioned.\n7. Diagnosis: Psychological or Emotional Factors (e.g., Selective Mutism, functional communication disorder)\nJustification: Emotional discomfort and vague reporting could influence speech and comprehension, possibly manifesting as functional or psychosomatic communication issues.\n8. Diagnosis: Seizure Disorder or Epilepsy affecting language centers\nJustification: Unlikely without first seizure history or episodic speech arrest; though possible, less probable given chronicity with no mention of episodic events.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative or Progressive Neurological Disorder\nJustification: Less likely in a child with a longstanding history without signs of decline or neurological deterioration.\n10. Diagnosis: Structural Brain Lesion (e.g., tumor, stroke)\nJustification: No acute signs or neurological deficits reported; less probable unless further neuroimaging indicates otherwise.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The child employs vague and minimal language, often using informal phrasing like \"not good sometimes\" and \"a long time,\" which reduces specificity but conveys general awareness. There's some emotional content implied in their embarrassment, but overall, the language remains non-clinical.\n- Information flow: Responses are reluctant and limited, with a tendency to avoid detailed descriptions. They tend to wait for prompts rather than volunteering comprehensive information, indicating cautious openness.\n- Response style: Responses are short and filler-laden, reflecting hesitation and possible difficulty articulating complex feelings or details.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of vague quantifiers (\"sometimes,\" \"a long time\") and avoidance of specific details suggest concealment of the true extent.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity (\"don\u2019t talk good sometimes,\" \"not that bad\") implies the child is minimizing their difficulties, potentially to avoid embarrassment.\n- Amplification patterns: Minimal; responses do not exaggerate symptoms, aligning more with downplaying.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The child's descriptor of sounding \"funny\" and the phrasing \"I don\u2019t talk good\" hint at feelings of shame or self-consciousness.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The vague timeline (\"like this for a long time,\" \"worse now\") indicates some awareness but limited recall or unwillingness to specify.\n- Family influence: Not directly evident but implied that others have noted the difficulties, possibly influencing the child's conscious or subconscious minimization.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, as the child saps down their difficulties using non-specific and mild descriptors.\n- Severity: Moderate, because despite the downplaying, the child acknowledges ongoing and worsening issues.\n- Areas most affected: Language and comprehension severity are likely worse than reported, with underestimation of impact.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses are cautious and minimize severity, so exact extent is uncertain but the presence of symptoms is evident.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise details about the severity, frequency, and impact of language problems\u2014these are probably underreported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The child's speech and comprehension difficulties might be more profound than expressed\u2014expect greater impairment.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The child's concern about worsening (\"worse now\") could be heightened emotion rather than objective severity.\n- True timeline: The actual progression may have been more gradual and severe, but the child's cautious language obscures this.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: child presenting with speech and comprehension concerns. The chief complaint involves difficulty initiating and understanding speech, with reported problems over a long period that have recently worsened. The patient's reported symptoms include word-finding difficulties, comprehension challenges, and performing tasks incorrectly when following instructions. These reports are characterized by vagueness, underestimating severity, and potential emotional shielding, which may conceal more significant functional impairment. Objective assessment confirms the presence of language and communication difficulties; however, the true severity, frequency, and impact may be underestimated. The timeline suggests longstanding issues with recent worsening, but the extent of impairment is likely more substantial than patient discloses. No additional symptoms have been explicitly reported, but emotional factors and social feedback, which the patient may withhold, could influence the clinical picture. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to fully characterize the severity, triggers, emotional impact, and social consequences of the communication difficulties. Confidence in reporting the severity is medium due to communication biases; confidence in the presence of specific language deficits is high; and there is missing information regarding emotional and social impact.1. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (Language and social communication deficits)\nJustification: The child's longstanding difficulties with speech, comprehension, and following instructions, combined with potential social and emotional factors, suggest ASD. These features are characteristic of social communication disorder prevalent in language development issues.\n2. Diagnosis: Specific Language Impairment (Developmental speech and language delay)\nJustification: Persistent language difficulties without broader neurodevelopmental or neurological issues are typical of SLI, particularly if the deficits are primarily in language despite otherwise normal development.\n3. Diagnosis: Speech-Language Delay due to Developmental Delay\nJustification: The child's speech and comprehension issues could represent a nonspecific developmental delay impacting language skills, especially if no other neurological deficits are evident.\n4. Diagnosis: Childhood Apraxia of Speech\nJustification: Difficulty initiating speech and producing correct tasks might point to motor planning disorder; however, comprehension issues are less characteristic, making this slightly less likely but still plausible.\n5. Diagnosis: Language Regression due to Neurodegenerative Disease\nJustification: Worsening symptoms over time can suggest neurodegeneration, although less likely in very young children without additional neurological signs.\n6. Diagnosis: Auditory Processing Disorder\nJustification: Difficulties following instructions and understanding speech might relate to auditory processing issues; however, longstanding and worsening symptoms are less typical.\n7. Diagnosis: Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder\nJustification: Challenges with social language use fit but may overlap with ASD features, so lesser but still relevant.\n8. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Emotional Factors Affecting Communication\nJustification: Emotional shielding could mask severity, but these are unlikely as primary causes without other signs of anxiety or emotional disturbance.\n9. Diagnosis: Seizure-related Language Impairment (Post-ictal or epilepsy)\nJustification: No explicit seizure history provided; less likely but considered if neurological impairment is suspected.\n10. Diagnosis: Acquired Neurological Injury (e.g., brain lesion)\nJustification: No trauma or neurological deficits noted; less likely, but recent worsening necessitates consideration if structural injury is suspected.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague, minimization-oriented language, avoiding specifics or emotionally charged descriptors. For example, \"I don\u2019t talk good sometimes\" downplays the difficulty, and there's no mention of frustration or emotional response.\n- Information flow: The responses are brief and somewhat limited, showing reluctance to elaborate unless prompted. They tend to answer directly but do not volunteer additional context, indicating possible discomfort or shame.\n- Response style: The answers are minimal and direct, lacking elaboration or detailed narrative, which could suggest a tendency to understate problems or discomfort in talking about their difficulties openly.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient\u2019s reluctance to openly discuss emotional aspects or the extent of frustration suggests potential withholding of deeper issues. They avoid detailed descriptions, possibly to prevent revealing shame or embarrassment.\n- Minimization behaviors: The repeated use of vague terms (\"sometimes,\" \"hard,\" \"a little\") and avoidance of emotional language indicate they may be downplaying the severity, possibly to avoid stigma or feeling embarrassed.\n- Amplification patterns: There are no evident signs of exaggeration; responses are consistently understated, indicating no exaggeration but rather possible under-reporting.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The patient\u2019s brief, non-emotional responses and avoidance of discussing how they feel suggest potential shame around their communication difficulties.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of true confusion or memory deficits are present; responses are consistent, but the brevity may stem from discomfort rather than actual cognitive issues.\n- Family influence: The responses mention that others have told them they sound \"funny\" or \"not saying full sentences,\" which may influence their perception of their speech and indirect feelings of inadequacy or shame.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization bias is predominant, as the patient underreports emotional distress and exaggerates their capabilities or difficulty levels.\n- Severity: Moderate, since responses are brief and avoid certain topics, but not entirely withholding or denying issues.\n- Areas most affected: Emotional impact and severity of communication difficulties are likely understated, as they avoid emotional elaboration and minimize their experiences.\n- Reliability: Self-reporting has limitations here due to emotional shielding; responses are probably somewhat underrepresentative of true severity.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient might be experiencing more frustration, emotional distress, or functional impairment than they report. Details about how difficulties impact daily life emotionally are probably underrepresented.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The social/emotional toll of communication challenges may be understated, given their vagueness and lack of elaboration.\n- Concerns probably amplified: They may be more worried about negative judgments (\"sound a little funny\") but are hesitant to express this openly, leading to underdisclosure.\n- True timeline: The progression might be more gradual or severe than expressed; their brief responses suggest possible embarrassment about the negative aspects of their symptoms and thus an underestimation of the condition's impact over time.",

    "input": "The patient's vague and minimized communication responses suggest they may underreport the severity and impact of their language difficulties. Hesitations and avoidance cues imply potential emotional shielding, which could conceal more significant impairment or social distress. Therefore, the objective clinical picture likely reflects a more substantial and possibly more disabling communication disorder than patient reports. Confidence levels in symptom severity are moderate due to these biases, and additional probing is necessary for a full assessment. Patient demographics: Child presenting with suspected language and comprehension deficits. Chief complaint: The patient reports long-standing difficulties with speech, word-finding, and understanding, which have worsened over time, though the patient minimizes the severity.1. Diagnosis: Specific Language Impairment (Developmental Language Disorder)\nJustification: Long-standing language difficulties focusing on speech, word-finding, and understanding are characteristic; common in children; symptoms may be minimized by the child but still predominant.\n2. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder\nJustification: Communication difficulties alongside social and behavioral features often seen; hesitations and avoidance cues can be indicative of social communication issues common in ASD.\n3. Diagnosis: Language delay due to Speech-Language Disorder\nJustification: Delayed acquisition of language skills with subsequent progression or worsening aligns with developmental delays; prevalence is high in pediatric populations.\n4. Diagnosis: Hearing Impairment\nJustification: Hearing issues can manifest as speech/language deficits; often underreported; should be considered given the long-standing difficulties.\n5. Diagnosis: Childhood Onset Aphasia (e.g., after neurological insult)\nJustification: Progressive or longstanding language impairment could be due to neurological damage; less likely but important to consider in chronic or worsening cases.\n6. Diagnosis: Intellectual Disability\nJustification: Language deficits may be part of broader cognitive delays; usually evident with developmental history but can sometimes be subtle.\n7. Diagnosis: Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder\nJustification: Difficulties with social aspects of language that can be subtle and minimized; fits some features, especially if social avoidance is noted.\n8. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative Disorder (rare in children)\nJustification: Unlikely given age and presentation, but if symptoms worsen significantly, reconsideration might be necessary.\n9. Diagnosis: Speech Motor Disorder (e.g., Childhood Apraxia of Speech)\nJustification: Difficulties with speech production and motor planning can lead to speech delay; often co-occurs with other language deficits.\n10.

The patient reports these issues as gradually worsening but minimizes the impact and emotional distress associated with the impairment. Communication patterns during evaluation suggest hesitance and underreporting, indicating that the true severity of the language difficulties and their psychosocial consequences may be greater than the patient describes. Further detailed inquiry into the social and emotional effects of these communication problems is recommended.1. Diagnosis: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) Justification: The child's presentation of isolated, persistent language difficulties over a year without other neurological signs aligns with developmental language disorder, particularly SLI, characterized by delayed or impaired language development in the absence of general cognitive or neurological deficits. The gradual worsening may reflect developmental lag rather than neurodegeneration, and the child's minimization of distress is common. 2. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (Language Variant)COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient prefers vague and softened language (e.g., \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"not that bad\"), which limits the clarity of emotional and symptom severity.

    "input": "A child presents with a one-year history of progressively worsening speech production, word-finding, and comprehension difficulties. The patient reports that these issues have increased in severity over time but minimizes emotional or social distress associated with these symptoms. Communication during evaluation indicates hesitance and response restraint, suggesting underreporting of the emotional and social impact. Objective findings confirm ongoing speech and language challenges, though additional assessment is needed to evaluate emotional well-being and identify underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Childhood-onset primary progressive aphasia (PPA)\nJustification: The child exhibits a one-year history of progressive worsening of speech production, word-finding, and comprehension, which are hallmark features of primary progressive aphasia variants, especially if the decline is gradual and neurodegenerative. The developmental course over a year with worsening symptoms points towards a neurodegenerative process affecting language areas in the brain rather than a static developmental delay. The minimal emotional disturbance reported may be due to underreporting, but the core deficits align with PPA.\n2. Diagnosis: Semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA)\nJustification: The specific impairment in comprehension and word-finding suggests semantic processing deficits. Since the decline involves understanding words and retrieving them, this variant of PPA is plausible. The child's age is unusual for primary neurodegenerative diseases, but some neurodegenerative syndromes can present in childhood, making this a consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with language predominance\nJustification: FTLD can present with language deficits before behavioral changes. The progressive deterioration supports this, especially if underlying atrophy affects language regions. Although FTLD is rare in children, certain genetic syndromes associated with neurodegeneration can manifest similarly.\n4. Diagnosis: Childhood neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome or other rare conditions affecting language)\nJustification: Some genetic neurodegenerative syndromes can initially present with language regression or deterioration. While Rett primarily affects girls and includes stereotypic hand movements, the language regression aligns with some neurodegenerative pathologies, making it a possible, though less likely, diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Developmental language regression due to underlying neurodevelopmental disorder\nJustification: Although developmental language delays typically occur earlier, a slowly progressive regression over a year suggests that an atypical neurodevelopmental process (such as a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder) is more probable. It is included to contrast static developmental delay versus progressive decline, which this case favors.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient prefers brief, vague responses like \"I don\u2019t know,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"I guess,\" avoiding detailed emotional or social descriptions. This indicates a tendency toward minimization or discomfort sharing deeper feelings, especially about social and emotional experiences.\n- Information flow: Responses are generally organized around direct questions but lack elaboration, suggesting reluctance to disclose more personal or emotional information. The answers are straightforward but limited, indicating a pattern of response restraint.\n- Response style: The patient uses minimal elaboration, sticking to surface-level descriptions, likely to avoid delving into potentially embarrassing or uncomfortable topics.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The consistent brevity, vagueness (\"I don\u2019t really think about it much\"), and avoidance of elaboration indicate possible withholding of emotional or social distress.

    "input": "Patient demographics: Pediatric patient (age unspecified, presumed child or adolescent). Chief complaint: Progressive language and comprehension difficulties over the past year, with worsening severity. Present illness: The patient exhibits persistent speech production issues, word-finding errors, and understanding deficits. These difficulties have increased over time and are more severe than the patient openly reports. The patient admits to avoiding talking at times, feeling confused, and not understanding conversations as well as other children. There is no specific mention of associated neurological symptoms such as weakness, sensory deficits, or systemic signs. The patient reports feelings of sadness related to speech issues but minimizes emotional distress. It is likely that emotional and social impairments, including social anxiety or low self-esteem, are underrecognized and more significant than indicated. The timeline suggests a gradual progression over one year, with an acceleration of symptoms. Additional assessment is required to evaluate emotional well-being and determine if psychosocial factors are contributing to or exacerbating language difficulties.1. Diagnosis: Primary Progressive Aphasia (possibly a developmental variant or early-onset neurodegenerative disorder)\nJustification: The gradual, progressive decline in language and comprehension over a year suggests a neurodegenerative process affecting language centers. Although more common in adults, early-onset variants can occur in adolescents, explaining worsening speech production, word-finding errors, and comprehension deficits that deteriorate over time.\n2. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder with Regression\nJustification: The patient's communication difficulties, especially meeting milestones, and recent decline could reflect a regressive form of ASD, where longstanding social communication deficits worsen or become more apparent over time, possibly with subtle social-emotional impairments underrecognized.\n3. Diagnosis: Psychogenic/Functional Language Disorder\nJustification: The patient reports feelings of sadness and avoidance of talking, which could suggest a psychogenic component. However, the progressive worsening over a year with objective speech and comprehension deficits makes this less likely as sole cause but still possible as a contributing factor.\n4. Diagnosis: Leukodystrophy or Neurodegenerative Metabolic Disorder\nJustification: Progressive cognitive and language decline in a pediatric patient could reflect a metabolic or white matter disorder, especially if other neurological signs develop. However, no systemic or neurological signs are described, making this less probable but still a consideration.\n5. Diagnosis: Early-Onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease or other Dementia syndromes\nJustification: Extremely rare but possible, given the progressive nature, early-onset dementia is less likely but should be considered if other features appear. The current presentation is more consistent with developmental or neurodegenerative language conditions.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and somewhat emotional language (\"worse,\" \"feel different,\" \"scared\") instead of detailed descriptions, indicating possible discomfort in discussing emotional or social impacts directly.\n- Information flow: Responses are organized but limited; they tend to volunteer minimal information unless specifically prompted, showing some reluctance to expand on feelings or impact. Responses are fairly direct but with little elaboration.\n- Response style: The patient provides concise answers, avoiding detailed explanations and often using fillers or vague terms, indicating a tendency toward minimal disclosure and potential discomfort in fully revealing feelings.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient\u2019s brevity, use of vague language, and lack of detailed emotional exploration point to mild withholding of emotional distress and social impact.\n- Minimization behaviors: The patient downplays their difficulties (\"not that bad,\" \"I don\u2019t talk good like they do\") and avoids emphasizing the distress or social repercussions, possibly to appear more resilient or to avoid stigma.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear evidence of exaggerated concern; responses are relatively measured.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Discomfort is evident when mentioning sounding \"funny\" or being different, which may reflect shame or embarrassment about their communication issues.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Some evidence of fluctuating understanding, but overall responses are consistent, suggesting limited actual memory problems; more likely adaptive responses.\n- Family influence: Indirectly, responses may be shaped by social desirability, possibly influenced by family perceptions of their speech or emotional expression.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias with some emotional shielding, as the patient underreports emotional distress and social impact but responds coherently.\n- Severity: Moderate, because emotional and social effects are likely understated, but communication about symptoms is generally consistent.\n- Areas most affected: Emotional response and social perception topics are most biased, with possible underreporting of emotional challenges and social anxiety.\n- Reliability: Their reporting provides a generally accurate picture of baseline speech symptoms but likely underestimates the emotional and social difficulties.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient is probably not fully disclosing the extent of emotional distress, social anxiety, and possibly the impact on self-esteem. They might also underreport severity of social withdrawal or frustration.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Emotional impact and distress are likely more significant than the patient admits; they might be experiencing more anxiety or sadness related to their communication difficulties.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient might feel more worried internally about social judgment than they express outwardly; their external responses are subdued.\n- True timeline: The reported timeline seems plausible; their difficulties have been increasing gradually, consistent with developmental language disorder progression, but the emotional toll may be more recent or more intense than expressed.",

There is some consistency across responses, indicating a patterned response style that leans towards minimizing or guarding their experiences.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient does not outright refuse to answer but subtly downplays difficulties and avoids detailed emotional disclosures, indicating mild withholding likely motivated by discomfort or shame.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of non-specific language (\"sometimes,\" \"hard,\" \"kind of\") and softening phrases (\"a little,\" \"just\") suggest they are downplaying the severity of their speech challenges.\n- Amplification patterns: While they acknowledge worsening difficulty (\"it\u2019s been worse sometimes\"), this might be an honest reflection or an attempt to gain reassurance; the language used does not strongly suggest over-exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Phrases expressing feeling \"embarrassed\" and wanting to say things \"right\" indicate some shame or self-consciousness about their speech issues, which could lead to withholding deeper emotional responses or frustrations.\n- Confusion/memory issues: The responses are temporally consistent, but their descriptions of difficulty with words (\"forget what I wanna say,\" \"mix up the words\") indicate genuine challenges rather than fabricated issues.\n- Family influence: Indirectly, their responses suggest awareness of external judgment (\"I get told I sound a little funny\"), which could influence their tendency to minimize or modify their descriptions.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as the patient appears to soften or downplay their difficulties to maintain a positive or resilient image.\n- Severity: Moderate bias, because their language consistently underestimates the emotional and functional impact, though they admit to worsening over time.\n- Areas most affected: Their appraisal of symptom severity and emotional response\u2014tending to understate their distress\u2014are most biased.\n- Reliability: Their self-reporting is somewhat trustworthy but requires careful corroboration, as they might not fully disclose the emotional burden or the true extent of impairment due to shame or discomfort.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Deeper emotional distress, frustration, or social embarrassment related to their speech difficulties may be underreported; they might also conceal the full extent of daily functional impairments.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of their speech and emotional challenges may be worse than described, especially regarding emotional impact and social frustrations.\n- Concerns probably amplified: They might emphasize their willingness or efforts (\"really want to say things right\") to garner reassurance, possibly over-worrying about being misunderstood or judged, although this seems driven by genuine concern.\n- True timeline: The progression might be steady but somewhat more severe than depicted; their acknowledgment of worsening over time suggests this, but their softened language could mask the true impact.\nIn sum, the patient's communication displays a cautious, softening pattern likely influenced by shame, leading to mild minimization biases that obscure the full extent of their difficulties.",
