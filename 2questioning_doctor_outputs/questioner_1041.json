    "input": "The patient presents with an acute onset of eye pain accompanied by a significant concern about impending vision loss. The description suggests high emotional distress, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity. Objective clinical assessment is necessary to determine the actual ocular pathology, which could include inflammatory or other ocular processes, but her reported symptoms may be exaggerated due to anxiety. Further detailed history focusing on symptom onset, progression, associated neurological symptoms, and baseline eye health is required to establish an accurate clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Sudden onset eye pain with concern for vision loss; characteristic of rapid pupil dilation causing increasing intraocular pressure; common in middle-aged adults, especially hypermetropes, with often unilateral presentation.  2. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Anterior Segment) Justification: Inflammatory eye condition presenting with eye pain and potential vision changes; often sudden and associated with redness, photophobia; can cause significant distress and mimic other acute eye pains.  3. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis Justification: Rapid vision loss and eye discomfort, often associated with neurological conditions like MS; though more common in younger adults, it can present with eye pain worsening with eye movement.  4. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion or Ulcer Justification: Sudden eye pain, especially if trauma or contact lens use reported; can cause significant discomfort and concern about vision but usually associated with foreign body sensation or visual disturbance.  5. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis with secondary keratitis Justification: Typically causes eye discomfort; rarely causes severe pain or vision loss; more common in infectious cases, but less likely to cause sudden severe pain.  6. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Justification: Sudden painless vision loss more often, but potential for atypical symptoms with accompanying eye discomfort; more common in older adults.  7. Diagnosis:Sinus-related orbital pain Justification: Sinusitis can cause orbital pain and pressure, sometimes mimicking ocular pain, but usually associated with sinus symptoms rather than direct ocular pain.  8. Diagnosis: Subacute or chronic uveitis Justification: Less likely given the acute onset but considered due to inflammation; would typically have associated signs like redness and photophobia.  9. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura Justification: Can cause visual disturbances and eye discomfort; however, pain is usually less severe and not associated with significant risk of vision loss; less likely as primary cause.  10. Diagnosis: Psychogenic or Functional Visual Disturbance Justification: Given emotional distress and perceived symptoms, psychogenic causes could amplify symptoms but are less likely to cause true structural impairment or acute vision loss without clinical evidence.

    "input": "Patient demographics: unspecified age and gender. Chief complaint: acute eye pain with visual disturbance, likely related to an inflammatory or neurological ocular process, though subjective severity may be overstated. Present illness: The patient reports onset approximately three days prior of eye pain that worsens with eye movement, blurred vision described as fog or curtain, and intermittent flashing lights. These symptoms are consistent with an ocular inflammatory process, such as optic neuritis, but emotional distress may have amplified her perception of severity. She may be underestimating baseline visual function or previous minor eye issues and might be withholding information about prior ocular history or less severe symptoms. The timeline suggests a relatively rapid onset, but emotional factors could impact her perception of progression speed. Associated symptoms like headache, neurological deficits, or systemic signs are not confirmed; further examination and history are needed. Confidence in symptom description is moderate, recognizing that her emotional state likely magnifies perceived severity, and some physical signs cannot be determined without physical exam. Additional probing into neurological symptoms, past ocular health, and systemic features, along with objective ophthalmologic assessment, are necessary for comprehensive evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis Justification: The presentation of eye pain worsened by eye movement, visual fog, and flashing lights strongly suggests optic neuritis, which commonly presents with such symptoms in a young to middle-aged adult and is often associated with multiple sclerosis. The rapid onset over three days aligns with typical inflammatory optic nerve pathology.  2. Diagnosis: Anterior Uveitis (Iritis) Justification: Intraocular inflammation can cause eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision; however, pain typically worsens with eye movement and may be associated with redness, which is not described here. Still, it remains a possibility given inflammatory ocular processes.  3. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment Justification: Flashes and visual disturbance (curtain), especially if intermittent, are classic signs of retinal detachment, but pain worsening with eye movement is less characteristic. Still, it must be considered given the visual symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Causes pain and visual disturbance; however, pain is typically severe, halts at rest, and is associated with halos and increased intraocular pressure. No evidence suggests these signs here.  5. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Justification: Sudden vision loss and optic nerve dysfunction; more common in older adults and typically painless, making it less likely in this acutely painful presentation.  6. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura Justification: Flashes and visual disturbances can suggest migraine aura, but the persistent worsening eye pain and the acuity over three days are less typical; exam focusing on ocular findings would differentiate.  7. Diagnosis: Corneal or Anterior Segment Inflammatory Process (e.g., Keratitis) Justification: Causes eye pain and visual disturbance but usually associated with redness and photophobia, which are not specified here.  8. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (acute exacerbation) Justification: Can cause optic neuritis, but as a primary presenting diagnosis, it's less likely until confirmed, and it is part of the most likely diagnosis.  9. Diagnosis: Infectious Uveitis or Endophthalmitis Justification: Causes ocular pain and inflammation, but typically associated with systemic infection signs or recent procedures.  10. Diagnosis: Intracranial Pathology (e.g., Mass lesion, increased intracranial pressure) Justification: Visual disturbance can occur with intracranial pathology, but pain worsened by eye movement and flashes favor an ocular or optic nerve process over intracranial causes.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses both vivid, emotionally charged descriptions (\"terrible pain,\" \"really frightening\") and metaphorical expressions (\"like a curtain coming down,\" \"blurry like a fog\"), indicating strong emotional involvement. Her language emphasizes severity, aligning with her anxious state. - Information flow: She freely shares her experience and concerns without prompting, providing organized details about onset and symptoms. Her responses are direct and detailed, reflecting openness. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative with emotional overtones, and she demonstrates consistent concern about her vision loss, frequently emphasizing her fear and distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; she appears open in describing her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not apparent; she emphasizes her symptoms' severity rather than downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: Clear evidence\u2014her language intensifies her distress (\"terrible pain,\" \"losing my sight,\" \"really frightening\"), indicating possible emotional amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she seems comfortable expressing her fears. - Confusion/memory issues: None indicated; her timeline and description are consistent. - Family influence: Mentions family history of MS but does not show signs of response distortion due to family; her fears seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias driven by anxiety about her health and visual loss. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her language exaggerates her distress and urgency but is still rooted in genuine symptoms; her emotional state influences perception. - Areas most affected: Perceived severity of symptoms and prognosis; her fears about blindness and MS are likely overemphasized relative to clinical findings. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy in reporting physical symptoms, but her emotional state may magnify her perception of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully aware of medication effects, coping strategies, or prior minor visual issues that could inform her condition. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual visual impairment might be worse than she perceives due to her anxiety\u2014she could be underestimating her residual vision. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of permanent blindness and MS are heightened by emotional distress; reassurance might be necessary. - True timeline: The reported progression fits typical optic neuritis, but her emotional reaction may cause her to perceive it as more rapid or severe.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: Recognizing that the patient is highly distressed and possibly amplifying her symptoms emotionally, I need to gently explore other aspects of her experience to better understand her overall picture. I want to examine her sense of how she's coping, explore any additional neurological or systemic symptoms, and build trust through open-ended questions. Because her description is emotionally charged, I should phrase my question in a supportive, non-leading way to encourage elaboration on her overall experience beyond the initial symptom focus. This will help fill gaps regarding her emotional state, possible additional symptoms, and her understanding, all of which are valuable for guiding further assessment.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Broader context of her symptoms, any systemic or neurological issues, emotional impact, prior ocular history. - Diagnostic priorities: Neurological or systemic signs, extent of vision loss, and emotional distress. - Patient factors: Her vivid descriptions and emotional expressions suggest she responds well to empathetic, open-ended prompts. - Interview phase goals: Establish rapport, explore her comprehensive experience, validate her fears, and gather contextual information.

    "input": "A patient presents with a three-day history of acute onset of ocular symptoms including pain exacerbated by eye movement, visual blurring described as fog or curtain, and flashing lights, indicative of an inflammatory or neurological process such as optic neuritis. The patient's emotional distress and anxiety appear to magnify perceived severity, but physical symptom descriptions are consistent with an inflammatory ocular condition. Additional neurological symptoms and baseline ocular history are not reported and require further inquiry. Objective evaluation and examination are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity independently of emotional factors.1. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis Justification: The acute onset of ocular pain exacerbated by eye movement, visual blurring as a fog or curtain, and flashing lights are classic for optic neuritis, likely demyelinating in origin. The symptom pattern aligns with inflammation of the optic nerve, especially in the setting of rapid progression over three days. Absence of neurological deficits does not exclude it, and emotional distress may augment symptom perception but not the underlying pathology.  2. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-Related Optic Neuritis Justification: Optic neuritis is often the first manifestation of MS; the clinical presentation fits MS-associated demyelination. The subacute visual symptoms with pain are typical. Although no other neurological signs are reported, early MS can present with isolated optic nerve involvement before other CNS lesions appear.  3. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy) Justification: Typically presents with painless vision loss, often in older patients or with vascular risk factors. The presence of pain and rapid onset favors inflammation, making ischemic neuropathy less likely, but it remains in differential, especially if pain is mild or unclear.  4. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura Justification: Flashes of light and visual disturbances could be migrainous auras, which may sometimes mimic optic neuritis. However, the presence of eye pain worsened by movement and the description of fog or curtain suggest a structural or inflammatory process rather than a typical migraine aura; thus, it's lower in probability but still consider.  5. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment Justification: Flashes of light can occur with retinal detachment, alongside visual blurring. However, pain is usually minimal or absent, and the typical presentation involves a curtain or shadow rather than diffuse fog, making it less likely but included due to overlapping symptoms.

Her narrative is organized around her distress but exhibits heightened emotional tone. - Response style: The responses are elaborative and expressive, often emphasizing her fears and the severity of her experience, showing a tendency to magnify her appraisal of the situation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her initial hesitance to fully detail prior visual changes and her focus on emotional distress suggest some reluctance to present a complete clinical picture, possibly to avoid appearing overly anxious. - Minimization behaviors: None apparent; she tends to overstate severity. - Amplification patterns: Strongly evident in her frequent expressions of fear (\"worst,\" \"really frightening,\" fearing permanent blindness). - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not prominent; her expressions are openly emotional. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; her timeline is consistent and detailed. - Family influence: Her mention of family history influences her concern, but responses do not seem biased by family opinion\u2014more by her personal anxiety.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias due to high anxiety levels, leading her to over-inflate the severity and permanence of her condition. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional state significantly influences perception but does not distort factual reporting of clinical symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her fear of blindness and prognosis assessments are most biased, as anxiety amplifies her perceived threat. - Reliability: Can be trusted with core symptom reporting but with caution regarding her emotional overestimation of risk.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early subtle symptoms or baseline eye health; her focus on worst-case scenarios might obscure a full understanding. - Symptoms probably minimized: She does not minimize; she exaggerates her fears. - Concerns probably amplified: Her feared outcomes (permanent blindness) are likely overestimated due to emotional distress. - True timeline: Symptoms align with her report, suggesting accurate onset; emotional impact may distort her perception of how rapidly the condition is worsening.  In summary, her communication exhibits emotional amplification bias, with high anxiety influencing her perception of the severity and prognosis. Her factual symptom reporting remains relatively reliable, but her fears seem exaggerated, which may impact her treatment expectations and mental health assessment.",

    "input": "The patient, an adult female, presents with a three-day history of acutely worsening eye pain, notably aggravated by eye movement, accompanied by visual disturbances described as fog or a curtain, and intermittent flashing lights. Her emotional distress appears to amplify her current symptom severity, and there is a likelihood that she has experienced minor, transient visual symptoms previously that she does not recall or consider noteworthy. She denies prior significant eye issues, but communication biases suggest she may have minimized mild past episodes. No other neurological symptoms are currently reported. Objective assessment and comprehensive history-taking are needed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for associated neurological involvement.1. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis (Associated with Multiple Sclerosis) Justification: The hallmark features include acute onset of eye pain worsened by eye movement, visual disturbances such as fog or curtain, and intermittent flashing lights. The symptoms are classic for inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerve, typical of optic neuritis, often seen in MS. The recent acute worsening and the patient's distress support this, especially in the context of possible prior mild or unnoticed episodes, which is common in MS. No signs of systemic infection or other ocular pathology are described, reinforcing this diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis Justification: The presentation of optic neuritis can be the first manifestation of MS, a demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system. The recurrent or unrecognized prior episodes suggested by communication biases imply possible previous subclinical demyelination. This diagnosis explains the optic nerve inflammation and the likelihood of future neurological episodes.  3. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Inflammatory Optic Neuritis Justification: While often associated with MS, idiopathic optic neuritis can occur without identifiable systemic disease. The acute optic nerve inflammation with pain and visual disturbance is typical. Given the lack of evidence for systemic infection or vasculopathy, idiopathic inflammation remains a clinical consideration.  4. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Justification: Typically presents with painless or less painful visual loss in older adults and is associated with vascular risk factors. The pain with eye movement and rapid symptom onset favor inflammatory rather than ischemic processes, so this is less probable but considered in differential.  5. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment Justification: Usually presents with a sudden curtain or shadow in vision, sometimes flashing lights, but generally not associated with eye movement pain. The presence of pain with eye movement and the description of fog suggests a more optic nerve involvement rather than retinal pathology, placing retinal detachment lower on the list.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional, somewhat vague language (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201chard,\u201d \u201cso scared\u201d) alongside attempts at minimization (\u201cMy eyesight has always been fine, I guess\u201d), indicating emotional distress intertwined with possible downplaying of minor past issues. - Information flow: She tends to answer directly but with superficial details, providing limited prior history, possibly to avoid admitting past minor issues or out of emotional overwhelm, resulting in scattered information. - Response style: Responses are succinct but emotionally charged, with notable emphasis on her fears rather than detailed medical history.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The minimal mention of prior visual problems suggests possible withholding of past minor symptoms, which might be relevant. - Minimization behaviors: The phrase \u201cMy eyesight has always been fine, I guess\u201d indicates downplaying any earlier minor issues, possibly to avoid seeming irregular. - Amplification patterns: Current fears about losing her sight and describing pain as \u201cterrible\u201d suggest heightened anxiety leading to overemphasis on severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited, but the vague response about her past health indicates some reluctance to share potentially minor past concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, responses are straightforward but superficial, perhaps lacking detailed recall. - Family influence: Awareness of family MS history may heighten her worry and influence her perception of severity, leading to emotional exaggeration.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional distress-to-severity bias combined with possible minimization of prior minor symptoms, driven by fear. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences perception and communication, affecting accuracy. - Areas most affected: Past visual history is most biased, with potential underreporting; current symptom severity may also be exaggerated due to anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report, especially regarding past history, is somewhat unreliable, though her current pain and fears likely reflect genuine distress.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Previous minor visual episodes or transient symptoms that she dismisses or forgets, important for a full assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any prior mild flashes, blurriness, or eye discomfort she deems insignificant. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of permanent blindness and MS connection, possibly driven by her emotional state and family history. - True timeline: Onset appears accurate, but her emotional response might inflate the perceived severity, and she may overlook or minimize minor prior symptoms due to distress or misconception about their importance.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The patient's history of any prior mild or transient visual symptoms, like flashes or blurriness, which she dismisses but could be relevant, is unclear. Her self-report that her eyesight has always been fine may result from minimization. Clarifying whether she has experienced any previous similar episodes, even briefly or mildly, is important to evaluate the possibility of recurrent demyelination or MS. - Diagnostic priorities: Determining if her past visual disturbances were present helps differentiate primary optic neuritis from other causes like ischemic or retinal issues. Also, exploring other neurological symptoms would support or refute MS diagnosis. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and tendency to minimize previous symptoms suggest the need for gentle, specific questions to elicit details without causing defensiveness or over-denial. - Interview phase goals: Clarify whether she had any prior eye symptoms, determine the timeline and nature of those, and assess if her current distress correlates with actual severity or emotional amplification.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarification questions about past symptoms, with an open-ended element to allow her to share if she recalls anything. - Information target: Past visual symptoms, their characteristics, timing, and impact; any prior episodes that may suggest recurrent demyelination. - Communication approach: Frame questions gently to avoid defensiveness, perhaps emphasizing that mild or brief episodes might have gone unnoticed or thought insignificant. - Expected value: This will help determine whether her current presentation is an isolated recent event or part of a pattern suggestive of MS or recurrent optic neuritis, refining the differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \u201cYou mentioned earlier that your eyesight has always been fine, but sometimes people notice very mild visual changes that they don't think much of or forget over time.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The minimal mention of prior visual problems suggests possible withholding of past minor symptoms, which might be relevant. - Minimization behaviors: The phrase \u201cMy eyesight has always been fine, I guess\u201d indicates downplaying any earlier minor issues, possibly to avoid seeming irregular. - Amplification patterns: Current fears about losing her sight and describing pain as \u201cterrible\u201d suggest heightened anxiety leading to overemphasis on severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited, but the vague response about her past health indicates some reluctance to share potentially minor past concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, responses are straightforward but superficial, perhaps lacking detailed recall. - Family influence: Awareness of family MS history may heighten her worry and influence her perception of severity, leading to emotional exaggeration.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional distress-to-severity bias combined with possible minimization of prior minor symptoms, driven by fear. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences perception and communication, affecting accuracy. - Areas most affected: Past visual history is most biased, with potential underreporting; current symptom severity may also be exaggerated due to anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report, especially regarding past history, is somewhat unreliable, though her current pain and fears likely reflect genuine distress.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Previous minor visual episodes or transient symptoms that she dismisses or forgets, important for a full assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any prior mild flashes, blurriness, or eye discomfort she deems insignificant. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of permanent blindness and MS connection, possibly driven by her emotional state and family history. - True timeline: Onset appears accurate, but her emotional response might inflate the perceived severity, and she may overlook or minimize minor prior symptoms due to distress or misconception about their importance.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a three-day history of acutely worsening eye pain, notably aggravated by eye movement, accompanied by visual disturbances described as fog or a curtain and intermittent flashes of light. Although she reports her eyesight was previously normal, she may have experienced minor, transient visual phenomena in the past that she considers insignificant and has not reported. Her current symptoms are likely severe and distressing; however, communication biases suggest she may have minimized or overlooked earlier mild visual disturbances. No other neurological symptoms are reported at this time. Further objective assessment and detailed history-taking are necessary to clarify the underlying cause and disease progression.Optic neuritis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses both emotionally charged words (\"terrible,\" \"frightening\") and minimizing phrases (\"probably,\" \"I guess\"), reflecting fluctuating emotional engagement and possible attempt to downplay prior issues. - Information flow: She tends to withhold minor past symptoms, responding only when directly asked, indicating selective disclosure. - Response style: Responses are generally concise and consistent; she does not elaborate much beyond required answers, but shows signs of distress through verbal and physical cues.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her denial of previous visual disturbances suggests some reluctance or unawareness, potentially missing early warning signs. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying her past stable eyesight indicates a tendency to minimize or forget minor symptoms, possibly to avoid worry or due to unawareness. - Amplification patterns: Her current fears and descriptions of pain and vision loss suggest genuine distress, but her focus on worst-case scenarios may reflect anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal, but her effort to neutralize past issues suggests some discomfort about admitting minor prior problems. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant indicators; she provides a consistent timeline. - Family influence: Notably aware of family history but does not express undue concern about her genetic risk, somewhat minimizing personal relevance.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, particularly around her prior ocular symptoms, possibly leading to underrecognition of earlier minor episodes. - Severity: Moderate; underestimating early subtle signs might affect clinical assessment and timing. - Areas most affected: Past visual symptoms and their clinical relevance, as she dismisses or forgets minor past fluctuations. - Reliability: Moderate; her current distress is credible, but her recall of minor history is likely biased toward minimizing prior issues.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Mild, transient visual disturbances or spots in her peripheral vision that she perceives as non-serious. - Symptoms probably minimized: Prior minor visual episodes (flashes, spots) that could inform disease course. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current fears of total blindness appear justified but may be heightened by anxiety. - True timeline: The recent onset appears accurate, but the possibility of earlier unnoticed or dismissed symptoms exists, which could alter understanding of disease progression.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's current symptoms are acute and severe, with a three-day history of eye pain and visual disturbances suggestive of an optic nerve process like optic neuritis. She has downplayed or forgotten earlier mild visual episodes, which may have been significant preclinical signs. To confirm the diagnosis, it's essential to ensure that she hasn't experienced prior visual disturbances that could point to a more chronic or different process, and to clarify her current symptom profile, especially focusing on the nature and severity of visual changes, pain, and their impact. Understanding her awareness and concerns about her condition can also guide appropriate education and management. Since she's somewhat minimization bias, I need to ask focused, clarifying questions that encourage her to reflect on her visual history and current experience without leading her, but still discerning subtle past symptoms. Additionally, I want to assess her understanding and emotional readiness for potential treatment options related to optic neuritis or underlying demyelinating disease. Finally, practical factors\u2014such as her allergies, current medications, and lifestyle\u2014are important for planning management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused clarifying questions targeting past visual episodes, severity of current symptoms, and her thoughts. - Information target: Past minor visual phenomena (flashes, spots), current symptom severity, her perceptions, and concerns. - Communication approach: Gentle, non-judgmental phrasing to mitigate minimization and encourage honesty. - Expected value: Will identify any missed early signs, confirm symptom characteristics, and assess readiness for diagnosis and treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your eyesight was always fine before, but I'm wondering\u2014have you noticed in the past any brief flashes, spots, or fuzzy vision in either eye that you might have overlooked or thought was normal at the time? Sometimes, people experience very mild episodes that they might forget later. Also, since these new symptoms started, how would you describe the severity of your vision fog or flashes now\u2014are they constant, or do they come and go? And how has all this affected your daily life or your worries about your eyesight?\"",
