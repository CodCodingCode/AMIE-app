She has not started puberty like most of her friends and feels that her body is not developing normally, which she finds confusing and frightening.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Premature Ovarian Failure  \nJustification: The patient\u2019s absence of menarche, lack of breast development, and delayed puberty suggest ovarian failure or dysfunction affecting estrogen production.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism  \nJustification: The delayed or absent pubertal development with low circulating gonadotropins (LH and FSH) points toward secondary hypogonadism due to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.\n\n3.

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient reports not having her period, no breast development, and feeling confused, scared, sad, and frustrated about her body's lack of development. She has not started puberty like most of her friends and feels that her body is not developing normally, which she finds confusing and frightening.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,X0)\nJustification: The patient exhibits primary amenorrhea, absence of breast development, and lack of pubertal development, which are hallmark features of Turner's syndrome. Turner syndrome typically presents with streak ovaries leading to estrogen deficiency, resulting in delayed or absent puberty. Given her physical presentation and emotional distress, this diagnosis is highly probable. Confirmatory tests like karyotyping are essential.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome)\nJustification: This condition involves deficient secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to absent or delayed puberty. The patient's lack of breast development and amenorrhea, coupled with normal or delayed growth, could fit this profile. Emotional distress may also stem from the absence of expected pubertal changes. Differentiation from Turner syndrome requires hormone assays and genetic testing.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Central (Hypothalamic or Pituitary) Hypogonadism\nJustification: Hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction can result in reduced secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH), leading to failure of ovarian stimulation, absence of breast development, and amenorrhea. Potential causes include tumors, trauma, or systemic illness. The emotional impact aligns with the lack of pubertal development.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete)\nJustification: Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) have XY chromosomes, no breast development, and primary amenorrhea, despite normal or elevated testosterone levels. They typically present at puberty with XY karyotype and undescended testes. While the patient has not yet been tested, the phenotype could fit, especially if internal testes are present.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Gonadal or Ovarian Dysgenesis (e.g., Premature Ovarian Failure)\nJustification: Premature ovarian failure typically manifests after puberty; however, in some cases, it can cause delayed or absent pubertal changes, leading to amenorrhea and lack of breast development. Although less common as an isolated cause, it remains a differential. Evaluation of ovarian function tests (e.g., FSH, estradiol) is needed.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Turner Syndrome (45,X0): Most probable due to classic presentation of primary amenorrhea, absent breast development, and lack of puberty, consistent with estrogen deficiency from gonadal dysgenesis.\n\n2. Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome): Significant contender considering the absence of pubertal signs with intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis, needing hormone profiling to confirm.\n\n3. Central (Hypothalamic or Pituitary) Hypogonadism: Possible if there is dysfunction in gonadotropin secretion, which accounts for absent secondary sexual characteristics.\n\n4. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Considered if phenotypic female features are present with absent pubertal development despite XY karyotype; internal testing and genetic analysis needed.\n\n5. Gonadal or Ovarian Dysgenesis (Premature Ovarian Failure): Less likely but still possible, particularly if initial investigations show elevated gonadotropins and low estrogen, indicating ovarian failure.\n\nFurther investigations, including karyotyping, hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone), and imaging, are essential to differentiate among these possibilities.",
    "output": "THINKING: To differentiate among these diagnoses, I need to gather detailed hormonal data and internal anatomy information. Confirming chromosomal status and hormone profiles will help distinguish between gonadal dysgenesis, hormonal deficiencies, and androgen insensitivity. Additionally, understanding familial history and any other associated features (such as sensorineural issues or other anomalies) can guide the diagnosis.\n\nANSWER: Has the patient undergone any recent blood tests for hormone levels such as FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone, or other relevant hormones? If not, would you like to proceed with ordering these tests?",

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient has not had recent blood tests for hormone levels. She has had her blood drawn before but is unsure of what was tested. She is interested in possibly ordering hormone tests now to understand why she doesn\u2019t feel like other girls.  \nFull Vignette: The patient reports not having her period, no breast development, and feeling confused, scared, sad, and frustrated about her body's lack of development. She has not started puberty like most of her friends and feels that her body is not developing normally, which she finds confusing and frightening. She feels off or different about her body development and worries about whether something is wrong or if it will ever improve. She has not undergone recent blood tests for hormone levels, though she has had her blood taken before; she is considering having tests for FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone, or other relevant hormones to understand her situation better.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism\nJustification: The patient exhibits primary amenorrhea, absence of breast development, and delayed or absent pubertal signs, suggesting insufficient gonadotropin stimulation. Normal or low FSH and LH levels alongside low estrogen would support this diagnosis, often caused by hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, which impairs the initiation of puberty.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,XO)\nJustification: Patients with Turner syndrome typically have primary amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characteristics due to streak ovaries and gonadal dysgenesis. Although phenotypic features such as short stature or neck webbing are common, their absence does not rule it out. Confirmatory testing with karyotyping would be needed, but clinical suspicion remains high given her presentation.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete)\nJustification: Although these patients typically have undescended testes and a 46,XY karyotype, phenotypic presentation can vary. Complete androgen insensitivity often results in a female external phenotype, no breast development, lack of menstruation, and undetectable or very low androgen levels, despite normal or elevated levels of testosterone. Without karyotype info, this remains a differential, especially if there is a discrepancy between hormone levels and phenotype.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Gonadotropic Deficiency\nJustification: Similar to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, this condition results from deficient secretion or action of gonadotropins, leading to delayed or absent puberty. The key here is understanding whether the hormone profile would show low FSH, LH, and estradiol, indicating central (brain or hypothalamic/pituitary) failure.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Premature Ovarian Failure (Primary Ovarian Insufficiency)\nJustification: Although more typical in older women, some adolescents may present with primary ovarian insufficiency, leading to lack of ovarian hormone production, absence of periods, and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Typically, estradiol levels are low and gonadotropins may be elevated, but in early stages, hormone levels can be variable.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism \u2014 Most consistent with delayed puberty, absence of secondary sexual characteristics, and potential low gonadotropin levels.\n2.

Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome \u2014 Possible if patient has typical female external phenotype but inadequate breast development and hormone profile consistent with insensitivity.\n4. Congenital Gonadotropic Deficiency \u2014 Encompasses a range of central causes of pubertal delay, including hypothalamic or pituitary deficiencies.\n5. Primary Ovarian Insufficiency \u2014 Less common at this age but possible; typically shows low estrogen with variable gonadotropins. Further testing needed to distinguish from other causes.\n\nFurther evaluation with hormone testing (FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone), chromosomal analysis, and possibly imaging studies (pelvic ultrasound to assess ovarian morphology or gonadal presence) will help refine the diagnosis.",

She has not started puberty like most of her friends and feels that her body is not developing normally, which she finds confusing and frightening. She feels off or different about her body development and worries about whether something is wrong or if it will ever improve. She has not undergone recent blood tests for hormone levels, though she has had her blood taken before; she is considering having tests for FSH, LH, estradiol, testosterone, or other relevant hormones to understand her situation better. She recalls an ultrasound of her pelvis but is unsure of the findings.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Premature Ovarian Failure  \nJustification: The patient has primary amenorrhea, no breast development, and reports feeling emotionally distressed about her lack of pubertal development. POI or Premature Ovarian Failure is characterized by the cessation of ovarian function before age 40, leading to estrogen deficiency, delayed or absent puberty, and elevated gonadotropins. The prior pelvis ultrasound might have suggested underlying ovarian or uterine anomalies or other structural issues. Blood tests (if performed) typically show low estrogen with high FSH and LH levels.\n\n2. Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome or Similar)  \nJustification: This condition involves deficiency in GnRH secretion, leading to absent or incomplete puberty and primary amenorrhea. The patient\u2019s lack of breast development, absence of pubertal signs, and emotional distress are consistent. This condition often presents with low gonadotropin and low sex steroid levels, and there's no structural abnormality necessarily evident on ultrasound alone.\n\n3. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) / Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS)  \nJustification: Although patients typically have testicular tissue (concealed in the abdomen), external female phenotype with absent pubic/axillary hair and no breast development can occur. The ultrasound might have revealed undifferentiated gonads or testes. Lack of breast development with normal or undescended testes but external female genitalia may fit. Genetic testing would be helpful to confirm.\n\n4. Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome  \nJustification: MRKH involves congenital absence or hypoplasia of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina, with normal ovarian function and secondary sexual characteristics. The patient\u2019s primary amenorrhea and lack of breast development could suggest this if her gonadal tissue is normal. The ultrasound might have shown absent or rudimentary uterine tissue. She may feel body development is delayed, especially if estrogen levels are low.\n\n5. Turner's Syndrome (45,X) or Other Chromosomal Abnormality  \nJustification: Typical features include primary amenorrhea, short stature, neck webbing, and streak ovaries leading to ovarian failure and absent puberty. The ultrasound may reveal a streak gonad or absent reproductive structures. Patients often have delayed or absent breast development. Emotional distress can be significant, and chromosomal analysis would confirm this diagnosis.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) / Premature Ovarian Failure \u2014 likely causes estrogen deficiency resulting in delayed or absent puberty and amenorrhea; could be confirmed with hormonal testing showing low estrogen and elevated FSH/LH.\n2. Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome) \u2014 characterized by low gonadotropin levels, delayed or absent puberty, and primary amenorrhea; emotional distress aligns with pubertal failure.\n3. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) \u2014 potential due to absence of breast development despite normal or undescended testes and external female genitalia; would require genetic and hormonal confirmation.\n4. Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome \u2014 normal ovarian function and secondary sexual characteristics, but congenital absence of the uterus and upper vagina; ultrasound findings support this possibility.\n5. Turner's Syndrome (45,X) or other chromosomal abnormality \u2014 characterized by ovarian failure and phenotypic features; would need karyotyping to confirm.\n\nFurther investigations, including gonadotropin levels, sex steroid levels, and chromosomal analysis, are essential for definitive diagnosis.",

She recalls an ultrasound of her pelvis but is unsure of the findings. There is no information about prior genetic testing or karyotype analysis.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Constitutional Delay of Puberty (CDP)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea, absence of breast development, and no pubertal changes by her age suggest delayed puberty. Since she feels emotionally distressed and has no secondary sexual characteristics, a common cause in adolescents is constitutional delay rather than a primary gonadal or structural abnormality. Her history of prior blood tests and ultrasound indicates some assessment has been performed but not definitive. The lack of additional concerning features such as systemic illness, dysmorphic features, or other organ system involvement points toward constitutional delay. Family history, growth patterns, and initial labs could support this, but given the current data, CDP remains the most probable diagnosis.\n- The absence of secondary sexual characteristics at her age and emotional distress support this. If her hormonal profile shows low FSH and LH with delayed or prepubertal levels, and growth pattern is consistent, this further supports CDP.\n- Other possibilities like Turner syndrome, androgen insensitivity, or other syndromic causes are less likely without additional features like physical anomalies or genetic abnormalities, but they should still be considered if further testing indicates so.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nConstitutional Delay of Puberty END",

Her feelings of being \"off\" or different, combined with emotional distress, are common in sex development disorders. Although she has not had recent hormone testing, she has undergone ultrasound, which may assist in identifying gonadal presence, and she is considering hormone tests (FSH, LH, estradiol) that would confirm hypergonadotropic hypogonadism if elevated FSH/LH with low estrogen are noted. The absence of secondary sexual characteristics points to an underlying condition affecting gonadal function, such as Turner syndrome, though further testing (like karyotype) would confirm the diagnosis. The clinical picture strongly supports primary ovarian failure rather than other causes of delayed puberty.\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nPrimary Hypogonadism END",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's absence of pubertal development, feelings of distress about her body's changes, and prior assessment with pelvic ultrasound, it is important to confirm whether her gonads are present and functioning. Asking about her prior ultrasound findings will help clarify the likelihood of ovarian dysgenesis or absent ovaries, which are key in diagnosing primary hypogonadism. Understanding her familiarity with the ultrasound results allows us to tailor our next steps toward confirmatory testing and appropriate management.\n\nANSWER: Have you had the opportunity to review your pelvic ultrasound report with your doctor, and if so, do you know what it showed regarding the presence or absence of ovaries or other reproductive structures?",
