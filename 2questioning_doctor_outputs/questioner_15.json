Diagnosis: Congenital Androgen Excess (e.g., Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia)\nJustification: The patient's deeper voice, unexpected muscle changes, and absence of menarche suggest excess androgens possibly due to a congenital condition affecting sex development.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS can present with hormonal imbalances leading to virilization features such as a deeper voice and muscle changes, often accompanied by menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Hypothalamic or Pituitary Dysfunction (e.g., Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism)\nJustification: Delayed or absent menarche along with hormonal alterations could be due to central hormonal deficiency affecting ovarian function and virilization features due to imbalance.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumor or Hyperplasia\nJustification: Excess androgen production from adrenal sources may cause virilization symptoms, including voice deepening and muscle changes while impacting normal menstrual development.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Ovarian Tumor (e.g., Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor)\nJustification: Ovarian tumors producing androgens could lead to virilization signs and menstrual irregularities in adolescents or young women.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting Tumors (e.g., testosterone-secreting tumors)\nJustification: An increase in circulating androgens from neoplastic sources can cause voice deepening, muscle hypertrophy, and disrupted menstruation.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Kallmann Syndrome\nJustification: It involves hypogonadotropic hypogonadism leading to delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea, sometimes with associated olfactory deficits, but less typical for virilization features.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic forms)\nJustification: Although typically presenting earlier, mild forms can manifest with signs of androgen excess like voice deepening and muscle changes, particularly if untreated.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Exogenous Androgen Exposure\nJustification: External intake or use of androgenic substances can cause virilization signs and affect normal menstrual development.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome with Variations in Gonadal Function\nJustification: Although Turner syndrome commonly causes amenorrhea, some variants or mosaic forms may have atypical virilization signs; further chromosomal analysis would be necessary.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Congenital Androgen Excess (e.g., Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia)\n2. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\n3. Hypothalamic or Pituitary Dysfunction (e.g., Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism)\n4. Adrenal Tumor or Hyperplasia\n5. Ovarian Tumor (e.g., Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor)\n6.

Diagnosis: Congenital Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\nJustification: The patient's lack of menstruation, deeper voice, and unexpected muscle changes suggest undervirilization in a genetic female, possibly due to androgen receptor insensitivity resulting in phenotypic female with internal testes and absent uterus.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism\nJustification: A failure of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis could lead to delayed or absent puberty, including lack of menarche and secondary sexual development; hormone levels would guide this.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Although typically associated with hirsutism and irregular cycles, hyperandrogenism can cause voice deepening; muscle changes are less typical but may occur with androgen excess.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Salt-Wasting or Non-Classic)\nJustification: Excess androgen production from adrenal glands could cause virilization features like voice deepening and muscle changes in a phenotypic female, possibly with absent menstruation.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting Tumor (Ovarian or Adrenal)\nJustification: Tumors secreting androgens can lead to rapid virilization, voice deepening, muscle hypertrophy, and primary amenorrhea.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Hypothalamic or Pituitary Tumor (Prolactinoma or Other)\nJustification: Tumors affecting gonadotropin release could impair ovarian development and cause amenorrhea, though virilization is less typical unless hormonal effects are complex.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,X) with Gonadal Dysgenesis\nJustification: Turner syndrome includes lack of secondary sexual development and absent menstruation; however, muscle changes and voice deepening are atypical, making this less likely.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)\nJustification: Features like gynecomastia and hypogonadism are common, but voice deepening and primary amenorrhea are less characteristic, making this less probable.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis or Other Intersex Conditions\nJustification: Variations in gonadal development could explain virilization features alongside amenorrhea.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (Premature Ovarian Failure)\nJustification: Usually presents with menopause-like symptoms; unlikely to cause sudden virilization or voice deepening but considered in differential.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Congenital Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome \u2013 due to virilization symptoms and primary amenorrhea in a genetically female individual.\n2. Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism \u2013 primary failure of pubertal development leading to absence of menarche and secondary sexual features.\n3. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia \u2013 excess androgen production causing virilization in a phenotypic female.\n4. Androgen-secreting Tumor \u2013 neoplastic source of excess androgens leading to rapid virilization features.\n5. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome \u2013 hormonal imbalance causing some virilization signs, though less typical.\n6. Pituitary or hypothalamic tumors \u2013 possibly disrupting hormonal regulation affecting sexual development.\n7. Turner Syndrome with gonadal dysgenesis \u2013 primary gonadal failure and absence of menstruation.\n8. Klinefelter Syndrome \u2013 hypogonadism with some hormonal imbalances; less associated with virilization.\n9.

Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)  \nJustification: CAH can cause excess androgen production, leading to virilization in females, including a deeper voice, ambiguous genitalia, and delayed or absent menstruation.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Tumor (adrenal or ovarian)  \nJustification: An androgen-secreting tumor can produce elevated levels of androgens, resulting in masculinization features such as a deeper voice, muscle changes, and delayed puberty.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Gonadal Dysgenesis (e.g., Turner syndrome mosaicism with virilization)  \nJustification: Some forms can cause atypical development, delayed puberty, and abnormal gonadal function, possibly leading to early virilization.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic form)  \nJustification: The milder, late-onset form can lead to virilizing features without significant salt-wasting, presenting with delayed menstruation and masculinization.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Virilization in Females  \nJustification: Although rare, some females may exhibit virilization due to idiopathic hormonal imbalance or increased androgen sensitivity.\n\n6. Diagnosis: PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)  \nJustification: PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, increased androgens, and some degree of virilization, though it typically does not cause a significantly deeper voice or delayed menarche.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumor (adrenal carcinoma)  \nJustification: Malignant adrenal tumors secreting androgens can cause rapid onset of virilization features such as a deeper voice and muscle changes.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Testicular Feminization Syndrome (Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome)  \nJustification: Individuals have XY chromosomes but develop female phenotype with delayed or absent puberty, but virilization features may be minimal or inconsistent.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Early-Onset Male Pseudohermaphroditism  \nJustification: Conditions resulting from androgen insensitivity or excess exposure to androgens during development can cause physical changes that resemble male features.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Disorders (e.g., gonadotropin deficiency)  \nJustification: Although less likely given virilization, disorders affecting hormone regulation could potentially cause delayed puberty and atypical secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) \u2013 Due to excess androgen production causing virilization and delayed menstruation.  \n2. Androgen-Secreting Tumor \u2013 Such tumors produce testosterone or other androgens leading to masculinization.  \n3. Gonadal Dysgenesis (e.g., Turner syndrome mosaicism) \u2013 Abnormal gonadal development can affect hormone levels and physical development.  \n4. Non-Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia \u2013 Milder form presenting later with virilization signs.  \n5. Idiopathic Virilization \u2013 Unexplained increased androgen effects in females, possibly due to hormonal sensitivity.  \n6. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) \u2013 Common cause of hyperandrogenism but less likely to cause significant deepening of voice or absent menstruation.  \n7. Adrenal Tumor (Carcinoma) \u2013 Malignant mass secreting androgens, causing rapid virilization features.  \n8. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome \u2013 Genetic XY individuals with female phenotype and absent or delayed puberty, typically no virilization, but other features may be present.  \n9. Male Pseudohermaphroditism \u2013 Conditions with prenatal androgen exposure causing atypical secondary sexual characteristics.  \n10. Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Disorders \u2013 Hormonal dysregulation affecting pubertal development, though less directly linked to virilization.",

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient reports that her voice has become deeper over the past year, she has experienced unexpected muscle changes, she has not yet started her period, and she feels that her development makes her look more like a boy than a girl.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Salt-Wasting or Non-Classic)\nJustification: The patient exhibits signs of virilization, such as a deepening voice, increased muscle mass, and a more masculine appearance relative to her age and sex, without having commenced menarche. These features suggest excess androgen exposure. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, particularly 21-hydroxylase deficiency, can cause adrenal overproduction of androgens in genetic females, leading to virilization. Absence of menstruation (primary amenorrhea) further supports disrupted sexual development, often seen in this condition.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Tumor of Ovarian or Adrenal Origin\nJustification: The sudden or progressive development of virilizing features, such as a deeper voice, increased muscle mass, and delayed menarche, can sometimes result from androgen-secreting tumors. These tumors produce excess androgens, leading to masculinization. Given the recent change and significant virilization in a patient without prior signs of hormonal imbalance, this diagnosis must be considered.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) \u2013 Classic Presentation Less Likely but Possible\nJustification: While PCOS typically presents with hyperandrogenism, irregular menses, and polycystic ovarian morphology, the degree of virilization and absence of menarche in this patient makes this less likely initially. However, early or severe forms can sometimes cause significant virilization, especially if other underlying hormonal dysregulation exists. Still, her presentation leans more toward congenital or tumor-related causes.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Androgen-Producing Adrenal or Ovarian Tumor (Benign or Malignant)\nJustification: Similar to diagnosis 2, but emphasizing that both benign and malignant tumors can produce excess androgens leading to virilization. The patient's rapid or progressive virilization warrants investigation into an androgen-producing neoplasm.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Gonadal Dysgenesis with Partial or Complete Androgen Excess\nJustification: Conditions like Turner syndrome variants with Y-chromosome material or Swyer syndrome may feature gonadal dysgenesis presenting with primary amenorrhea and ambiguous or masculinized features. However, these conditions often have additional features like streak gonads and are less directly associated with excess androgen production unless a dysgenic gonad produces hormones. Still, they remain part of differential considerations, particularly if supported by genetic testing.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications as above:\n1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Salt-Wasting or Non-Classic)\n2. Androgen-Secreting Ovarian or Adrenal Tumor\n3. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) \u2013 Less likely but possible\n4. Androgen-Producing Gonadal or Adrenal Tumor (Benign or Malignant)\n5. Gonadal Dysgenesis with Androgen Excess (e.g., Turner variant with Y-chromosome material)",
    "output": "THINKING: To better differentiate among these possibilities, I need to understand more about her overall hormonal profile, the onset and progression of her virilization signs, and any associated features that might point toward one diagnosis over another. Specifically, knowing whether she has any other signs of hormonal imbalance, her family history, or previous medical issues could help clarify whether this is congenital, acquired tumor-related, or related to gonadal dysgenesis.\n\nANSWER: Has she experienced any other symptoms such as hair loss, acne, or changes in skin texture? Additionally, are there any concerns or history of rapid growth spurts, early pubertal signs, or other systemic symptoms?",

Diagnosis: Androgen Excess (e.g., Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia or Androgen-Secreting Tumor)\nJustification: The patient's deepening of the voice, facial hair growth, oily skin, and body changes consistent with masculinization suggest excess androgen levels. The absence of menstruation indicates delayed or absent puberty, which can occur in cases of androgen excess, especially congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is often evident early in life but can present or persist into adolescence if untreated or overlooked.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Features such as oily skin, hirsutism, and delayed puberty could be consistent with PCOS, which is characterized by hyperandrogenism. However, the lack of menarche and absence of other typical PCOS signs like polycystic ovaries at this age make it less likely initially, but still a differential to consider.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen-Producing Tumor (Adrenal or Ovarian)\nJustification: A unilateral androgen-producing tumor can cause rapid virilization signs, including facial hair, deepening voice, and androgenic skin changes. The hormonal production is often significant enough to cause observable physical changes at a relatively young age.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Precocious or Delayed Puberty due to Endocrinopathies\nJustification: The delayed onset of puberty, combined with signs of virilization, suggests possible underlying endocrine dysfunction. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia can present with virilization and delayed puberty without classic menarche, particularly in milder forms or if diagnosed late.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome (less likely based on current features)\nJustification: Although some features like oily skin and skin texture change can overlap with Cushing's syndrome, virilization is less prominent in Cushing's. The absence of other classic features such as weight gain, purple striae, or hypertension makes this less probable but worth considering.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), particularly non-classic or late-onset forms, due to signs of virilization and lack of menstruation.\n2. Androgen-secreting Adrenal or Ovarian Tumor, because of rapid development of masculine features and hormonal excess.\n3. Other causes of hyperandrogenism such as idiopathic or due to premature adrenarche (though less likely given the degree of virilization).\n4. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), as a differential for hyperandrogenism, though less likely given the delayed puberty and absence of menarche.\n5. Endocrinopathies like Cushing's syndrome, although features are less consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nFurther evaluation with hormonal testing (e.g., serum androgens, 17-hydroxyprogesterone), imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing are advised to confirm the diagnosis.",

Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), possibly 21-hydroxylase deficiency  \nJustification: The patient's virilization symptoms, including a deeper voice, facial hair, and oily skin, suggest androgen excess. The absence of menarche and the presence of features more typical of male development point toward a disorder of steroidogenesis. CAH is a common cause of congenital androgen overproduction in females, often presenting with adrenal virilization and delayed or absent puberty due to cortisol synthesis impairment. The skin changes and muscle development support androgen excess as the underlying cause.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Early-Onset Androgen Excess Due to Ovarian or Adrenal Tumor  \nJustification: The rapid onset of virilization signs, including voice deepening, hirsutism, and skin changes, could result from an androgen-producing tumor. Although less common at her age without other systemic symptoms, tumors such as androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumors can cause sudden virilization, especially if the symptoms have developed rapidly over the past year.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Precocious Puberty with Androgenic Features (Particularly 'Testosterone-secreting' tumor or hyperandrogenism)  \nJustification: While she has not yet experienced menarche, the increase in androgen features raises suspicion for early or abnormal pubertal development. Premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis with excessive androgen production, either from the ovaries or peripheral sources, could cause virilization signs.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  \nJustification: PCOS commonly presents with hyperandrogenism, oily skin, and hirsutism, but it typically appears after menarche and develops gradually. It is less likely given the extensive virilization, especially if the onset is rapid and there is significant voice deepening and muscle changes, which suggest a more severe or different pathology.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Exposure to Androgens or External Sources of Androgens  \nJustification: Prospects of exogenous exposure (e.g., supplements, medications, or environmental sources) that contains androgens could explain the virilization signs. However, in a prepubertal girl, endogenous causes are more common causes of such symptoms; exposure would be rare but should be considered.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), especially 21-hydroxylase deficiency, due to virilization features and delayed puberty.  \n2. Androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumor causing rapid virilization and deepening of voice.  \n3. Early or abnormal activation of the HPG axis leading to hyperandrogenism, potentially from a tumor or hyperplasia.  \n4. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), presenting with signs of hyperandrogenism, though less likely with rapid onset and severe features.  \n5. External or environmental androgen exposure causing virilization features.  \n\nFurther work-up with hormonal assays (including serum testosterone, DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogesterone), imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to clarify the exact cause.",

The absence of menstruation is also consistent with androgen excess. The progression over roughly a year suggests an endogenous hormone imbalance rather than a transient or external cause. These features are characteristic of virilizing CAH, which results from enzymatic defects (most commonly 21-hydroxylase deficiency) causing excess androgen production from the adrenal glands. The lack of reported growth delay and the presence of other signs of androgen excess support this diagnosis. \n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\n- No further clarification needed: Yes\n\nANSWER:\nCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), virilizing form END",
