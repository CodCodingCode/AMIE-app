    "input": "A 32-year-old woman in the immediate postpartum period reports ongoing heavy bleeding characterized by large clots that has persisted since delivery. She describes feeling dizzy, weak, and experiencing blurred vision, circumstances suggestive of significant blood loss and possible anemia. She reports concern and fear regarding her condition. Objective assessment is needed to determine the actual volume of bleeding, signs of hypovolemia or anemia, and to explore additional systemic symptoms. Further evaluation is warranted to assess the severity of hemorrhage and associated risks.1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: Most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage presenting with heavy bleeding and large clots; occurs due to failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery, leading to continued bleeding.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Persistent bleeding since delivery with large clots may suggest incomplete expulsion of placenta, causing ongoing bleeding and risk of secondary postpartum hemorrhage.\n3. Diagnosis: Genital trauma (lacerations, episiotomy)\nJustification: Vaginal or cervical lacerations can cause ongoing bleeding; may be associated with large clots and unstable recovery post-delivery.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., DIC or thrombocytopenia)\nJustification: Bleeding that is disproportionate or persists despite uterine contraction suggests possible bleeding disorder; DIC can occur postpartum due to obstetric complications.\n5. Diagnosis: Placental accreta/increta/percreta\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence leading to excessive bleeding; more common in women with prior cesarean or uterine surgeries but still a possibility post-delivery.\n6. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the placental site\nJustification: Delayed involution of the uterus leading to continued bleeding and hematoma formation at the placental site.\n7. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Rare but life-threatening; usually associated with abnormal labor or prior uterine surgery, presenting with bleeding, abdominal pain, and signs of hypovolemia.\n8. Diagnosis: Coagulopathies unrelated to pregnancy (e.g., hemophilia)\nJustification: Less likely without prior history or bleeding diathesis, but should be considered if bleeding persists despite uterotonics and no obvious obstetric cause.\n9. Diagnosis: Endometrial or cervical neoplasm\nJustification: Rare in postpartum setting; less likely without prior history or abnormal findings, but important to consider in recurrent or atypical bleeding.\n10. Diagnosis: Uterine inversion\nJustification: Rare complication causing massive bleeding and shock; usually presents acutely during or immediately after delivery with characteristic signs, but included as less likely due to absence of specific signs.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: She employs mostly specific language regarding her symptoms but with some vagueness (\"like with big clots\"), possibly to downplay severity. Her emotional expression (\"really scared\") adds sincerity but is succinct. The tone remains neutral and straightforward.\n- Information flow: The patient provides organized, direct disclosures, focusing on relevant facts without tangential details. She is forthcoming with major symptoms but avoids overelaborating, indicating a preference for simplicity and clarity.\n- Response style: Her responses are concise and earnest, not overly elaborate but covering key points. She answers directly, showing a clear understanding of her situation.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No explicit evidence; she reports all major issues candidly. Her minimal language suggests slight tendency to downplay but not conceal critical information.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of \"like\" when describing bleeding could reflect a subtle downplaying, but overall, she conveys significant concern. No overt minimization is apparent.\n- Amplification patterns: She does not seem to exaggerate; her descriptions appear proportional to her distress and physical state.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; she openly discusses her postpartum symptoms and fear.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion or memory lapse; her timeline appears consistent.\n- Family influence: No indication of family influence affecting her responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild minimization possibly to avoid seeming overly dramatic, but mostly honest reporting.\n- Severity: Mild; her communication is largely reliable, with slight tendency to understate details.\n- Areas most affected: Bleeding description and emotional expression might be subtly understated, but key symptoms are present and credible.\n- Reliability: Generally trustworthy; her self-reporting seems accurate with slight potential underreporting of specifics.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Slight details about the amount and rate of bleeding or emotional impact might be understated, which could understate the true danger level.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of bleeding and the emotional impact might be greater than conveyed. Her use of vague language suggests possible underreporting of the extent of blood loss.\n- Concerns probably amplified: She appears genuinely frightened, so her concern is valid and not likely exaggerated.\n- True timeline: Her description aligns with typical postpartum bleeding onset, so her timeline appears accurate; no evidence suggests distortion here.",

    "input": "A 32-year-old woman in the immediate postpartum period reports persistent heavy bleeding characterized by large clots since delivery. She describes experiencing systemic symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, and blurred vision, which suggest significant blood loss and potential anemia. While her account indicates ongoing postpartum hemorrhage, precise quantification of bleeding and vital sign assessment are necessary to evaluate severity. Further clinical examination is required to determine signs of hypovolemia, estimate blood loss volume, and assess for other systemic symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage characterized by inadequate uterine muscle contraction leading to heavy bleeding; symptoms align with ongoing blood loss, and large clots are typical.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Persistence of bleeding and large clots post-delivery may suggest retained placental fragments preventing uterine contraction and increasing bleeding risk.\n3. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervical lacerations\nJustification: Persistent heavy bleeding with large clots could be due to trauma-related vascular lacerations, especially if bleeding continues despite uterine tone.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation, inborn bleeding disorder)\nJustification: Systemic symptoms and ongoing bleeding may be exacerbated by a bleeding disorder, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone or trauma.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta spectrum disorder\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence leading to bleeding; elevated risk in cases with previous cesarean or uterine surgery, although less common acutely postpartum.\n6. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Severe bleeding and systemic symptoms could suggest uterine rupture, especially if obstetric history supports risk factors, though less common in this context without prior surgical history.\n7. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the placental site\nJustification: Delayed involution leading to continued bleeding; typically presents days postpartum but can be in early postpartum as well.\n8. Diagnosis: Endometrial or uterine infection (endometritis)\nJustification: Less likely acutely unless associated with signs of infection such as fever, but systemic symptoms warrant keeping it in differential.\n9. Diagnosis: Hematologic disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia)\nJustification: Underlying platelet deficiency or clotting disorder could cause bleeding; relevant if systemic bleeding out of proportion.\n10. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy secondary to preexisting conditions (e.g., liver disease)\nJustification: Less likely without other systemic signs; still an important \"can't miss\" diagnosis if suspected, but less probable given the primary postpartum setting.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses direct, emotional language to describe distress, with some vague descriptors like \"a lot\" and \"big clots.\" No minimization or exaggeration is prominent.\n- Information flow: Responses are organized and seem forthcoming; the patient offers relevant details without significant prompting.\n- Response style: Typically elaborative enough to convey distress and factual data without being overly verbose or tangential.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; responses are complete and relevant.\n- Minimization behaviors: Lack of minimization, as the patient emphasizes the severity and persistence of bleeding.\n- Amplification patterns: No signs of exaggeration; the distress appears proportionate to symptoms.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; responses suggest openness.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear confusion; timeline appears consistent.\n- Family influence: Not indicated; responses are self-contained.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: None significantly apparent; communication appears open and credible.\n- Severity: Mild bias if any, mainly due to lack of detailed quantitative data.\n- Areas most affected: Precise measurement of bleeding volume/rate, which isn't detailed.\n- Reliability: Moderate to high; responses are consistent and emotionally congruent.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact quantities and rates of bleeding, prior episodes, or baseline health status.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Not significantly minimized; patient describes symptoms candidly.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Worry appears genuine but not exaggerated.\n- True timeline: Likely accurate but generalized; more specific timing data could enhance assessment.\nOverall, the patient communicates openly, with minimal biases affecting her reporting.

Chief complaint: Heavy postpartum bleeding with large clots, associated with systemic symptoms suggestive of hypovolemia. Present illness: The patient reports ongoing postpartum bleeding since delivery, characterized by substantial blood loss with large clots and continuous flow. She describes feeling dizzy, weak, and close to fainting, indicating possible hypovolemia. These symptoms are likely real but may be somewhat exaggerated due to emotional distress but suggest a significant hemorrhagic event. She reports soaking through pads quickly, consistent with heavy bleeding, but lacks specific measurement or quantification of blood loss. She does not mention other systemic signs such as pallor, tachycardia, or orthostatic changes, which are important to assess for severity.1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: Most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage; characterized by failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery, leading to heavy bleeding and large clots, with systemic symptoms of hypovolemia.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Can cause ongoing bleeding due to incomplete placental separation; presents with heavy bleeding, large clots, and persistent flow unresponsive to initial interventions.\n3. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta/increta/percreta\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence/invasion can cause excessive bleeding postpartum; risk factors include previous cesarean and placental abnormalities, leading to heavy bleeding and difficulty in placental separation.\n4. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Rare postpartum emergency presenting with heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, and systemic signs; may be associated with prior uterine surgery, but still a vital differential.\n5. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation - DIC)\nJustification: Blood dyscrasia causing bleeding tendency; systemic symptoms and ongoing bleeding may suggest a bleeding disorder, especially if bleeding persists despite uterine tone.\n6. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervical trauma\nJustification: Injury during delivery can lead to persistent bleeding; associated with large clots and ongoing hemorrhage despite uterine contraction.\n7. Diagnosis: Placental site bleeding (e.g.,\nDiffuse postpartum hemorrhage from placental bed)\nJustification: Potential source of bleeding if placental attachment is abnormal or bleeding originates from the uterine wall, leading to ongoing blood loss.\n8. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the placental site\nJustification: Delayed involution causes continued bleeding; less common but important to consider in prolonged postpartum hemorrhage.\n9. Diagnosis: Hematological disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia)\nJustification: Bleeding tendency from low platelet count or clotting factor deficiencies; systemic symptoms may overlap with hemorrhage but less likely without prior history.\n10. Diagnosis: Uterine inversion\nJustification: Rare postpartum emergency characterized by protrusion of the fundus, leading to hemorrhage and shock; less likely unless specific signs are present, but must be considered due to severity.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: She uses specific, visceral descriptions (\"big clots,\" \"soaking through the pad,\" \"a lot of blood\") and emotional qualifiers (\"really scared,\" \"about to faint\"), indicating honest, emotionally charged reporting.

    "input": "Patient demographics: 32-year-old female, postpartum, recent delivery.\nChief complaint: Heavy postpartum bleeding with large clots and continuous flow, with associated dizziness and near-fainting episodes.\nPresent illness: The patient reports ongoing postpartum bleeding since delivery, characterized by substantial blood loss with large clots and continuous flow. She experiences episodes of dizziness and feelings that she may faint, especially upon sitting or standing. She reports soaking through multiple pads quickly but does not specify exact quantities or timing. She describes feeling weak and dizzy, particularly with positional changes, but has not provided measurements of blood loss or objective vital signs. No mention of pallor, tachycardia, or other physical findings has been provided yet. Her emotional distress suggests real concern, but her subjective reporting may overstate the severity of her bleeding. The timeline indicates persistent bleeding since recent delivery, with systemic symptoms coinciding with ongoing hemorrhage but unconfirmed by objective data.\nAssociated symptoms: Dizziness, weakness, possible near-fainting episodes with positional changes; no other systemic signs reported. Confidence in these symptoms is high, but their severity is subject to bias.\nConfidence assessment:\n- High confidence: The patient is postpartum and experiencing ongoing bleeding and systemic symptoms consistent with anemia or hypovolemia.\n- Medium confidence: The perceived severity of bleeding and systemic symptoms may be overestimated due to emotional distress and communication pattern.\n- Low confidence: Exact quantification of blood loss, vital signs, and physical findings at this time.\n- Missing information: Precise number of soaked pads, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), physical examination findings (pale conjunctiva, orthostatic changes), and laboratory data (hemoglobin, hematocrit).1. Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage due to Uterine Atony\nJustification: The most common cause of heavy postpartum bleeding with large clots and continuous flow in the immediate postpartum period. The persistent bleeding, large clots, and systemic symptoms of dizziness and near-fainting strongly suggest ongoing blood loss from uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract effectively after delivery. The lack of specific mention of trauma or placental abnormalities further supports this as the primary diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception\nJustification: Persistent bleeding with large clots could also indicate retained placental tissue or membranes preventing uterine contraction and promoting continued bleeding. If bleeding does not reduce with uterotonics, retained products become highly probable, especially in the context of ongoing postpartum hemorrhage. This diagnosis is also important to consider given the ongoing nature of bleeding beyond immediate delivery.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, uterine rupture can cause significant postpartum bleeding and systemic symptoms. It is more probable if there were risk factors such as previous cesarean, uterine scar, or labor complications, which are not mentioned. Still, severe hemorrhage with systemic symptoms warrants keeping this on the differential until more findings are available.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy\nJustification: Coagulopathies can cause postpartum bleeding, especially if there is pre-existing bleeding disorder or conditions like placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism, which are not specified here. Given the lack of other features suggestive of coagulopathy (easy bruising, petechiae), it's a less likely primary cause but still relevant to consider in ongoing hemorrhage.\n5. Diagnosis: Bleeding due to Vaginal or Cesarean Surgical Site Complication\nJustification: Bleeding from surgical sites can cause postpartum hemorrhage, but the description of large clots and continuous flow points more toward uterine source bleeding. Still, without explicit physical findings, this remains a secondary consideration.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses emotional and somewhat vague language, such as \"a lot,\" \"more and more,\" and \"feels like,\" which indicate reliance on internal emotional states rather than clinical specifics.\n- Information flow: Responses are generally forthcoming but lack specific details like exact number of soaked pads or precise timing, suggesting discomfort or uncertainty about reporting quantitative data.\n- Response style: She tends toward elaboration when describing how she's feeling (\"feeling dizzy,\" \"about to faint\") but is less precise about measurable quantities, resulting in a mix of emotional openness and vagueness.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No deliberate withholding is evident; however, the vagueness in quantifying blood loss hints at possible discomfort with the severity or difficulty in assessing exact figures.\n- Minimization behaviors: The term \"pretty much\" and use of non-specific reflections (\"a lot,\" \"keeping bleeding more and more\") suggest mild minimization or at least interpretative reporting rather than precise measurement.\n- Amplification patterns: The emotional descriptors (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed,\" \"about to faint\") emphasize distress but align with her physical symptoms, indicating genuine concern rather than exaggeration.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs are evident; responses seem open and focused on her symptoms.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness could point to discomfort or stress rather than actual confusion.\n- Family influence: Not observed; responses are individually focused.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild minimization or vague reporting bias, particularly regarding the quantification of blood loss.\n- Severity: Moderate; emotional distress is high, but lack of specific data may affect clinical assessment accuracy.\n- Areas most affected: Blood loss quantification and objective evaluation of her hemodynamic state, which are crucial for management but underreported in precise terms.\n- Reliability: Moderate; her responses reflect real distress but are limited in clinical specificity, requiring caution and supplementary assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact blood loss volume, vital signs, and objective measures of hemodynamic stability.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Underestimation of blood loss severity, given only vague descriptions, potentially delaying urgent interventions.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress and feeling faint are real, but her perception may exaggerate or underreport bleeding extent.\n- True timeline: Bleeding and symptoms likely escalate more rapidly and severely than indicated; her report captures distress but not the full physiological picture.",

    "input": "Patient demographics include a 32-year-old female who recently delivered. The primary concern is ongoing postpartum bleeding characterized by heavy flow and large blood clots. She reports feeling dizzy, weak, and nearly fainting with positional changes, suggesting systemic effects potentially related to ongoing hemorrhage. The patient indicates soaking through multiple pads in a short period, but lacks precise quantification. She has not measured vital signs or physical signs such as pallor or tachycardia. Her systemic symptoms and bleeding have persisted since delivery, though the severity may be exaggerated by emotional distress. Objective physical examination and vital signs are currently unavailable but are necessary to evaluate her hemodynamic status further.1. Diagnosis: Uterine Atony\nJustification: Postpartum bleeding with heavy flow and large clots suggests uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. It explains persistent bleeding and inability of the uterus to contract effectively. Systemic symptoms like dizziness and weakness result from hypovolemia secondary to ongoing blood loss.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Placental Tissue\nJustification: The ongoing bleeding with large clots also raises suspicion for retained products of conception, which prevent uterine contraction and cause continuous bleeding. Her recent delivery aligns with this diagnosis, which can cause significant bleeding if not expelled.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, uterine rupture is a critical postpartum complication, especially shortly after delivery, causing heavy bleeding. The systemic symptoms and heavy hemorrhage could indicate uterine rupture, especially if bleeding rapidly progresses or if fetal remnants are suspected, though no fetal or intra-abdominal signs are reported.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)\nJustification: Excessive bleeding and systemic symptoms might suggest a bleeding disorder such as DIC, especially if initial causes are backing up. However, no prior signs of coagulopathy are detailed, making this less immediate but still possible.\n5. Diagnosis: Placental Site Bleeding/Implantation Site Bleeding\nJustification: Postpartum bleeding at the site of placental attachment can cause ongoing bleeding, especially in cases of abnormal placental adherence (increta, percreta). Yet, without specific risk factors or placental invasion noted, this remains a secondary consideration.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotionally charged language.

    "input": "Patient is a 32-year-old female presenting with concern for ongoing postpartum bleeding since delivery. She reports heavy bleeding with large blood clots and soaking through multiple pads rapidly. She experiences dizziness, weakness, blurry vision, and reports feeling faint, particularly with positional changes. She has not checked vital signs herself and declines measurements at presentation. Physical examination findings are unavailable, but her symptoms suggest possible hypovolemia. Her communication indicates emotional distress, which may amplify her perceived severity of symptoms, though her descriptions point toward significant postpartum hemorrhage requiring urgent evaluation and management. Further objective data collection is necessary to confirm her clinical status.1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: The heavy bleeding with large clots and rapid saturation of pads is classic for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. The absence of mention of surgical or manual intervention suggests the uterus may be relaxed and unable to contract effectively, leading to continued bleeding. Dizziness and weakness are consistent with hypovolemia caused by ongoing hemorrhage, making uterine atony the most probable cause.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placenta or placental tissue\nJustification: Large blood clots and ongoing bleeding may stem from retained placental fragments preventing uterine contraction and expelling blood efficiently. The postpartum period is highly suggestive of this diagnosis, especially if the bleeding is persistent despite efforts to contract the uterus. It fits with the clinical pattern of continued bleeding and is a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage.\n3. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation or primary bleeding disorder)\nJustification: Severe postpartum bleeding and large clots could be exacerbated by an underlying bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone or palpable trauma. Although not explicitly indicated, the potential for coagulopathy must be considered if bleeding persists despite initial management, and it explains the severity of hemorrhage.\n4. Diagnosis: Genital lacerations or cervical tears\nJustification: Continuous heavy bleeding with blood clots, especially during or after delivery, can result from lacerations or tears in the cervix or vagina. Although physical findings are unavailable, this diagnosis is included given the postpartum bleeding context, particularly if bleeding exceeds what uterine atony alone can explain. It remains a differential, especially if bleeding does not respond to uterotonics.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta spectrum (abnormal placental attachment)\nJustification: Placenta accreta or increta may cause abnormal postpartum bleeding due to incomplete separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. Although less immediately common than the others, it should be considered if bleeding persists and is not controlled after initial measures, especially in cases of previous uterine surgery or placenta previa, which are not specified but are relevant in postpartum hemorrhage cases.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"a few pads\" and \"really dizzy,\" which offer limited objective clarity. Her use of phrases like \"just feel\" and \"think\" reflect a tendency towards downplaying and uncertainty.\n- Information flow: She appears reluctant to provide detailed, measurable information about her physical state, often deferring to feelings rather than specific data. Her additional emotional disclosures suggest she increases her distress to communicate urgency, but overall, her disclosures are somewhat scattered and emotionally driven.\n- Response style: Her responses are concise but laden with emotional content. She tends to elaborate on her feelings rather than on quantifiable symptoms, indicating a pattern of expressing emotional distress as a primary means of conveying severity.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Her avoidance of specific data such as blood loss volume, blood pressure readings, or pulse measurements suggests withholding critical clinical information.\n- Minimization behaviors: She downplays her blood loss (\"a few pads\") despite clinical significance, and her focus on feeling faint may mask the true extent of hypovolemia.\n- Amplification patterns: While some responses overstate her distress (\"really scared and overwhelmed\"), this likely reflects emotional expression rather than exaggeration of clinical severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her reluctance to specify quantities or to check vital signs may reflect discomfort with medical details or feelings of helplessness.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, but her vague language about blood loss and symptoms could indicate some difficulty in recalling or assessing her situation accurately.\n- Family influence: Not indicated explicitly, but her emotional tone may be influenced by concern for her baby's or her own health, possibly amplifying her distress.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization with emotional amplification\u2014she minimizes measurable symptoms (blood loss) but overstates distress, which is typical in overwhelmed patients.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014she shows signs of distress and potential underreporting but maintains some awareness of symptoms, though lacks precise data.\n- Areas most affected: Quantitative symptom data (blood loss volume, vitals) are most biased; her subjective distress is likely accurate but emotional responses could exaggerate perceived severity.\n- Reliability: Moderate, given her evasiveness about specific data but genuine distress expressed; clinical data (e.g., vitals) would be needed for accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Exact blood loss measurements, blood pressure, and heart rate are probably underestimated or unreported, which are critical for hemodynamic assessment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of blood loss and hypovolemia may be worse than she indicates.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional distress might lead her to overemphasize fears of passing out, but this could be a sign of underlying physiological instability.\n- True timeline: The onset of symptoms appears rapid, aligning with her description of sudden heavy bleeding and weakness; her expressed fears suggest the severity may be higher than communicated.",
