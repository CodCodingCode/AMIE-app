    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: Rapid onset of redness, tearing, and swelling following activity suggests infectious conjunctivitis, which is common in young individuals and often contagious.  2. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: Similar symptoms to bacterial conjunctivitis but often with watery discharge; recent activity and quick onset support this, also common in young, active individuals.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness could be allergy-related, especially if patient has a history of allergies; however, less likely given recent activity and absence of itching data.  4. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Trauma from playing soccer could cause superficial corneal injury, leading to redness, tearing, and swelling; often associated with discomfort and foreign body sensation.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Rapid swelling, redness, and recent activity raise concern for infectious process involving orbital tissues, especially if associated with pain, proptosis, fever; a medical emergency if present.  6. Diagnosis: Eyelid Hemorrhage (Hematoma) Justification: Trauma can cause eyelid swelling and redness; swelling localized to eyelid with no mention of pain or systemic symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less common acutely in this scenario but can cause redness and tearing; typically associated with pain and photophobia, which are not specified.  8. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Severe eye redness and swelling could suggest this, but usually associated with deep eye pain and systemic autoimmune disease, not indicated here.  9. Diagnosis: Chalazion or Hordeolum Justification: Swelling localized to eyelid area, common post-trauma or infection, but less likely given the rapid onset and general redness/swelling.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign Body in Eye Justification: Eye trauma during activity can deposit foreign objects, causing irritation, redness, tearing; would need examination but feasible.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional, somewhat vague language (\u201creally low,\u201d \u201cfeel so heavy,\u201d \u201ctrapped in a fog\u201d), which conveys distress but may also serve to soften or mask the full extent of severity. Their descriptions are moderate in detail, balancing honesty with possible emotional filtering. - Information flow: The patient generally provides organized but emotionally charged descriptions, volunteering information about their symptoms. There is some hesitation, especially when discussing distressing topics like hallucinations, suggesting ambivalence or discomfort. - Response style: Responses are somewhat elaborated when describing symptoms, but they tend to be hesitant and rambling, indicating a soft-spoken, anxious demeanor. They avoid detailed elaboration on feelings unless prompted, consistent with their personality traits.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitation before elaborating on feelings and hallucinations point to some reluctance, possibly due to shame or fear of judgment, but no overt withholding. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the impact (\u201creally low,\u201d \u201cjust feeling really low\u201d) may lead to underestimating severity, potentially obscuring the true level of impairment. - Amplification patterns: The emphasis on worsening (\u201cgetting worse,\u201d \u201cworried\u201d) and emotional distress may amplify perceived severity, driven by anxiety and fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Briefly looking away when discussing hallucinations suggests some discomfort or shame about these symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of actual disorganization; responses are clear and consistent, indicating intact cognition. - Family influence: Mention of family history is straightforward; no evident external influence or pressure on responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be emotional amplification\u2014heightened anxiety leading to exaggerated perception of symptoms\u2019 severity. There\u2019s also mild minimization regarding functional detail. - Severity: Moderate because the patient is genuinely distressed and reporting significant symptoms, though some emotional exaggeration may be present. - Areas most affected: Severity of hallucinations and emotional distress are most biased, potentially overemphasized due to anxiety; actual functional impairment may be somewhat less extreme. - Reliability: Self-report is generally trustworthy but influenced by anxiety-driven amplification; some caution needed in interpreting subjective distress level.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not fully disclose the intensity or frequency of hallucinations or the impact on daily functioning, possibly due to shame or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of hallucinations and mood symptoms could be greater than expressed, especially if the patient tries to appear more functional or less distressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about deterioration and losing control appears heightened, which might lead to over-prioritizing crisis responses that aren't fully warranted or missing under-the-radar risks like passive suicidal ideation. - True timeline: The reported progression seems plausible; emotional reactions may be exaggerated, but overall timeline is consistent.",
    "output": "THINKING: Considering the patient's emotional and somewhat vague descriptions, I want to encourage them to elaborate without feeling judged or overwhelmed. Understanding how their symptoms are affecting their daily life and their perception of these experiences can help clarify the severity and context. Additionally, exploring the timeline and what they have noticed over time can reveal patterns or triggers. Given their hesitations, a gentle, open-ended question that invites storytelling while being sensitive to their emotional state would be most helpful at this stage.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about how often and how intensely the hallucinations occur, their impact on daily functioning, and any patterns or triggers. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the patient's subjective experience and gather more info about mood, hallucination nature, and distress level to distinguish between potential psychiatric, neurological, or substance-related causes. - Patient factors: The patient's hesitancy and emotional tone suggest that a soft, non-confrontational question would facilitate openness, foster rapport, and reduce discomfort. - Interview phase goals: To gather rich, contextualized narratives that reveal the scope and impact of symptoms and help form a broad differential diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, narrative-focused to allow patient to describe their experience freely. - Information target: Symptom characteristics, onset, progression, emotional impact, and functional effects. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language that normalizes sharing. - Expected value: This will allow the patient to express their story in their own words, which can reveal subtle nuances and emotional factors influencing their presentation.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling overall, especially with regard to these experiences you mentioned?

    "input": "The patient is a mid-30s individual presenting with a history of persistent low mood, fatigue, and auditory hallucinations occurring multiple times weekly over approximately three weeks. They describe feelings of heaviness, mental fog, and hopelessness, yet their reporting suggests possible emotional amplification and withholding of specific symptom details such as hallucination content, sleep, appetite, and safety concerns. The symptoms are likely indicative of a moderate depressive episode with psychotic features, although severity may be overstated due to emotional distress. Further targeted assessment is required to clarify symptom content, impact, and safety, with attention to potential underreporting or embellishment influenced by the patient's emotional state.1. Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder with psychotic features Justification: Persistent low mood, fatigue, hopelessness, and auditory hallucinations over three weeks align with a depressive episode with psychotic features. Such symptoms are common in moderate to severe depression and typically involve hallucinations congruent with depressive themes.  2. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective disorder, depressive type Justification: The combination of mood symptoms and hallucinations suggests a mood disorder with psychotic features, but if mood episodes are prominent and persist independently, schizoaffective disorder remains a differential, though less likely given the current info.  3. Diagnosis: Brief psychotic disorder Justification: Acute emergence of hallucinations and mood symptoms over three weeks could be consistent, but duration exceeds the typical 1-month threshold, making this less likely.  4. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: Hallucinations and mood symptoms might suggest schizophrenia, but the relatively brief duration (3 weeks) and mood predominance favor a mood disorder with psychotic features.  5. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychotic disorder Justification: No information on substance use; if present, substances could cause hallucinations, but without details, less likely.  6. Diagnosis: Bipolar disorder, depressive episode Justification: Features of depression with psychosis could be part of bipolar depression if mood episodes fluctuate; however, no evidence of mania/hypomania is provided.  7. Diagnosis: Postpartum psychosis Justification: Unlikely, given the patient's age and no mention of recent childbirth.  8. Diagnosis: Delusional disorder Justification: Persistent hallucinations are less characteristic; this disorder primarily involves non-bizarre delusions, so less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Organic brain disorder (e.g., neurological or metabolic) Justification: No neurological signs or symptoms provided; thus, less probable without further neurological findings.  10. Diagnosis: Anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder Justification: Mood and fatigue could be associated, but hallucinations are atypical in these conditions; thus, the primary presentation suggests a psychotic mood disorder over primary anxiety.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient predominantly uses vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"really heavy,\" \"feels so hopeless,\" and \"like I can\u2019t get out of this fog.\" This suggests difficulty articulating precise experiences and an inclination to communicate distress more emotionally than clinically. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat scattered and hesitant, with the patient waiting for questions but then elaborating in a rambling manner. This shows an initial reluctance or discomfort, then a tendency to over-express distress once engaged. - Response style: The patient tends to answer in a lengthy, tangential manner, often focusing on feelings rather than specific details, indicating emotional overwhelm and difficulty with precise communication.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The vagueness about hallucinations and the lack of detailed descriptions about the voices suggest deliberate or unconscious withholding, possibly to avoid stigma or acknowledging the full extent of symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: The use of \"dunno\" and \"like\" during emotional recounts may diminish perceived severity, possibly masking deeper distress. - Amplification patterns: Phrases like \"feel so hopeless\" and \"lose it\" suggest exaggeration of emotional suffering, which could be driven by distress rather than objective severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Briefly looking away and hesitance when discussing hallucinations hint at discomfort or shame about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: The vague, approximate timeline indicates some difficulty recalling or prioritizing symptom progression accurately. - Family influence: Acknowledgment of family history (bipolar disorder, depression) suggests awareness but also potential influence on how symptoms are perceived and expressed.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias is most prominent, as the patient emphasizes feelings of hopelessness and distress, possibly exaggerating their suffering due to emotional state. - Severity: Moderate\u2014while his descriptions are vivid, the emotional nature and scattered responses suggest some overstatement amid genuine symptoms. - Areas most affected: Emotional symptoms and hallucinations are most biased, with a tendency to magnify distress, which might inflate perceived severity. - Reliability: Moderate; the emotional distress likely inflates perceived severity, but core symptoms like heaviness and hallucinations are probably present and real.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about hallucination content, frequency, and duration; specifics about mood episodes; recent substance use; and sleep patterns. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient might underreport the severity or frequency of hallucinations and mood instability due to discomfort or shame. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of losing control or \"going crazy\" are likely exaggerated compared to actual risk or severity. - True timeline: The reported gradual onset over three weeks aligns with typical depressive episodes but may overemphasize the rapid escalation of distress driven by emotional amplification.  Overall, this patient\u2019s communication demonstrates reliance on emotional language, scattered responses, and some signs of distress exaggeration, which can complicate accurate clinical assessment.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body or abrasion Justification: The onset after playing soccer suggests possible trauma leading to corneal injury or foreign body, which can cause redness, tearing, and swelling. The temporal association supports trauma as a primary cause.  2. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye irritation and redness following physical activity aligns with conjunctival inflammation due to minor trauma or foreign material, without deeper involvement.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are consistent; although less likely acutely post-trauma without systemic signs, exposure during outdoor play could predispose to infection.  4. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Common cause of conjunctivitis with redness and tearing, though less likely to be solely trauma-related; consideration if other viral symptoms develop.  5. Diagnosis: Eyelid cellulitis Justification: Local swelling and redness may suggest infection of eyelid tissues possibly from environmental exposure or minor trauma, especially if swelling localized to eyelid.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotional language, e.g., \"heavy,\" \"freaks me out,\" often adding qualifiers like \"kind of\" or \"a little,\" which serve to soften the perceived severity.

    "input": "The patient presents with persistent auditory hallucinations occurring multiple times daily, characterized as whispering voices that worsen with stress. They report experiencing mood swings, pervasive feelings of heaviness and hopelessness, and low energy, which interfere with daily functioning. The patient maintains some insight into their experiences but may overstate distress levels and underreport physical symptoms such as fatigue or sleep disturbances. Additional details about the hallucinations\u2019 content, duration, associated behaviors, and safety considerations are necessary to inform diagnosis and management.1. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder Justification: The patient exhibits persistent auditory hallucinations alongside mood swings and feelings of hopelessness, which suggests co-occurring psychosis and mood disorder features. The hallucinations worsen with stress, indicative of a primary psychotic process possibly intertwined with mood symptoms. The presence of mood instability and psychosis not fully attributable to a mood episode alone supports schizoaffective disorder, especially if hallucinations and mood symptoms have been concurrent over a significant period, with some insight retained.  2. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The persistent auditory hallucinations occurring multiple times daily and interference with functioning suggest a primary psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. Mood symptoms are present but can be part of negative or residual features rather than core diagnostic criteria. The report of hallucinations when stress increases aligns with typical schizophrenia symptom exacerbation, and insight is partial but not full, consistent with this diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: The patient reports pervasive feelings of heaviness and hopelessness, with low energy and mood swings, which align with severe depression. The psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations) could largely be mood-congruent, particularly if hallucinations are consistent with depressive themes (e.g., voices criticizing or condemning). However, the prominent psychosis plus mood swings makes this less likely unless hallucinations are exclusively depressive.  4. Diagnosis: Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: Mood swings noted could reflect bipolarity, with psychotic features manifesting during depressive or manic episodes. If hallucinations occur during mood episodes, bipolar disorder with psychosis might be probable, particularly if the patient's history indicates episodic mood changes. However, lacking explicit episodes of mania or hypomania diminishes the certainty of this diagnosis.  5. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: General mood disorder (depression or bipolar) accompanied by psychosis fits the symptom profile. The patient's depressive symptoms and laughably precipitating psychosis could align with this diagnosis, although without specified episode timing, it ranks lower in probability than primary psychotic-mood overlap diagnoses.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mixture of vague and emotionally charged language, softening descriptions (e.g., \"a little headachy\") but also emphasizing distress (\"really freaks me out\"). There is a tendency to elaborate and sometimes overstate feelings to convey seriousness. - Information flow: Tends to volunteer both detailed and emotional responses, though cautiously, often rambling. There is some inconsistency indicating potential difficulty in self-reporting accurate timelines. - Response style: Responses are elaborative, hesitant, and emotionally saturated, reflecting anxiety and discomfort with the topics discussed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient hints at uncertainty about symptom causes (\"I don\u2019t know why it starts or stops\") and is hesitant about specifics, suggesting some concealment or avoidance of full disclosure. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying physical symptoms (\"a little headachy\") and the overall impact, possibly to avoid appearing too vulnerable or to prevent overreacting. - Amplification patterns: Exaggerates emotional distress (\"really freaks me out,\" \"so scary\"), likely to garner attention or reassurance, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Brief avoidance (looking away, hesitant speech) may indicate modesty or shame about hallucinations or mental health. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in the frequency and timeline of hallucinations suggests some difficulty recalling or analyzing severity. - Family influence: No explicit evidence in responses, but awareness of family history may influence concern levels.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional exaggeration and anxiety-driven over-reporting, with some minimization of physical symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; emotional responses influence the perceived severity, but core experiences are likely accurate in content. - Areas most affected: Intensity and impact of hallucinations and emotional distress; these are likely inflated by anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; responses demonstrate genuine distress but are affected by emotional bias, making absolute trust in self-report nuanced.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about hallucination content, frequency, and any safety behaviors or additional symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical discomforts and functional impairments may be understated; emotional distress emphasized. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of psychosis, losing touch with reality, and harming oneself or others are possibly exaggerated by anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have developed gradually over three weeks, but emotional intensity may inflate current severity, possibly making the patient perceive the situation as worse than it is.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation with frequent auditory hallucinations, mood swings, and feelings of hopelessness suggests a complex psychotic and mood disorder. To refine whether this aligns more with a primary psychotic disorder with mood symptoms (e.g., schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia) or a mood disorder with psychotic features, I need more specific information about the content and timing of hallucinations relative to mood episodes. Given the emotional exaggeration and possible minimization, I should explore the hallucinations' content, their correlation with mood states, and any history of manic or depressive episodes. Additionally, assessing insight, safety behaviors, and other symptoms like changes in sleep or physical health will further clarify the diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about the hallucinations' content, timing, and context. - Information target: Hallucination themes, relation to mood episodes, safety, and impact. - Communication approach: Gentle, validating, acknowledging distress to encourage honest sharing despite anxiety. - Expected value: Helps differentiate between primary psychotic vs mood-related psychosis, and determine severity and treatment needs.\nANSWER: You mentioned experiencing these whispering voices multiple times daily and feeling overwhelmed by them.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient hints at uncertainty about symptom causes (\"I don\u2019t know why it starts or stops\") and is hesitant about specifics, suggesting some concealment or avoidance of full disclosure. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying physical symptoms (\"a little headachy\") and the overall impact, possibly to avoid appearing too vulnerable or to prevent overreacting. - Amplification patterns: Exaggerates emotional distress (\"really freaks me out,\" \"so scary\"), likely to garner attention or reassurance, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Brief avoidance (looking away, hesitant speech) may indicate modesty or shame about hallucinations or mental health. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in the frequency and timeline of hallucinations suggests some difficulty recalling or analyzing severity. - Family influence: No explicit evidence in responses, but awareness of family history may influence concern levels.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional exaggeration and anxiety-driven over-reporting, with some minimization of physical symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; emotional responses influence the perceived severity, but core experiences are likely accurate in content. - Areas most affected: Intensity and impact of hallucinations and emotional distress; these are likely inflated by anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; responses demonstrate genuine distress but are affected by emotional bias, making absolute trust in self-report nuanced.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about hallucination content, frequency, and any safety behaviors or additional symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical discomforts and functional impairments may be understated; emotional distress emphasized. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of psychosis, losing touch with reality, and harming oneself or others are possibly exaggerated by anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have developed gradually over three weeks, but emotional intensity may inflate current severity, possibly making the patient perceive the situation as worse than it is.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with persistent auditory hallucinations occurring multiple times daily, characterized as whispering voices that tend to worsen during periods of increased stress and low mood. They report feelings of heaviness, foggy mental state, mood swings, and hopelessness, which interfere with daily functioning. While acknowledging some awareness of the unreal nature of their hallucinations, the patient appears to minimize the severity and frequency of these symptoms, with indications that they may be more persistent and distressing than disclosed. Additional symptoms such as visual phenomena and emotional distress are present but may also be underreported. The overall presentation suggests a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, with the likelihood that the true symptom burden is moderate to severe. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify the content, severity, and impact of their hallucinations, as well as to evaluate for potential risk factors such as sleep disturbances and suicidality.Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient favors vague and tentative language (\"maybe,\" \"I think,\" \"kind of\"), likely to avoid overstatement or judgment. Emotional language indicates distress but is carefully modulated. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat organized and reply directly but are punctuated with hesitations and qualifiers, reflecting possible reluctance or discomfort. They wait for questions and provide additional details only when prompted. - Response style: Responses tend to be elaborative but softened with hedging, showing cautious disclosure.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of hedging phrases (\"maybe,\" \"I guess,\" \"I think\") suggests the patient is not fully revealing the severity of hallucinations or distress. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the frequency (\"maybe almost every day,\" \"sometimes gets worse\") and impact indicates the patient might understate symptoms to avoid alarm or stigma. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"it sometimes gets worse,\" and \"they seem louder or more frequent\" show concern but are possibly exaggerated attempts to highlight distress, balanced by hedging. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and non-specific language in discussing hallucinations suggest some discomfort or shame in fully expressing the severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No overt signs, but vague timelines and qualifying descriptors may reflect emotional distancing rather than memory problems. - Family influence: Not directly evident, but the patient's mention of family history and their own experiences may inform their cautious responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias seems to be minimization of symptoms, likely driven by stigma, fear, or emotional fatigue. - Severity: Moderate bias, given the acknowledged distress but downplayed severity. - Areas most affected: Frequency and severity of hallucinations, and overall emotional state, are most biased, as indicated by hedging language. - Reliability: Their self-report should be interpreted cautiously; actual symptom burden may be higher, and the current account may underestimate severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent and emotional impact of psychotic symptoms, and possibly suicidal ideation or hopelessness level. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual frequency and distress caused by hallucinations, and the severity of mood disturbances, may be worse than reported. - Concerns probably amplified: The fear of losing touch with reality shows heightened worry, which may be appropriate or exaggerated; their cautious language suggests they may feel overwhelmed but are trying to understate it. - True timeline: Progression likely aligns with what they describe but could include more fluctuation in symptom severity that they are reluctant to fully acknowledge.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need to confirm whether hallucinations occur during mood episodes or independent of mood states, and clarify their severity, content, and impact; also whether there are concurrent depressive or manic symptoms like suicidality. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiate if hallucinations are primarily mood-congruent (e.g., during depressive or manic episodes) or independent psychotic symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. - Patient factors: Given the tentative language, it's important to gently probe for actual symptom severity without causing shame or defensiveness, making questions more reassurance-oriented. - Interview phase goals: Final adjustments for diagnostic certainty, clarify symptom content and impact, gauge patient's emotional state, and assess for red flags like suicidality or hallucinations outside mood episodes.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions to clarify timing, severity, and context of hallucinations, with some yes/no or confirmatory questions for diagnostic criteria. - Information target: Hallucination frequency, content, mood relation, emotional impact, and scenario triggers; current mental state, suicidality, and insight. - Communication approach: Use collaborative framing\u2014\"Based on what you've shared, I want to understand more about...\"\u2014to encourage honest disclosure while making the patient feel safe. - Expected value: This will help finalize whether symptoms meet diagnostic criteria and their influence on functioning, guiding treatment and psychoeducation.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that. Just to make sure I understand fully\u2014do these whispering voices happen regardless of whether you're feeling low or anxious? For example, do they sometimes occur even when your mood isn't particularly low or high? And would you say they happen every day, or more on some days than others?\"",
