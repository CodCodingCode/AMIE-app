    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with a recent increase in symptoms of low mood, hopelessness, auditory hallucinations of voices, and visual hallucinations of shadows over the past few weeks. He reports significant distress and fears of losing control or causing harm, with emotionally intense language that suggests high emotional activation. It is possible that the severity of hallucinations and suicidal ideation may be somewhat exaggerated or influenced by his heightened anxiety, and prior psychiatric history and baseline functioning are not yet established. More comprehensive history is necessary to determine the onset, frequency, previous episodes, and risk factors, as well as to assess the need for immediate safety interventions.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The presence of auditory and visual hallucinations, along with prominent mood symptoms and high emotional activation, suggests a primary psychotic disorder; onset in young adulthood is typical.  2. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: Substance use (e.g., cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens) can precipitate hallucinations and mood symptoms, especially in young adults; coverage necessary given recent onset.  3. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: Severe low mood and hopelessness, combined with hallucinations, can indicate a mood disorder with psychosis; the recent increase suggests an acute episode.  4. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: Sudden-onset psychotic symptoms lasting less than one month, often stress-induced; applicable if symptoms are recent and transient.  5. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder Justification: Presence of psychotic symptoms with mood disturbance; more common if mood symptoms are prominent and persistent.  6. Diagnosis: Psychotic Disorder Due to a Medical Condition Justification: Certain neurological or systemic illnesses (e.g., neurological tumors, infections) can cause psychosis; requires clinical correlation but less likely without neurological signs.  7. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: Intense anxiety and fear of losing control could produce hallucination-like experiences; less consistent, but possible given high emotional activation.  8. Diagnosis: Postpartum Psychosis (less likely) Justification: Unlikely in this case due to lack of obstetric history, but included as core psychotic disorder in young females.  9. Diagnosis: Frontotemporal Dementia (very unlikely in this age) Justification: Neurodegenerative cause common in older adults; not relevant here.  10. Diagnosis: Dissociative or Psychogenic Psychosis Justification: Rare, usually in response to trauma or stress; less probable given severity and type of hallucinations but considered in differential for atypical presentations.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally intense and somewhat vague descriptions (\"losing my mind,\" \"really low and hopeless,\" \"scared\"), which convey distress but can also obscure nuanced symptom presentation. - Information flow: He appears forthcoming, volunteering multiple symptoms and concerns, suggesting openness influenced by high distress levels. - Response style: His answers are elaborate and emotionally charged, with a tendency to emphasize severity, reflecting genuine distress but also possible exaggeration due to anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; he seems eager to share, though he may minimize less distressing symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Some descriptions are broad (\"sometimes see shadows,\" \"feel like I\u2019m losing my mind\"), which could be an attempt to keep symptoms manageable in narrative. - Amplification patterns: The vividness and intensity of hallucination descriptions and fears suggest possible exaggeration driven by distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; he openly discusses hallucinations and suicidal thoughts, indicating no significant shame. - Confusion/memory issues: His description of the timeline is coherent, but emotional distress may distort perceived onset or severity. - Family influence: Family history of mood disorders might influence how he perceives and reports his symptoms, possibly adding to their perceived severity.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom amplification bias, fueled by high anxiety and emotional distress, leading him to portray symptoms as more severe. - Severity: Moderate to severe; his distress is evident, and hallucinations plus suicidal thoughts are significant concerns. - Areas most affected: Hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and emotional instability are likely overemphasized; his subjective reports may overstate current severity. - Reliability: While self-report contains valuable insight, emotional amplification suggests caution; correlating with objective assessment is essential.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Less severe or intervening symptoms, baseline functioning, and insight into his condition may be underreported or obscured. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might understate baseline or historical mood fluctuations; current distress amplifies perceived severity. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of losing control, harming himself, or others are likely heightened by anxiety, possibly overestimating imminent danger. - True timeline: The reported three-week onset aligns with typical episodes but may overlook earlier subtler fluctuations and prior coping mechanisms; current distress inflates the perceived severity and timing.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The primary goal here is to deepen understanding of his current experience and build rapport, while gathering richer details about his symptoms. - Since he reports psychotic and mood symptoms, it\u2019s important to explore how these symptoms began, what triggers or worsens them, and how they affect his daily life. - I need to avoid leading him toward specific diagnoses but encourage elaboration on the nature and impact of his experiences. - Asking about the timeline and circumstances around symptom onset can help clarify whether there are precipitating factors or patterns. - Since he's quite distressed and uses emotionally charged language, clarifying his perspective with an open-ended question can uncover more nuanced insight. - I will focus on inviting him to describe his experience in his own words, emphasizing understanding his view of what he's going through now.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: The specific circumstances of symptom onset, how these symptoms have evolved, and his function during this period. - Diagnostic priorities: Establishing timing, frequency, severity, and context of hallucinations and mood symptoms; co-occurring substance use; prior psychiatric episodes. - Patient factors: Emotional distress and vivid descriptions suggest a need for gentle, empathetic questioning to maintain rapport and encourage openness. - Interview phase goals: Build trust, elicit detailed experience, understand impact, and explore any potential stressors or triggers.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to invite storytelling about his current experience, especially focusing on the onset and change over time. - Information target: Symptom details, onset, progression, triggers, current severity, and functional impact. - Communication approach: Use comforting language and show genuine curiosity, validating his distress while encouraging elaboration. - Expected value: This will help clarify the timeline, severity, and context of symptoms, guiding subsequent questions and assessments.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing over these past few weeks?

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with a recent worsening of psychotic symptoms and mood disturbances over the past three weeks. He reports experiencing auditory hallucinations of voices and visual hallucinations of shadows, along with feelings of hopelessness and low mood. He also describes engaging in risky behaviors and prior irritability episodes, though the severity of current hallucinations and suicidal thoughts may be exaggerated by emotional distress. There is no detailed information available on previous episodes, baseline functioning, or specific impact on daily activities. Further assessment is needed to clarify symptom severity, risk levels, and functional impairment, considering potential under- or overreporting biases in his communication.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (acute episode) Justification: The presence of auditory and visual hallucinations along with mood symptoms in an early presentation suggests a primary psychotic disorder; the symptom duration over three weeks aligns with acute episodes in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 2. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder Justification: Co-occurrence of mood disturbances (hopelessness, low mood) with psychotic symptoms hints at schizoaffective disorder, especially if mood symptoms are prominent and concurrent with psychosis. 3. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: Psychotic symptoms are common with intoxication or withdrawal from substances such as stimulants, hallucinogens, or cannabis; recent worsening may be related to recent substance use. 4. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features (Major Depressive Disorder with Psychosis) Justification: The patient's hopelessness and low mood could be indicative of major depression with psychotic features, especially if mood symptoms predominate. 5. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: Given the recent onset (three weeks) without prior history, this transient psychotic episode could be a brief psychotic disorder, particularly if symptoms are acute and possibly triggered. 6. Diagnosis: Organic Brain Syndrome (e.g., encephalitis, neurological pathology) Justification: Visual hallucinations and recent onset could point towards an organic cause such as neurological pathology; further testing would clarify this. 7. Diagnosis: Postpartum Psychosis (if applicable) Justification: Not specified, but if recent circumstances involved postpartum period, this could be considered; absent context, lower likelihood. 8. Diagnosis: Delirium (due to medical causes) Justification: If there are underlying infections or metabolic disturbances, delirium could present with hallucinations; no supportive details provided. 9. Diagnosis: Other Psychotic Disorders due to Medical Conditions Justification: Certain medical conditions may cause psychosis; again, no specific medical history suggests this but remains possible. 10. Diagnosis: Dissociative or Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified Justification: Could be considered if symptoms do not meet criteria for specific diagnoses but involve psychosis and mood symptoms.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged, specific phrases (\"losing my mind,\" \"voices that nobody else can hear,\" \"shadows that move\"). The language is direct but also influenced by distress, making it both vivid and potentially exaggerated. There is a tendency to express feelings openly, indicating a willingness to share but possibly driven by emotional need. - Information flow: They are forthcoming, volunteering detailed symptoms and a clear timeline, though responses are emotional and sometimes impulsive. The detailed narrative suggests organized thought patterns but also reflects emotional clutter. - Response style: They tend to elaborate with emotional detail, which can sometimes lead to overstatement of the severity. Responses are direct about feelings but may lack some specifics about functional impact or coping strategies.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant evidence; they seem willing to disclose symptoms, possibly driven by concern and anxiety. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; they describe symptoms with emotional intensity, not downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: High likelihood\u2014they are possibly amplifying fears and hallucination severity due to locus of anxiety and distress, evidenced by their dramatic language and focus on losing control. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not predominant; they openly discuss hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and mood swings without evident shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No real signs; timeline coherence suggests functioning clarity, though emotional distress clouds objectivity. - Family influence: Indirectly noted\u2014family history of mood disorders may heighten their perception of severity or influence feelings of inevitable worsening; not explicitly evident here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxious amplifier, primarily driven by intense emotionality leading to exaggeration of symptoms and fears. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given the vividness of symptoms described and potential overestimation of danger and severity due to heightened anxiety. - Areas most affected: Hallucinations, mood instability, and suicide risk are likely overrepresented in their account, influenced by emotional distress. - Reliability: While their subjective report aligns with clinical features of severe bipolar episodes, emotional amplification suggests some overstatement; thus, self-report should be corroborated with objective assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific functional impairments, coping mechanisms, and detailed hallucination content may not be fully conveyed; their focus is on distressing sensations and fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any calm periods, resilience, or reality testing abilities may be underreported, given their emotional intensity. - Concerns probably amplified: Degree of danger, urgency of psychosis, and hopelessness may be overemphasized due to emotional distress. - True timeline: The patient\u2019s report of symptom onset is coherent, but the emotional state might have intensified perceptions of severity; actual progression could be more gradual or less intense than stated, but their current state amplifies their experience.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The missing key information includes the patient's baseline functioning, the severity and nature of prior episodes, and whether they have had any prior psychotic or mood episodes, which will aid in differentiating diagnoses like schizophrenia, mood disorder with psychotic features, or brief psychosis. - Diagnostic priorities involve clarifying whether psychotic symptoms are primary or secondary to other causes, their current risk of harm (to self or others), and how these symptoms are impacting daily life and relationships. - The patient communicates openly and emotionally, which suggests building trust and reassurance will be important; questions should be gentle yet thorough to gather detailed information without increasing distress. - In early exploration, the objective is to encourage the patient to elaborate and clarify their experience, focusing on the context, duration, and impact of symptoms, as well as their perceptions and concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused open-ended questions are needed to explore baseline mental state, previous episodes, and functional impact. - The target is to understand the full scope of psychotic and mood symptoms, their onset, and their influence on the patient's life. - Phrasing should be sensitive to emotional distress, emphasizing understanding and support, using language that validates their experience. - This will help uncover details that differentiate between primary psychotic disorders and mood-related psychosis, and identify areas of immediate concern.\nANSWER: \"That\u2019s helpful to hear, and I can see this is very upsetting for you.

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with a recent onset approximately three weeks prior of auditory hallucinations of voices, visual hallucinations of shadows, and a low, hopeless mood. He reports significant functional impairment, including social withdrawal and disruptive thoughts of self-harm and suicide, which he describes with emotional intensity. While these symptoms are consistent with a severe psychotic and depressive episode, his detailed and emotionally charged account likely amplifies the perceived severity; thus, some symptoms may be less persistent or intense in reality. Additional assessment is necessary to evaluate symptom fluctuation, current risk, and resilience factors, as emotional distress may influence both reporting and perception of danger.1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Justification: The presence of hallucinations (auditory and visual), social withdrawal, and functional decline are core features. Although the symptoms are recent, a primary psychotic disorder is plausible, especially if hallucinations are persistent, and mood symptoms may be secondary. The patient's age (29) aligns with typical onset, and the combination of hallucinations and social impairment strongly supports schizophrenia, provided other causes are excluded.  2. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: The description of a low, hopeless mood, mood-related hopelessness, and suicidal ideation suggest severe depression. The presence of psychotic features (hallucinations) indicates a mood disorder where psychosis is mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. The recent onset of depressive and psychotic symptoms together suggests this diagnosis, especially if mood symptoms are prominent and preceded or paralleled psychosis.  3. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: The recent, acute onset of hallucinations and mood symptoms within the past few weeks could represent a brief psychotic episode, possibly triggered by stress. If symptoms resolve within a month, this diagnosis is appropriate. Its inclusion considers the subacute presentation and may be distinguishable from chronic schizophrenia with further time course clarification.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: Substance use can cause hallucinations and mood disturbances. Although not detailed here, if there's any history or suspicion of substance misuse, this diagnosis remains relevant. Its rank is lower unless supporting evidence emerges, but it must be considered due to the acute psychosis and mood symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Schizoaffective Disorder Justification: The combination of psychotic symptoms and mood disturbances over three weeks may suggest schizoaffective disorder if mood symptoms are prominent, persistent, and coincide with psychosis. It is included as a potential diagnosis that bridges mood and psychotic disorders, especially if mood symptoms are not solely related to mood episodes.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs highly emotional and vivid language, such as \"losing my mind\" and \"totally empty,\" which amplifies perceived severity. His descriptions are specific regarding hallucinations and mood but tend to focus on distressing aspects, possibly to evoke sympathy or prompt urgent response. - Information flow: He appears forthcoming, providing detailed narratives without much prompting, especially about symptom onset and impact. The organization is relatively coherent, with a focus on emotional state and hallucinations. - Response style: The responses are elaborative and emotionally expressive, often leaning towards overstatement of severity. He offers detailed descriptions unsolicited, indicating an open but distress-driven communication style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is no clear evidence of withholding; he consistently shares distressing symptoms, perhaps overemphasizing them. However, his focus on symptoms related to psychosis and hopelessness might mean he is less willing to discuss less distressing states or negative coping mechanisms. - Minimization behaviors: The patient does not seem to minimize symptoms; instead, he exaggerates them to highlight the gravity of his situation. - Amplification patterns: The intense language and focus on feelings of losing control and killing himself suggest amplification driven by emotional distress, which may influence the perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not prominently evident; his openness indicates comfort in discussing his distress. - Confusion/memory issues: The timeline appears consistent, though his emotional state might color his perception of symptom progression; no explicit memory issues are indicated. - Family influence: Mention of family history of mood disorders may influence his understanding or feelings about his condition but does not seem to distort his reporting directly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, with tendencies to overstate severity due to distress and fear. He may be magnifying symptoms, especially hallucinations and hopelessness. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as his language indicates significant functional impairment and high-risk concerns. - Areas most affected: Severity of hallucinations, mood symptoms, and risk perception are most biased due to emotional modulation. - Reliability: While his descriptions seem sincere, his emotional distress likely inflates perceived severity, so some overstatement should be considered in clinical judgment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Less emotionally charged or less distressing symptom fluctuations, coping mechanisms, or positive periods; potential denial or minimization of less severe symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: As he primarily reports despair and hallucinations, subtle cognitive deficits or defensive complacency might be underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: His fear of harming himself or others, given the prominence of these themes, could be overemphasized if he is catastrophizing or seeking reassurance. - True timeline: Reported onset appears consistent, but emotional distortion may exaggerate the impact or chronicity of symptoms; gradual escalation may be more nuanced than presented.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: While we know about the hallucinations and mood symptoms, we lack details on whether these symptoms are persistent or episodic, and how they fluctuate over time.

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with a three-week history of auditory and visual hallucinations characterized by hearing voices and seeing shadows, primarily worsening at night. He describes a low, hopeless mood with significant social withdrawal and difficulty functioning, including persistent suicidal thoughts, though without specific plans or protective factors detailed. While these symptoms are consistent with a recent onset of psychotic and depressive features, his emotionally intense account suggests the possibility of symptom exaggeration. The core symptoms of hallucinations, mood disturbance, and social withdrawal are evident, but their severity may be somewhat overstated due to emotional distress; further assessment is needed to evaluate symptom specifics, psychotic content, substance use, and his current safety.1. Diagnosis: Schizophreniform Disorder Justification: The patient's three-week history of hallucinations, social withdrawal, and mood disturbance aligns with schizophreniform disorder, especially given the duration (more than one week but less than six months). The prominent hallucinations and social withdrawal are characteristic, with the recent onset favoring this diagnosis over schizophrenia.  2. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: The reported low, hopeless mood, persistent suicidal thoughts, and social withdrawal suggest a severe depressive episode with psychotic features. The presence of hallucinations, especially voices of hopelessness, supports this, and mood symptoms are prominent, making this a strong alternative diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: While not explicitly stated, hallucinations can be precipitated by substance use (psychoactive drugs, intoxication, or withdrawal). The temporal association with symptoms' onset suggests this possibility, which warrants consideration, though lacking direct evidence.  4. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: The three-week duration of hallucinations and mood disturbance could fit with brief psychotic disorder, especially if symptoms resolve within a month. The severity and social withdrawal support this possibility, but the persistent suicidal ideation suggests a more sustained mood component.  5. Diagnosis: Mania with Psychotic Features Justification: Although less typical, the hallucinations could be part of a manic episode with psychosis, especially if mood elevation or irritability occurs. Given the low mood reports, this is less likely but considered for completeness.

    "input": "The patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with a recent (approximately three-week history) of psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations involving threatening voices and visual shadows, primarily worsening at night, alongside low mood, anhedonia, and significant social withdrawal. He also reports persistent suicidal ideation without specific plans. While he describes these symptoms as highly distressing, his emotionally exaggerated narrative suggests the severity may be overrepresented, necessitating careful assessment of actual symptom frequency, intensity, and safety risks. The clinical picture indicates a probable acute psychotic episode with comorbid depression; however, some symptom details might be understated or concealed, especially regarding impulsive or dangerous behaviors. Further inquiry is essential to evaluate risk, clarify hallucination content, and determine overall functional impact.Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder with Depressive Features ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional, descriptive language\u2014\"terrifying,\" \"falling apart,\" \"scared\"\u2014indicating high distress, but also employs vagueness (\"bad things,\" \"I don\u2019t know\"), which can hinder precision. - Information flow: They tend to volunteer detailed descriptions when discussing hallucinations and fears, showing openness, but demonstrate hesitations and hedging, suggesting some avoidance or discomfort. Their responses are generally organized around their emotional states. - Response style: They provide elaborated responses, especially regarding hallucinations, but show reactive hesitations that reflect anxiety and distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of reluctance when discussing the potential danger they pose, possibly downplaying their capacity for harm, indicated by statements like \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d hurt anyone.\" - Minimization behaviors: Describing hallucinations as \"not that bad\" or \"can\u2019t be real\" indicates some effort to diminish the perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: Repeated expressions of being \"falling apart\" and fears of losing control lean toward emotional or paranoid exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitant language and hedging suggest some internal discomfort, though explicit shame isn't overtly expressed. - Confusion/memory issues: Use of vague phrases (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"maybe\") and inconsistent timeline references could reflect confusion or difficulty recalling details accurately. - Family influence: Recognition of family history indicates awareness of genetic predisposition, which may subtly bias their framing of symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias dominates\u2014they tend to overstate the severity due to anxiety and paranoia, though there is some minor minimization when they dismiss potential dangers. - Severity: Moderate to severe, as their high distress and risk-related concerns are genuine, yet some responses suggest they may overestimate their risk or the immediacy of danger. - Areas most affected: Hallucinations and fears of harming self or others are most biased, with emotional state inflating perceived threat levels. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; their self-report captures core distress but likely overstates symptom severity due to emotional bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: They may not fully disclose safety plans, concrete intentions, or the actual level of functional impairment, possibly guarding against hospitalization or judgment. - Symptoms probably minimized: The degree of paranoia or hallucinations' threat could be worse than articulated. - Concerns probably amplified: Fears about losing control and hurting others may be exaggerated by paranoia and anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms appear consistent with early depressive phase with psychosis, but distress levels and paranoia may be emotionally exaggerated, inflating perceived severity.  Overall, the patient's communication exhibits emotional amplification with some minimization, influenced by high anxiety and paranoia, which affects the accuracy and reliability of self-reports.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need clarity on the frequency and severity of hallucinations and delusions, whether there are any safety concerns, and the patient's understanding of their symptoms. It\u2019s also important to assess if there are any change in overall functioning and if the patient perceives the symptoms as ongoing or worsening. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm the presence of psychotic features (hallucinations, delusions), evaluate mood symptoms, and rule out organic or substance-induced causes. Since hallucinations are prominent and distressing, confirming their consistency, context, and impact is essential to differentiate between primary psychotic disorder and mood spectrum conditions. - Patient factors: The patient\u2019s tendency to exaggerate or minimize symptoms suggests a need for careful, balanced questioning with both open and focused questions to validate their reports without leading them. - Interview phase goals: To firmly establish the core features of psychosis, assess safety and risk, and gauge the patient\u2019s understanding and perception of their symptoms to inform treatment planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to clarify symptom frequency, context, and content, alongside some open-ended prompts to explore understanding and concern. - Information target: Hallucination details, delusional beliefs, insight level, safety assessment, functional impact. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language to reduce shame and defensiveness; normalize symptoms to facilitate disclosure. - Expected value: This will confirm or refine the diagnosis and help guide immediate safety and treatment planning.\nANSWER: Based on what you've told me about hearing voices and seeing shadows, I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about how often these hallucinations occur\u2014are they happening daily, multiple times a day, or less often? Also, can you tell me if they are usually the same voices or images, or do they change? Do they tend to happen at certain times, like more at night or when you're feeling particularly stressed? Understanding this will help me get a clearer picture of your experiences, and it\u2019s important for us to figure out how these symptoms are affecting your safety and overall well-being.",
