    "input": "An adult female presenting with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain, accompanied by swelling, tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and chills. The pain is described as constant and very intense, suggestive of a serious intra-abdominal process such as appendicitis, perforation, or another urgent gastrointestinal condition. Her subjective report indicates significant distress; however, communication patterns suggest her symptom severity may be somewhat amplified by anxiety. Further history and physical examination are necessary to confirm objective findings and establish the precise etiology.1. Diagnosis: Perforated Peptic Ulcer Justification: Severe, sudden-onset abdominal pain with systemic signs like chills and vomiting suggests perforation; common in adults with ulcer disease, often presenting with generalized peritonitis signs.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis with Possible Perforation Justification: Classic signs include severe right lower quadrant pain (or generalized pain if perforated), nausea, vomiting, and tenderness; perforation increases severity and systemic symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Diverticulitis with Perforation Justification: Common in adults, especially those over 50, presenting with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis; perforation is a serious complication.  4. Diagnosis: Bowel Obstruction (High-grade or Complete) Justification: Presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension; can become septic if perforates or ischemic.  5. Diagnosis: Ovarian Torsion or Rupture (in female patient) Justification: Acute severe abdominal pain with tenderness, possibly associated with nausea and vomiting; can present with generalized or lower abdominal pain.  6. Diagnosis: Ectopic Pregnancy (if pregnant) Justification: In women of reproductive age, sudden severe abdominal pain, shock signs, and pelvic tenderness are characteristic; requires urgent diagnosis.  7. Diagnosis: Ischemic Bowel Justification: Severe abdominal pain disproportionate to exam, signs of systemic toxicity; may lead to perforation if untreated.  8. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis Justification: Causes acute abdominal pain with systemic symptoms; less common but important to consider in the differential.  9. Diagnosis: Acute Cholecystitis with Perforation or Gangrene Justification: Right upper quadrant pain, tenderness, and systemic signs; perforation possible in severe cases.  10. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis with Severe Inflammation Justification: Nausea, vomiting, chills, and diffuse tenderness could reflect infection; less likely to cause such intense localized pain but still possible.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs emotionally intense, specific descriptions (\"killing me,\" \"terrible,\" \"excruciating\"), with little use of vague or minimizing phrases. Her responses are mostly direct and detailed, aiming to depict her distress vividly. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, proactively volunteering detailed symptoms without prompting, which suggests openness rather than withholding. Her narrative is organized around her perceived severity, with emotional emphasis, rather than scattershot or distracted reporting. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, emotionally charged, and urgent, matching her distress level. She avoids minimal responses and maintains focus on her main concern\u2014severe pain and distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she appears transparent about her symptoms, likely driven by distress. - Minimization behaviors: None observed; she describes her symptoms as severe and urgent, which aligns with her actual distress. - Amplification patterns: Her language indicates an amplification bias; describing pain as \"killing me\" and \"worst\" pain, which may heighten perceived urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; she openly discusses intense pain and physical discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: No indications of confusion; her timeline (\"started yesterday\") seems consistent and coherent. - Family influence: Not evident; responses are personal and emotionally driven by her own perception, not influenced by others.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias due to her emotionally charged language and heightened concern about severity. - Severity: Moderate to severe; her vivid descriptions suggest genuine significant distress, but the focus on exaggeration may inflate perceived seriousness. - Areas most affected: Pain description and urgency signals; her emotional tone may lead clinicians to overestimate the immediacy or severity of some symptoms. - Reliability: Her responses are likely accurate regarding her subjective experience but may overstate threat level due to anxiety and emotional response, thus reducing objectivity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the onset of specific features such as swelling or vomiting, and any previous similar episodes; psychosocial factors influencing her perception may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possibly she underreports prior mild symptoms or overall health baseline, focusing instead on overall severity now. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about life-threatening conditions are heightened\u2014she's very worried about perforation or the need for surgery, which may reflect anxiety more than factual likelihood. - True timeline: The progression appears rapid and severe, consistent with her report of symptoms worsening from the previous day; her emotional focus may magnify the perceived urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to explore the onset and progression of her abdominal pain to better understand the timeline and severity. - Since she reports severe and intense symptoms, understanding if there are any associated features like fever, changes in bowel movements, or urinary symptoms can help narrow the differential. - Given her distress and vivid descriptions, it\u2019s important to validate her experience while gently clarifying details to differentiate between emotional amplification and actual symptom severity. - An open-ended question will encourage her to elaborate on her entire experience, providing context that might reveal clues about the underlying cause and her own understanding. - This approach will also help build rapport, demonstrating genuine interest and concern for her experience.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Specific details about when the swelling and vomiting started, any previous abdominal issues, presence of fever or chills, and prior similar episodes. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify features indicative of surgical emergencies such as perforation, appendicitis, or bowel obstruction\u2014especially timeline and associated symptoms. - Patient factors: Her emotional tone suggests heightened distress; open-ended questions need to be compassionate and reassuring. - Interview phase goals: Gather a comprehensive symptom history, beginning with onset and progression, to inform differential diagnosis and forge connection.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended and broad, encouraging her to describe her entire experience. - Information target: Duration, progression, associated symptoms, and her own perception of severity. - Communication approach: Use gentle, empathetic phrasing that encourages elaboration without sounding invasive or leading. - Expected value: This will yield critical contextual details and help discern her subjective experience from clinical signs, guiding further focused questions.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your symptoms started and how they've changed since then?

    "input": "An adult female presents with an acute onset of severe, constant abdominal pain that has progressively worsened over approximately 24 hours. She describes the current pain as intense and distressing, accompanied by abdominal swelling, tenderness, chills, and vomiting. While she reports that initial discomfort was mild and dull, communication patterns suggest her early symptoms could have been more significant than documented. Her elevated emotional state and dramatic descriptions indicate the potential for symptom exaggeration, especially regarding current severity, though objective findings such as systemic signs are consistent with a serious intra-abdominal pathology. Further history and physical examination are needed to clarify the progression and identify any additional systemic features.1. Diagnosis: Perforated peptic ulcer Justification: The severe, worsening abdominal pain with vomiting, chills, and guarding suggest perforation, a life-threatening emergency often with sudden onset but can become progressively worse; ulcers are common and can perforate, leading to peritonitis.  2. Diagnosis: Appendicitis with perforation Justification: Though typically presenting with abdominal pain that localizes to right lower quadrant, perforation can cause diffuse severe pain, systemic signs like chills, and peritoneal irritation, particularly if diagnosis is delayed.  3. Diagnosis: Bowel perforation (e.g., diverticulitis or ischemic bowel) Justification: Sudden severe abdominal pain with systemic signs indicates possible perforation with peritonitis; underlying diverticulitis or ischemia can cause perforation.  4. Diagnosis: Cholecystitis with complications (e.g., perforation) Justification: If the pain is right upper quadrant and severe, along with systemic signs, gallbladder inflammation with potential rupture could produce similar features, especially if the pain is steady and worsening.  5. Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion or ruptured ovarian cyst Justification: Female patient with severe abdominal pain; though typically acute and unilateral, complicated cyst rupture or torsion can produce intense pain, swelling, nausea, and systemic signs, especially in reproductive-aged women.  6. Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy (if pregnant) Justification: Severe, worsening lower abdominal pain with systemic signs could result from rupture of an ectopic pregnancy, a crucial \"can't miss\" diagnosis in women of reproductive age; no pregnancy status is specified but remains high on differential.  7. Diagnosis: Mesenteric ischemia Justification: Severe and worsening abdominal pain disproportionate to exam findings, with systemic symptoms, suggests ischemia especially if risk factors are present, though less common in females without vascular risk factors.  8. Diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis Justification: Severe epigastric pain radiating to back, persistent and worsening, can cause systemic signs; however, the absence of specific location details makes this slightly less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection progressing to pyelonephritis Justification: Chills and systemic symptoms but less likely to cause severe diffuse abdominal pain, more localized flank or lower abdominal pain.  10. Diagnosis: Functional abdominal pain or symptom exaggeration Justification: Communication suggests possible symptom exaggeration; however, systemic signs and objective findings point toward organic pathology.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: There's a mix of emotional and somewhat dramatic language to convey distress (\"killing me,\" \"worst,\" \"terrible\") combined with vague descriptions (\"kind of dull\") that suggest some level of social desirability or reluctance to appear overly concerned. - Information flow: The patient appears forthcoming about current severe symptoms but is less explicit about initial mild symptoms, indicating concealment or minimization of early signs. - Response style: Responses are emotionally charged and somewhat elaborative about distress but lean toward amplifying the severity of current symptoms, which may skew clinical assessment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The initial mild symptoms are downplayed (\"kind of dull\"), possibly to avoid seeming overly worried or to minimize their own perception of risk. - Minimization behaviors: Early gastrointestinal discomfort is minimized, but the escalation in pain and distress is amplified. - Amplification patterns: Clear exaggeration of current pain and severity to communicate urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit embarrassment, but initial subtle minimization may reflect discomfort in admitting minor issues. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are consistent, suggesting no significant memory issues. - Family influence: Not directly evident; however, emotional intensity could partly stem from internalized fears rather than external pressure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification with mild minimization bias\u2014overstating current symptoms to seek urgent care while downplaying initial mild discomfort. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014this pattern could lead to overestimating current crisis severity but is rooted in genuine distress. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and urgency assessment are most biased due to amplification; initial symptom description is most minimized. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; current symptom reporting is likely accurate, but early timeline details may be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The initial onset and progression of symptoms, especially mild or moderate discomforts, may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early mild discomforts might have been more pronounced, indicating a more insidious onset. - Concerns probably amplified: The urgency, pain severity, and threat level are exaggerated, possibly to ensure prompt attention. - True timeline: Mild symptoms onset was probably more significant than recognized by the patient; current distress is high but consistent with genuine severity, albeit with some emotional exaggeration.",

    "input": "An adult female presents with an acute onset of severe, constant abdominal pain, accompanied by swelling, tenderness, chills, and vomiting, with symptoms lasting approximately 24 hours. She reports that initial gastrointestinal discomfort was mild and nonspecific, resembling indigestion, and may have included intermittent cramping, but these early symptoms were underreported or minimized. Over the last day, her symptoms intensified significantly, leading to visible abdominal distension, systemic signs such as chills, and persistent vomiting. Physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and swelling consistent with intra-abdominal pathology. While her current presentation indicates a serious condition likely requiring urgent evaluation, her description of earlier discomfort suggests a progression from mild, possibly overlooked GI symptoms to severe illness. Further history is needed to confirm prior episodes, bowel habits, and symptom evolution to fully assess the clinical course.1. Diagnosis: Perforated Appendicitis or Perforated Visceral Organ Justification: The abrupt onset of severe, constant abdominal pain with increasing severity, vomiting, tenderness, swelling, and systemic signs like chills strongly suggest intra-abdominal perforation. Although initial symptoms were mild, the progression indicates a possible perforation of a hollow viscus, such as the appendix, stomach, or bowel. Perforation causes peritonitis, explaining the tenderness, swelling, and systemic response, and typically presents acutely within hours to a day.  2. Diagnosis: Ischemic Bowel (Mesenteric Ischemia) Justification: The rapid onset of severe, continuous pain, coupled with systemic symptoms and abdominal distension, raises suspicion of mesenteric ischemia, especially if underlying vascular risk factors are present. It explains the sudden progression from mild discomfort, as ischemia causes bowel infarction leading to peritonitis. The pain out of proportion to physical findings is typical but may not be explicitly noted here; however, the severity and rapid worsening support this diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Acute Mechanical Bowel Obstruction Justification: The patient\u2019s initial mild GI symptoms evolving into severe pain with vomiting and abdominal distension suggest bowel obstruction. The timeline of progression and swelling indicate a possible obstructive process\u2014herniation, volvulus, or adhesions\u2014leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure, tenderness, and systemic response due to bowel compromise.  4. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Perforation (Peptic or Diverticular) Justification: The persistence and severity of pain, vomiting, and systemic signs could reflect perforation of a peptic ulcer or diverticulum. The early mild discomfort might have been related to ulcer formation, with subsequent perforation leading to peritonitis. This diagnosis aligns with sudden severe abdomen and systemic inflammatory response, although less specific than the first two.  5. Diagnosis: Intra-abdominal Abscess or Infectious Peritonitis Justification: Although less likely as a primary diagnosis given rapid progression, an abscess resulting from ongoing inflammation or perforation of a bowel segment could account for signs of infection, swelling, and systemic symptoms. The presence of chills and tenderness supports an infectious component secondary to perforation or necrosis.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use vague, non-specific terms (\"some cramping,\" \"kind of,\" \"maybe\"), combined with emotional descriptors (\"really sick,\" \"terrible\"), reflecting hesitance and distress. - Information flow: She is reluctant to open up fully, providing minimal initial history unless specifically asked, indicating withholding of earlier, possibly less alarming symptoms. - Response style: Responses are concise, mostly direct but with unelaborated statements, suggesting discomfort or shame around certain symptoms, or fear of judgment.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to disclose prior minor gastrointestinal discomforts and vague descriptions during early symptom onset suggest intentional or subconscious withholding. - Minimization behaviors: She minimizes initial symptoms, calling them \"some cramping\" or \"maybe indigestion,\" potentially underreporting earlier warning signs. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the severity of current pain and distress, possibly exaggerating emotional impact to seek urgent care. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Use of vague language and reluctance to specify details about her GI past hint at discomfort or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence. - Family influence: Not explicitly indicated, but her limited history suggests she might be hesitant to discuss milder symptoms possibly perceived as trivial or embarrassing.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Information withholding**, especially about early symptoms and minor discomforts, due to embarrassment or forgetfulness. - Severity: **Moderate**, considering her vague and hesitant descriptions but clear expression of severe current distress. - Areas most affected: Timeline of symptom development and prior minor GI issues, which may be underreported. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her current report of severe symptoms is credible but she likely underreports milder, earlier symptoms.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed history of early or mild GI symptoms, which could clarify disease progression. - Symptoms probably minimized: The initial discomforts are understated, and the gradual worsening might be more insidious. - Concerns probably amplified: She overstates current distress, probably driven by anxiety, risking overestimation of urgency. - True timeline: Likely a slow progression from mild discomfort to severe symptoms, but her report emphasizes immediate severity, possibly overshadowing earlier signs.  (Note: This analysis suggests that the clinician should probe gently about prior minor symptoms and reassure the patient about privacy concerns, encouraging more detailed disclosure to fully assess her condition.)",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The early, mild, and possibly overlooked gastrointestinal symptoms are poorly characterized, including their nature, frequency, and duration. Understanding whether there were prior similar episodes or subtle signs could clarify the progression. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether the initial symptoms were more consistent with benign indigestion or suggestive of an insidious process like early appendiceal or gastric pathology, which might have been underestimated. Exploring systemic or associated symptoms may help differentiate from other acute intra-abdominal emergencies. - Patient factors: The patient's vague and hesitant responses indicate possible discomfort or embarrassment about discussing initial symptoms, so questions need to be gentle and reassurance-oriented. Her minimal elaboration suggests she may minimize early signs, so careful wording is essential. - Interview phase goals: Elicit detailed information about the nature, timing, and progression of earlier symptoms, especially any minor or intermittent discomforts, to build an accurate timeline and assess for warning signs that might differentiate diagnoses.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused yet gentle follow-up questions aimed at past mild symptoms and their details. - Information target: Specifics about prior GI sensations, their characteristics, duration, and whether she remembers any early signs like mild cramping, nausea, or discomfort. - Communication approach: Phrase questions in a nonjudgmental, reassuring manner, emphasizing privacy and the normality of discussing prior minor symptoms, to encourage openness. - Expected value: Uncovering subtle early signs may help determine if the current severe presentation followed a period of mild, overlooked symptoms, thus aiding in differentiating between conditions such as appendiceal perforation versus ischemic bowel or obstruction.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that initially your discomfort was mild and kind of vague, like some cramping or indigestion\u2014can you tell me more about when you first started feeling that way?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body or abrasion Justification: The sudden onset of eye redness, swelling, tearing after playing soccer strongly suggests trauma; outdoor activity increases risk for a foreign body or corneal abrasion, which typically causes redness, tearing, and discomfort.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (allergic or infectious) Justification: The eye symptoms of redness and tearing can also be caused by conjunctivitis, especially if irritants or allergens are involved; however, the recent activity hints trauma as primary.  3. Diagnosis: Orbital trauma with periorbital edema Justification: Mechanical injury from soccer could lead to eyelid swelling and redness; though not specified as pain or fracture, trauma-related swelling is plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness around the eye post-activity could be due to skin or eyelid infection, especially if there is local skin breach or contamination.  5. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Although less likely, symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling could overlap with glaucoma; however, absence of pain, visual disturbance, or hx of high intraocular pressure makes it less probable.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague terms (\"like some crampy feeling,\" \"maybe indigestion\") to minimize early symptoms and more emotional, intense language (\"really sick,\" \"killing me,\" \"so swollen and tender\") to amplify current concerns. - Information flow: Initially reluctant to share specific details about early symptoms, offering minimal information unless prompted repeatedly.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The predominant bias is **minimization of early symptoms** combined with **amplification** of current fears and pain, influenced likely by anxiety and distress. - Severity: **Moderate**, as she underreports early mild symptoms, which could lead to an underestimation of the progression timeline, while current descriptions are exaggerated. - Areas most affected: The timeline of symptom development and severity is biased, as she minimizes initial discomfort and overstates current severity. This affects the accurate assessment of disease progression. - Reliability: Her self-reporting shows moderate reliability\u2014early symptom data is likely understated, current discomfort possibly exaggerated due to anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She probably did experience more significant early symptoms than she reports, including persistent mild discomfort that she dismissed, which may have been a warning sign. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early cramping and discomfort, which she downplays, suggesting the initial period may have been more symptomatic and concerning. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current fears about severity and potential life-threatening complications appear exaggerated, possibly driven by anxiety. - True timeline: The actual progression may involve a gradual worsening from mild, tolerable symptoms to severe, urgent pain\u2014her initial reports underestimate this progression, likely due to minimization; her current fears and descriptions overstate her perceived severity, influenced by distress.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Traumatic conjunctivitis or ocular surface trauma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague, hedging phrases (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"just sort of\"), showing a tendency to soften or obscure details, while using emotionally charged words (\"really,\" \"awful\") to emphasize current distress. Her descriptions of early symptoms are minimized, reflecting possible reluctance to admit earlier issues. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to fully disclose early symptoms unless prompted, offering minimal details initially and elaborating more on current severe symptoms. Responses are organized but guarded. - Response style: Responses are concise, sometimes evasive, with a mix of elaboration when pressed on current issues but minimal details about initial onset, indicating possible discomfort or defensiveness about early neglect.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to specify initial symptom onset and duration; inconsistent detail about early discomfort suggests withholding or minimization. She appears to downplay or forget some details, perhaps to avoid admitting neglect. - Minimization behaviors: Describing early symptoms as \"not really bothering me much\" or \"sort of\" feelings suggests downplaying the significance of initial discomfort, potentially masking the true initial severity. - Amplification patterns: Her vivid, strong language about current pain (\"so bad,\" \"worst,\" \"really sharp\") suggests emotional exaggeration of current distress, possibly to gain urgency or reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: She may feel shame about neglecting initial symptoms or about her response to early discomfort, evidenced by vague language and reluctance to elaborate more. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about timing (\"a week ago,\" \"sometimes for a day or two\") indicates possible difficulty recalling precise details or intentional minimization. - Family influence: Minimal evidence; responses seem self-contained with no direct influence apparent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization, particularly regarding initial symptoms, likely driven by embarrassment or denial. - Severity: Moderate, as her current reporting of severe pain is vivid, but early histories are vague and understated, obscuring the full progression. - Areas most affected: The early symptom timeline and severity are most biased, potentially delaying diagnosis or influencing management decisions. - Reliability: Moderate to low for early history; better for current severe symptoms, but overall self-reporting should be corroborated with clinical findings and perhaps further history from family or records.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true duration and intensity of early symptoms, which may have been more severe or persistent, possibly indicating a longer disease course than reported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial mild discomfort that progressed silently or unnoticed could have been more severe, suggesting a delayed recognition. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be exaggerating her current distress to prompt urgent attention, which might affect clinical prioritization. - True timeline: The progression might have been more insidious than she admits; early symptoms could have been significant before rapidly worsening, suggesting a need for careful exploration beyond her initial reports.",
    "output": "THINKING: The current focus is to clarify remaining uncertainties about the onset, progression, and severity of initial symptoms, which seem minimized or vague. Since she reports severe current symptoms but has been less detailed about her early discomfort, I need to probe whether her initial mild sensations could have been more significant than she admits, or if her condition has worsened rapidly. Understanding the timeline and triggers will help confirm whether the presentation aligns with typical diagnostic criteria, such as for conjunctivitis or trauma. Additionally, assessing her perception of her symptoms and her emotional response will inform her readiness for discussing potential management strategies. Given her guarded responses, a focused, gentle approach that encourages elaboration without feeling confrontational is essential. I will target her recall about early symptoms, their severity, and any triggers, ensuring she feels understood and comfortable sharing potentially sensitive details. This will help determine if her early history aligns with the current clinical picture and will solidify the diagnosis.  QUESTION: \"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like your symptoms have become quite uncomfortable now. When you first started noticing any eye irritation or discomfort\u2014that is, a week or two ago\u2014can you tell me more about what you felt at that time? Specifically, do you recall how severe the irritation was back then compared to now, and whether you noticed anything that seemed to make it better or worse, like light, touch, or rubbing your eye?\"\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
