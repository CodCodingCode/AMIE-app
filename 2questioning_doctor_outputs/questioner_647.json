    "input": "The patient, likely a pediatric individual, reports experiencing itchy and greasy skin primarily on the face and head, accompanied by persistent scratching. Observed behaviors and descriptions are consistent with a dermatological condition affecting these areas. No systemic symptoms such as fever or sleep disturbance were reported but should be further assessed to identify any underlying or associated issues. Additional inquiries are needed to clarify the presence of systemic signs, the duration and progression of skin findings, and the impact on the patient's overall health and well-being.1. Diagnosis: Seborrheic dermatitis Justification: Characterized by greasy scales and erythema on the face and scalp, common in pediatric patients, especially infants and young children; presents with itchiness and greasy appearance.  2. Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis Justification: Common in children; may present with itchy, dry, and inflamed skin, often affecting the face; can coexist with seborrheic dermatitis but typically involves xerosis.  3. Diagnosis: Cradle cap (infantile seborrheic dermatitis) Justification: Typically seen in infants as greasy, yellowish scales on the scalp and face; many cases resolve spontaneously.  4. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis Justification: Allergic or irritant reaction causing localized itching and erythema; should be considered if exposure to potential irritants has occurred.  5. Diagnosis: Tinea capitis Justification: Fungal infection of the scalp presenting with scaling, itching, and possible follicular inflammation; may mimic seborrheic dermatitis but often involves hair loss.  6. Diagnosis: Bacterial folliculitis Justification: Presents with itchy, inflamed pustules or papules centered around hair follicles; greasy skin may predispose to bacterial overgrowth.  7. Diagnosis: Psoriasis (scalp) Justification: Presents with well-demarcated, thickened, silvery scales; less common in infants but can be mimicked by seborrheic dermatitis.  8. Diagnosis: Sebaceous hyperplasia Justification: Usually occurs in adults, presenting with small, yellowish papules; unlikely but considered in differential diagnoses involving sebaceous activity.  9. Diagnosis: Lichen simplex chronicus Justification: Persistent scratching can lead to thickened, lichenified skin, often secondary to underlying pruritus.  10. Diagnosis: Scalp psoriasis Justification: Similar to psoriasis but localized to the scalp; characterized by thick, silvery scales and erythema, less common in young children but important to consider.

Emotional expressions like crying or fussiness naturally reflect discomfort but do not indicate language bias. - Information flow: The patient shares symptoms spontaneously, suggesting a willingness or ability to report distress accurately within their developmental limits. - Response style: Responses are mostly non-verbal and immediate, typical for his age; there's no attempt to hide or distort feelings.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None evident; he reports symptoms clearly. - Minimization behaviors: Not present; descriptions indicate genuine discomfort and visible signs. - Amplification patterns: Absent; concern descriptions seem proportionate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; age-appropriate reactions. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight timeline confusion is age-appropriate; no severe inconsistencies. - Family influence: Parental concern is notable, but no evidence they are influencing his reports directly beyond caregiving context.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal bias; responses align with observable symptoms, appropriate for age. - Severity: Mild; communication is straightforward with no deception or minimization. - Areas most affected: Slightly uncertain about the precise timeline or severity of systemic involvement, but expected for an infant. - Reliability: High; given age and developmental status, responses are likely accurate representations of his condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific details about systemic illness severity, exact fever measures, overall health trajectory\u2014these are dependent on parental reporting. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not significantly; visible skin findings and distress support current reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Parental concern about severity might lead to slight overestimation, but the infant's own distress aligns with actual discomfort. - True timeline: Likely accurate; symptom progression over two weeks is consistent with the depiction, though recall bias is minimal at this age.  **Overall,** the communication from Ethan is consistent with his developmental level and appears truthful. The main biases are minimal, primarily due to the infant's limited capacity for intentional deception or minimization. Parental input plays a role but is not evidenced as distorting or biased in this interaction.",
    "output": "THINKING: The key information gaps include understanding the full scope of symptoms, such as whether there are any systemic signs like fever, sleep disturbances, or changes in appetite, and how the skin condition has affected the child's daily life. Although the report of itchiness and greasiness is useful, I need to explore the duration and progression of these symptoms in more detail, and how they impact the child's comfort. Since the patient is an infant, parental description is critical, and I should also gauge how the parents perceive the severity and their concerns, as well as any treatments already attempted. My goal here is to build rapport with the parents, gather detailed information about the timeline and associated features, and understand their main worries to inform possible diagnoses and next steps.  QUESTION STRATEGY: I need an open-ended question targeting the child's overall experience, focusing on symptom progression, associated signs (like fever or sleep issues), and the impact on daily comfort or routines. Given the developmental stage, I will frame the question to the parent caregiver in a gentle, non-leading way that encourages detailed responses and expresses genuine interest. This will help uncover details about systemic features and the child's general well-being, providing data relevant for differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your baby has been feeling lately\u2014have you noticed any changes in his energy, sleep, or any other new symptoms along with the skin troubles?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Red, tearing eye following physical activity is typical; common and usually benign, especially in settings of exposure.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Eye trauma during playing soccer can cause superficial corneal injury presenting with redness, tearing, and swelling.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid hematoma or contusion Justification: Swelling after physical impact suggests eyelid trauma, common in contact sports.  4. Diagnosis: Eyelid laceration Justification: Possible trauma-induced cut leading to swelling and redness; need to rule out open injury.  5. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden swelling and redness post-activity could represent bleeding beneath conjunctiva from minor trauma.  6. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Although chronic, inflammation of eyelid margins can cause redness and tearing; less likely acutely but possible.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Eye swelling and redness might indicate deeper infection; less common without systemic symptoms but important to consider.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less likely given the acute trauma, but inflammation within the eye can cause redness and tearing.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (angle-closure) Justification: Sudden redness with swelling could suggest acute angle-closure glaucoma, but more symptoms like pain and visual loss are usually prominent.  10. Diagnosis: Globe rupture Justification: A serious, though less likely without explicit trauma details, but must rule out in post-trauma eye injury.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The parent uses vague, non-specific language (\"maybe last week\", \"kind of greasy\") rather than detailed, clinical descriptions. Emotional descriptors like \"worse and worse\" show concern but lack precision. - Information flow: The parent responds readily but in a scattered, imprecise manner, indicating a tendency to avoid details or forget specifics. Responses are organized enough but lack factual accuracy. - Response style: Generally minimal and non-elaborate, with brief answers that suggest discomfort or uncertainty about specifics; avoidance of detailed timelines.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The parent\u2019s uncertainty about timing indicates possible hesitation to share precise details\u2014this could be genuine forgetfulness or a subtle form of withholding to simplify the narrative. - Minimization behaviors: The vague references (\"kind of greasy\", \"worse and worse\") may downplay the severity or speed of symptom progression. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s limited evidence of exaggeration; if anything, the parent seems cautious about overreporting severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs, but the hesitation suggests some discomfort about providing detailed medical history. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear evidence of timeline confusion and difficulty in recalling exact onset, indicating moderate memory or comprehension issues. - Family influence: Not explicitly evident, but the parent\u2019s reliance on approximate language could reflect an influence of emotional distress affecting factual recall.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Timeline confusion/memory bias, as shown by the uncertain and vague descriptions. - Severity: Moderate, because this impairs the clinician\u2019s ability to precisely assess disease progression and urgency. - Areas most affected: Onset timing, symptom progression, associated systemic features like fever; these are core for diagnosis and treatment planning. - Reliability: They provide overall symptoms reasonably but lack precise detail, so their self-report should be supplemented with clinical observations and parents\u2019 concerns.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact onset date and the specific sequence of symptoms (e.g., when fever began), which are vital for understanding severity and progression. - Symptoms probably minimized: The parent might underreport the speed and extent of worsening, especially systemic signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Likely to overemphasize the uncertainty or worry about the timeline rather than the severity, but their reactions suggest genuine concern. - True timeline: The actual disease progression might have been faster and more severe, considering the typical course of severe skin infections in infants with immune compromise, but the parent\u2019s recount obscure this.  In sum, this parent exhibits moderate memory/timeline confusion bias, impacting detailed history-taking.

    "input": "The patient presents with eye redness, swelling, and itching that likely began approximately 4 to 7 days ago, though earlier mild symptoms may have occurred but were underrecognized or unnoticed. Currently, symptoms include significant redness, puffiness, heat sensation, and discomfort, indicating ongoing inflammation. The initial mild symptoms, possibly present before the patient reports, may have been less severe or overlooked. The progression appears steady, and the patient may be experiencing more severe symptoms than initially described, with potential associated symptoms such as tearing or light sensitivity to be further evaluated.1. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: The patient exhibits eye redness, swelling, and itching persisting over several days, which are classic signs of allergic conjunctivitis. The progression aligns with an allergic reaction, especially if there were prior mild symptoms unnoticed. Itching is a hallmark feature of allergy. No mention of purulent discharge or systemic illness reduces the likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis. The presence of swelling and redness without systemic signs points strongly toward allergy.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Viral conjunctivitis can cause redness, watery discharge, and sometimes mild swelling, often lasting several days. If the patient reports tearing or light sensitivity, these features could suggest a viral origin. However, the predominant itching and swelling favor allergy over viral etiology, placing it as a less likely but possible diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Bacterial conjunctivitis typically presents with purulent discharge, which is not described here. The absence of systemic symptoms and lack of discharge makes this less probable; however, it remains in the differential due to overlapping conjunctival redness.  4. Diagnosis: Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis Justification: Significant eyelid swelling and redness could suggest cellulitis, but usually this involves more painful, tender, and sometimes febrile presentation with systemic illness signs. The absence of systemic symptoms or fever makes this diagnosis less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Episcleritis or scleritis Justification: These are more rare causes for isolated redness and swelling with discomfort. They typically involve more intense pain and may be associated with systemic autoimmune disease, which hasn't been indicated. Given the clinical picture, they are less probable.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient\u2019s use of vague, non-committal phrases such as \"maybe,\" \"sort of,\" and \"kind of\" demonstrates a tendency to hedge or minimize.

They combine emotional language with non-specific terms, possibly reflecting anxiety or a desire to avoid detailed recounting. - Information flow: Responses are generally brief and somewhat scattered, showing reluctance or difficulty in providing clear timelines or sequences of events. They tend to answer questions minimally, only volunteering additional details when prompted, and often hedge their responses, indicating hesitance or confusion. - Response style: The patient\u2019s answers are inconsistent and often non-specific, showing a pattern of response hesitation, suggestive of discomfort, uncertainty, or possibly an attempt to avoid revealing full details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The vagueness about when symptoms exactly started, using \"maybe last week or maybe two weeks ago,\" indicates withholding precise information, possibly to avoid worry or judgment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the timeline and initial severity (e.g., \u201cit\u2019s been getting worse,\u201d but without exact details) suggests they might be minimizing early symptoms or their significance. - Amplification patterns: The expression \u201cit\u2019s getting worse\u201d could be genuine but may also serve to emphasize concern or draw attention to severity they've perceived. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but reluctance to specify precise details might reflect discomfort with admitting the true timeline or extent initially. - Confusion/memory issues: The inconsistent referencing of symptom onset (\u201cmaybe last week or maybe two weeks ago\u201d) indicates some confusion or difficulty in recalling the exact timeline, possibly due to stress or overload. - Family influence: The parents are doing most of the talking; their own worried tone might influence the patient's responses, making them hesitant to define details clearly.

    "input": "The patient presents with ocular and facial inflammatory symptoms characterized by redness, swelling, heat sensation, and itching, with an estimated onset approximately one to two weeks prior, though earlier mild signs may have been unnoticed or underreported. The progression appears gradual, with current symptoms indicating ongoing inflammation. Associated features likely include eye discomfort and facial skin changes, but additional related symptoms such as tearing or light sensitivity require further assessment. Communication biases suggest that some initial mild or intermittent symptoms may have been minimized or overlooked, and current severity could be under- or overestimated emotionally. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to clarify the full extent, timing, and associated symptoms of the condition.1. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis with Periorbital Dermatitis Justification: The predominant symptoms of redness, itching, and swelling suggest an allergic etiology; the timeline of one to two weeks aligns with typical allergic or environmental responses. The heat sensation and progression support an allergic or inflammatory process affecting both ocular surfaces and adjacent skin, especially if exposure to allergens or irritants occurred.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic or Atopic Dermatitis involving Eyelids and Face Justification: The description of facial swelling, redness, heat, and itching is characteristic of atopic dermatitis, which often involves the periocular skin. The gradual onset over a week or two suggests a hypersensitivity reaction, possibly exacerbated by environmental or irritant exposures.  3. Diagnosis: Chalazion or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction with Secondary Inflammation Justification: Chronic eyelid inflammation and swelling are signs; if the symptoms include localized eyelid swellings with redness and warmth, this could explain some ocular surface discomfort, especially if earlier unnoticed. However, this may not explain the facial skin symptoms fully unless there's secondary dermatitis.  4. Diagnosis: Preseptal Cellulitis Justification: The facial swelling and redness, along with heat and possible pain, could indicate a superficial eyelid or periorbital cellulitis, especially if the inflammation is localized around the eyelids with no systemic symptoms like fever. The subacute progression fits, but the itching suggests allergy more than infection.  5. Diagnosis: Seborrheic Dermatitis Justification: Facial redness and swelling, particularly involving the eyelids and face, with gradual development, may represent seborrheic dermatitis, which tends to cause greasy, flaky, erythematous skin, often involving eyelid margins. The lack of systemic signs and the subacute course support this less aggressive inflammatory skin disorder.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The parent uses vague, uncertain phrases (\"maybe last week,\" \"not sure,\" \"kind of slow\") that obscure the exact timeline, possibly to avoid over- or under-stating details. Emotional language reflecting worry is present but not overly explicit. - Information flow: Responses are scattered and inconsistent regarding timing; they tend to hedge, indicating difficulty with recall or discomfort in precise disclosure. When prompted, they provide tentative details, but overall the info is fragmented. - Response style: The parent responds with minimal elaboration, often ambiguous, and avoids providing definitive chronology unless specifically asked. This pattern suggests difficulty organizing or recalling information under pressure.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The parent hesitates and qualifies their answers to questions about timing, indicating they might be withholding or struggling to remember exact details. - Minimization behaviors: They phrase symptoms mildly (\"kind of greasy,\" \"maybe two weeks ago\") which could serve to lessen perceived severity or to avoid alarm. - Amplification patterns: Slight exaggerations like \"really bad quick\" could reflect emotional distress rather than factual accuracy, amplifying concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and hedging may reflect discomfort in fully disclosing or owning the details, possibly shame or concern about judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear inconsistency and uncertainty about when symptoms started highlight cognitive difficulty with recall. - Family influence: Not explicit but the frequent hedging may be influenced by anxiety or uncertainty from familial concerns.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology/confusion bias dominates, as the parent cannot produce a clear, consistent timeline. - Severity: Moderate, because this impairs accurate assessment of disease progression but doesn't fully distort other symptom reports. - Areas most affected: The timeline of initial onset and progression, critical for assessing severity and urgency, is most biased. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are fragmented and rely heavily on vague, hedged language, warranting corroboration through direct observation or records.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact dates of symptom onset, sequence of symptom worsening, initial severity, and response to treatment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial discomfort or severity may be underreported, as the parent downplays early symptoms or difficulty recalling them. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about worsening might inflate perceived severity, but overall their responses are cautious and uncertain. - True timeline: The actual progression likely started earlier and was more gradual, but parental confusion leads to uncertainty, obscuring the true course.",

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The parent hesitates and qualifies their answers to questions about timing, indicating they might be withholding or struggling to remember exact details. - Minimization behaviors: They phrase symptoms mildly (\"kind of greasy,\" \"maybe two weeks ago\") which could serve to lessen perceived severity or to avoid alarm. - Amplification patterns: Slight exaggerations like \"really bad quick\" could reflect emotional distress rather than factual accuracy, amplifying concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and hedging may reflect discomfort in fully disclosing or owning the details, possibly shame or concern about judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear inconsistency and uncertainty about when symptoms started highlight cognitive difficulty with recall. - Family influence: Not explicit but the frequent hedging may be influenced by anxiety or uncertainty from familial concerns.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology/confusion bias dominates, as the parent cannot produce a clear, consistent timeline. - Severity: Moderate, because this impairs accurate assessment of disease progression but doesn't fully distort other symptom reports. - Areas most affected: The timeline of initial onset and progression, critical for assessing severity and urgency, is most biased. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are fragmented and rely heavily on vague, hedged language, warranting corroboration through direct observation or records.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact dates of symptom onset, sequence of symptom worsening, initial severity, and response to treatment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial discomfort or severity may be underreported, as the parent downplays early symptoms or difficulty recalling them. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about worsening might inflate perceived severity, but overall their responses are cautious and uncertain. - True timeline: The actual progression likely started earlier and was more gradual, but parental confusion leads to uncertainty, obscuring the true course.",

    "input": "The patient is an infant presenting with a one to two-week history of ocular and facial inflammation characterized by redness, swelling, and a sensation of heat and itchiness. The clinical features suggest a persistent inflammatory process with a gradual onset, potentially exacerbated by environmental exposures such as outdoor play or contact with certain objects. The initial symptoms may have been mild and underreported, with current symptoms representing ongoing or worsening inflammation. Additional signs such as tearing and light sensitivity could be present but are not clearly reported. Further structured assessment is needed to clarify the full symptomatology, triggers, and severity due to communication biases impacting the history.Allergic conjunctivitis or dermatitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient frequently uses vague, non-specific terms like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" and \"probably,\" indicating discomfort or difficulty in providing precise details. When describing symptoms, the language oscillates between mild descriptors (\"more red,\" \"more bump\") and uncertain estimates, reflecting either genuine recall problems or a tendency to downplay. - Information flow: The responses are somewhat scattered with gaps\u2014volunteered information about rash appearance and general timeline but reluctance to specify exact dates or triggers. They tend to answer questions with ambiguity and hedge responses, showing hesitance. - Response style: The responses are minimal and cautious, often emphasizing uncertainty (\"I think,\" \"maybe,\" \"not really sure\"), and avoid definitive statements. They shift focus from specific chronological details to overall feelings (\"it started slow,\" \"got really bad\"), suggesting difficulty in precise recall.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient appears to avoid confirming specific exposure details, such as exact timing of symptom onset and activity-related triggers. Their uncertain language could be a deliberate withholding or genuine confusion. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions of symptoms as \"more red\" or \"more bump\" without alarming adjectives suggest an intent to present their condition as less severe than perceived. They do not specify duration of worsening or quantify symptoms precisely. - Amplification patterns: There is little clear evidence of over-exaggeration; however, the emphasis that symptoms \"got really bad\" quickly and \"feel worse now\" might be reactive exaggeration related to distress rather than factual severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the frequent hedging could indicate discomfort in admitting full extent or responsibility for triggers. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear difficulty in establishing a timeline, with repeated uncertainty about dates and sequence, points to possible genuine memory issues or intentional vagueness. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but the patient\u2019s responses might reflect parental influence or pressure to not admit certain exposures.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be confabulation or memory difficulty accentuated by emotional distress, leading to vague or inconsistent responses. - Severity: Moderate, since the patient exhibits both confusion and potential strategic minimization, which could impact accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: The timeline of symptom progression and external triggers (e.g., outdoor exposure) are most biased, impacting understanding of disease course. - Reliability: Moderately unreliable; responses are affected by confusion and possible intentional vagueness, thus requiring corroboration with caregiver reports and clinical findings for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timing, specific activities or exposures that precipitated symptom worsening, and detailed progression are probably underreported or unclear. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity and duration of symptoms, especially regarding the rapidity of progression and specific triggers, are likely understated. - Concerns probably amplified: The actual extent of discomfort or danger might be underappreciated, as the patient may be minimizing distress to cope with confusion or discomfort. - True timeline: The actual clinical progression may be more straightforward but is obscured by the patient's difficulty in chronological recall, potentially causing underestimation of the urgency or severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: <In this stage, I need to clarify the timeline and specific features of the infant\u2019s ocular and facial symptoms, given the vague and hedging responses from previous questions. To confirm a diagnosis like allergic conjunctivitis, I should focus on details that differentiate it from other causes, such as infection or contact dermatitis. Since the parent shows uncertainty and minimal specifics, a question that gently prompts for a narrative while honing in on key diagnostic criteria\u2014like the presence of itching, severity, and pattern\u2014is needed. Also, exploring any exposure details that might have been overlooked is important, but I must phrase it in a non-confrontational way to accommodate hesitations. This will help confirm whether typical allergic features are present and whether there\u2019s any red flag for other causes, thereby moving closer to diagnostic certainty and preparing for treatment discussion.>  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact timing of symptom onset, consistency of symptoms, specific triggers, and details about itching or tearing. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm allergy-related features (itching, bilateral redness), rule out infection or dermatitis, assess severity and impact. - Patient factors: Hesitant speech, vague descriptions, possible discomfort or confusion, requiring careful, open-ended, yet focused prompts. - Interview phase goals: Gather precise symptom timeline, identify characteristic features, explore triggers, and assess the parent\u2019s understanding and concerns for shared management planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused but open-ended to allow elaboration while targeting key features. - Information target: Timing, symptom characteristics (itchiness, severity), triggers, pattern, and impact. - Communication approach: Gentle, collaborative, ensuring the parent feels safe to share details without pressure. - Expected value: Clarify critical diagnostic features, confirm or exclude key differentials, and identify concerns for shared decision-making.\nANSWER: \u201cBased on what you've shared so far, I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about how your baby\u2019s eye symptoms have been behaving. Can you tell me, when the redness and swelling first started\u2014was it something you noticed happening slowly over a few days, or did it seem to come on more suddenly? Also, during the times when his eyes or face looked more swollen or red, did you notice if he was scratching his eyes a lot, or if he seemed bothered by any particular sensations like itching or tearing? And have you observed whether certain activities or environments seem to make his symptoms better or worse?\u201d",
