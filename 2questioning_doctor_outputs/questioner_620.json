    "input": "The patient, a young adult female, presents with social anxiety symptoms including nervousness, physical sensations such as facial burning and sweating, and fear of judgment in social situations. Although she reports these symptoms as distressing, her communication style suggests she may be minimizing their severity and extent. Objective indicators indicate that she likely experiences frequent and intense panic episodes that contribute to significant social avoidance and impairment. Additional emotional symptoms, such as low mood or depression, may be present but are not explicitly disclosed. Her symptom onset appears gradual over the past two years, with possible recent worsening, yet the true severity and impact are probably greater than the patient initially reports. Further detailed assessment is necessary to quantify symptom frequency, functional impairment, and emotional status.1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Justification: Core symptoms include persistent fear of social situations, physical sensations such as facial burning and sweating, and significant social avoidance; onset over two years aligns with typical development, and the severity appears substantial given impairment.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: Objective indicators suggest frequent and intense panic episodes contributing to social avoidance; physical symptoms like facial burning and sweating are characteristic of panic attacks, which may occur unexpectedly or in social contexts.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: Possible pervasive worry and physical symptoms across various contexts; some symptoms overlap with social anxiety and panic, but if worry is more diffuse, GAD remains plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder Justification: Low mood or depressive symptoms may be present but are not explicitly disclosed; depressive symptoms can coexist with anxiety disorders, and social withdrawal might be secondary.  5. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia Justification: Less likely as the primary issue unless social situations are specifically feared over other contexts; not detailed in the vignette.  6. Diagnosis: Agoraphobia Justification: Typically involves fear of places or situations where escape might be difficult; no specific evidence from the vignette supports this as primary.  7. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Justification: No history of trauma or relevant triggers noted; less likely.  8. Diagnosis: Somatic Symptom Disorder Justification: Physical sensations may be somatic manifestations, but these are better explained within the context of anxiety disorders rather than primary somatic concerns.  9. Diagnosis: Bipolar Disorder Justification: No episodes of mood elevation or history of mood swings noted; less likely based on presentation.  10. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Justification: Absence of psychotic symptoms, disorganized thinking, or hallucinations makes this diagnosis improbable in this context.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague, softening language like \"just\" and \"kind of,\" which minimizes the perceived severity of her symptoms. She employs emotional descriptors (\"burning face,\" \"start to sweat\") to convey distress but avoids explicit clinical terminology. - Information flow: Her responses are hesitant and somewhat scattered; she offers basic information but refrains from elaborating on the depth or impact of her social anxiety, indicating reluctance or embarrassment. Responses are generally organized but limited in detail. - Response style: She is minimally elaborate, often pausing or trailing off, and prefers short, cautious responses. Her tone and speech indicate hesitations and an emotional overlay, consistent with anxiety-driven communication.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evident in her guarded responses and vagueness about the extent or duration of her symptoms. Her reluctance to fully describe her social avoidance suggests she may be hiding the true severity. - Minimization behaviors: The repeated use of \"just\" and vague timing (\"like this for a couple of years\") hints at subconscious downplaying of her experiences, possibly to avoid stigma or shame. - Amplification patterns: Certain physical symptoms (\"burning face,\" \"start to sweat\") are emphasized, which could reflect actual panic episodes or serve as emotional expressions of her distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation, soft-spoken tone, and avoidance of eye contact coupled with feelings of embarrassment suggest she feels shame about her symptoms and fears judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies in reporting timeline (\"a couple of years,\" sudden worsening \"last semester\") suggest some difficulty with precise recall or an attempt to frame her experience in a manageable way. - Family influence: Her family\u2019s report of her social fears and their protective attitude likely reinforce her reticence, possibly contributing to her reluctance to disclose full details.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: \"Information withholder\" bias, as she appears to minimize her symptoms and withhold certain aspects due to embarrassment or shame. - Severity: Moderate bias, because she communicates distress but consistently underreports the full impact; her hesitance and vagueness obscure the severity. - Areas most affected: Her actual level of social impairment and physical panic symptoms are likely underestimated. Her emotional burden may be more profound than indicated. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat compromised\u2014likely underestimating her distress and impairment but accurately conveying her emotional discomfort.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably experiencing more intense panic episodes, avoidance behaviors, and impairment in daily functioning than she admits, especially concerning school attendance and social participation. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, or extreme avoidance are likely more severe, yet she downplays these. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about judgment and feeling \"weird\" are valid but possibly magnified by her anxious perception; her concern about being different is genuine but may be heightened. - True timeline: Her symptoms likely worsened more abruptly around last semester with increasing severity, but she traces her distress loosely over a longer period, possibly underestimating recent escalation.",
    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration phase, I need to gently deepen my understanding of her social anxiety symptoms, their overall impact, and her personal perspective, while encouraging elaboration without leading or pressuring her. Since she uses vague language and minimizes her symptoms, I should craft an open-ended question that invites her to describe her experiences in her own words, focusing on how social situations feel for her, how often she notices these feelings, and how they affect her daily life. This will help fill in gaps about severity, frequency, and functional impairment. Also, it may help her feel more comfortable sharing by validating her experience and demonstrating genuine interest.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact details about her social situations, frequency and severity of symptoms, impact on daily functioning, and emotional experience. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm severity and impairment levels, gather more context about panic episodes, and explore her personal view of her social fears. - Patient factors: Her reluctance and minimization suggest she might feel shame or embarrassment; questions should be non-threatening and empathetic. - Interview phase goals: Establish rapport, explore her subjective experience of social anxiety, and understand her perception of how it affects her.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Deeply open-ended to encourage her to elaborate on her experience. - Information target: Her personal description of social anxiety, how it started, what it feels like, and its effects. - Communication approach: Use gentle language, normalize her experience, and express curiosity to foster trust. - Expected value: Gaining richer narrative details that clarify the severity, course, and personal impact, informing potential diagnoses like social anxiety or panic disorder.\nANSWER: \"Could you tell me more about what it's been like for you when you're in social situations?

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, characterized by intense nervousness, physical sensations such as facial burning, sweating, and difficulty breathing during social interactions. She exhibits avoidance behaviors and a desire to withdraw in social situations. Communication patterns suggest her symptoms are likely more intense and frequent than she verbally reports, potentially including unrecognized panic episodes and underlying emotional distress. The onset appears gradual over the past two years, with possible recent worsening. Further assessment is needed to quantify the severity, identify panic episodes, and evaluate emotional wellbeing.1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder Justification: The primary presentation involves intense nervousness, physical symptoms during social interactions, avoidance behaviors, and a gradual onset over two years, aligning with social anxiety disorder.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: Symptoms like difficulty breathing, facial burning, and sweating could indicate unrecognized panic episodes, which are common in panic disorder, often comorbid with social anxiety.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's ongoing emotional distress and physical symptoms may extend beyond social situations, which is characteristic of GAD.  4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia Justification: If symptoms are limited to particular social situations, this could be a specific social-related phobia, though the broad presentation suggests social anxiety.  5. Diagnosis: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Justification: Physical sensations like facial burning and distress may reflect preoccupations with appearance, but less likely when social anxiety is predominant.  6. Diagnosis: Medical causes (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmia) Justification: Physical symptoms overlap with medical conditions causing adrenergic symptoms but are less likely given the context and gradual onset.  7. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Anxiety Justification: Substance use can cause anxiety symptoms, but none are indicated in the vignette.  8. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Justification: The presentation does not specify trauma history; less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder Justification: Social avoidance can be part of ASD, but the description suggests anxiety rather than developmental disorder.  10. Diagnosis: Malingering or Factitious Disorder Justification: No evidence suggests symptom fabrication; highly unlikely.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Her speech is characterized by vagueness and minimization, such as \"just get really nervous,\" which can obscure her true level of distress. She employs emotional descriptors but in a cautious manner, reflecting discomfort with fully revealing her experiences. - Information flow: Responses are generally reluctant and brief, indicating she may be withholding or hesitant to fully disclose her inner state. She tends to answer the question directly but stops short of elaborating, possibly avoiding embarrassment. - Response style: Her style is minimalistic and hesitant, often pausing mid-sentence to gather courage or hide feelings. She avoids elaboration, which limits understanding of the full scope of her anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her reluctance to describe specific episodes in detail and her \"just get really nervous\" responses suggest she is withholding deeper feelings or severity. - Minimization behaviors: Her frequent use of \"just\" diminishes the apparent severity of her symptoms, probably to shield herself from shame or stigma. - Amplification patterns: Vivid, intense descriptions of physical sensations may be exaggerated by her anxious state, serving as emotional amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation, brief responses, and avoidance of eye contact suggest discomfort and shame about her symptoms, possibly discouraging full disclosure. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence of memory lapses; her timeline seems consistent but her vague descriptions imply discomfort rather than actual cognitive issues. - Family influence: Her family communications might reinforce her anxiety, possibly increasing her tendency to minimize or overstate symptoms out of concern or protective instincts.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: *Minimization*, as she downplays her symptoms with words like \"just\" and \"really\" but still describes significant physical distress. - Severity: *Moderate*, because her responses are somewhat truthful but show tendency toward under- or overstatement influenced by discomfort. - Areas most affected: Her internal emotional states and physical symptoms, which she may be underreporting or exaggerating depending on her emotional comfort at the moment. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report contains genuine distress but is filtered through her emotional shield, so clinical interpretation should consider possible under- or overstatement.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper feelings of shame or fear and the full extent of her physical and emotional symptoms might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her physical symptoms and distress severity could be greater than she admits, impairing her functioning more extensively. - Concerns probably amplified: Her focus on social judgment and \"disappearing\" might lead her to overemphasize particular fears, but underlying anxiety might be more pervasive. - True timeline: Her progression of symptoms seems consistent but may be more severe or pervasive than she communicates, given her tendency to soften descriptions and emotional discomfort.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with signs indicative of social anxiety disorder, characterized by physical symptoms such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and breathing difficulties during social interactions. She exhibits avoidance behaviors and a desire to conceal herself in social settings. Her responses suggest her symptoms are likely more intense and frequent than she verbally reports, with possible underlying panic episodes and significant emotional distress related to shame and fear of judgment. The onset appears gradual and worsening over the past two years, but specific timelines and symptom frequencies require further assessment.1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's pronounced anxiety during social interactions, avoidance behaviors, physical symptoms (facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulties), and emotional distress are hallmark features. The gradual worsening over two years indicates a chronic pattern consistent with social anxiety. The symptoms specifically triggered in social settings, rather than in other contexts, support this diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, trembling, breathing issues) could suggest panic episodes. However, these occur primarily during social interactions, and there is no evidence of spontaneous panic attacks outside social situations, making panic disorder less likely but still a consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient experiences significant anxiety, but the symptoms are specifically triggered in social settings rather than a pervasive worry across multiple domains. Her avoidance and specific situational anxiety suggest social anxiety rather than generalized anxiety.  4. Diagnosis: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Justification: Although facial burning and concern about appearance are noted, there is no evidence of preoccupations with specific body parts, nor compulsive behaviors or distortions related to appearance, making this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Avoidant Personality Disorder Justification: The avoidance behaviors and desire to conceal oneself fit this diagnosis; however, the episodic physical symptoms are more characteristic of anxiety\u2014personality disorder diagnosis would require broader pattern assessment, which the current data do not fully support, so it remains a lower probability.

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with symptoms suggestive of social anxiety disorder, characterized by physical signs such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing predominantly during social interactions or evaluative situations. She reports avoidance of social settings and feelings of extreme nervousness, but likely underestimates her internal distress and the frequency of panic symptoms, often minimizing or concealing episodes occurring when alone. These internal symptoms may include panic-like feelings, dizziness, chest tightness, or nausea, which she might be reluctant to acknowledge fully. Her symptoms have shown a gradual onset and worsening over the past two years, but her actual experience may be more severe than described. The underlying internal anxiety and physical symptoms are probably more pervasive, especially in solitary contexts, than her current reports suggest. Further assessment is recommended to explore these concealed symptoms and internal episodes.1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Justification: The primary features\u2014extreme nervousness, avoidance of social situations, physical symptoms such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat during social interactions\u2014are classic for social anxiety disorder. The gradual onset and worsening over two years support this diagnosis, which often involves internal distress that is minimized or concealed, consistent with the patient's reporting. Her symptoms are predominantly situational and linked to social evaluation, fitting the pattern of social phobia.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The mention of internal episodes including dizziness, chest tightness, and nausea suggests the presence of panic-like symptoms. These episodes may occur during social situations or even when alone, which could imply co-occurring panic disorder. The internal nature of these symptoms, their physical intensity, and reporting of rapid heartbeat support this interpretation.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Justification: Chronic anxiety that extends beyond social situations could be a component, especially considering the gradual worsening over time. Although less specifically focused on social contexts, GAD features include pervasive worry, which might underlie her social fears. However, given the prominence of situational social symptoms, GAD remains a less likely primary diagnosis but possible as a comorbid condition.  4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia (if social situations with certain targets are involved) Justification: If the patient's social anxiety is limited to specific contexts or feared stimuli (e.g., public speaking, performance), a specific social phobia could be considered. However, the generalized description suggests broader social anxiety rather than a narrowly focused phobia.  5. Diagnosis: Cardiac or Medical Condition (e.g., arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism) Justification: Physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and chest tightness could indicate cardiac arrhythmia or hyperthyroidism. However, the temporal pattern, situational triggers, and coexistence with anxiety symptoms make a primary psychiatric diagnosis more probable. Nevertheless, ruling out medical causes is necessary to ensure comprehensive care.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She often uses vague, non-specific phrases like \"maybe,\" \"sort of,\" or \"I think,\" indicating discomfort with specifics. Her tone is soft and hesitant, with frequent pauses, reflecting nervousness. - Information flow: She is reluctant to fully disclose details unless prompted, thus providing limited information initially and offering more only under repeated questioning. - Response style: Responses are minimalistic and cautious, tending toward avoiding elaboration, which suggests an effort to conceal the full extent of her internal experience.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her frequent use of uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"maybe\") and lack of concrete examples imply reluctance to fully share her experiences. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her symptoms by framing episodes as occasional or situational (\"more in certain situations\"), possibly to avoid seeming overly distressed or to prevent judgment. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; she actually seems to understate her symptoms' severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her soft voice, avoidance of eye contact, and avoidance of detailed descriptions reflect discomfort and possible shame regarding her anxiety. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about the frequency and context (\"I don\u2019t really notice it when I\u2019m alone\") suggests some confusion about her own experiences, potentially due to emotional overwhelm. - Family influence: Limited evidence, but her mentioning that her family reports anxiety and that she\u2019s been bullied indicates external factors impacting her responses, although she does not explicitly reflect family influence on her disclosures.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is information withholding with some minimization, driven by shame or fear of judgment about her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she provides some symptomatic information but is clearly holding back details, possibly to protect herself or avoid embarrassment. - Areas most affected: Her detailed internal experiences, especially regarding episodes when alone or less anxious, are probably underreported, which impacts a comprehensive understanding of her condition. - Reliability: Their self-report is somewhat limited; expect her to underrepresent or omit the full scope of her anxiety symptoms, so clinical judgment should consider this possible underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably not fully disclosing the frequency, severity, and contexts of her symptoms, especially when alone or in less controlled environments. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity and pervasiveness of her anxiety may be worse than she describes, particularly episodes outside social situations. - Concerns probably amplified: Her focus on specificSituations as triggers might overstate their importance and understate her internal distress when alone or in different settings. - True timeline: The progression from mild nervousness to intense anxiety likely occurred gradually; her report may skew recent severity as more pronounced than the initial development, possibly to rationalize her current state or due to emotional shielding.",

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her frequent use of uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t know,\" \"maybe\") and lack of concrete examples imply reluctance to fully share her experiences. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her symptoms by framing episodes as occasional or situational (\"more in certain situations\"), possibly to avoid seeming overly distressed or to prevent judgment. - Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; she actually seems to understate her symptoms' severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her soft voice, avoidance of eye contact, and avoidance of detailed descriptions reflect discomfort and possible shame regarding her anxiety. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about the frequency and context (\"I don\u2019t really notice it when I\u2019m alone\") suggests some confusion about her own experiences, potentially due to emotional overwhelm. - Family influence: Limited evidence, but her mentioning that her family reports anxiety and that she\u2019s been bullied indicates external factors impacting her responses, although she does not explicitly reflect family influence on her disclosures.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is information withholding with some minimization, driven by shame or fear of judgment about her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she provides some symptomatic information but is clearly holding back details, possibly to protect herself or avoid embarrassment. - Areas most affected: Her detailed internal experiences, especially regarding episodes when alone or less anxious, are probably underreported, which impacts a comprehensive understanding of her condition. - Reliability: Their self-report is somewhat limited; expect her to underrepresent or omit the full scope of her anxiety symptoms, so clinical judgment should consider this possible underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably not fully disclosing the frequency, severity, and contexts of her symptoms, especially when alone or in less controlled environments. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity and pervasiveness of her anxiety may be worse than she describes, particularly episodes outside social situations. - Concerns probably amplified: Her focus on specificSituations as triggers might overstate their importance and understate her internal distress when alone or in different settings. - True timeline: The progression from mild nervousness to intense anxiety likely occurred gradually; her report may skew recent severity as more pronounced than the initial development, possibly to rationalize her current state or due to emotional shielding.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with symptoms indicative of social anxiety disorder characterized by physical manifestations such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and breathing difficulties predominantly during social interactions. She reports avoidance behaviors and significant internal anxiety, though her communication suggests she may underreport the severity and frequency of panic episodes, especially those occurring when alone, which include dizziness and chest pounding. Her symptoms have been gradually worsening over approximately two years, but the true extent and impact of her autonomic and panic symptoms are likely more severe than she admits, affecting her social functioning and internal well-being.Social Anxiety Disorder with Panic Features ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient favors vague, tentative language (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"sometimes\"), indicating an attempt to modestly present her experiences but also revealing internal discomfort and uncertainty. Her emotional expression is mild but present (\"freaks me out\"), supporting her anxiety. - Information flow: Responses tend to be hesitant and incomplete; she often responds with minimal detail unless pressed, suggesting reluctance or difficulty in fully articulating her experience. - Response style: She employs brief, guarded answers with frequent pauses and hesitations, and she shows a tendency to avoid direct answers or commitment about the severity and frequency of her symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Vague descriptions, inconsistent reporting of symptom frequency, hesitation, and cautious language show she\u2019s withholding full details. - Minimization behaviors: She minimizes her physical symptoms, framing them as occasional or manageable (\"really dizzy,\" \"kind of scary\"), possibly underestimating their severity. - Amplification patterns: While she acknowledges that her symptoms have worsened, her overall tone avoids seeming overwhelmed, suggesting some degree of internal minimization. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation, avoidance of eye contact, and nervous speech indicate she feels embarrassed or ashamed about her symptoms or her social fears. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in timeline reporting (worsening \"lately\" vs \"a couple of years\") may reflect her nervousness and difficulty in recalling precise details. - Family influence: Family concerns are present in her background, but she does not seem directly influenced in her responses, rather, her own anxiety and discomfort shape her disclosures.  BIAS ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is *minimization combined with hesitancy*, as she intentionally soft-pedals her symptoms and responds vaguely due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Severity: Moderate, since responses are enough to obscure true symptom severity and frequency, affecting accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: The physical symptoms\u2014dizziness, heart pounding, and overall anxiety\u2014are most biased, likely underreported. - Reliability: Self-reporting is moderately unreliable; her tendency to downplay symptoms and speak hesitantly suggests her descriptions underrepresent the true extent of her experiences.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The actual intensity, frequency, and impact of her physical symptoms are probably greater than she admits, possibly leading to underestimation of her level of impairment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her reports of symptoms being occasional or not severe may mask significant distress, especially since she exhibits common internal cues of anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: She seems to over-focus on trying to moderate her answers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\"), which may inflate her sense of uncertainty but also hide the actual severity. - True timeline: Her progression is likely more rapid and extensive than she presents, with her initial nervousness possibly escalating into more disabling symptoms but she minimizes or omits these details.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: While she describes social symptoms and physical sensations, her reports suggest she may not fully acknowledge the severity or frequency of her panic episodes, especially those occurring when alone. Clarifying whether her physical symptoms\u2014like dizziness, chest pounding, or racing heart\u2014also happen outside social situations is critical to determine if panic attacks occur generally, not just in social contexts. - Diagnostic priorities: Understanding whether panic features are prevalent outside social situations impacts the differentiation between Social Anxiety Disorder with Panic features versus Panic Disorder. It\u2019s important to confirm if her autonomic symptoms happen in situations beyond social interactions. - Patient factors: Her hesitant, vague communication style indicates discomfort discussing her symptoms openly. Framing questions gently and collaboratively can help encourage more detailed disclosures. - Interview phase goals: Final clarification on the scope and severity of her physical symptoms, especially any panic episodes, and ensuring she comprehends the possible implications of her symptoms for diagnosis and treatment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, confirmatory question to determine if panic-like symptoms occur outside social contexts. An open-ended follow-up may be useful if initial answers are unclear. - Information target: Frequency, severity, and context of physical symptoms like dizziness, racing heart, trembling, and chest sensations outside social situations. - Communication approach: Use gentle, non-confrontational language, emphasizing collaboration: \u201cBased on what you've told me, I want to make sure I understand\u2014do you ever notice these feelings, like dizziness or a pounding heart, when you're alone or not around other people? Or do they mostly happen only when you're in social situations?\u201d - Expected value: This question will help confirm whether her panic episodes are situational or more generalized, refining the diagnosis and guiding treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing that. Just to make sure I understand correctly\u2014do you ever notice feelings like dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or trembling when you're by yourself or not around other people? Or have you mostly experienced these symptoms only during social situations? Exploring this can help us understand your experience better.\"",
