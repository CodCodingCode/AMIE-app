She does not report feeling unwell or other specific symptoms.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Amenorrhea due to pregnancy\nJustification: The absence of periods and body changes could suggest pregnancy, especially if the patient has missed periods and has signs such as breast tenderness or nausea. Although no specific symptoms are reported, pregnancy remains a primary consideration.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS commonly presents with irregular or absent periods, hirsutism, and body changes such as weight gain or acne. Even without explicit symptoms, it remains a common cause of amenorrhea.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Hypothalamic amenorrhea\nJustification: Stress, significant weight loss, excessive exercise, or emotional distress can impair hypothalamic function, leading to missed periods with minimal other symptoms.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian failure (premature ovarian insufficiency)\nJustification: Early decline in ovarian function can cause amenorrhea and body changes such as menopausal symptoms, even in young women.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)\nJustification: Thyroid disorders can disrupt menstrual cycles and cause bodily changes; hypothyroidism often causes amenorrhea and weight gain.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Hyperprolactinemia\nJustification: Elevated prolactin levels can suppress ovulation and cause amenorrhea; may be associated with galactorrhea or visual changes, which were not reported but should be considered.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting tumors\nJustification: Tumors producing excess androgens can lead to body changes such as virilization, irregular periods, or alopecia, though no specifics are provided.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Congenital or anatomical reproductive tract anomalies\nJustification: Structural abnormalities can lead to absent menstrual flow (primary amenorrhea) despite normal secondary sexual development.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Pituitary disorders (e.g., tumors, hypopituitarism)\nJustification: Pituitary pathology can disrupt the hormonal axis, leading to amenorrhea with possible other endocrine symptoms.\n\n10.

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient reports not getting her period and describes her body as different. She mentions feeling \"weird\" about her body but does not report any other symptoms, weight changes, hair growth, emotional issues, or changes in lifestyle. She has not been on any medications or supplements and has been experiencing increased stress, but nothing specific.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Amenorrhea secondary to Stress-Induced Hypothalamic Dysfunction  \nJustification: The patient reports recent increased stress and the absence of her period, with a subjective sense of her body feeling \"weird.\" Stress can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, leading to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The lack of other symptoms such as weight loss, hair changes, or emotional disturbances suggests a relatively subtle stress impact rather than an underlying structural or systemic disorder.\n\n2. Diagnosis: PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)  \nJustification: While the patient does not report overt hyperandrogenic features such as hirsutism or acne, PCOS can present with irregular or absent menses, especially early or mild forms. The subjective feelings of \"weirdness\" and perception of body changes could reflect early hormonal imbalances. However, without signs like insulin resistance or hyperandrogenism, this is less specific but still a plausible consideration.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Thyroid Dysfunction (e.g., hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)  \nJustification: Thyroid disorders often cause menstrual irregularities; hypothyroidism may cause amenorrhea, and hyperthyroidism may lead to irregular bleeding patterns. The patient reports feeling \"weird\" about her body, which could be associated with mood or systemic symptoms. The absence of overt thyroid symptoms makes this a moderate possibility but still worth considering.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)  \nJustification: POI can cause amenorrhea and hormonal changes, with the ovaries failing earlier than age-expected. The description of feeling \"different\" may reflect hormonal change, though generally, POI is associated with other features such as hot flashes or mood changes, which are not reported here. Still, it remains in the differential because of her amenorrhea and subjective feelings.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Psychological or Mood Disorder (e.g., Depression, Anxiety)  \nJustification: Stress and psychological factors can impact menstrual cycles via hypothalamic suppression. The patient's subjective \"weird\" feelings about her body, coupled with increased stress, suggest a potential psychological or emotional component influencing her reproductive health. Even in absence of overt symptoms, emotional well-being plays a critical role.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Stress-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea (functional hypothalamic suppression due to stress)\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (early or mild hormonal imbalance causing menstrual irregularity)\n3.

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient is 16 years old and reports never having had a menstrual period. She feels her body is different and feels \"weird\" about her body. She reports being \"more on edge\" lately but has not observed any other symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, or galactorrhea. She has not been on any medications or supplements and has experienced an increase in stress.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Primary Amenorrhea due to Turner Syndrome\nJustification: The patient is a 16-year-old with primary amenorrhea and atypical physical features (\"feels her body is different\"). Turner syndrome is a common genetic cause of primary amenorrhea in this age group, often presenting with short stature, neck webbing, and gonadal dysgenesis leading to ovarian failure. Given her age and description, genetic assessment could be warranted, especially if physical features suggest it.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome)\nJustification: She reports feeling \"more on edge\" (possibly indicative of mood or hormonal factors) and has never had a menstrual period, implying hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. Kallmann syndrome is characterized by absent or delayed puberty and loss of olfactory senses, with normal or delayed physical development otherwise. Stress may exacerbate her symptoms.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete AIS)\nJustification: Because she reports feeling different about her body and has not undergone menstruation, one possibility is complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, where individuals have a 46,XY karyotype but phenotypically female, with undescended testes and no menstruation. She may have normal female secondary sexual characteristics but lack uterine development.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Ovarian Failure\nJustification: An autoimmune etiology could lead to premature ovarian failure, resulting in amenorrhea. The patient's recent increase in stress could also be a contributing factor or a reaction to the amenorrhea, though autoimmune causes are more common in older women, they can sometimes present in adolescents.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Psychological/Functional Amenorrhea due to Stress\nJustification: She reports increased stress and mood changes (\"more on edge\") without other systemic symptoms. Psychological stress can disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function, leading to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, especially in adolescents experiencing significant emotional or psychological stress.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Primary amenorrhea due to Turner syndrome \u2013 genetic condition often presenting with physical features and gonadal dysgenesis, which could explain her atypical body perception.\n2. Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome) \u2013 features include absent pubertal development and possible olfactory deficits, fitting her primary amenorrhea and mood symptoms.\n3. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome \u2013 46,XY individual phenotypically female, with absence of menstruation and possible atypical body development.\n4. Autoimmune ovarian failure \u2013 immune-mediated destruction of ovarian tissue leading to amenorrhea, potentially triggered or exacerbated by stress.\n5. Stress-induced functional hypothalamic amenorrhea \u2013 chronic stress disrupting hypothalamic function, resulting in absent menses without structural or genetic abnormalities.\n\nThis list incorporates her physical presentation, emotional state, and the absence of menstrual bleeding, covering genetic, hormonal, structural, and psychological causes.

She feels her body is different and feels \"weird\" about her body. She reports feeling \"more on edge\" lately and has not observed hot flashes, night sweats, or galactorrhea. She has not been on any medications or supplements. Her stress level has increased recently.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome)\nJustification: The patient is a 16-year-old girl with breast and pubic hair development (puberty initiation) but has never had menarche, suggesting primary amenorrhea. The absence of secondary sexual characteristics progression beyond early development points toward hypogonadism. Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as Kallmann syndrome, results from GnRH deficiency, leading to incomplete sexual maturation and absent or delayed menstruation despite some pubertal signs. Her recent feelings of being \"weird\" and increased stress might be related to underlying hormonal deficiencies affecting her well-being.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete)\nJustification: The patient has breast development and pubic hair, indicating some estrogen and androgens activity, but lacks menstruation, which may suggest a chromosomal or receptor disorder. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) presents with a phenotypically female individual with normal breast development, little to no uterine structures, and absent menstruation. While the patient has breast tissue, absence of mention of internal reproductive organs makes this a consideration, pending further chromosomal and imaging studies.\n\n3. Diagnosis: M\u00fcllerian Agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome)\nJustification: The primary amenorrhea with normal breast and pubic hair development is characteristic. This condition involves congenital absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina, with normal ovarian function and secondary sexual characteristics. Her breast development and pubic/axillary hair suggest functional ovaries producing estrogen, consistent with M\u00fcllerian agenesis.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Functional or psychological/anxiety-related menstrual suppression\nJustification: Given recent increased stress, emotional factors could be contributing to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. Stress can suppress GnRH secretion, leading to decreased estrogen levels, no menarche, or secondary amenorrhea. Although her pubertal development indicates a more longstanding issue, stress might still influence menstrual regulation or delay onset.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Other forms of chromosomal or genetic disorders affecting sexual development\nJustification: Conditions such as Turner syndrome (45,X0) often present with primary amenorrhea, but usually with short stature and other phenotypic features. The current data does not mention short stature or additional features.

    "input": "Vignette:\nThe patient is 16 years old, has breast development and pubic hair, and has never had a period. She reports her body is different and feels \"weird\" about it. She has feelings of being \"more on edge\" and increased stress. She has had an ultrasound but does not know the results. She has not undergone genetic testing or blood tests. She has not experienced hot flashes, night sweats, or galactorrhea. She has not taken medications or supplements. She is willing to proceed with a karyotype test to confirm whether she has Turner syndrome.\nCurrent Estimated Diagnosis: THINKING:\nDiagnosis: Turner syndrome (45,X0 karyotype)\nJustification: The patient is a 16-year-old girl with breast development and pubic hair but has never experienced menstruation, indicating primary amenorrhea. She reports her body feels \"weird,\" which could relate to the phenotypic features associated with Turner syndrome. Although she has not undergone genetic testing yet, her characteristics\u2014absence of menarche despite normal breast development\u2014are suggestive of ovarian dysgenesis commonly caused by Turner syndrome. The fact that she is willing to proceed with karyotyping confirms that further testing will help establish or rule out this diagnosis. Her lack of hot flashes and other symptoms of ovarian failure is noted, but gonadal failure is characteristic of Turner syndrome, which often presents with streak gonads leading to primary amenorrhea and physical features.\n\nChecklist:\n- No diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No\n- No further clarification needed: No\n\nANSWER:\nTurner syndrome (45,X0)",
    "output": "THINKING: This question is crucial to verify whether the patient has Turner syndrome or another condition causing primary amenorrhea, especially since her physical development suggests ovarian insufficiency but she has not yet had confirmatory genetic testing. Understanding her chromosomal makeup will guide management, including hormone therapy and psychological support. \n\nANSWER: Would you be comfortable proceeding with a karyotype test to confirm whether she has Turner syndrome or an alternative chromosomal abnormality?",
