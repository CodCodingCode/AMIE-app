    "input": "Patient is a 72-year-old individual presenting with a primary concern of difficulty swallowing and a sensation of stomach tightness and bloating. While she reports that these symptoms began approximately two days ago and have worsened, her communication pattern suggests that her symptoms may be more prolonged and severe than described. Objective findings indicate she experiences significant dysphagia and gastrointestinal discomfort, which are likely impacting her nutritional intake and quality of life. There is a need to investigate additional symptoms such as pain, nausea, weight changes, or episodes of vomiting that she may be reluctant to disclose. Further detailed assessment is required to elucidate the full extent and chronicity of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Esophageal carcinoma Justification: Elderly patient with progressive dysphagia and sensation of stomach tightness suggests possible neoplasm obstructing the esophagus, especially given the age and symptom progression, which are common in esophageal cancers.  2. Diagnosis: Achalasia Justification: Dysphagia with chest tightness and bloating could reflect esophageal motility disorder like achalasia, which causes dysphagia and obstructive symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Esophageal stricture Justification: Progressive dysphagia and bloating in an older adult may be due to benign or malignant strictures resulting from chronic reflux or other scarring processes.  4. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with possible complication Justification: Chronic reflux can cause dysphagia and bloating, sometimes leading to strictures; common in older adults.  5. Diagnosis: Gastric outlet obstruction (e.g., pyloric stenosis, tumor) Justification: Bloating, stomach tightness, and dysphagia could indicate pyloric or gastric outlet obstruction, especially in a patient with possible underlying gastric pathology.  6. Diagnosis: Gastric or esophageal malignancy (other than carcinoma) Justification: Malignancy margins could involve gastric or esophageal regions, causing obstructive symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Esophageal or gastric motility disorder (e.g., diffuse esophageal spasm) Justification: Manifests with dysphagia and chest tightness; can cause similar symptoms but less common in this age group than structural causes.  8. Diagnosis: Functional dysphagia Justification: Less likely given the symptom severity and progression; usually not associated with physical findings like stomach tightness.  9. Diagnosis: Peptic stricture or ulcer Justification: Could cause dysphagia and discomfort, especially with history of reflux or NSAID use, though less likely without prior history.  10. Diagnosis: Cardiac causes (e.g., angina) Justification: While chest tightness can be cardiac, this presentation is primarily gastrointestinal, but ruling out cardiac ischemia is essential given age.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and emotionally charged language (\u201clike I swallowed a rock,\u201d \u201creally tight and bloated\u201d), signaling an attempt to communicate her discomfort without overstatement. She avoids explicit details about the severity, perhaps out of caution or embarassment. - Information flow: She provides core symptoms promptly but withholds specific details about her previous episodes or discomfort level unless prompted, indicating a tendency to hold back sensitive information. - Response style: Her responses are concise, with descriptive phrases that reveal concern but lack depth. She avoids elaborating on feelings or history unless directly asked, reflecting mild reticence.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not mention the previous episodes or the impact on her daily life unless asked, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose her health history. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her symptoms as \u201ca lot of trouble\u201d and \u201creally tight,\u201d but doesn\u2019t emphasize pain or urgency, possibly underplaying how serious her condition might be. - Amplification patterns: Descriptive metaphors like \u201clike I swallowed a rock\u201d serve to emotionally emphasize her discomfort, but may also be an unconscious attempt to be understood or solicit reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her soft tone and hesitance may indicate discomfort with discussing swallowing issues or bloating, which can be sensitive topics. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs. - Family influence: No evident influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Moderate under-reporting of symptom severity and history, combined with emotional amplification. The patient aims to convey enough concern but may be cautious to avoid seeming overly alarming. - Severity: Moderate; her wording suggests genuine discomfort, but she avoids emphasizing potential danger. - Most affected: The true impact of her symptoms and detailed history may be understated, affecting full assessment. - Reliability: Moderate, as her cautious language and emotional cues indicate she might be holding back some information or minimizing severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about prior similar episodes\u2019 severity, exact impact on her daily activities, and full health background. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may not fully express how much her symptoms are impairing her quality of life or their intensity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her metaphors and emotional tone indicate real concern, but possibly more worry than her words alone suggest. - True timeline: The progression is likely more acute or severe than expressed, given her tendency to be cautious and her expressions of worry.  Overall, her communication shows a pattern of cautious disclosure, emotional amplification to ensure concern is understood, and some degree of symptom minimization. Recognizing these biases is essential to accurately assess her clinical needs.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The key information gaps include the full history of her symptoms\u2014specifically, whether they are recent or have been present for some time, how severe they are, and if she has experienced similar issues before. Additionally, understanding how her symptoms affect her daily life and any associated symptoms like pain, nausea, or weight loss is crucial. - Diagnostic priorities involve clarifying whether her symptoms might stem from a structural, motility, or malignant process, and ruling out serious causes like esophageal or gastric malignancy or cardiac causes such as angina. - The patient's communication style appears cautious and somewhat reticent, meaning I should encourage her to elaborate without sounding intimidating or expectant of certain answers. - The goals at this stage are to open up her narrative further, gain insight into the duration, intensity, and impact of her symptoms, and explore any previous episodes or other associated factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - An open-ended question is best to allow her to express her experience freely. - The target is her detailed description of her symptoms, including their onset, progression, and how they influence her life. - The phrasing needs to be gentle, encouraging, and patient-centered, to foster trust and reduce discomfort. - This question will help build rapport and gather richer information relevant to formulating a differential diagnosis, especially distinguishing between acute versus chronic issues and assessing severity.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about when you first started noticing these symptoms, and how they have changed or affected you over time?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal Foreign Body Justification: Playing soccer can cause minor trauma leading to a foreign body in the eye, presenting with redness, swelling, tearing, and possibly discomfort. Common in athletes post-injury.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (Viral or Bacterial) Justification: Sudden onset redness and tearing are typical signs; recent activity may exacerbate irritation, with viral conjunctivitis being common in young, active individuals.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Trauma from play may cause superficial damage to the cornea, resulting in redness, tearing, and swelling, often with discomfort.  4. Diagnosis: Traumatic Uveitis Justification: Recent trauma can cause inflammation of the uveal tract, leading to redness, swelling, tearing, and possibly pain, though pain severity is not specified.  5. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Justification: Sudden eye redness after activity may result from small vessel rupture, presenting as localized redness with minimal symptoms, but swelling and tearing are less typical.  6. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Common in active individuals, presenting with redness, tearing, and swelling, often triggered or worsened by environmental factors.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital Contusion or Hematoma Justification: Blunt trauma may lead to swelling and redness around the eye, especially after contact sports, with possible diplopia or pain if severe.  8. Diagnosis: Periorbital Cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness around the eye could suggest infection of the eyelid tissues, especially if associated with trauma, though more systemic signs would typically be present.  9. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Less likely due to the absence of eye pain or visual changes described, but should be considered if symptoms escalate; trauma is less directly related.  10. Diagnosis: Retrobulbar Hemorrhage Justification: Severe trauma leading to bleeding behind the eye can cause swelling and redness, though less common without more trauma details.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient speaks clearly with vivid imagery, especially when describing her symptoms (\"like I swallowed a rock\"), indicating concern but not excessive exaggeration. She avoids minimizing her distress, instead emphasizing worse symptoms for impact. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with her timeline and main complaints, providing organized responses when questioned directly, demonstrating a cooperative pattern. - Response style: Her answers are concise and focused, with moderate elaboration on symptoms. She does not add tangential details unless prompted.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant withholding; she seems fully engaged in sharing her concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Not apparent; she emphasizes her discomfort vividly. - Amplification patterns: Possible slight exaggeration in her descriptive language (\"like I swallowed a rock\") to communicate severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; she appears straightforward about her problems. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; her timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: No external influences discernible; responses are internally consistent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight emotional amplification bias, causing her to vividly describe her symptoms, perhaps to seek reassurance. - Severity: Mild bias, as her descriptions are consistent and focused, with no signs of denial or withholding. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and urgency may be somewhat inflated. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy, though her vivid imagery slightly elevates perceived urgency.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be fully disclosing psychosocial stressors or her health fears; her focus is primarily on physical symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely, as her descriptions are detailed and expressive. - Concerns probably amplified: Yes, her expressive language suggests she perceives her condition as more severe than might be objectively evaluated. - True timeline: Accurate; initial symptoms began two days ago with progressive worsening consistent with her report.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's vivid description of her symptoms and recent activity, I need to explore how her experience is affecting her overall well-being and daily functioning.

    "input": "An elderly woman presenting with a two-day history of progressively worsening dysphagia characterized by food impaction sensation and significant abdominal bloating. She reports difficulty eating and drinking without increased discomfort but does not disclose systemic symptoms such as weight loss or fever. Her history of prior surgeries or gastrointestinal conditions remains incomplete. The clinical picture suggests an obstructive or motility-related process, but underlying severity and full extent of her condition require further history and examination, with particular attention to past medical history and additional systemic symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Esophageal carcinoma Justification: The progressive worsening of dysphagia over two days with food impaction sensation raises concern for obstructive neoplasm. Elderly age increases risk, and esophageal cancer commonly presents with painful or obstructive dysphagia. Although systemic symptoms like weight loss are not reported, the rapid progression warrants high suspicion for malignancy causing luminal narrowing or mass effect.  2. Diagnosis: Esophageal stricture Justification: An esophageal stricture, often benign and resulting from prior injury, inflammation, or GERD, can cause food impaction and dysphagia. In an elderly patient, strictures can develop insidiously but may acutely worsen with an irritant or progression of underlying disease. The presentation of food impaction aligns with a luminal narrowing causing mechanical obstruction.  3. Diagnosis: Achalasia Justification: Achalasia causes impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation and esophageal dilation, leading to dysphagia and food impaction. Though typically develops gradually over months, an acute exacerbation can occur, especially if there is superimposed inflammation or other factors. The symptom pattern fits, but the rapid progression is somewhat less typical, making it slightly less probable compared to structural obstructions.  4. Diagnosis: Esophageal diverticulum Justification: A pulsion or traction diverticulum can cause food retention and impaction, leading to dysphagia and bloating. Esophageal diverticula are more common in the elderly, especially thoracic (zenker\u2019s) diverticula, which can cause similar symptoms. The food impaction sensation and bloating support this, but it is less common as a primary cause than strictures or carcinoma.  5. Diagnosis: Gastric outlet obstruction Justification: Significant abdominal bloating and difficulty eating suggest possible gastric outlet obstruction; however, this usually involves postprandial vomiting and may have a different pattern. Given dominant esophageal symptoms and food impaction, it's less likely but included because of the bloating component. Additionally, secondary gastric dilation can contribute to bloating but does not fully explain dysphagia.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient's language is mostly vague and descriptive rather than clinical, with phrases like \"like I swallowed a rock\" conveying discomfort but avoiding alarm. Her emphasis on \"really tight and bloated\" signals concern but with guarded wording. There\u2019s subtle hesitance to elaborate on sensitive topics such as her prior surgeries unless explicitly asked. - Information flow: The patient is forthcoming about current symptoms but reluctant to share detailed past medical history unless pressed. Her responses suggest a tendency to withhold or minimize her background, possibly to avoid appearing overly worried or to prevent seeming overly dramatic. - Response style: She responds directly to symptom-related questions but is less verbose about history, indicating a pattern of guardedness. Her responses are concise, possibly to limit exposure of uncertainties or feelings of shame.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to specify her prior surgeries (\"I don\u2019t remember exactly what for\") and the limited detail about her Crohn\u2019s history suggest concealment of specifics. Fidgeting and slight eye contact avoidance could also reinforce this. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the perceived urgency, describing her symptoms as \"really tight and bloated\" without explicitly emphasizing distress or danger; she emphasizes that she just \"wants to know if it\u2019s serious\" rather than expressing panic. - Amplification patterns: She expresses concern about \"something serious\" like tumors or blockages, which may reflect genuine worry rather than exaggeration, but her cautious tone suggests she perceives her situation as quite severe. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and focus on discomfort, especially when discussing swallowing difficulties, may indicate some level of embarrassment or shame regarding her symptoms, especially dysphagia. - Confusion/memory issues: Vague recall of prior surgeries signals mild memory fuzziness, possibly influenced by age or stress. - Family influence: No direct evidence, though her reserved responses could be influenced by a general tendency toward cautiousness possibly shaped by her personality.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Predominantly, a mild underreporting/minimization bias, as she selectively discloses information and may understate the severity, particularly regarding past health history. - Severity: Moderate, because her current symptom report appears reliable but her background details are incomplete, which could affect full understanding. - Areas most affected: Her medical history and perceived severity of her condition are most biased because she withholds or minimizes details that could alter assessment. - Reliability: Her current symptom description is fairly trustworthy, but her background information warrants corroboration for comprehensive evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details of her prior surgeries and her overall health status, which could influence her risk profile. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of her condition might be greater than expressed, especially regarding her past health and how urgently she should be managed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of serious blockage or tumor may lead to heightened anxiety, possibly causing overestimation of immediate threat but also compelling her to seek help. - True timeline: Symptoms are likely slowly progressing over the two days, but her guarded responses may obscure the full extent of their impact, making it necessary to probe further for a complete picture.",

Assessing for weight change or systemic signs would help prioritize diagnosis. - Patient factors: Her communication appears guarded; she minimizes details about past medical history, possibly out of embarrassment or confusion. Her responses are concise, so questions must be clear yet gentle to encourage elaboration without provoking anxiety. - Interview phase goals: Narrowing possible causes for the acute worsening of dysphagia, uncovering past medical history relevant to gastrointestinal conditions, and clarifying the presence of systemic or associated symptoms that might suggest severity or complicating factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions to explore her medical history and symptom context, coupled with some clarify questions about associated features. - Information target: Details about her previous GI surgeries or diagnoses, prior episodes of dysphagia, associated gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms, and any recent changes in weight or eating habits. - Communication approach: Use soft, non-judgmental phrasing, encouraging her to share her history comfortably, acknowledging her possible forgetfulness or discomfort. - Expected value: These questions will help fill critical gaps, especially about her past medical history, risk factors for malignancy, and previous symptom patterns, moving closer to a more accurate differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \u201cYou mentioned having some surgeries in the past but aren\u2019t sure exactly what for, and that you sometimes felt similar issues before.

    "input": "A 72-year-old woman presents with a two-day history of progressively worsening dysphagia characterized by food impaction sensation and significant abdominal bloating. She reports difficulty eating and drinking without increased discomfort, describing episodes similar to past experiences that she perceives as brief and self-limiting. She does not disclose systemic symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or fever, though her medical history, including prior surgeries, is uncertain and potentially underreported. The clinical presentation suggests an obstructive or motility-related esophageal disorder; however, further detailed history and examination are needed to clarify the severity, chronicity, and any systemic implications of her symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Achalasia Justification: Progressive dysphagia with food impaction sensation is characteristic; her age increases risk, and achalasia commonly causes esophageal motility disorder with similar features. The episodic nature and self-limiting events may suggest intermittent esophageal obstruction due to failure of LES relaxation.  2. Diagnosis: Esophageal Stricture Justification: Food impaction and worsening dysphagia suggest a possible fibrotic narrowing from prior esophageal injury or chronic reflux, especially in a 72-year-old woman. Her uncertain prior surgeries could have contributed to scarring or stricture formation.  3. Diagnosis: Esophageal Carcinoma Justification: Although she denies weight loss or systemic symptoms, malignancy remains a concern in her age group presenting with progressive dysphagia. An obstructive lesion could cause similar clinical features, but absence of systemic signs makes it slightly less probable at this point.  4. Diagnosis: Esophageal Motility Disorder (non-achalasia) Justification: Disorders like diffuse esophageal spasm or nutcracker esophagus could cause dysphagia and food impaction, especially if motility is impaired without a fixed stricture. The episodic nature aligns with motility issues.  5. Diagnosis: Foreign Body or Esophageal Obstruction Justification: Less likely given the two-day progression and chronicity, but given her report of food impaction sensation, an occult foreign body or residual esophageal bolus could be contributory, especially if prior surgeries have altered anatomy.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent and acuity of current symptoms, precise details of prior surgeries, and episodes might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her portrayal of past episodes as resolve quickly suggests current symptoms could be more severe than indicated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about serious causes (tumor, obstruction) seems heightened, possibly inflating her level of worry. - True timeline: Symptoms are likely more progressive and severe than she perceives or admits, requiring cautious clinical evaluation to uncover hidden severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to refine the differential diagnosis by exploring specific symptom features, associated symptoms, and risk factors, especially considering the patient's age and likelihood of certain conditions like achalasia, strictures, or malignancy. The patient's guarded communication and tendency to understate or withhold details suggest that open-ended but focused questions are needed to elicit more precise information without causing discomfort or defensiveness. Clarifying details about the nature, timing, and triggers of her dysphagia, as well as her previous medical and surgical history, is crucial at this stage to avoid missing critical clues and to narrow the differential effectively.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about prior surgeries, the duration and progression of current symptoms, and any systemic or constitutional symptoms that may suggest malignancy or other systemic issues. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if the symptoms are primarily motility-related (e.g., achalasia vs. spasm), obstructive (strictures or tumor), or related to previous interventions. - Patient factors: Her guarded, brief responses suggest the need for sensitive, clarifying questions to encourage elaboration without making her feel judged. - Interview phase goals: Obtain detailed symptom characterization, assess for alarm features, and explore relevant medical history to guide further diagnostic steps.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent and acuity of current symptoms, precise details of prior surgeries, and episodes might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her portrayal of past episodes as resolve quickly suggests current symptoms could be more severe than indicated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about serious causes (tumor, obstruction) seems heightened, possibly inflating her level of worry. - True timeline: Symptoms are likely more progressive and severe than she perceives or admits, requiring cautious clinical evaluation to uncover hidden severity.",

    "input": "A 72-year-old woman presents with a recent two-day history of dysphagia characterized by a sensation of food sticking, difficulty swallowing, and persistent abdominal bloating. Although she reports that symptoms started suddenly and have worsened, her language suggests these symptoms may be more longstanding or severe than initially described. She reports episodes of similar sensations that resolved quickly but may be underestimating their duration or recurrence. She has a history of prior surgeries, but details are uncertain, and she does not report associated systemic symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or fever. Her communication pattern indicates potential underreporting, and further history regarding the duration, frequency, associated symptoms, and detailed prior medical/surgical history is required for comprehensive assessment.Esophageal diverticulum or stricture ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and softened language (\"kind of,\" \"like I swallowed a rock\"), indicating a tendency to downplay or avoid alarming detail. She employs emotional descriptors (\"really bloated,\" \"food gets stuck\") to emphasize her concern but remains cautious. - Information flow: She exhibits reluctance to volunteer detailed medical history, sharing only what is prompted (\"don\u2019t remember exactly what for,\" \"felt like this before\"). Her responses tend to be selective, potentially omitting key details. - Response style: Her answers are generally minimal and guarded, with brief elaborations limited to prompting questions. She tends to avoid direct disclosures about past surgeries unless specifically asked, indicating resistance or discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids specific details about previous surgeries and the exact history, possibly to mask uncertainty or discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Using phrases like \"felt like this before,\" and \"it always went away pretty quick,\" suggest she is downplaying the severity or persistence of symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"food gets stuck\" and \"like I swallowed a rock\" are vivid, possibly reflecting underlying anxiety about the situation. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation when discussing surgery history and the cautious tone imply discomfort or shame about her health status. - Confusion/memory issues: Not knowing exactly what surgeries she had reflects possible memory lapses or, alternatively, intentional vagueness. - Family influence: No evident influence detected.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization with some uncertainty about prior medical history, leading to a cautious or guarded self-report. - Severity: Moderate; her reluctance to disclose full information and vague symptom descriptions could result in underrecognition of severity or operative findings. - Areas most affected: Accurate understanding of medical history and symptom severity. - Reliability: Overall, her self-reporting should be interpreted carefully, considering potential under- or over-reporting tendencies influenced by anxiety or discomfort.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details about prior surgeries, symptom severity, and variability. Her hesitations suggest she may not fully convey how incapacitating her symptoms are. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be underestimating how serious her bowel obstruction could be, emphasizing quick resolution when symptoms may be more persistent. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of serious obstruction or tumors seem heightened, possibly driven by anxiety rather than clinical facts. - True timeline: The onset appears consistent, but her vagueness and possible minimization suggest her actual condition might be more severe or longstanding than she reports, requiring thorough assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need to clarify the exact duration, frequency, and progression of her symptoms; details about her previous surgeries; presence of other symptoms like weight loss or pain; and her understanding of her condition. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm whether features fit esophageal stricture or diverticulum; rule out more urgent conditions like esophageal carcinoma or motility disorders. - Patient factors: Her guarded and vague communication style necessitates gentle, focused questioning to elicit detailed, reliable information. - Interview phase goals: Finalize diagnostic certainty by confirming key symptom features, exploring her medical history in detail, and assessing her readiness for discussing management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions to fill in recent symptom details and prior surgery info. - Information target: Symptom timeline, frequency, associated features, prior surgical details, and her understanding. - Communication approach: Framing questions empathetically and openly, ensuring she feels safe sharing potentially sensitive information. - Expected value: Will help confirm the diagnosis by matching symptom criteria and uncover potential red flags or comorbid concerns, paving the way for treatment discussion.\nANSWER: \"Given what you've shared, I want to make sure I understand your situation fully\u2014could you tell me more about how often these episodes of food feeling stuck happen, if they\u2019ve become more frequent or severe over time, and whether you\u2019ve noticed any additional symptoms like weight changes, pain, or vomiting? Also, about your previous surgeries\u2014do you remember what they were for or if they\u2019ve helped with symptoms before? Your detailed experience will help us plan the best next steps for your care.\"",
