    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a history of recurrent swelling episodes over recent months, with some episodes involving throat tightness and breathing difficulties indicative of potential airway issues. Although she describes her symptoms in a calm and organized manner, there is likely underreporting of the true frequency and emotional impact. The recent severe episode suggests a worsening or increased severity of symptoms, but details regarding the overall frequency, functional effects, and psychological impact remain unclear and require further detailed assessment.1. Diagnosis: Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Justification: Recurrent episodes of swelling involving airway components, including throat tightness, with increasing severity; absence of urticaria favors HAE over allergic angioedema; considers familial patterns and the episodic worsening.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic Angioedema Justification: Episodic swelling and throat tightness common in allergic responses; however, the absence of itching or urticaria reduces likelihood but does not exclude it.  3. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Angioedema Justification: Recurrent angioedema without identifiable cause; considered when other specific etiologies are ruled out; typically less severe but still episodic.  4. Diagnosis: ACE inhibitor-induced Angioedema Justification: Common cause of acquired angioedema in adults; depends on medication history, which is not specified but should be considered.  5. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Churg-Strauss, Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) Justification: Can cause episodic swelling and airway issues; usually accompanied by systemic manifestations\u2014less likely given limited info.  6. Diagnosis: Allergic Asthma with or without Eosinophilic Esophagitis Justification: Airway involvement with breathing difficulty; however, more typical features like wheezing or eosinophilia are not described.  7. Diagnosis: Laryngeal or Airway Parasitic Infection Justification: Rare but possible cause of transient airway swelling; less common in developed regions unless risk factors are present.  8. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Disorders (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) Justification: Can cause or contribute to swelling through vasculitis; less likely if episodes are purely localized and episodic without other systemic signs.  9. Diagnosis: Angioedema Secondary to Food or Drug Allergies Justification: Potential trigger for swelling episodes; specific triggers are not identified in the vignette.  10. Diagnosis: Psychogenic or Stress-related Swelling Justification: Functional causes can sometimes mimic physical episodes; however, severity and airway involvement make this less plausible.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses clear, descriptive language with a focus on her symptoms (\"swelling episodes,\" \"throat started feeling tight,\" \"trouble breathing\"). Her tone is calm and measured, indicating an attempt to project composure. Her phrase \"really worried\" suggests genuine concern but is not overly emotive, perhaps reflecting her effort to remain controlled. - Information flow: She primarily provides pertinent details upfront, volunteering critical information about recent severity and her main concern without much prompting. Her response is organized, directly addressing the question. She does not seem hesitant or reluctant to share; her communication appears transparent at this stage. - Response style: Her responses are concise and focused, balancing detail with brevity. She quickly states key symptoms, which implies she is aware of what is important but may not be elaborating on her emotional state or other contextual factors unless asked.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence here; she shares relevant symptoms openly, including recent severity. However, her minimal elaboration might mask some underlying anxiety or concerns she is not verbalizing. - Minimization behaviors: There's little indication she is downplaying her symptoms; her mention of severe throat tightness and difficulty breathing suggests she perceives these as significant. - Amplification patterns: Not apparent; her account appears measured and consistent with her presenting issue. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of discomfort discussing her symptoms; her tone indicates transparency. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of these; her timeline is consistent\u2014swelling episodes for months, recent worsening, and an acute severe episode. - Family influence: She mentions her mother had similar episodes, which could influence her perception of risk, but her responses do not indicate undue reliance or influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main pattern is straightforward reporting with mild concern; no overt biases are present at this stage. Still, her focus on severity might stem from anxious tendencies, but not necessarily bias. - Severity: Mild; her communication appears accurate and genuine, though her briefness may subtly suppress deeper emotional cues. - Areas most affected: Her description of recent severity and the associated concern about breathing are most prominent; emotional nuances may be understated. - Reliability: High; her responses are consistent, direct, and detailed enough for initial assessment. She seems credible.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport her emotional distress or ongoing worries unless specifically asked. Her calm tone might hide deeper anxiety or previous episodes not explicitly discussed. - Symptoms probably minimized: The impact of her symptoms on daily functioning may be understated; for example, how frequently she experiences swelling or her fears about future episodes might not be fully conveyed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her concern about the recent severe episode suggests genuine worry, but her controlled tone indicates she might be trying to avoid appearing overly alarmed, which could mask the extent of her anxiety. - True timeline: The reported progression\u2014from occasional swelling over months to more severe recent episodes\u2014appears plausible but could benefit from further probing into prior episodes or emotional reactions to understand if there's any underreporting or emotional filtering.  Overall, her communication seems honest and well-calibrated, with no overt signs of withholding or bias. She appears cooperative and transparent, although her concise responses might conceal some underlying anxiety that could surface with more exploration.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's clear description of her symptoms and recent episodes, I need to explore the onset, frequency, and emotional impact to understand the pattern better. Since her tone is calm but concerned about severity, I want to gently explore how often these episodes happen, whether she notices any patterns or triggers, and how they are affecting her life. Open-ended questions will help her elaborate on these aspects, and understanding her experience can guide differential diagnosis assessment. I will also aim to encourage her to share her feelings and worries, which can reveal the psychological impact and help build rapport.\nANSWER: Can you tell me more about how often you've experienced these swelling episodes over the past few months, and what, if anything, seems to trigger or make them worse?",

    "input": "The clinical presentation involves an adult female experiencing recurrent episodes of facial and lip swelling, urticaria, and recent severe airway symptoms such as throat tightness and difficulty breathing. While she reports these episodes as sporadic and of uncertain frequency, recent severe symptoms indicate potential progression. Her communication style suggests she may be underreporting the true severity and frequency of her episodes, and she might be unaware of or reluctant to disclose additional associated symptoms or underlying triggers. Further targeted inquiry is necessary to determine the precise pattern, triggers, associated systemic symptoms, and impact on her daily functioning.1. Diagnosis: Allergic (IgE-mediated) angioedema with urticaria Justification: Recurrent facial and lip swelling, urticaria, and potential triggers point to an allergic hypersensitivity reaction; common in adults and often involves airway symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) Justification: Recurrent swelling episodes, particularly involving the face and airway, without apparent allergic urticaria in some cases; a \"can't miss\" diagnosis due to risk of airway obstruction and need for specific treatment.  3. Diagnosis: Acquired angioedema (e.g., ACE inhibitor-induced) Justification: If patient is on ACE inhibitors or other drugs associated with angioedema, could be responsible; typically presents with painless swelling and lacks urticaria.  4. Diagnosis: Idiopathic urticaria with angioedema Justification: Chronic urticaria with episodic angioedema; common in adults, may be associated with other allergic triggers.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic contact dermatitis (less likely but possible) Justification: Typically involves localized dermatitis, but can occasionally cause swelling; less likely given facial swelling and airway symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Autoimmune angioedema Justification: Autoimmune mechanisms may underlie episodes; combined with urticaria, may suggest autoimmune urticaria or systemic disease.  7. Diagnosis: Mast cell activation syndrome Justification: Systemic episodes of swelling, urticaria, and airway symptoms due to abnormal mast cell mediators; relatively rare but considered in recurrent unexplained episodes.  8. Diagnosis: Infectious angioedema Justification: Rare, but some infections can cause facial swelling, though usually accompanied by other infectious signs; less consistent with episodic severe airway symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Amyloidosis or systemic vasculitis Justification: Would typically have more systemic signs and duration; less likely given episodic nature and specific facial/airway symptoms.  10. Diagnosis: Psychological or functional disorder (factitious disorder) Justification: No evidence in the vignette; considered only if other diagnoses excluded and episodes are inconsistent or inconsistent with organic causes.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with recurrent episodes of angioedema characterized by facial swelling, eyelid swelling, urticaria, and recent episodes of throat tightness and difficulty swallowing. She reports these episodes as sporadic and variable, worsening over recent months, with a notably severe episode involving airway compromise. While she describes the episodes as occurring \"randomly,\" clinical review suggests they may be more frequent and prolonged than she reports, potentially occurring multiple times per week or daily. Additional systemic symptoms such as dizziness, abdominal pain, or fainting are not explicitly reported but may be present and underreported. Her communication style indicates possible underestimation of her symptom burden, necessitating further detailed inquiry into triggers, related systemic symptoms, and episode frequency for accurate assessment and management.1. Diagnosis: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) Justification: The recurrent episodes of angioedema involving face, eyelids, and airway, with increasing severity and episodes potentially frequency, are characteristic. HAE often presents with episodic swelling without urticaria and can cause airway obstruction, fitting this patient's presentation. The severity and progression over recent months suggest a hereditary pattern, especially if episodes are more frequent than initial reports. The lack of reported triggers does not exclude HAE, as it can be idiopathic or familial. Hereditary angioedema is a primary concern due to its potential for airway compromise and quality of life impact.  2. Diagnosis: Acquired angioedema (AAE) Justification: Acquired angioedema can present in adults with similar features to HAE, including episodic angioedema without urticaria and airway risks. It is often associated with underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune diseases, which may not yet have manifested overtly but could be present. The progressive worsening suggests possible acquired deficiency of C1-INH, making it a second-line consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic (mast cell-mediated) angioedema Justification: If episodes are associated with urticaria or allergic triggers, this would be typical. Although the vignette emphasizes airway episodes and severity, the presence of urticaria or allergen exposure history could support this. However, in absence of such details, allergic angioedema is considered less probable but remains a differential, especially if episodes are episodic, recurrent, and associated with other allergic symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Idiopathic angioedema Justification: When no clear allergen or systemic cause is identified after initial evaluation, idiopathic angioedema is a diagnosis of exclusion. It could explain recurrent episodes with no clear triggers, particularly if investigations for hereditary or acquired causes are inconclusive.  5. Diagnosis: Angioedema secondary to medication (e.g., ACE inhibitors) Justification: If the patient is taking medications such as ACE inhibitors known to cause bradykinin-mediated angioedema, this would be relevant. While not specified, medication history could influence likelihood, but in their absence, it remains a lower priority diagnosis.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague terms like \u201ckind of,\u201d \u201ca little,\u201d and \u201call over the place,\u201d suggesting some minimization. She also describes symptoms with emotional words (e.g., \u201cscared,\u201d \u201creally puffed out\u201d) but avoids clinical specificity. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming but hesitant to specify triggers or frequency. She offers detailed descriptions when discussing recent symptoms but remains vague about the underlying pattern. - Response style: She tends to elaborate when describing symptoms but maintains some restraint, indicating an intent to appear cooperative but cautious about revealing too much detail she might consider personal or sensitive.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her reluctance to specify triggers or clarify patterns suggests some withholding, possibly to avoid implications or because she\u2019s uncertain. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays the severity and frequency (\u201ckind of,\u201d \u201cjust happens randomly\u201d) and describes episodes as \u201ca little\u201d or \u201ckind of all over,\u201d which may understate actual distress. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional expressions (\u201creally swollen,\u201d \u201cscared\u201d) seem genuine; no clear signs of exaggeration beyond normal concern. Her concern about their severity may be amplified by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort visible in physical cues (touching face, adjusting collar) when discussing severity may indicate mild embarrassment or desire to appear less affected. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant inconsistencies are apparent; her timeline seems plausible. - Family influence: She mentions her mother\u2019s similar episodes, which may influence her perception of severity or normalcy.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias\u2014she seems to intentionally or unconsciously understate the frequency, triggers, or severity of her episodes while genuinely fearing their implications. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her descriptions are consistent with moderate bias; her reports likely underrepresent the true scope. - Areas most affected: Trigger specifics and symptom severity, which she minimizes or remains vague about. - Reliability: Moderately reliable but somewhat biased; her self-report probably underestimates episodic frequency and impact due to anxiety and desire to appear controlled.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact trigger identification, frequency, and true severity of episodes; her responses suggest she may be hiding or downplaying details that could be crucial. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity and impact\u2014she might experience more frequent or severe episodes than acknowledged. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about danger and need for immediate help may be somewhat exaggerated by her anxious state. - True timeline: Likely that episodes are somewhat more frequent or severe, but her perception is colored by anxiety and cautious reporting.  Overall, her communication reflects moderate minimization, with emotional concern influencing her description but no overt deception. Taking this into account, I should probe deeper into specific triggers, episodic patterns, and her emotional responses to gain a more accurate picture.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Acute redness, swelling, and tearing after physical activity suggest possible eyelid or periorbital skin and tissue infection. Onset 2 days ago indicates a recent infectious process, potentially from minor trauma or skin breach during activity. No systemic symptoms are noted, and the presentation aligns with preseptal cellulitis, which often manifests with eyelid swelling and erythema without signs of orbital involvement. This is high in probability given the timing, symptoms, and recent activity.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (bacterial or viral) Justification: Tearing and redness are hallmark features. The recent onset (2 days) supports an infectious cause. The absence of mention of eye pain or vision changes makes conjunctivitis plausible. However, swelling and tearing favor conjunctivitis over isolated trauma; toxin or bacterial conjunctivitis are common post-activity, making this a probable diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis/allergic eyelid edema Justification: Allergic reactions often cause tearing, redness, and eyelid swelling. History does not specify allergy symptoms or exposure, but recent physical activity could have exposed the eyes to allergens. Though less likely than infectious causes, allergies remain a differential, especially if symptoms persist or recur.  4. Diagnosis: Hordeolum (stye) Justification: Localized eyelid swelling and redness could indicate a hordeolum. Usually focal and associated with tenderness, possibly with a palpable nodule. Given the recent onset, this is possible but less certain without more detailed examination findings.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid/ocular injury Justification: Playing soccer involves risk of trauma; swelling and redness could result from minor eyelid trauma or contusion. Lack of reported injury details limits certainty, but trauma remains a relevant differential, especially given recent physical activity.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague and emotionally charged language, often using \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"really scared,\" balancing honesty with uncertain qualifiers that reduce specificity but heighten emotional impact. - Information flow: Responses are generally organized but sprinkled with hesitation and ambiguity, indicating a tendency to withhold details or admit uncertainty unless explicitly prompted. - Response style: She tends to be somewhat elaborative when expressing fears, but minimal in describing triggers or specific timing, suggesting careful self-monitoring of disclosures.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague descriptions of triggers and timing suggest reluctance or difficulty in recalling specifics, possibly to avoid overexposure or shame. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with phrases like \"a little while\" and \"out of nowhere\" imply she might be minimizing predictable patterns or severity. - Amplification patterns: Emotional language such as \"really scared\" and \"worried\" hints at heightened concern, which might lead to overestimation of danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but reluctance to specify exact triggers could reflect subconscious discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Moderate vagueness about the timeline and triggers indicates some memory or perception bias. - Family influence: Mentioning her mother's similar episodes could contribute to her heightened anxiety and perception of danger.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with vagueness\u2014her anxious demeanor and inability to specify triggers suggest overreliance on emotional cues and uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate bias, as her factual reporting contains gaps, but core symptoms and concerns are clear. - Most affected areas: Trigger patterns and episode timeline, where her uncertainty hampers precise understanding. - Reliability: Moderate; emotional distress influences her reporting, possibly leading to exaggeration of fears and underreporting of some details.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Likely missing info: Specific environmental or dietary triggers, precise timing, duration, and frequency details. - Likely minimized: Predictability or controllability of episodes, potential severity of symptoms. - Likely amplified: Her fears of danger and her distress level\u2014she appears highly anxious, possibly overestimating risk. - True progression: Probably a gradual worsening of episodes, but her perception may be skewed by emotional stress, making her report appear more alarming than the reality.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description of her eye symptoms\u2014redness, swelling, tearing\u2014begs clarification concerning potential causes such as infectious, allergic, or traumatic origins. Since she recently played soccer, trauma remains a significant differential, and details about trauma severity or specific injury are missing, which are crucial for diagnosis. Additionally, understanding the timing, duration, triggers, and whether symptoms are isolated or associated with other systemic or ocular symptoms is necessary. Her vague communication style suggests she may be hesitant to disclose details or may not recall specifics, so questions should be patient-centered yet specific enough to elicit relevant information without causing discomfort.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about the injury (e.g., pain, tenderness, object contact), recurrent or previous episodes, and any associated systemic or ocular symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if trauma occurred, assess for signs of infection or allergy, and distinguish between preseptal cellulitis, conjunctivitis, or orbital cellulitis. - Patient factors: Her vague, emotionally charged responses imply hesitancy; questions need to be gentle and open-ended but directed. - Interview phase goals: Narrow etiologies further by pinpointing injury details, symptom progression, and any associated systemic features.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about trauma specifics, symptom timing, and additional associated features. - Information target: Nature of possible injury, recurrence pattern, severity, and associated symptoms like pain, visual disturbances, or systemic signs. - Communication approach: Gentle, reassuring prompts encouraging elaboration without judgment or pressure. - Expected value: This will help determine if the eye findings are trauma-related, infectious, allergic, or other, guiding examination focus and treatment.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your eye started swelling and redness after playing soccer. Can you tell me exactly what happened during that time? For example, did you feel any pain, or did your eyelid get hit or injured in any way? Have you noticed if these episodes happen again after sports or other activities, or are they usually out of nowhere? Also, are you experiencing any other issues, like blurred vision, pain around the eye, or sensitivity to light?\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague and emotionally charged language, often using \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"really scared,\" balancing honesty with uncertain qualifiers that reduce specificity but heighten emotional impact. - Information flow: Responses are generally organized but sprinkled with hesitation and ambiguity, indicating a tendency to withhold details or admit uncertainty unless explicitly prompted. - Response style: She tends to be somewhat elaborative when expressing fears, but minimal in describing triggers or specific timing, suggesting careful self-monitoring of disclosures.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague descriptions of triggers and timing suggest reluctance or difficulty in recalling specifics, possibly to avoid overexposure or shame. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with phrases like \"a little while\" and \"out of nowhere\" imply she might be minimizing predictable patterns or severity. - Amplification patterns: Emotional language such as \"really scared\" and \"worried\" hints at heightened concern, which might lead to overestimation of danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but reluctance to specify exact triggers could reflect subconscious discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Moderate vagueness about the timeline and triggers indicates some memory or perception bias. - Family influence: Mentioning her mother's similar episodes could contribute to her heightened anxiety and perception of danger.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with vagueness\u2014her anxious demeanor and inability to specify triggers suggest overreliance on emotional cues and uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate bias, as her factual reporting contains gaps, but core symptoms and concerns are clear. - Most affected areas: Trigger patterns and episode timeline, where her uncertainty hampers precise understanding. - Reliability: Moderate; emotional distress influences her reporting, possibly leading to exaggeration of fears and underreporting of some details.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Likely missing info: Specific environmental or dietary triggers, precise timing, duration, and frequency details. - Likely minimized: Predictability or controllability of episodes, potential severity of symptoms. - Likely amplified: Her fears of danger and her distress level\u2014she appears highly anxious, possibly overestimating risk. - True progression: Probably a gradual worsening of episodes, but her perception may be skewed by emotional stress, making her report appear more alarming than the reality.",

    "input": "The patient, a female of unspecified age, reports experiencing episodic swelling of the lips, periorbital area, and hives over several months, with episodes varying in frequency and severity. Recently, she described an episode involving marked lip swelling and throat tightness, which she found frightening and difficult to swallow. She reports these episodes occurring unpredictably, sometimes following physical activity such as playing soccer, but unable to identify consistent triggers. She denies prior emergency interventions such as EpiPen use or hospitalization but expresses concern about airway compromise. There are no additional reported symptoms like dizziness or fainting, though subtle or transient symptoms such as brief difficulty swallowing or mild dizziness may be underreported due to emotional distress. The timing suggests an increase in frequency and severity, but her anxiety-related communication may overemphasize the threat posed by her symptoms. Further detailed inquiry is indicated to objectively determine symptom duration, severity, triggers, and any subtle features of airway compromise.Allergic angioedema with urticaria ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient balances between vague language (\"out of nowhere,\" \"kind of\") and emotional descriptors (\"scary,\" \"really puffed up\"). She appears to minimize the severity at times but expresses significant concern, especially about airway issues. - Information flow: She freely volunteers her history but also responds with hedging, showing some reluctance to admit full severity or possible triggers. Her detailed answers suggest openness but with underlying anxiety. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and focused on her distress, with a pattern of emphasizing how alarming episodes feel rather than sticking to purely clinical descriptions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Touching her face and slight hesitations may indicate discomfort in fully disclosing or acknowledging the severity of some symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Describing the swelling as \"kind of\" or \"not that bad\" despite evident distress suggests an attempt to downplay the severity. - Amplification patterns: Repeatedly emphasizing the suddenness and scary nature of events may reflect heightened anxiety rather than exaggerated actual symptom severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal, but minor discomfort when discussing health concerns, possibly due to fear of a serious diagnosis. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: Mention of her mother's similar episodes may intensify her anxiety and perception of danger.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight minimization combined with anxiety-driven exaggeration\u2014she minimizes some symptoms but overemphasizes her concern about danger. - Severity: Moderate bias, as her emotional distress influences her report but her detailed responses support the actual presence of significant symptoms. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and trigger identification are most biased; she may understate the actual severity while over-stating fears. - Reliability: Moderate; she offers trustworthy information but with some emotional overlay and possible bias toward alarm.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully convey the extent of airway compromise or how long episodes last; she might also underreport avoidance behaviors or other subtle symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The risk of severe airway obstruction or life-threatening progression might be underestimated by her. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety heightens her perception of danger, possibly leading to overreaction or unnecessary worry. - True timeline: The progression seems to be gradually worsening, but her perception may overstate the abruptness or intensity, influenced by emotional responses.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, focused questions to clarify whether her episodes meet the diagnostic criteria for an allergic angioedema with urticaria or if alternative causes should be considered. Given her previous descriptions and current concern, it's important to verify features such as rapid onset, duration, allergen exposure, and signs of airway involvement. The patient's emotional distress suggests a need for gentle, reassuring inquiry to accurately understand her symptoms without escalating anxiety. Gathering details on her episodes\u2019 exact timing, severity, and triggers will help confirm or refute key criteria and prepare for discussion of management options.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions aimed at specific diagnostic criteria. - Information target: Duration, onset, triggers, associated symptoms, airway symptoms, and impact. - Communication approach: Sensitive and collaborative phrasing to encourage honest disclosure and reduce anxiety. - Expected value: Will solidify diagnostic certainty regarding angioedema, airway involvement, and potential triggers, directly informing treatment planning.\nANSWER: Based on what you've shared, I\u2019d like to ask specifically about the timing of your episodes\u2014when you notice the swelling starting, how quickly it develops, and how long each episode generally lasts. Can you walk me through what you experience from the very first sign to resolution? Also, during these episodes, have you noticed any difficulty breathing, feeling your throat getting tight, or trouble swallowing? Have there been moments when your symptoms worsened suddenly, requiring emergency help or medications like an EpiPen? Understanding these details will help me determine how these episodes compare to classic allergic angioedema and guide the next steps in management.",
