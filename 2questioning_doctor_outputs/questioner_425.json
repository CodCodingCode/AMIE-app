    "input": "A patient presents with a history spanning several months of persistent abdominal pain that has recently worsened, accompanied by frequent vomiting and the development of jaundice, indicating possible hepatobiliary pathology. The patient reports these symptoms with emotional emphasis, which may amplify perceived severity. Objective assessment should include evaluation for signs of cholestasis such as changes in stool and urine color, pruritus, and potential hepatomegaly or scleral icterus. Further inquiry into recent alcohol or medication use, prior medical evaluations, and associated symptoms is essential, as these factors significantly impact diagnosis and management. More detailed assessment is necessary to determine the actual severity of symptoms and underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Gallstone-induced obstructive cholestasis (Cholelithiasis with choledocholithiasis) Justification: Common cause of jaundice and biliary obstruction, presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, and jaundice; prevalence in adults, especially with episodic pain that worsens over time.  2. Diagnosis: Biliary stricture or benign biliary strictures Justification: Persistent jaundice with recent worsening; possibly post-inflammatory or post-surgical; causes obstructive symptoms without clear stones.  3. Diagnosis: Cholangiocarcinoma Justification: Malignancy of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts presenting with progressive jaundice, abdominal pain, and possibly weight loss, more common in older adults.  4. Diagnosis: Pancreatic head tumor (adenocarcinoma) Justification: Can cause distal biliary obstruction leading to jaundice and abdominal pain; typically in older individuals and may present with significant weight loss.  5. Diagnosis: Acute or chronic cholangitis Justification: Infection of biliary tree causing pain, fever, jaundice; associated with obstruction, potentially precipitated by stones or strictures.  6. Diagnosis: Hepatitis (viral, alcoholic, or drug-induced) Justification: Causes progressive jaundice; though less characterized by persistent or worsening pain, hepatitis remains a differential in jaundice with systemic illness.  7. Diagnosis: Hepatic neoplasm (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) Justification: Could cause jaundice if extensive; often associated with underlying liver disease, but less likely given the predominant biliary symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Primary sclerosing cholangitis Justification: Inflammatory destruction of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to obstructive jaundice; more common in young men with IBD history.  9. Diagnosis: Autoimmune cholestatic diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis) Justification: To cause jaundice and cholestasis; typically in middle-aged women, with less acute pain.  10. Diagnosis: Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension causing hepatomegaly and secondary cholestasis Justification: Evolves over time; may present with jaundice but usually with additional features like splenomegaly, ascites, and varices; less likely to cause sudden worsening of symptoms.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses explicit, emotionally charged language that emphasizes distress, reflecting genuine concern but possibly aiming to highlight urgency. - Information flow: They are forthcoming with information about key symptoms, organizing their responses logically and directly. - Response style: Responses are concise, focused, and direct, with minimal tangential information, indicating a straightforward communication approach.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None observed; the patient openly shares critical symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Absent; they stress the severity, suggesting awareness of their condition. - Amplification patterns: Use of superlatives (\"terrible,\" \"unbearable\") could serve to showcase their genuine suffering or could slightly exaggerate emotional impact. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited; the blunt language implies a level of resignation rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; timelines are consistent and coherent. - Family influence: Minimal; they reference family history only to contextualize risk.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: None prominently present; responses appear authentic, aligning with symptoms described. - Severity: Mild; because of the detailed, consistent symptom reporting without evident distortion. - Areas most affected: No significant bias affects key symptom disclosure; their descriptions are straightforward. - Reliability: High, based on the consistency and clarity of their responses.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about alcohol intake and lifestyle habits that are pertinent to management. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident here; they depict severe symptoms clearly. - Concerns probably amplified: They might express exaggerated concern to communicate urgency but are consistent enough to be credible. - True timeline: The patient\u2019s narrative appears accurate, with the months-long progression aligning with the worsening symptoms.  Overall, the patient\u2019s communication pattern suggests honesty, with a focus on conveying the severity of symptoms to prompt urgent attention, and limited evidence of withholding or minimizing key information.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to deepen understanding of the patient's experience with these symptoms by exploring how they perceive and describe their abdominal pain, since this can provide clues about the source and impact. - Additionally, understanding the timing, frequency, and any pattern to the pain and associated symptoms like vomiting and jaundice helps clarify the course and severity of their condition. - Since the patient's language is direct and emotional, I should encourage elaboration to ensure I capture their subjective experience comprehensively. - This also sets the stage for building rapport, validating their distress, and gaining insights into how these symptoms have affected their life and concerns about the future.

    "input": "A patient presents with a several-month history of intermittent or gradually worsening upper abdominal pain localized to the right upper quadrant, described as sharp and burning, with episodes of dull ache that increase after eating or drinking. The patient reports associated vomiting and jaundice. While these symptoms are evident from the history, the actual severity may be less intense than described, as emotional factors appear to amplify perceived urgency. There is a possibility of additional cholestatic features such as pruritus, dark urine, or pale stools that have not been explicitly reported. No physical examination findings are available at this time, but assessment for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, or abdominal tenderness remains important. The patient may withhold or underreport contributory factors such as alcohol use or medication intake. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate for hepatobiliary pathology, including physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging, to determine the precise cause of the symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Gallstone disease (Cholelithiasis) with biliary colic or obstruction Justification: Classic symptoms include episodic right upper quadrant pain exacerbated after meals, often with nausea/vomiting, and possible jaundice if there's biliary obstruction; prevalent in the general population.  2. Diagnosis: Biliary obstruction (choledocholithiasis) Justification: Jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, and right upper quadrant pain suggest obstruction of bile flow, often from gallstones impacted in the common bile duct.  3. Diagnosis: Acute or chronic hepatitis (viral, toxic, or autoimmune) Justification: Jaundice with elevated bilirubin, possibly with associated hepatocellular injury, can present with right upper quadrant discomfort, especially in chronic or subacute forms.  4. Diagnosis: Primary sclerosing cholangitis Justification: Chronic cholestatic symptoms, progressive jaundice, potentially associated with prior episodes of cholangitis, and characteristic bile duct changes; more common in young males but relevant as a differential.  5. Diagnosis: Biliary or pancreatic malignancy (e.g., cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic head tumor) Justification: Progressive jaundice, dull ache, and pruritus suggest obstructive mass; risk factors include age and chronic biliary inflammation.  6. Diagnosis: Cholangitis Justification: Jaundice with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and vomiting suggest biliary infection; safety concern due to potential progression to sepsis.  7. Diagnosis: Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension Justification: Chronic liver disease can cause jaundice and abdominal discomfort; however, symptoms may be less localized to RUQ unless complicated by hepatomegaly or portal hypertensive features.  8. Diagnosis: Bile duct injury or stricture Justification: Post-cholecystectomy or prior hepatobiliary procedures could lead to strictures causing cholestasis, pain, and jaundice.  9. Diagnosis: Autoimmune cholestatic diseases (e.g., primary biliary cholangitis) Justification: Chronic cholestasis with pruritus and jaundice, especially in female patients, with slow progression.  10. Diagnosis: Peptic ulcer disease involving the proximal duodenum or stomach Justification: Sharp, burning pain after eating, though less likely to cause jaundice, remains in the differential due to symptom overlap and gastric involvement possibilities.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs emotionally charged descriptors (\u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cgetting worse\u201d), which highlight distress but may also exaggerate severity. Descriptions of pain are specific but framed under intense terms. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming, sharing detailed symptoms without much prompting, indicating openness but possibly influenced by anxiety. - Response style: Direct and concise, with a focus on the worsening of symptoms. No apparent tangential or deflective responses; responses align with expressions of distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; the patient appears to disclose all pertinent details. - Minimization behaviors: Not overt, but the consistent use of hyperbolic language may hide true baseline functioning. - Amplification patterns: Words like \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cunbearable\u201d suggest emotional amplification of symptoms, possibly to underscore urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent\u2014tone indicates a straightforward demeanor. - Confusion/memory issues: None; timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: Mention of father\u2019s pancreatitis influences perceived risk, possibly contributing to concern but not observed to distort reporting.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014magnifying perceived severity due to worry and fear. - Severity: Moderate\u2014distress is high, which may bias the perceived urgency, but clinical details are consistent. - Areas most affected: Severity of pain and jaundice perception; these are likely overemphasized, while other less distressing aspects may be underreported. - Reliability: Generally reliable for symptom description, but the intensity and impact may be overstated due to emotional state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of social factors like alcohol use due to shame or denial; may also understate baseline health status. - Symptoms probably minimized: Likely none; the patient emphasizes the worst aspects\u2014pain and jaundice. - Concerns probably amplified: Distress level and perceived threat, which could lead to an overly urgent assessment. - True timeline: Symptoms may have developed gradually over months, consistent with report, but emotional responses could exaggerate their current severity.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: The symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling are classic for conjunctivitis, which can develop rapidly after environmental exposure; recent activity (playing soccer) could expose eyes to irritants, allergens, or pathogens. While conjunctivitis often involves redness and tearing, swelling is usually mild but can be prominent in viral or allergic types.  2. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness of the eyelid suggest preseptal cellulitis, especially following activity that might cause minor trauma or inoculation. The acute onset over 2 days aligns. It is generally localized anterior to the septum, causing eyelid swelling without pain on eye movement or visual changes.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic ocular surface injury Justification: Recent physical activity could have resulted in minor trauma or foreign body exposure leading to conjunctival or eyelid injury\u2014manifesting as redness, swelling, tearing. Symptoms align with minor trauma-related irritation.  4. Diagnosis: Viral Keratoconjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness could be caused by viral infection, particularly adenovirus, which is common after outdoor or sports activities, with rapid onset. However, swelling might be less prominent compared to conjunctivitis.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Less likely at this stage without systemic symptoms, pain with eye movement, or proptosis. Still, given recent activity and eye symptoms, it cannot be fully excluded but ranks lower because no systemic illness or pain suggests deep orbital involvement.

His tone often reflects distress, which can amplify perceived severity. However, he avoids vague or overly clinical jargon, making his reports straightforward but emotion-laden. - Information flow: He appears forthcoming about primary symptoms, volunteering key details early. His responses are organized around his main concerns, indicating an open flow of information, though his emotional state might temporarily influence what he emphasizes. - Response style: Generally direct, with some emotional qualifiers. His speech is responsive but sometimes hurried, reflecting anxiety and frustration. He tends to focus on the worst aspects, which may indicate amplification of concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No strong evidence; he openly discusses main symptoms and fears. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; his language reflects acknowledgment of severity, though emotional distress may cause him to sometimes overstate or focus excessively on certain symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Use of words like \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d and \u201cworried\u201d suggests emotional amplification, possibly increasing perceived urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; he discusses symptoms and family history without evident shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Some mild uncertainty about the significance of stool changes (\u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d), but overall timeline coherence suggests minimal confusion. - Family influence: His father\u2019s history likely heightens his anxiety, influencing emotional expression but not necessarily distorting factual content significantly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional concern and health anxiety, with some potential for amplification of symptom severity due to familial history and personal fears. - Severity: Moderate, as he expresses high distress but maintains consistent symptom reporting. - Areas most affected: His perception of symptom intensity and urgency appears heightened (\u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cterrible\u201d), which may lead to an overestimation of severity. - Reliability: Largely trustworthy in terms of symptom description; emotional factors could inflate perceived urgency but overall, his self-report is credible.

    "input": "A patient presents with recent onset (approximately two days ago) of ocular redness, swelling, tearing, and discomfort following playing soccer, with no specific trauma or injury recalled. The patient reports that the eye felt \"weird\" after physical activity and is concerned about symptoms that are currently bothersome and persistent. Examination findings are not detailed in the conversation, but the presentation suggests a mild ocular surface irritation such as conjunctivitis or minor trauma to the ocular surface. No reported visual changes or discharges are noted, though these should be further evaluated. The emotional tone of the patient may amplify their perceived severity, but objectively, the symptoms are consistent with a benign, superficial ocular irritation requiring routine assessment and management.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral or allergic) Justification: Ocular redness, tearing, swelling, and discomfort are characteristic, especially following physical exertion which can predispose to irritant or allergic conjunctivitis. The lack of purulent discharge points toward viral or allergic rather than bacterial.  2. Diagnosis: Minor corneal or conjunctival trauma Justification: The sensation of a \"weird\" eye after physical activity suggests possible minor superficial injury, such as a small corneal abrasion or conjunctival scratch caused by contact with sports equipment or environmental factors, explaining recent symptom onset.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: The swelling and tearing, especially after physical activity, may reflect allergic response, possibly triggered by outdoor allergens or contact with pollen, outdoor irritants. No mention of itching, but it remains plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Common in young, active individuals, often self-limited. Though no discharge is noted, viral causes are common and can follow exposures during sports or outdoor activity, consistent with recent symptom onset.  5. Diagnosis: Subclinical intraocular or intraorbital pathology (less likely) Justification: No visual changes or systemic symptoms reported; less probable but included to cover rare possibilities, such as early inflammatory or intraocular issues, though clinical coherence with the vignette is weaker.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient combines specific somatic descriptions (\"greasy and pale,\" \"yellow skin\") with emotional descriptors (\"worried,\" \"bothered\"), which may serve to both inform and evoke empathy.

The patient seems motivated to provide a full picture, driven by concern.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None apparent; the patient appears willing to share comprehensive information. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; symptoms are described with urgency and clarity. - Amplification patterns: Slightly, as the patient uses intense emotional language (\"terrible,\" \"unbearable\") which might exaggerate their distress but also could genuinely reflect their experience. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No evident reluctance or discomfort discussing symptoms or familial history. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; timeline and sequences seem coherent. - Family influence: The mention of familial history is consistent and straightforward, with no signs of external influence affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, where the patient emphasizes emotional distress more than necessary, likely to communicate urgency and validate their experience. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 they are mostly accurate but may overstate their distress levels to ensure behavioral validation. - Areas most affected: Emotional descriptions of symptoms and overall concern are most biased; factual details about symptoms and history are consistent. - Reliability: Fairly high; the patient reports symptoms congruently with physical signs and timeline, though emotional exaggeration may slightly inflate perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about their baseline health, coping mechanisms, or social support are limited; they might underreport relevant lifestyle factors or past subtle symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The patient doesn't seem to downplay their symptoms; their descriptions seem consistent with severe pathology. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s emotional language may overstate their level of distress, possibly influenced by fear or anxiety. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent; initial months of intermittent pain and gradual worsening match clinical course, though emotional emphasis might make their current state seem worse than the objective findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify what additional, clarifying details are needed to refine the diagnosis, especially given the recent ocular symptoms following physical activity, without clear trauma. The primary uncertainties are whether the conjunctivitis is viral, allergic, or related to minor trauma, and what features might help distinguish these. It is also important to confirm whether the patient experiences any visual changes, discharge, or specific triggers, and to explore associated systemic or allergy-related symptoms. Considering their detailed responses and emotional tone, I will aim to gather precise symptom characteristics, timing, and severity while maintaining rapport.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Are there associated itching or allergy signs? Is there any visual impairment or discharge? Clarify any recent activities that may have caused microtrauma. - Diagnostic priorities: Distinguish viral versus allergic conjunctivitis, or minor trauma; rule out more serious intraocular issues if indicated. - Patient factors: Since the patient provides detailed descriptions, focused, specific questions will help clarify key features without feeling invasive. - Interview phase goals: Narrow down the type of conjunctivitis, confirm the presence of associated symptoms, and assess severity and impact.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about specific symptoms\u2014discharge, itching, visual changes. - Information target: Presence of discharge, itching, pain severity, visual disturbance, associated systemic or allergy symptoms. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently, affirming their concerns while clarifying details to avoid misinterpretation. - Expected value: Clarify features that support or exclude differential diagnoses, guiding management and further testing.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing all these details.

The communication pattern indicates possible underreporting of ocular symptoms' severity, warranting thorough clinical evaluation.Conjunctivitis or superficial ocular surface irritation Systemic hepatobiliary disease (possible jaundice-related pathology) affecting ocular health ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague descriptors like \"kinda blurry\" and \"feels terrible,\" which suggest a tendency towards non-specific language and possible minimization. He avoids detailed explanations about his eye, indicating potential discomfort or lack of concern about that area, contrasting with his expressed distress about overall health. - Information flow: His responses are direct when asked simple yes/no questions but lack elaboration regarding the eye symptoms. He volunteers basic details but does not seek to elaborate. There is a pattern of minimal details about less prominent symptoms, possibly to sidestep discussing issues he's uncomfortable with or perceives as less urgent. - Response style: Responses are concise and somewhat cautious, avoiding tangential topics. He seems focused on asserting his overall feeling of being terrible without delving into specifics, possibly to avoid appearing overly anxious or to minimize unnecessary details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient downplays or doesn\u2019t confirm specific eye issues like itching or discharge\u2014despite being asked directly\u2014pointing to possible concealment or lack of acknowledgment of certain symptoms. His vague description of vision changes (\u201ckinda blurry\u201d) may indicate uncertainty or a reluctance to specify minor symptoms he deems insignificant. - Minimization behaviors: He states \u201cmy vision\u2019s been kinda blurry sometimes,\u201d which may understate actual visual changes, especially if he\u2019s unsure or is trying to appear less concerned. His overall description of symptoms emphasizes how \u201cterrible\u201d he feels rather than detailing specific visual problems. - Amplification patterns: He loudly emphasizes feeling \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cfeeling worse,\u201d which may exaggerate his distress to ensure the severity is understood, even if specific symptoms are less dramatic. - Embarrassment/shame signals: His avoidance of detailed discussion about his eye symptoms (\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember any injury\u201d) might reveal discomfort or denial about minor or non-urgent issues. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness (\u201ckinda blurry,\u201d \u201cfeel weird afterward\u201d) could indicate some confusion or difficulty pinpointing specific ocular symptoms. - Family influence: The responses don\u2019t show explicit impact from family opinions or stories, but his focus on his health deterioration might be influenced by family history of pancreatitis.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization\u2014he downplays or obscures minor eye symptoms and possibly minimizes the importance of visual changes. There may also be some emotional bias, where his distress overrides detailed description of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014he is honest about feeling very unwell but likely underreports or minimizes ocular findings; his vague descriptions suggest some concealment or lack of awareness. - Areas most affected: Details about eye symptoms and visual changes are most biased\u2014he underreports specifics, possibly to avoid concern or out of genuine uncertainty. - Reliability: Their self-reporting of eye symptoms is somewhat limited; responses indicate possible underestimation of ocular issues and overemphasis on general distress, making complete reliance on his account alone risky.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might be experiencing more significant ocular symptoms\u2014such as more persistent visual disturbances, discomfort, or signs of eye trauma\u2014that he's reluctant to fully disclose or recognizes only vaguely. - Symptoms probably minimized: Visual changes, minor eye discomfort, or injury may be underreported. He might not realize or choose not to report the full extent of ocular involvement. - Concerns probably amplified: His overall feeling of being \u201cterrible\u201d and distress about health might lead him to overstate the severity or focus on worst-case scenarios, possibly inflating the impact of non-ocular symptoms relative to eye findings. - True timeline: The vague description of visual symptoms (\u201ckinda blurry sometimes\u201d) suggests that, while he reports a sensation of visual disturbance, it might be less severe or more intermittent than implied. The overall health decline seems consistent with his narrative of ongoing significant symptoms, but certain minor issues are likely less dramatic.  This analysis indicates that while the patient communicates his main concern\u2014his severe illness\u2014he minimizes or lacks clarity about minor ocular symptoms. Recognizing this bias can guide the clinician to probe more specifically about visual disturbances, perhaps with objective testing, rather than relying solely on his subjective report.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Clarification is needed regarding the specific ocular symptoms to confirm if conjunctivitis or minor trauma is present, as the patient downplays or avoids detailed discussion. Also, understanding the severity and impact of visual disturbances will help determine urgency and potential diagnosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Rules out infectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or minor trauma. Need to explore whether ocular redness, swelling, tearing, or discomfort are persistent and how they correlate with overall symptoms. - Patient factors: The patient tends to minimize or vague about eye symptoms, possibly due to discomfort, lack of awareness, or not perceiving them as significant. Questions should be phrased gently and collaboratively to encourage openness. - Interview phase goals: Confirm the presence, character, and impact of ocular symptoms, especially visual disturbances; assess if these symptoms suggest a more serious ocular condition; rule out red flags like severe pain, vision loss, or trauma; and prepare for potential diagnosis and management discussion.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and confirmatory to clarify ocular symptoms, with some open-ended components to gauge symptom severity and patient perception. - Information target: Specific ocular symptoms (redness, swelling, tearing, pain, vision changes), their timeline, severity, and impact on daily life. - Communication approach: Use non-judgmental, collaborative language to reduce reluctance, such as \u201cI\u2019d like to understand more about your eye to see how it might be related to what you\u2019re experiencing overall.\u201d - Expected value: These questions will help confirm whether ocular findings align with conjunctivitis, minor trauma, or other superficial irritations, and whether the patient\u2019s subjective report corresponds with clinical signs.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that. Just to clarify, have you noticed any persistent redness, swelling, or tearing in your eye that lasts beyond the initial injury or that you're concerned about? Also, have you experienced any ongoing discomfort, a feeling like something\u2019s in your eye, or any changes in your vision\u2014like blurriness or flashes\u2014since your symptoms started? Even if these seem minor, I want to understand if there might be more to what you're feeling.\"",
