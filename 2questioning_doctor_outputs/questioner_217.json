    "input": "The patient, a female of unspecified age, presents with complaints of stomach discomfort and sensations suggestive of cardiac issues. She reports these symptoms as having begun suddenly but provides brief, emotionally charged responses that may underestimate or obscure the true severity and progression. Her hesitation suggests potential withholding of information about her diet, medication adherence, and additional related symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or sweating. The clinical picture indicates the need to explore these areas further to accurately assess underlying risk factors and symptom severity, recognizing that her current reporting may reflect emotional amplification and communication bias.1. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Justification: Sudden onset of symptoms suggestive of cardiac issues, such as chest discomfort or sensations resembling cardiac events, warrants high suspicion for ACS, which is a critical, potentially life-threatening condition that must be ruled out promptly.  2. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Justification: The stomach discomfort and cardiac-like sensations could represent acid reflux, a common cause of chest discomfort that mimics cardiac pathology, especially if the pain worsens after meals or with certain positions.  3. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Brief, emotionally charged responses, sudden onset of symptoms, and sensations mirroring cardiac issues may indicate a psychological origin, especially if physical causes are ruled out; anxiety can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Esophageal Spasm Justification: Esophageal motility disorders can cause chest pain and discomfort that resemble cardiac symptoms, often triggered by stress or eating, fitting the presentation of sudden discomfort with a sensation of cardiac issues.  5. Diagnosis: Costochondritis Justification: Inflammation of costochondral joints can cause chest pain that might be perceived as cardiac; although less likely given the \"stomach discomfort,\" it remains a differential considering chest symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Peptic Ulcer Disease Justification: Ulcers can cause epigastric pain with sudden onset and discomfort, possibly radiating or mimicking cardiac pain; prevalence is common.  7. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Strain Justification: If the discomfort is localized and related to recent physical activity or positioning, musculoskeletal injury could cause chest or abdominal discomfort, although less likely without specific trauma.  8. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: A life-threatening vascular emergency presenting with chest or abdominal pain, sudden in onset; red flags were not described but remains an important differential due to severity.  9. Diagnosis: Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder (e.g., Functional Dyspepsia) Justification: Chronic or episodic stomach discomfort with no structural cause; less urgent but possible, especially if other causes are excluded.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: This can present with chest discomfort and sensations of cardiac issues, especially if accompanied by dyspnea or hypoxia; less likely given the limited data but important to keep in mind for differential screening.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotional and somewhat vague descriptions, like \"feeling all this stuff\" and \"pretty suddenly,\" indicating discomfort with specifics and a tendency to express distress in broad terms. - Information flow: Tends to be brief and to the point, withholding details unless directly asked, and possibly avoiding elaboration on her diet or medication use. - Response style: Slightly minimal and hurried, reflecting her anxiety and desire to communicate urgency without trauma or shame, but may hinder detailed assessment.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her reluctance to specify her dietary habits, combined with brief responses, suggests she might be hiding or minimizing risk factors. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the significance of her symptoms, focusing on emotional distress rather than detailed physical descriptions. - Amplification patterns: Her emotionally charged language (e.g., \u201cterrible stomach pain,\u201d \u201creally bad\u201d) may be exaggerated to communicate seriousness or solicit concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation when mentioning her diet (\"I probably shouldn't\"), indicating potential shame or guilt associated with her habits. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, but her vague responses could reflect uncertainty or internal discomfort. - Family influence: No explicit signs but her independent living and internal justifications hint at a desire to maintain control and avoid judgment.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization coupled with emotional exaggeration due to anxiety and shame. - Severity: Moderate, as her hesitance and brief responses may lead to underestimating her real clinical risk while her language inflates her distress emotionally. - Areas most affected: Accurate assessment of her diet, symptom timeline, and severity might be compromised, risking underdiagnosis. - Reliability: Self-report is somewhat compromised; lab values and clinical signs are critical to confirm her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Complete details of her dietary intake, symptoms before this acute episode, and adherence to medication may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: She might not fully acknowledge the severity of her prior symptoms or minor signs suggesting chronic issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of a heart attack may be heightened due to emotional distress; she may be more frightened than her objective clinical state warrants. - True timeline: The worsening appears more rapid and severe than she indicates, suggesting her perception of progression is influenced by anxiety, potentially underestimating early signs.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's brief and emotionally charged responses, it's important to gently explore the full scope of her symptoms without making her feel judged or hurried. We need to understand more about her personal experience of the symptoms, including when they started, how they've changed, and what she associates them with. Since her reactions suggest potential withholding, asking open-ended questions that invite elaboration while noting her comfort level is essential. Exploring her feelings and understanding of her symptoms will help clarify severity and impact, especially in a context where she might minimize or exaggerate certain aspects. CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about symptom onset, progression, associated symptoms (e.g., dizziness, nausea), and lifestyle factors like diet and medication adherence. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if symptoms are indeed cardiac, gastrointestinal, or psychological in origin to guide further testing or reassurance. - Patient factors: Her brief responses and emotional tone suggest anxiety and possible shame; questions should be empathetic and non-confrontational. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, encourage comprehensive disclosure, and start forming an understanding of her experience and concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage detailed narrative about her symptoms and experience. - Information target: Symptom timeline, duration, severity, triggers, and impact on daily life. - Communication approach: Gentle, validating, and patient-centered, using her own language to foster trust and openness. - Expected value: Gaining a richer picture of her symptoms will help identify key features that differentiate among potential diagnoses and clarify her level of concern or risk.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what you\u2019ve been experiencing with these symptoms?

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with recent onset chest discomfort, sensations of heart pounding, and weakness, which began yesterday and worsened over several hours. While she reports severe distress and anxiety, objective assessment suggests that initial mild gastrointestinal discomfort may have preceded these symptoms. Her current presentation shows features consistent with acute distress, but underlying symptom severity could be less intense than perceived. Further evaluation of associated systemic symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, sweating, or chest pain is necessary, along with review of her medical history and risk factors, to distinguish between psychological amplification and true physiological severity.1. Diagnosis: Anxiety/Panic Attack Justification: The severe distress, sensations of heart pounding, and recent onset with worsening over hours align with panic attacks, especially given reported anxiety. Anxiety is common and can mimic or precipitate cardiac symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Justification: Chest discomfort with symptoms of heart pounding raises concern for ischemic cardiac events, especially in the context of exertion or stress, although additional risk factors would be helpful.  3. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain Justification: Chest discomfort can originate from musculoskeletal issues, especially if exacerbated by movement or palpation. Mild initial GI discomfort is less indicative but still considered.  4. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Reflux or Esophageal Spasm Justification: The initial mild GI discomfort suggests reflux or esophageal spasm, which can cause chest discomfort mimicking cardiac pain.  5. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia Justification: Sensations of heart pounding (palpitations) might indicate arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia, which can cause chest discomfort and weakness.  6. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Sudden chest discomfort and weakness could suggest PE, especially if risk factors are present; symptoms often include dyspnea, but chest pain and hemodynamic instability need to be assessed.  7. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Though less likely without specific risk factors or severe pain character, dissection can present with chest discomfort and radiates to the back; red flags would include severe, tearing chest pain.  8. Diagnosis: Cardiac Pericarditis Justification: Chest pain that worsens with inspiration and positional change, often involving the pericardium, could be considered, though less likely without other signs.  9. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia Justification: Weakness and potentially cardiac symptoms could be secondary to low blood sugar, especially if she has underlying diabetes or fasting, but less likely without dietary history.  10. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism (Thyrotoxicosis) Justification: Symptoms such as heart pounding, weakness, and anxiety could be aspects of hyperthyroid state but less likely acutely unless there are other signs of thyrotoxicosis.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged language (\"really bad,\" \"so weak I can't even walk properly,\" \"pretty scared\") alongside some vague descriptors (\"a little stomach pain\"), balancing between specific concerns and mild minimization. Her descriptions reflect distress more than clinical detail. - Information flow: She readily shares her symptom timeline and concerns, indicating an open flow but with a focus on emotional impact. She appears to respond directly to questions without evasion. - Response style: Her responses are straightforward but imbued with emotional qualifiers, emphasizing her fears and the sudden worsening of symptoms. She tends to highlight urgency and distress prominently.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding, but her description of early symptoms (\"a little stomach pain\") may be an unconscious minimization or an attempt to mask initial mild discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Possibly underplaying initial discomfort, intending to show her condition escalated quickly. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions carry emotional weight (\"really bad,\" \"so weak,\" \"pretty scared\"), likely amplifying her perceived distress to convey urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No evidence suggesting embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion or inconsistency; her timeline appears logical. - Family influence: Not relevant; she is alone but expresses personal fear openly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification driven by anxiety and fear, with mild minimization of initial mild symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences her reporting, possibly leading her to overemphasize current severity while underplaying earlier, milder symptoms. - Areas most affected: Early symptom detail and timeline comprehension are somewhat biased by emotional focus; her perception of rapid worsening may be exaggerated. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional distress skews objective assessment, so some self-reported details should be confirmed clinically.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully acknowledging or remembering her minor initial symptoms, which could be relevant to causality or progression. - Symptoms probably minimized: The initial stomach discomfort and subtle early weakness might be understated; she might intend to focus on the most alarming aspects. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of heart attack and severity of current symptoms are likely heightened by anxiety, possibly leading to exaggerated perceived danger. - True timeline: The actual progression was likely more gradual with mild early symptoms that she now perceives as severe under emotional influence.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The aim now is to deepen understanding of her experience, particularly about how her symptoms have developed and how they\u2019re impacting her everyday life and emotional state. Given her focus on distress and fear, it\u2019s important to explore not just the physical sensations but also her thoughts and feelings about her symptoms. - I need to gently encourage elaboration on her perception of symptom progression, current worries, and prior health or stress factors, without leading her or minimizing her experience. - Since she might have some emotional amplification, phrasing questions that are open-ended and empathetic can help her express her viewpoint more accurately. - Exploring her understanding and concern will help clarify whether her distress is mainly emotional or if she perceives a physical threat.

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with an acute onset of chest discomfort that began approximately 24 hours prior, with initial mild gastrointestinal symptoms that have since worsened. She reports sensations of a racing, pounding heart and weakness, coupled with significant emotional distress and fear of a serious condition. While she describes her current symptoms as \"not that bad,\" her guarded communication style suggests her symptoms, including chest pain, palpitations, and systemic signs such as dizziness or nausea, may be more severe than she reports. Further assessment is needed to evaluate for potential cardiac or systemic etiologies, with particular attention to additional symptoms she might be withholding, to ensure timely diagnosis and management.1. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Justification: The presentation of chest discomfort with palpitations and weakness suggests possible ischemic cardiac etiology. Although she reports the pain as \"not that bad,\" her guarded manner and systemic signs like weakness raise concern for serious cardiac pathology that needs to be ruled out urgently.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Sudden onset of chest sensations, racing heart, emotional distress, and guarded communication are characteristic of panic attacks. The presence of systemic symptoms could be due to adrenergic surge associated with anxiety.  3. Diagnosis: Myocarditis Justification: Systemic symptoms along with chest discomfort and palpitations could suggest myocarditis, especially given the acute nature. Emotional distress may exacerbate symptoms, but myocarditis remains a possibility due to her presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal causes (e.g., esophageal reflux or disorder) Justification: Initial mild gastrointestinal symptoms that worsened could be related to reflux or esophageal spasm, which can mimic cardiac chest pain, particularly in females.  5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Chest discomfort, weakness, and systemic symptoms could also suggest a pulmonary embolism; however, less information on risk factors or dyspnea limits immediate suspicion until further assessment.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Prefers vague, non-specific phrases (\"little stomach pain,\" \"not that bad\") that minimize symptom severity, while expressing fear in cautious terms. - Information flow: Tends to withhold detailed emotional reactions and minimizes physical symptoms unless pressed; information is organized but guarded. - Response style: Responses are concise, somewhat guarded, with a tendency to prioritize resilience; avoids overstating symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Fails to fully disclose the extent of her distress and minimizes severity, often downplaying symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Uses phrases like \"not that bad,\" \"just my old stuff,\" suggesting an attempt to diminish perceived seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Occasional expressions of fear (\"I'm pretty scared\") indicate genuine anxiety but are suppressed by minimization. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No blatant signs, but her reluctance to describe her symptoms fully may reflect pride or shame about her physical vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident inconsistencies; her timeline is clear. - Family influence: None apparent; responses seem internally managed.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Minimization, because she consciously or subconsciously downplays symptoms and emotional reactions. - Severity: Moderate, as her language and responses suggest she underestimates symptom severity but communicates enough to seek care. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity perception and emotional expression, with potential underestimation of urgency. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report provides a partial picture, likely underrepresenting the true severity of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of physical discomfort, emotional distress, and perceived urgency. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of chest pain, weakness, and dizziness; she might be experiencing more immediate danger than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear and anxiety are real, but her cognitive bias causes her to understate physical risks. - True timeline: The progression is rapid, fitting her severe presentation; her focus on \"not that bad\" suggests she perceives her symptoms as less urgent than they are.  Overall, her communication pattern shows strong minimization bias with guarded emotional disclosure, which could lead clinicians to underestimate the severity of her hyperkalaemia.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps include her current emotional state, any recent stressors, and details about associated symptoms like sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath that might support or refute diagnoses such as panic attack or cardiac etiology. - Diagnostic priorities involve clarifying the presence of typical cardiac signs, features of anxiety or panic, or systemic symptoms that could suggest myocarditis or pulmonary embolism. - Her guarded communication style suggests we should ask focused, yet sensitive questions to elicit more detailed symptom descriptions without feeling confrontational. - During early exploration, it\u2019s crucial to hone in on symptom qualities, triggers, and modifiers, especially for chest discomfort and systemic symptoms, to refine the differential.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific follow-up questions about key symptoms and associated findings. - Information target: Characteristics of chest pain (e.g., location, nature, timing), presence of associated symptoms (e.g., dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath), emotional responses, and any previous similar episodes. - Communication approach: Phrase questions in a non-judgmental, gentle manner, encouraging openness, and explicitly acknowledging the difficulty of sharing such symptoms. - Expected value: This will help distinguish among cardiac, anxiety, or systemic etiologies, and uncover any critical symptoms that may be underreported.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your chest discomfort began about a day ago and that you've been feeling weak and anxious.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral or allergic) Justification: The symptoms of redness and tearing are classic conjunctival involvement; recent physical activity does not exclude conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis often causes bilateral redness and tearing, which may fit if bilateral, but even unilateral viral conjunctivitis can present this way. Allergic conjunctivitis is also characterized by redness and tearing, frequently with swelling. The abrupt onset post-activity suggests environmental or allergic factors influencing ocular surface. No mention of purulent discharge or systemic signs leans toward a viral or allergic etiology.  2. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: The acute onset after playing soccer strongly suggests trauma-induced rupture of superficial blood vessels, leading to localized redness (a blood collection under conjunctiva). The swelling can be secondary to trauma, with tearing possibly due to irritation. The history of recent physical activity supports trauma as a cause; the absence of pain or visual changes is consistent with simple hemorrhage.  3. Diagnosis: Trauma-related ocular injury (e.g., minor blunt trauma) Justification: Playing soccer introduces the possibility of minor ocular trauma, which can cause conjunctival redness, swelling, and tearing due to conjunctival or superficial injury. Symptoms appearing within two days align with mild trauma. This explanation fits well with recent sports activity and no systemic illness.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are characteristic; recent activity might have exposed the patient to allergens (grass, pollen). Though less specific than trauma, the rapid onset supports an allergy, especially if the patient has a history of allergies. Lack of discharge or other systemic signs makes it less certain but still plausible.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Although it can present with eyelid swelling and redness, this is less likely given the short duration, absence of systemic symptoms (fever, malaise), and no mention of pain or proptosis. It remains lower on the list but included because eyelid swelling and redness can sometimes mimic more serious infections, warranting consideration if systemic signs develop.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient prefers emotional descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"so weak\") and vague terms (\"pressure or fluttering\"), indicating emotional response may overshadow precise symptom reporting. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming about key symptoms but with some vagueness, possibly to soften the presentation or out of discomfort. - Response style: Responses are somewhat abbreviated and emotion-driven, with a tendency toward exaggeration but still logical overall.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight vagueness about the nature of the chest sensations and the history of prior similar episodes, suggesting some withholding or downplaying. - Minimization behaviors: Use of \"more like\" and \"not sure\" when describing chest feelings indicates possible intentional or subconscious minimization. - Amplification patterns: Words like \"really bad,\" \"so weak I can't walk\" reveal emotional exaggeration of severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs of embarrassment; anxiety seems openly expressed. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence. - Family influence: Not directly evident.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with mild minimization\u2014an anxious patient seeking reassurance but also potentially underrating certain descriptions to avoid sounding overly severe. - Severity: Moderate, as the patient communicates concern but may be unintentionally downplaying certain physical descriptions. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of chest tightness and weakness\u2014could be slightly understated. - Reliability: Moderate; emotional distress may distort accurate perception but overall reporting appears consistent.

These symptoms are persistent and distressing, raising concern for potential cardiac or anxiety-related conditions, but further history and examination are necessary to clarify the nature, pattern, and severity of her symptoms, as well as to identify any associated signs that might influence diagnosis.Acute Coronary Syndrome ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a combination of vague and emotional language, often downplaying symptoms (\"more like pressure\") while emphasizing distress (\"really bad,\" \"so weak I can't stand\"). She oscillates between minimization and exaggeration. - Information flow: She offers some details proactively, especially when describing sensations, but also adds qualifiers to soften or emphasize symptoms, indicating partial control over information sharing. - Response style: Her responses are relatively elaborative but often include self-correcting or qualifying phrases, revealing internal uncertainty and emotional influence.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She indicates uncertainty (\"I don\u2019t remember it ever being like this before\") and hesitates to confirm specifics, which may mask actual symptom severity. - Minimization behaviors: Using phrases like \"more like,\" \"not sure,\" attempting to sound less alarming. - Amplification patterns: Descriptions like \"really bad,\" \"terrible,\" \"so weak I can't even walk\" underscore high emotional distress, possibly exagerrating fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Self-corrections and hesitance when discussing symptom specifics suggest some discomfort with admitting severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident memory issues but some descriptor vagueness may reflect uncertainty rather than cognitive lapses. - Family influence: Not directly evident, but internalized worry and desire to avoid overreacting may reflect social conditioning.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization combined with some emotional exaggeration. Her language indicates she tries to downplay but cannot fully suppress her distress, leading to mixed bias signals. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her responses are somewhat biased but still contain core accurate information. - Most affected areas: Symptom description and timeline are most biased, with potential underreporting of episodic aspects and overstating general discomfort. - Reliability: Moderate trustworthiness; emotional distress influences her reporting, so cross-verification of symptoms and clinical signs is essential.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise characterization of episodic nature, triggers, and history of similar symptoms; she might underreport specifics to avoid seeming overly anxious. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity and acuity of chest sensations, the true progression of symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of a catastrophic event (heart attack), which may lead her to overemphasize the fear-driven aspects. - True timeline: Likely more episodic than continuous, with symptoms evolving rapidly; her perception is colored by anxiety, so actual clinical progression may differ slightly from her report.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps include the detailed pattern of her chest symptoms\u2014how often they occur, their duration, and whether they are reproducible or associated with particular triggers. - Diagnostic priorities involve clarifying whether her symptoms align more with cardiac ischemia or anxiety/nonspecific chest discomfort, necessitating focus on symptom quality, associated features, and triggers. - The patient's emotionally charged language and oscillation between minimization and exaggeration suggest she may be uncertain or anxious, so questions should be sensitive and collaborative. - Given her presentation with sudden onset chest tightness and associated symptoms, confirming the episodic nature, severity, and impact is essential before considering further urgency. - At this stage, I want to solidify whether the symptoms are truly transient, reproducible, or linked to specific activities, and explore her understanding and concerns regarding her symptoms and potential diagnoses. - I should use focused, open-ended questions that gently probe her symptom pattern without leading, while also validating her distress.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions that encourage detailed description of symptom timing and pattern. - Information target: Duration, triggers, frequency, progression, and associated symptoms of her chest issues, as well as her understanding and fears. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, empathetic language to facilitate trust and accurate disclosure. - Expected value: This will help disentangle the episodic nature, clarify severity, and determine urgency or need for immediate intervention, all vital for diagnostic certainty and planning next steps.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, can you describe in more detail what happens when these chest feelings come on? For example, do they come suddenly or gradually? How long do they usually last? Do they happen during specific activities or times of day? And when these episodes occur, do you notice anything else happening at the same time, like dizziness or sweating? Also, how often have you been experiencing this pattern\u2014are these episodes one-time or recurring?\"",
