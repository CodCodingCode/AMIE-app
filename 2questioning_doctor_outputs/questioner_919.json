    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: The acute onset with redness, tearing, and swelling spreading rapidly after physical activity is characteristic; common in young, active individuals and highly contagious.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: Rapid onset with eye redness and tearing suggests bacterial etiology, especially if there is purulent discharge, which commonly follows contagious exposure.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Usually bilateral and associated with itching; relevant considering recent physical activity which might expose to allergens, but less likely without prior allergy history.  4. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Common after sports involving eye trauma; redness, swelling, tearing, especially if associated with pain or foreign body sensation.  5. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden swelling and redness following activity; often painless, related to strain or trauma, common in sports like soccer.  6. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness localized around the eye, possibly after trauma; uncommon without systemic signs but important to consider.  7. Diagnosis: Typical Environmental or Contact-related Allergy Justification: Can cause bilateral redness and tearing, possibly exacerbated by outdoor activity, though less likely without additional allergic symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: If severe pain accompanies redness and visual disturbance, but less likely here as symptoms are recent and more conjunctivitis-like.  9. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes redness and tearing; usually associated with pain and photophobia, but less likely given the presentation\u2019s rapid onset and activity association.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness, but usually associated with systemic signs such as fever and more severe pain; less typical with brief activity-related onset.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses highly emotional, vivid language (\"really bad cramps,\" \"feel like I might pass out,\" \"pretty scary\") that reflects distress but lacks specific medical detail. Her responses are focused on her emotional experience rather than clinical facts. - Information flow: She lijkt to volunteer her main concerns quickly but with minimal elaboration on specific symptoms or timeline details, indicating a tendency toward emotional expression rather than detailed reporting. Her communication appears somewhat disorganized and driven by fear. - Response style: Her style is mostly emotional and direct, with little elaboration or technical language. She heavily emphasizes her fears and feelings, which suggests an amplification bias.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of reluctance to provide detailed prior medical history or specific symptom chronology, possibly due to overwhelm or avoidance. Her focus on current distress may inhibit complete disclosure of relevant background information. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her symptoms as \"really bad\" but also as \"scary,\" indicating she might be emphasizing severity, yet she doesn\u2019t discuss other symptoms thoroughly, possibly minimizing lesser symptoms or earlier warning signs. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional language and focus on the worst-case scenario suggest an amplification bias\u2014she may perceive her symptoms as more severe than they objectively are. Her focus on fear could lead her to overstate her discomfort. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited evidence; her open expression of distress suggests she's not particularly reticent about her feelings but may avoid discussing medical details she perceives as shameful or sensitive. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent signs of confusion; her timeline is clear but emotionally charged. - Family influence: No explicit evidence of external influences affecting her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification, driven by her significant distress and fear, leading her to describe her symptoms as more urgent than might be objectively warranted. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 her emotional state clearly influences her reporting, likely inflating her perception of symptoms, but her narrative remains mostly coherent. - Areas most affected: Her perceived severity of symptoms and her timeline are impacted. She may underreport or exclude relevant medical history details due to distress. - Reliability: Her self-report is somewhat compromised; emotional distress affects her ability to provide a balanced, accurate report. While her fears are justified, reliance solely on her description without corroborative data may overstate current severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific medical history details, prior symptoms, and timeline nuances. She may be withholding information about her past pelvic health or previous minor symptoms that could clarify her current presentation. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less severe symptoms or earlier warning signs that she perceives as insignificant. Her focus on crisis-driven language suggests she may underreport subtler or less emotionally charged issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about pregnancy loss and infection are likely heightened by emotional response; while her symptoms are urgent, her perception of danger might be exaggerated. - True timeline: The actual progression might be more gradual than she perceives; her focus on sudden onset may reflect her current distress more than the real onset of symptoms.",

    "input": "A female patient presents with recent onset of heavy vaginal bleeding and abdominal cramps, which began approximately 24 hours prior and have increased in intensity. She describes the cramps as sharp and stabbing and reports sensations of heaviness and dizziness, raising concern for significant blood loss. Given her emotional communication style, the severity of symptoms may be overestimated, though the symptoms are objectively present. No additional systemic symptoms such as fever or foul-smelling discharge have been reported; further assessment is needed to evaluate for infection, bleeding severity, and other systemic signs, along with detailed menstrual and reproductive history.1. Diagnosis: Miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) Justification: Recent onset of heavy bleeding and abdominal cramps in a female patient suggests early pregnancy loss, especially if her pregnancy status is unknown or confirmed. Cramping and bleeding are typical presenting features; dizziness indicates possible significant blood loss.  2. Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy Justification: Sharply stabbing abdominal cramps with heavy bleeding and dizziness are classic warning signs, especially in a woman of reproductive age; though often associated with positive pregnancy, it must be considered in differential diagnostics.  3. Diagnosis: Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) Justification: The presentation resembles increased menstrual bleeding; however, the acuity and associated dizziness suggest an underlying pathology or complication rather than typical cycle variation.  4. Diagnosis: Uterine fibroids causing heavy bleeding Justification: Fibroids can cause heavy bleeding and cramping; in some cases, this can precipitate acute hemorrhage especially if they outgrow blood supply or suddenly enlarge.  5. Diagnosis: Bleeding irregularities from hormonal dysfunction Justification: Hormonal imbalances (e.g., anovulation) may cause heavy bleeding, but usually less acute and not as associated with severe cramps and dizziness unless complication occurs.  6. Diagnosis: Endometrial or cervical pathology (e.g., polyps, hyperplasia) Justification: Abnormal bleeding can be due to endometrial hyperplasia or polyp formation, especially in women approaching menopause, but less likely to cause acute severe cramps.  7. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy Justification: Bleeding severity may be amplified in bleeding disorders, with associated dizziness; however, absence of prior history diminishes likelihood.  8. Diagnosis: Pelvic infection (pelvic inflammatory disease) Justification: No fever or foul smell reported, making infectious causes less likely; nonetheless, some infections can cause bleeding if cervix is involved.  9. Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst rupture Justification: Ovarian cyst rupture can cause acute abdominal pain and bleeding, but heavy bleeding is less characteristic unless complicated.  10. Diagnosis: Urinary tract pathology (e.g., ureteral stone) Justification: Less likely given the presenting gynecological symptoms; would primarily cause flank pain rather than heavy vaginal bleeding.

BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Clutching her abdomen and fidgeting suggest discomfort, but her guarded language hints at possible withholding of less obvious symptoms like fever or unusual discharge, which she might consider less pressing. - Minimization behaviors: She refers to her symptoms as \"kind of\" starting suddenly, downplaying the severity, and emphasizes that she \"kind of\" feels heavy, indicating she might minimize how severe her pain or bleeding truly is. - Amplification patterns: The description of her pain as \"sharp, stabbing,\" and the feeling of \"like I might pass out\" reflect actual distress, but her focus on the worst-case fears and use of exaggerated language (e.g., \"really bad,\" \"terrible\") suggest some amplification driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signals, but her guarded language and reluctance to detail specific aspects (e.g., reproductive health concerns) may hint at modesty or discomfort discussing certain symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; responses are consistent with her narrative. - Family influence: No direct evidence of external influence affecting responses, but close contact with her family might indirectly shape her expression of concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification and minimization bias, chiefly driven by anxiety\u2014she amplifies her fears of losing the pregnancy and the severity of her pain while minimizing the normalcy of some symptoms like bleeding. - Severity: Moderate, as she may be overstating the urgency due to fear but still reports genuine symptoms, making her overall report somewhat reliable but exaggerated in emotional tone. - Areas most affected: Her pain and bleeding descriptions are likely accurate, but her perceived severity and fears about outcome might be overstated. She might underreport additional symptoms like fever or foul odor, which are significant but unmentioned. - Reliability: Generally reliable regarding the presence of symptoms but biased toward exaggeration of severity and emotional distress, warranting careful assessment to avoid over- or under-treatment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specifics about associated symptoms such as fever, chills, foul discharge, or prior bleeding patterns that she considers less significant might be withheld. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be minimizing the subtle or less distressing symptoms that could suggest infection or other complications, focusing instead on her pain and bleeding. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about pregnancy loss, infection, and suffering are amplified, potentially clouding objective assessment. - True timeline: Her report of sudden onset aligns with her physical symptoms; however, emotional exaggeration may lead to perceived escalation that is greater than the actual progression.",

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with acute heavy vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal cramps that began approximately 24 hours prior, with worsening over time. While she describes her symptoms as \"pretty bad\" and \"scary,\" her communication indicates possible minimization of the true severity. Objective assessment suggests the bleeding may be more copious, and she may be experiencing systemic signs of blood loss such as dizziness, weakness, or pallor that are underreported. Her symptoms warrant urgent evaluation to determine the severity of hemorrhage, assess for hypovolemia or anemia, and investigate for possible gynecological complications.1. Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy Justification: The acute onset of heavy vaginal bleeding combined with severe abdominal cramps strongly suggests an ectopic pregnancy, especially given the rapid progression. Since this condition often presents with unilateral lower abdominal pain and bleeding in women of reproductive age, and can progress quickly to rupture with significant hemorrhage, it is the most likely cause of her symptoms. The severity and worsening over 24 hours align with rupture or ongoing bleeding from an ectopic focus.  2. Diagnosis: Spontaneous miscarriage Justification: Heavy bleeding and abdominal cramps can also occur in spontaneous miscarriage, especially in early pregnancy. Although the degree of abdominal pain and bleeding is severe, this remains a primary differential because it is common and can present similarly. Without confirmatory information about pregnancy status, it's important to consider miscarriage as a probable cause, particularly if she is pregnant.  3. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture Justification: Uterine rupture, while less common, can cause sudden heavy bleeding and abdominal pain, especially in women with previous uterine surgery or trauma. Its presentation includes signs of hemorrhagic shock and severe abdominal pain, which fits the scenario. The acuity and systemic signs heighten concern for uterine rupture, although it is less frequent than ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.  4. Diagnosis: Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst Justification: A ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst can cause sudden-onset abdominal pain with bleeding, sometimes significant. It is a plausible differential, especially if cystic pathology was previously known or suspected, though it is generally less severe than ectopic rupture and may not fully explain systemic signs unless hemorrhage is substantial.  5. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy or bleeding disorder Justification: Although less likely given the description, underlying bleeding disorders could exacerbate bleeding severity and delay recognition of other causes. However, the acuteness and localizing symptoms make primary gynecologic causes more probable, so this remains a lower-probability differential.

She only shares core concerns without elaborating on the emotional or physical impact. - Response style: Her answers are minimal and guarded, likely to protect herself from vulnerability or due to difficulty expressing intense feelings.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague descriptors and lack of detailed emotional elaboration suggest she may not be fully communicating the extent of her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Her language minimizes the severity (\"pretty bad,\" \"just a lot to handle\"), which indicates she may be underreporting how serious her condition actually is. - Amplification patterns: There is some emotional distress evident, but she avoids overstatement, possibly to maintain composure or pride. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her guarded tone hints she might feel uncomfortable fully admitting the extent of her distress. - Confusion/memory issues: None observed. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family affecting responses, but her close relationship indicates internal support, not external pressure affecting her statements.

    "input": "A woman presenting with acute, heavy vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal cramps that began approximately 24 hours prior, with progressive worsening. She reports significant pain and feelings of faintness, soaking through multiple pads and becoming more distressed over time. Clinical suspicion includes substantial hemorrhage with systemic hypovolemia that may be underappreciated in reported symptoms, necessitating urgent assessment of vital signs, physical examination for signs of shock, and further quantification of blood loss to determine severity and guide management.1. Diagnosis: Spontaneous Abortion (Miscarriage) Justification: The acute onset of heavy bleeding with abdominal cramps strongly suggests miscarriage, especially if the patient is of reproductive age and possibly pregnant. The progression and severity imply ongoing substantial bleeding, which is common in miscarriage, particularly if incomplete. This diagnosis directly explains the symptoms and the systemic hypovolemia risk.  2. Diagnosis: Ectopic Pregnancy Justification: If the patient is pregnant, an ectopic pregnancy is a critical consideration given the sudden, heavy bleeding, and severe pain. It often presents with unilateral abdominal pain and can rapidly lead to bleeding and shock. Although pregnancy status isn't explicitly given, this remains a top priority differential considering the presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Fibroids or Uterine Pathology Justification: Fibroids or other structural abnormalities can cause heavy, irregular bleeding that worsens over time. However, the rapid progression and cramps suggest an acute cause rather than a chronic or slowly worsening process, making this less likely as the primary diagnosis but still relevant.  4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy or Bleeding Disorder Justification: Bleeding disorders can cause heavy menstrual or vaginal bleeding. These might be more relevant if there's a history of bleeding episodes or known coagulopathy. Since the presentation is acute and severe, this remains a consideration, especially if initial evaluation shows systemic bleeding with no obstetric cause.  5. Diagnosis: Placental Abruption or Other Obstetric Hemorrhage Justification: In pregnant women, placental abruption could cause sudden, severe bleeding with abdominal pain. This is less likely if pregnancy is denied or unknown, but it remains a critical consideration if pregnancy is confirmed.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses a mix of vague qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") and explicit descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"solid 8\"), balancing honesty with cautiousness. Her emotional terms (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") reveal genuine distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about her symptoms when asked directly, providing details on pain and bleeding but tends to moderate her description to avoid sounding overly dramatic. - Response style: Her responses are elaborated but tempered; she attempts to explain her experience clearly but adds qualifiers that suggest she wants to minimize perceived severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: minimal; she generally shares her symptoms openly but filters her descriptions with moderation. - Minimization behaviors: evident in her frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" which suggest she is consciously or unconsciously downplaying her discomfort. - Amplification patterns: she acknowledges feeling very faint and pain that \"might be more,\" indicating some awareness that symptoms could be more severe than expressed. - Embarrassment/shame signals: subtle; her cautious language may hint at discomfort discussing intense pain, but no overt signs. - Confusion/memory issues: none; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: limited; close to her parents but living alone, no indication her responses are notably affected.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as she moderates descriptors of pain and bleeding despite considerable discomfort. - Severity: Moderate; the likelihood that her symptoms are somewhat worse than reported is high, affecting clinical judgment if not probed further. - Areas most affected: pain and bleeding severity are most biased; her cautious language likely underestimates actual symptom intensity. - Reliability: Moderate; her willingness to disclose detailed symptoms suggests honest communication, but her tendency to minimize warrants cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity of her pain and bleeding may be underrepresented; she might be experiencing more intense discomfort and hemorrhage. - Symptoms probably minimized: Pain and bleeding are probably worse than described, given her use of cautious language. - Concerns probably amplified: Her genuine fears about pregnancy loss or infection are likely accurate, but her anxious state may amplify perceived danger. - True timeline: Symptoms probably worsened faster and more intensely than she admits, especially regarding escalation of pain and bleeding.  Overall, her communication pattern suggests cautious disclosure with subtle minimization bias; recognizing this is critical to ensuring accurate assessment of her urgent clinical needs.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Details about the nature of her pain (quality, location, duration), quantity and pattern of bleeding, and any associated symptoms such as fever, chills, or additional systemic symptoms are missing.

Clarifying the severity of symptoms and associated features will help determine urgency. - Patient factors: The patient's cautious, minimization language indicates she may downplay certain symptoms like pain or bleeding severity. Questions should therefore be framed gently but precisely to elicit accurate information, reinforcing her openness. - Interview phase goals: To refine the understanding of the progression, intensity, and impact of her symptoms; confirm pregnancy status; and identify any red flags such as signs of severe blood loss or systemic illness.

Her emotional terms (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") reveal genuine distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about her symptoms when asked directly, providing details on pain and bleeding but tends to moderate her description to avoid sounding overly dramatic. - Response style: Her responses are elaborated but tempered; she attempts to explain her experience clearly but adds qualifiers that suggest she wants to minimize perceived severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: minimal; she generally shares her symptoms openly but filters her descriptions with moderation. - Minimization behaviors: evident in her frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" which suggest she is consciously or unconsciously downplaying her discomfort. - Amplification patterns: she acknowledges feeling very faint and pain that \"might be more,\" indicating some awareness that symptoms could be more severe than expressed. - Embarrassment/shame signals: subtle; her cautious language may hint at discomfort discussing intense pain, but no overt signs. - Confusion/memory issues: none; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: limited; close to her parents but living alone, no indication her responses are notably affected.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as she moderates descriptors of pain and bleeding despite considerable discomfort. - Severity: Moderate; the likelihood that her symptoms are somewhat worse than reported is high, affecting clinical judgment if not probed further. - Areas most affected: pain and bleeding severity are most biased; her cautious language likely underestimates actual symptom intensity. - Reliability: Moderate; her willingness to disclose detailed symptoms suggests honest communication, but her tendency to minimize warrants cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity of her pain and bleeding may be underrepresented; she might be experiencing more intense discomfort and hemorrhage. - Symptoms probably minimized: Pain and bleeding are probably worse than described, given her use of cautious language. - Concerns probably amplified: Her genuine fears about pregnancy loss or infection are likely accurate, but her anxious state may amplify perceived danger. - True timeline: Symptoms probably worsened faster and more intensely than she admits, especially regarding escalation of pain and bleeding.  Overall, her communication pattern suggests cautious disclosure with subtle minimization bias; recognizing this is critical to ensuring accurate assessment of her urgent clinical needs.",

    "input": "A pregnant woman presenting with approximately 24 hours of acute, progressively worsening heavy vaginal bleeding and severe lower abdominal cramps. She reports sharp, stabbing pain and a heavy, aching sensation across her lower abdomen. She also experiences dizziness and weakness but minimizes the severity, stating she does not want to overreact. She reports soaking through multiple pads within a short timeframe, indicating significant blood loss. Communication suggests her systemic and emotional distress may be more severe than acknowledged, with potential underlying hypovolemia or shock that requires urgent assessment and management.Spontaneous miscarriage with hemorrhage ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague descriptors such as \"mostly like sharp\" and \"heavier than before,\" which signal some degree of minimizing or discomfort with detailed description. Her emotional language appears controlled; she mentions dizziness and weakness but tries not to overemphasize these symptoms, indicating a tendency to understate severity. - Information flow: Her responses are generally organized but appear somewhat guarded. She volunteers basic info about her symptoms when prompted but is reluctant to elaborate on emotional or functional impact unless specifically asked. The responses are succinct, with occasional hesitations suggesting internal conflict about revealing true extent. - Response style: She tends to minimize and understate her symptoms, perhaps to avoid seeming overly upset or to maintain composure. When pressed for severity and impact, she offers more detail but still avoids full expression of distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her deliberate downplaying of dizziness and weakness indicates an intent to minimize seriousness. She states she \"doesn't want to make a big deal,\" which shows awareness of her condition\u2019s gravity but reluctance to fully acknowledge it. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her pain as \"mostly like\" and \"kinda all over,\" which may underplay her actual discomfort. She reports soaking through pads but minimizes the concern by saying \"I think,\" avoiding precise acknowledgment of severity. - Amplification patterns: She does not seem to exaggerate symptoms; rather, she minimizes. Her concern about the pregnancy and the IUD seems genuine but possibly understated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her reluctance to discuss emotional distress fully and her comment about not trying to get pregnant hint at potential shame or embarrassment about her situation. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: She maintains a level of independence but mentions being close to her parents, possibly hinting at potential influences or pressures, though not overtly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, as evidenced by her downplaying both physical symptoms and emotional distress, likely driven by a desire to appear responsible or resilient. - Severity: Moderate; she acknowledges pain and bleeding worsening but keeps her distress toned down. The primary concern of heavy bleeding and dizziness could be more severe than reported. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and emotional impact; she underestimates dizziness and weakness. - Reliability: Partial; her responses are somewhat guarded, so some details\u2014especially concerning severity\u2014may not be fully reliable.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be experiencing more profound weakness, hypovolemia, or emotional distress than she admits, which could impact clinical urgency. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her dizziness and weakness, as well as the overall severity of bleeding, might be worse than current self-report suggests. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about the pregnancy and IUD complications seem genuine but may be understated or driven by underlying anxiety rather than complete understanding. - True timeline: Her symptoms are worsening rapidly, possibly more acutely than she reports, emphasizing the need for urgent assessment.  Overall, her communication indicates moderate minimization bias impacting accurate clinical appraisal. Her physical symptoms and emotional state may be more severe, requiring careful probing for full understanding.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is presenting with significant bleeding and abdominal pain, but she tends to minimize symptoms, especially dizziness and severity. Since her history suggests potential hypovolemia or emergent obstetric issues, I need to confirm the severity of her bleeding, the characteristics of her pain, and assess whether her condition might be more urgent than she indicates. Additionally, exploring her understanding of her pregnancy status and emotional state will help prepare for shared decision-making and treatment planning. I should phrase questions to gently uncover any hidden distress or worse symptoms while remaining sensitive to her guarded communication style. This stage aims to gather concrete, specific details on her current condition and confirm that her presentation aligns with an urgent diagnosis like spontaneous miscarriage with hemorrhage.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise amount of bleeding, current vital symptoms (dizziness, weakness), her awareness of her condition's severity, stability, and understanding of her pregnancy. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm ongoing heavy bleeding, signs of hypovolemia, and the timeline of symptom worsening. - Patient factors: Guarded communication and minimization bias suggest using specific, non-threatening questions to elicit full information. - Interview phase goals: Verify severity of bleeding, pain characteristics, assess her understanding of pregnancy risk, and gauge emotional and physical stability before explaining diagnosis and management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions to clarify severity and impact. - Information target: Bleeding volume, pain quality, associated symptoms like dizziness or faintness, pregnancy status. - Communication approach: Use compassionate, non-judgmental language that encourages honesty without causing defensiveness. - Expected value: Clarifying her clinical status will confirm if she needs urgent intervention and facilitate shared decision-making for treatment options.\nANSWER: \"I understand that you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, and I want to make sure I understand just how serious your symptoms are right now. Can you tell me exactly how many pads or towels you've soaked through today, and whether you're feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or faint at this moment? Also, has the pain become sharper or more intense in the last few hours? Are you feeling able to sit or stand comfortably, or do you feel weak or unsteady? And just to double-check, are you still pregnant and trying to get pregnant, or do you think your pregnancy might have changed?\"",
