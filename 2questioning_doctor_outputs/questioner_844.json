    "input": "The patient is experiencing intermittent chest discomfort described as a heaviness, with associated fatigue, dizziness, and exertional shortness of breath, with clinical severity potentially underestimated due to cautious patient reporting. Further investigation is necessary to clarify symptom characteristics and assess for underlying cardiac ischemia.1. Diagnosis: Stable Angina Pectoris Justification: Classic symptoms of exertional chest heaviness with associated fatigue and dyspnea strongly suggest myocardial ischemia, common in patients with risk factors, and consistent with the description.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (Unstable Angina or NSTEMI) Justification: The intermittent chest discomfort with exertion and associated symptoms raises concern for potential acute ischemic events, especially if symptoms worsen or become more frequent.  3. Diagnosis: Microvascular Angina (Cardiac Syndrome X) Justification: Chest heaviness and exertional symptoms with normal or non-obstructive coronaries are characteristic, particularly in patients without significant coronary stenosis; often underrecognized.  4. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Justification: Chest discomfort that is exertional and intermittent can mimic cardiac ischemia; GERD is a common differential, especially if symptoms can be triggered or relieved by position or antacids.  5. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain Justification: Non-cardiac cause; can present with intermittent heaviness, especially if linked to movements or palpation, and less likely to be associated with exertional symptoms but still possible.  6. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Dizziness and exertional dyspnea can suggest PE, especially if risk factors are present; however, the described symptoms are more typical of ischemia.  7. Diagnosis: Pericarditis Justification: Can cause chest discomfort, but typically with positional or pleuritic features; less likely given the exertional pattern and heaviness.  8. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Chest heaviness can be severe, and dizziness may be present; typically more acute and severe, often with radiation or associated signs, but cannot be entirely excluded.  9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Can produce chest tightness, fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath; less likely if exertional and consistent with ischemic features but should be considered.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Justification: Exertional shortness of breath and fatigue may suggest pulmonary vascular issues; less likely without other supporting signs but should be remembered.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Linda uses a mixture of specific descriptors (\"heavy weight,\" \"short of breath\") but balances this with mild, less alarming language (\"kind of,\" \"a little tired,\" \"manageable\"). Her tone suggests a careful attempt to be truthful but also to avoid sounding overly anxious. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming and organized, providing a clear timeline and detailed symptom descriptions, though she downplays severity. She appears cooperative but subtly minimizes the importance of her symptoms. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative but contain understatements that could reflect an attempt to appear resilient or to avoid alarm. She is open but employs some mild minimization language.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Possible hesitation to fully express concern about the severity or urgency of her symptoms, potentially to avoid worrying the doctor or indicating she is overly anxious. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"manageable\" discomfort and \"kind of like\" suggest she\u2019s downplaying how serious her symptoms might be. - Amplification patterns: Her declaration of \"worse over the past few weeks\" and being \"really worried\" signals genuine concern but may be slightly exaggerated to ensure her issues are taken seriously. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs\u2014she seems straightforward, though her modest language could be a form of self-protection. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: She notes her family visits often but does not indicate they influence her symptom reporting directly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight tendency toward symptom minimization and delayed care engagement, perhaps influenced by wanting to appear tough or resilient. - Severity: Moderate, because while she does report worsening symptoms, her language and tone could lead her to underappreciate the potential seriousness. - Areas most affected: Her description of chest pain and dizziness is likely biased toward underplaying, which could underestimate her true clinical risk and urgency. - Reliability: Her self-report is relatively consistent but contains subtle downplaying signs, so clinical judgment should include corroboration with objective testing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully disclosing how severe her symptoms might be or the level of concern she truly feels, possibly to avoid appearing overly anxious. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of her chest pain and risk of cardiac event could be greater than she indicates. - Concerns probably amplified: Her stated worry (\"quite high\") may reflect genuine concern but could be slightly exaggerated to ensure her condition gains appropriate attention. - True timeline: Her symptom progression seems consistent; however, her language suggests she might be framing it less alarmingly than it truly is, potentially delaying urgent intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The key information gaps involve understanding the full scope of her symptoms, particularly how often and severe her chest discomfort is, what triggers it, and whether she has experienced changes in intensity or frequency. I'm also interested in her thoughts and feelings about these symptoms\u2014how she perceives their seriousness and impact. Because she\u2019s described her chest heaviness and associated symptoms as \"manageable\" and somewhat mild, I should probe further to assess whether she underestimates the risk or severity. Given her cautious communication style, an open-ended question inviting elaboration on her experience and concerns could help us build rapport and gather more detailed information. Exploring what she has noticed about her symptoms over time could reveal important clues about their progression or triggers.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about symptom severity, triggers, changes over time, and her emotional response. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether her symptoms could be cardiac in nature or related to other causes such as reflux, musculoskeletal issues, or anxiety. - Patient factors: She appears to be somewhat reserved and careful with her wording, so questions need to be gentle and open-ended to encourage honesty. - Interview phase goals: Create a safe environment for her to describe her experience in her own words, gather detailed symptom descriptions, and gauge her concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, broad question that encourages elaboration. - Information target: Sheer narrative of her symptom experience, including onset, progression, triggers, and emotional impact. - Communication approach: Frame the question gently, validating her perspective, and avoiding medical jargon or leading language. - Expected value: Will provide a comprehensive narrative that can help identify patterns and further guide targeted questioning.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about what you've noticed with this chest heaviness and the other symptoms you mentioned. How has it been changing over time, and what do you think might be making it better or worse?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a history of intermittent chest discomfort described as a heaviness that worsens over several weeks, particularly with exertion such as walking or climbing stairs. She also reports increased fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath during activity. Communication patterns suggest she may be minimizing symptom severity and details of associated features such as radiation, sweating, or nausea, which are not explicitly reported but could be significant. The clinical picture indicates possible exertional angina with progressive symptom burden, warranting thorough investigation into ischemic heart disease and associated risk factors.1. Diagnosis: Stable Angina Pectoris Justification: The features of exertional chest heaviness worsening over weeks, along with associated fatigue and dyspnea, strongly suggest myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery disease, which is common in adults and is a leading cause of chest symptoms matching this presentation. 2. Diagnosis: Unstable Angina Justification: Progressive symptoms over weeks may indicate increasing ischemia, placing her at risk for unstable angina, especially if symptoms become more frequent or severe. 3. Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease (Atherosclerosis) Justification: Underlying cause of angina; common in adults with risk factors; chest heaviness with exertion supports this. 4. Diagnosis: Heart Failure (with preserved or reduced ejection fraction) Justification: Increased fatigue and dyspnea could be early signs of cardiac decompensation; exertional symptoms fit this pattern. 5. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Justification: Chest discomfort can often mimic cardiac pain; however, the exertional nature and progression favor cardiac causes but cannot be excluded. 6. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain Justification: Can produce heaviness and discomfort, especially with activity; less likely here given associated systemic symptoms. 7. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Justification: Symptoms include exertional dyspnea and fatigue; risk factors or other signs are not specified but is a pertinent consideration. 8. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: Can cause chest discomfort and dyspnea; however, the episodic worsening with exertion suggests organic cardiac cause. 9. Diagnosis: Pericarditis Justification: Chest heaviness can occur, but typically is positional or pleuritic, not reliably exertional. 10. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Usually presents with sudden severe chest pain and possibly radiating, less consistent with gradual onset and exertion-related worsening; red flag but less likely here.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Linda's language is mostly vague and neutral (\"kind of\", \"a little\"), which sidesteps expressing the true severity. She avoids emotionally charged words when describing her discomfort, which may mask the full extent of her symptoms. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming but seems reluctant to elaborate beyond what she perceives as necessary, suggesting some withholding of deeper concerns or fears. - Response style: Her responses are concise and to the point, possibly to avoid drawing more attention to her symptoms or to maintain emotional control. She avoids detailed descriptions unless explicitly asked.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The brevity and vagueness in her descriptions, such as not explicitly stating how severe the chest pain is at its worst or how much her activity has changed, indicate potential withholding of deeper concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Linda describes her symptoms as \"kind of\" or \"like\" a heavy weight, which downplays their true impact. Her statement that she \"just tries to rest more\" when symptoms worsen suggests she may be minimizing the need for urgent care. - Amplification patterns: She does not seem to exaggerate her symptoms; rather, she may understate them. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No strong signs of embarrassment; her tone is open, though perhaps slightly guarded. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of confusion; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Her mention of her father's heart disease and her own worries may influence her heightened concern, but she does not seem overly influenced by family narratives in her current responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main issue appears to be symptom minimization, as evidenced by her vague language and reluctance to fully detail the severity. - Severity: Moderate, because while she provides some information, her tendency to downplay may obscure the true seriousness of her condition and delay urgent care. - Areas most affected: Her descriptions of chest pain and functional impairment are most biased; she might be underrating how serious her symptoms are. - Reliability: Moderately reliable but with caution\u2014her self-reports likely underestimate the severity, so clinical suspicion should be maintained.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true intensity and impact of her chest pain and associated symptoms, especially how much her activity limitations are affecting her daily life. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of her chest discomfort, dizziness, and shortness of breath might be worse than she reports, given her tendency to be stoic. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry level is high, which may be accurate or slightly exaggerated due to anxiety, but her actual physical condition might be more severe than perceived. - True timeline: Her described progression seems plausible but her brief responses suggest she might be underreporting early warning signs or the impact on her daily functioning.  Overall, her communication exhibits signs of symptom minimization and guarded reporting, which clinicians should interpret carefully to avoid underestimating her risk level.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Infectious conjunctivitis Justification: The rapid onset of redness, swelling, and tearing following physical activity is characteristic. Viral conjunctivitis commonly presents acutely with bilateral redness, tearing, and discomfort, often following exposure or contagious spread, which could occur after team sports. Bacterial conjunctivitis can also cause similar symptoms with purulent discharge; the timing and presentation support this as a leading possibility.  2. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis or corneal abrasion Justification: Playing soccer involves potential ocular trauma, leading to injury of conjunctiva or cornea. Swelling and redness can result from trauma, and tearing is a common protective response. The recent onset post-activity strongly suggests trauma, especially if the patient experienced an eye hit or foreign body entry.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Though less likely given the acute onset after play, allergic conjunctivitis typically causes redness, tearing, and swelling. Its recurrence or seasonal pattern could support this, but the lack of prior history and relation to physical activity makes it lower on probability.  4. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: While presenting with eye swelling and redness, cellulitis usually involves more prominent swelling, warmth, and possible systemic signs like fever; the suspicion is lower unless additional systemic symptoms emerge. The recent activity and localized signs favor conjunctivitis or trauma rather than cellulitis.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Orbital cellulitis can cause swelling, erythema, and tearing, but is usually associated with more severe pain, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and systemic illness; less consistent with the described presentation without other signs. This diagnosis is less probable but remains a consideration if symptoms worsen or additional signs develop.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague, mild language (\"kind of,\" \"just\"), avoiding detailed descriptions that might indicate severity. Her tone is cautious and reserved, likely to maintain a stoic front. - Information flow: Responses are concise and structured but deliberately restrained. She offers basic info without elaboration, perhaps to avoid sounding alarmist. - Response style: She responds directly but minimizes her symptoms, showing a tendency toward understatement and reluctance to portray her condition as more serious.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of withholding is present in her vague descriptions and avoidance of emphasizing pain or limitation; she seems to be downplaying the impact. - Minimization behaviors: She frequently uses softening phrases like \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" and \"just,\" which reduce perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: While her worry is evident, she does not exaggerate symptoms beyond describing discomfort, signaling controlled concern rather than panic. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her stoic tone hints at a possible desire to appear resilient. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Her mention of her father\u2019s heart disease and worries about her own health hints at external influence shaping her perceived seriousness, though she handles responses independently.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Minimization and stoic response bias**. Her language and response style suggest a conscious or unconscious tendency to downplay symptoms. - Severity: **Moderate**, since her underreporting could mask critical signs and lead to underestimation of disease severity. - Areas most affected: The perceived severity and persistence of symptoms; she minimizes the impact on her daily life. - Reliability: Cautious. Her responses are honest but biased towards underplaying, so clinical assessment should probe further.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity and frequency of her symptoms, especially any episodes of more intense chest pain or significant dizziness. - Symptoms probably minimized: The seriousness of her chest discomfort, potential for critical ischemic episodes or arrhythmias. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about her heart indicates real concern but may be amplified by underlying anxiety, possibly magnifying perceived risk. - True timeline: Symptoms may have been worsening more rapidly than reported, considering her tendency to understate discomfort and impact.",

    "input": "The patient is experiencing intermittent episodes of chest heaviness described as a heavy weight or tightness, primarily triggered by physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs, with reported worsening over several weeks. Accompanying sensations include dizziness and sweating, though these may be underreported or minimized. The patient reports that symptoms are moderate and manageable, not severely limiting activity, but communication biases suggest the actual severity, frequency, and presence of episodes at rest or with more intensity could be greater. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to assess the full extent of symptoms and potential risks.1. Diagnosis: Stable Angina Pectoris Justification: The chest heaviness triggered by physical activity such as walking and climbing stairs, with gradual worsening over weeks, strongly suggests exertional angina due to myocardial ischemia. The associated symptoms of dizziness and sweating support ischemic chest pain, especially since symptoms occur with exertion and are manageable, aligning with stable angina characteristics.  2. Diagnosis: Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease Justification: Underlying cause of stable angina, most commonly due to progressive obstructive plaque formation in coronary arteries. The pattern of exertional symptoms and progression over time fits this diagnosis, which explains the clinical presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Unstable Angina Justification: While symptoms are exertional and manageable, slight potential for escalation exists, especially with worsening over weeks. Absence of symptoms at rest does not exclude unstable angina, but current data favor stable angina; still, it remains high priority to monitor.  4. Diagnosis: Microvascular Angina (Cardiac Syndrome X) Justification: If coronary arteries are angiographically normal but symptoms persist, microvascular dysfunction could cause exertional chest discomfort. However, without further testing data, this remains a differential.  5. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain Justification: Less likely but possible; exertional musculoskeletal pain could mimic angina but less commonly triggers with specific exertion like climbing stairs and is not typically associated with systemic symptoms like sweating and dizziness. Still included due to symptom overlap and the need for differential exclusion.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: They tend to use vague, mild descriptors such as \"kind of,\" \"just,\" and \"a little,\" which minimize the perceived severity. Emotional words are present but tempered, like \"scary\" and \"uncomfortable,\" indicating some anxiety but not outright panic. For example, \"It mostly happens when I\u2019m walking around or climbing stairs, and it feels like a heavy weight\" shows descriptive but cautious language. - Information flow: Responses are organized but concise, providing only what is asked, which suggests reluctance to disclose more detailed concerns unless prompted. They seem to withhold deeper fears or perceptions. - Response style: They prefer minimal elaboration, sticking to core symptoms, and avoid emphasizing seriousness unless directly asked. The responses are consistent but filtered.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of qualifiers like \"kind of,\" \"sort of,\" and \"I don\u2019t really know\" point to possible reluctance to fully disclose perceived severity or fears. - Minimization behaviors: Repeatedly downplaying symptoms' strength and impact (\"not that bad,\" \"doesn\u2019t really stop me,\" \"kind of scary\" in a subdued way) suggest they might be underestimating or underreporting the seriousness. - Amplification patterns: They do acknowledge worry and fear (\"it\u2019s kind of scary,\" \"I\u2019m worried\"), but they seem to modulate emotional expression possibly to appear less anxious, so actual concern could be higher. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the cautious language may reflect an unconscious desire not to seem overly alarmist. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence thereof; their timeline is coherent. - Family influence: Not overtly indicated, but their restraint might be influenced by wanting to appear composed in front of family or others.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Minimization bias, as they consciously or unconsciously downplay their symptoms' severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014because they acknowledge and describe symptoms but with cautious language that conceals the true extent. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity perception, especially regarding chest heaviness and associated risks, with some potential underreporting of urgency. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014descriptions are consistent but likely conservative, so actual symptom burden may be higher.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true intensity and frequency of chest pain, dizziness, and palpitations, as they minimize these. They may also be reluctant to disclose any worsening or emergency-level symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of chest heaviness and risks associated with their cardiac history could be greater than reported. - Concerns probably amplified: Their expressed worries suggest genuine concern, but their subdued language indicates they are trying not to alarm themselves or others excessively. - True timeline: Possibly more rapid worsening of symptoms than they admit, given the gradual but escalating description provided, supporting a need for cautious interpretation.  Overall, the patient exhibits moderate minimization bias, which may lead to underestimating symptom severity in a clinical setting.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to clarify the severity, frequency, and presence of symptoms at rest to evaluate for more serious conditions like unstable angina. - Since the patient tends to minimize symptoms, I should carefully and specifically explore the intensity and any recent changes, including episodes that might occur at rest or with minimal exertion. - Understanding triggers and what makes symptoms better or worse will help differentiate between stable and unstable angina or other cardiac or non-cardiac causes. - Incorporating questions about how often and how severe symptoms are, as well as any recent worsening, will guide risk assessment and management plans.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused questions targeting symptom severity, duration, and triggers, especially without prompting for disclosure, to counteract minimization bias. - Address potential episodes at rest or with minimal exertion, looking for signs of escalation suggesting unstable angina. - Phrase questions gently but specifically to encourage honest disclosure, considering their cautious communication style. - The goal is to delineate if symptoms have escalated recently or occur under less exertional circumstances, indicating higher risk.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your chest heaviness is usually triggered by activity like walking or climbing stairs, but have you noticed if this heaviness ever happens when you're resting or doing nothing particular? Also, has the heaviness felt more intense or lasted longer than before? Are there any times, even during rest, when you experience dizziness, sweating, or any other symptoms that concern you?

They may also be reluctant to disclose any worsening or emergency-level symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual severity of chest heaviness and risks associated with their cardiac history could be greater than reported. - Concerns probably amplified: Their expressed worries suggest genuine concern, but their subdued language indicates they are trying not to alarm themselves or others excessively. - True timeline: Possibly more rapid worsening of symptoms than they admit, given the gradual but escalating description provided, supporting a need for cautious interpretation.  Overall, the patient exhibits moderate minimization bias, which may lead to underestimating symptom severity in a clinical setting.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with reports of intermittent chest heaviness described as a heavy weight or tightness, mainly occurring during physical activities such as walking or climbing stairs, with reported gradual worsening over several weeks. She also reports episodes of dizziness and sweating, though these symptoms may be underreported or minimized, particularly at rest. Communication patterns suggest she emphasizes manageable, activity-related symptoms while possibly underestimating the frequency, severity, and occurrence of symptoms during rest. The clinical picture warrants further assessment to evaluate for persistent or more severe symptoms, especially at rest, to rule out underlying cardiac or vascular pathology.Stable angina pectoris ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use vague and hedging phrases (\"kind of,\" \"I think,\" \"mostly\") that soften the description of her symptoms, indicating possible minimization. She also expresses emotions explicitly (\"scary,\" \"worried\"), which reveals underlying anxiety. - Information flow: She provides straightforward answers but holds back details about symptoms at rest, showing some reluctance to fully disclose severity. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded. - Response style: She is concise and cooperative, elaborating mainly when describing feelings, but tends to avoid emphasizing the worst aspects, contributing to an underreporting bias.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She admits to dizziness and symptoms at rest but emphasizes activity-related symptoms more, potentially underreporting resting issues. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the severity of her chest discomfort and dizziness, portraying her symptoms as manageable and not too alarming. - Amplification patterns: Her expressions of fear (\"scary,\" \"really tired\") suggest concern, but she balances this with minimization. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slightly evident through her cautious wording, possibly a desire to avoid seeming overly fragile or alarmed. - Confusion/memory issues: Minor variances in symptom timing; responses are consistent but include qualifiers pointing to uncertainty. - Family influence: No clear indication of family influencing responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization, as she tends to downplay symptoms at rest or to avoid alarming the clinician. - Severity: Moderate due to her willingness to disclose main symptoms yet softening their impact. - Areas most affected: Resting symptoms and the perceived severity of dizziness; she minimizes the potential danger these pose. - Reliability: Moderate; her expressions of genuine concern mixed with hedging suggest she is truthful but cautious, possibly underreporting some symptoms' severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent and timing of symptoms at rest, details on dizziness and chest heaviness during inactivity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Resting chest heaviness and dizziness, which may be more significant than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety about her health and the scary nature of her symptoms, possibly leading to overreaction or fear disproportionate to the actual risk. - True timeline: Symptom progression appears consistent, but her tendency to minimize may obscure the urgency or severity of her condition.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The patient has described chest heaviness predominantly during activity but has only briefly mentioned symptoms at rest (dizziness, sweating), with indications she may be underreporting or downplaying their severity. Clarifying whether she experiences serious symptoms like chest pain, or worsening at rest, is crucial. - Diagnostic priorities: To confirm or exclude unstable angina or other ischemic cardiac conditions, it\u2019s important to investigate the presence and characteristics of resting symptoms, associated features like dizziness and sweating, and whether her symptoms have changed recently in severity or frequency. - Patient factors: She uses vague language to describe symptoms and shows signs of minimization but also expresses concern and anxiety. Approach questions gently but focus on specifics to elicit accurate details. - Interview phase goals: Finalize understanding of her symptoms\u2019 pattern, especially at rest, confirm symptom severity, and gauge her awareness and concerns about potential cardiac issues, to guide shared decision-making.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions about symptoms at rest, with some confirmatory queries for key features. - Information target: Symptom intensity, timing, triggers, and whether these symptoms have become more frequent or severe over time. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, empathetic language to encourage honest disclosure about potentially sensitive or alarming symptoms, framing questions to validate her concerns. - Expected value: Clarify whether her symptoms meet criteria for unstable angina or suggest more urgent pathology, informing the risk assessment and management plan.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've described so far, it sounds like your chest heaviness mainly happens when you're active, but I want to make sure we're not missing anything important. Have you noticed if this heavy feeling, or any dizziness or sweating, ever occurs when you're resting or just sitting quietly? And, if it has happened, has it been more intense, lasted longer, or occurred more often recently, even when you haven't been active?\"",
