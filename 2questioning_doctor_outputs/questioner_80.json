Diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)\nJustification: The episodes are triggered specifically by head movements, such as turning or lying down, with brief duration (<1 minute), which are hallmark features of BPPV. The positional nature and increasing frequency support this diagnosis. No neurological deficits or auditory symptoms suggest peripheral origin.\n2. Diagnosis: Vestibular Migraine\nJustification: The episodes are brief and positional, with associated nausea, which can overlap with vertiginous migraines. Though the patient has no current headache, vestibular migraine can present with isolated dizziness and episodic vertigo. The recent increase in frequency supports episodic vestibular dysfunction, making this plausible.\n3. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension (or Postural Hypotension)\nJustification: Dizziness during positional changes (lying to sitting/standing) could suggest orthostatic hypotension. Though episodes are also triggered by lying down and rolling over, the brief and positional nature, coupled with increasing frequency, could still fit, especially if blood pressure drops with movement. Additional data like blood pressure readings needed for confirmation.\n4. Diagnosis: Inner Ear Infection (Labyrinthitis or Vestibulitis)\nJustification: Vestibular dysfunction from infection can cause episodic dizziness, sometimes with nausea, lasting days or longer, but typically involves ongoing imbalance rather than brief, positional spells. Nonetheless, intra-ear inflammation remains a differential, especially if episodes are triggered by head movement due to labyrinthine inflammation.\n5. Diagnosis: Central causes (e.g., vertebrobasilar insufficiency or cerebellar pathology)\nJustification: Less likely given the pattern\u2014short, positional episodes without neurological deficits. But geometry of symptoms could overlap if episodes are due to transient ischemia affecting the posterior circulation, though less probable without other neurological signs.
