    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Common cause of redness, tearing, and swelling; likely viral given recent activity and quick onset; highly prevalent in young, active populations.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Symptoms include redness, tearing, and swelling; occurs in active individuals exposed to environmental allergens, although less specific without allergy history.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma from playing soccer could cause superficial corneal injury; presenting with redness, tearing, possible foreign body sensation.  4. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Inflammation of eyelid margins causing swelling and redness; can be precipitated or worsened by environmental exposure during activity.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Recent activity does not exclude this; presents with redness, swelling, possible proptosis, and pain; more likely if systemic signs develop.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Anterior segment inflammation causing redness and tearing; less likely given brief symptom duration and activity-related onset without systemic symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Traumatic event during sports may introduce debris or a foreign object, causing local inflammation and tearing.  8. Diagnosis: Chalazion or Hordeolum Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness may suggest a localized eyelid abscess or lipogranuloma; less likely as primary cause but possible.  9. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness limited to eyelid tissues without systemic signs; occurs after minor trauma or local infection.  10. Diagnosis: Uveitis (iritis) Justification: Intraocular inflammation presenting with redness and tearing; less common in this context without other intraocular symptoms.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Sofia uses descriptive but somewhat emotional and anxious language, emphasizing worst-case scenarios (\"something serious,\" \"could be something with my blood\"). Her responses are detailed when describing symptoms, indicating openness but also worry. - Information flow: she is forthcoming voluntarily with her main complaints and concerns, consistently elaborating on her symptoms and fears without much prompting. - Response style: her replies are elaborate and emotional, and her nervous behaviors (fidgeting, touching her chest) reinforce her anxious state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: no clear evidence\u2014she appears to share her concerns openly. - Minimization behaviors: she does not minimize her symptoms; instead, she portrays them as significantly impairing, though her concern about severity seems somewhat exaggerated. - Amplification patterns: evident in her focus on dangerous illnesses and her worry about serious health consequences, indicating catastrophic thinking. - Embarrassment/shame signals: none apparent; she seems willing to discuss her symptoms and diet. - Confusion/memory issues: no evident inconsistencies or confusion. - Family influence: not explicitly observed but her concern about serious illnesses may be influenced by familial or media messages about health risks.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: anxiety amplification, specifically catastrophic thinking about her health. - Severity: moderate\u2014this bias influences her interpretation of symptoms significantly but doesn\u2019t distort her report entirely. - Areas most affected: her perception of illness severity and the interpretation of normal fatigue and dizziness. - Reliability: relatively reliable in describing physical symptoms, but her emotional overlay suggests her concern exceeds the actual clinical danger.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: her underlying anxiety or stress levels, which may intensify her health worries beyond the physical symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: her fatigue may be more impactful than she perceives, but she emphasizes her tiredness and dizziness clearly. - Concerns probably amplified: her fears of serious disease are disproportionate; her anxiety might lead her to overinterpret minor symptoms. - True timeline: symptoms have been gradual; her reported progression is consistent, but her emotional state may exaggerate their significance.  Overall, her communication shows openness but is colored by anxiety-driven amplification, which requires addressing both physical and psychological aspects for effective management.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Considering her detailed descriptions and emotional tone, I need to gently explore her understanding of her symptoms and how they affect her daily life. - To build rapport, I should encourage her to share her perspective and concerns without leading or minimizing her feelings. - Given her anxiety, I want to explore whether her worries are specific to her eye symptoms or part of a broader health concern, which may reveal underlying stress or health anxiety. - An open-ended question will help her elaborate and provide insight into her personal experience, which is invaluable at this stage. - This will help clarify her chief concern and how she perceives her illness, supporting both diagnosis and rapport.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Open-ended question to encourage elaboration. - Target: Her understanding and emotional response to her eye symptoms, their impact, and her worries. - Approach: Sensitive, non-judgmental phrasing that invites her to describe her experience in her own words. - Value: Will shed light on her emotional state and health beliefs, guiding subsequent questions and management.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how these eye symptoms are affecting you and what concerns you have about what might be happening?\"",

    "input": "A 16-year-old female presents with subjective reports of fatigue, dizziness upon standing, concentration difficulties, shortness of breath, and episodic blurry vision with visual flashes. These symptoms have been ongoing, with no acute clinical findings noted during examination. Her fears of serious illnesses such as tumors or neurological conditions appear to be influenced by anxiety, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity. Further objective assessment, including physical examination and diagnostic testing, is needed to clarify the physical findings and underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension Justification: Dizziness upon standing and fatigue suggest possible orthostatic hypotension, common in adolescents due to dehydration or autonomic dysregulation.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: The patient's fears and perception of symptoms being influenced by anxiety point toward a psychological component contributing to her symptom experience.  3. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath are characteristic symptoms that could be caused by anemia, which is common in adolescents due to nutritional deficiencies.  4. Diagnosis: Vestibular dysfunction Justification: Episodic blurry vision with visual flashes and dizziness could involve inner ear or vestibular system disturbances, affecting balance and visual stability.  5. Diagnosis: Migraine Justification: Visual flashes are common in migraines; episodic visual disturbances and dizziness are typical neurological symptoms associated with migraine episodes.  6. Diagnosis: Dehydration Justification: Fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath may be exacerbated by dehydration, which can impair blood volume and circulation.  7. Diagnosis: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Justification: Symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, and visual disturbances are characteristic of POTS, more common in young females, often worsened upon standing.  8. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia Justification: Fatigue, dizziness, and visual disturbances can result from low blood sugar levels, especially if recent dietary intake is inadequate.  9. Diagnosis: Neurological tumor (e.g., brain tumor) Justification: Episodic visual flashes and dizziness could be signs of intracranial pathology, though the lack of focal findings on examination makes this less likely initially.  10. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Justification: Visual flashes and neurological symptoms might suggest demyelinating disease; however, age and lack of other neurological findings make MS less probable at this stage.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses vague qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"just\") suggesting minimization; expresses strong emotion (\"nervous,\" \"scared\") indicating anxiety amplification. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming regarding primary complaints but possibly withholding detailed context unless specifically prompted; responses are organized but emotionally charged. - Response style: Elaborative with emotional qualifiers; tends to emphasize fears and worst-case scenarios, especially when discussing potential serious diagnoses.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight hesitancy in elaborating on detailed history, possible reluctance to fully disclose emotional distress or familial influences. - Minimization behaviors: Frequent use of \"just\" and \"kind of,\" indicating downplaying her symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Emphasis on fears about brain tumors or neoplasms; overstatement of symptom impact (e.g., \"making me really nervous\"). - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous tone, fidgeting, seeking reassurance show discomfort with her health vulnerabilities. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence. - Family influence: Not explicitly present but her concern about \"something serious\" suggests external information shaping her fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification combined with some minimization\u2014she is overemphasizing her fears in certain areas, yet slightly downplaying some symptoms' severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional responses influence her communication; she seems aware but overwhelmed by fears. - Areas most affected: Her perceived severity of eye symptoms and health risks\u2014these are exaggerated relative to her actual complaints. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her report contains valid concerns but is colored by anxiety, which may distort her perception of severity and her overall health status.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full emotional background, detailed medical history beyond current symptoms, actual diet and lifestyle specifics, and contextual factors influencing her fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her overall health behavior and possibly her actual nutritional intake. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about serious disease, notably tumors or neoplastic causes, which might be overestimated. - True timeline: Symptoms likely developed gradually; her anxiety may have magnified their personal significance but the progression appears plausible.  In summary, Sofia's communication shows a pattern of anxiety-driven amplification of fears coupled with slight minimization of her actual health behaviors, notably dietary habits. Her responses are organized but emotionally charged, indicating that her fears significantly influence her perception and reporting of symptoms.",

    "input": "A 16-year-old female presents with a history of persistent fatigue, orthostatic dizziness, concentration difficulties, shortness of breath during exertion, and episodic blurry vision with flashes. These symptoms have been ongoing with no acute clinical findings noted at examination. Her concern about serious illness, such as tumors, appears to be influenced by anxiety, which may lead to overestimation of symptom severity. Physical symptoms likely include moderate to severe fatigue and orthostatic dizziness, with visual disturbances and concentration problems that may be more prominent than reported due to anxiety. Further objective assessment including vital signs, physical exam, and laboratory testing are necessary to elucidate underlying causes. Evaluation of emotional health is indicated to address anxiety's impact on symptom perception.1. Diagnosis: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Justification: The patient's orthostatic dizziness and exertional symptoms strongly suggest orthostatic intolerance, which is characteristic of POTS. POTS commonly affects adolescents and young females, presenting with symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and concentration problems. Flashes of vision might relate to cerebral hypoperfusion upon position changes, aligning with autonomic dysfunction. Her symptom pattern is typical for POTS, especially considering her age and the context of these autonomic features.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder or Somatic Symptom Disorder Justification: The patient's concern about serious illness and the emphasis on anxiety influencing symptom perception suggest a significant psychiatric overlay. Anxiety can amplify symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and visual disturbances. Even if physiological causes are present, anxiety plays a role in symptom severity and reporting. This is ranked high because of her self-reported concern and the potential for psychosomatic contributions.  3. Diagnosis: Iron-Deficiency Anemia Justification: Fatigue, exertional shortness of breath, and dizziness are common features of anemia, which is prevalent in adolescents, especially females due to menstrual losses. Although not directly confirmed by lab data, anemia remains a plausible contributing factor to her fatigue and orthostatic symptoms and should be evaluated promptly.  4. Diagnosis: Vestibulo-ocular or Visual Pathway Disorder Justification: Episodic blurry vision with flashes raises concern for neuro-ophthalmic conditions, such as migraines or ocular vascular issues. Although less common in this age without other migraine symptoms, it remains in the differential, especially considering visual disturbances that may be related to transient neurovascular phenomena.  5. Diagnosis: Dehydration or Electrolyte Imbalance Justification: Fatigue, orthostatic dizziness, and exertional symptoms could result from dehydration, common in adolescents due to poor fluid intake or excessive activity. While not highlighted explicitly, it remains a less specific but relevant consideration that could exacerbate autonomic or hematologic issues.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Sofia uses vague, non-specific descriptions (\"kind of blurry,\" \"little flashes\") combined with emotionally charged language (\"really nervous,\" \"making me really nervous\"). Her tone indicates distress but avoids clinical precision, which may reflect discomfort or avoidance of detailed disclosure. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer her major symptoms readily but hesitates or shows nervousness about discussing details like her emotional state or family history, suggesting some reluctance or withholding. Her responses are organized around her core concerns but include emotional elaboration that seems driven by anxiety. - Response style: Her explanations are somewhat scattered with emotional overtones, explaining her fears and symptoms in relation to her feelings of nervousness and concern, rather than a neutral or purely clinical report.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Subtle signs of hesitance when discussing deeper emotional aspects or family history, possibly indicating reluctance to fully disclose or discomfort with certain topics. - Minimization behaviors: She appears to downplay the severity by describing symptoms as \"kind of blurry\" or \"little flashes,\" which may be less alarming than actual clinical signs, perhaps to avoid further worry or because she perceives her symptoms as less serious. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes how \"really nervous\" she feels, how her symptoms \"make it hard\" for her, and fears of a tumor or cancer, thereby magnifying her emotional distress and perceived danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight nervousness and hesitation point to possible embarrassment or shame about her emotional fears and physical symptoms, leading to a more anxious presentation. - Confusion/memory issues: No obvious signs of inconsistency, but her vague descriptions may reflect discomfort in recalling or articulating precise details. - Family influence: Not directly observed, but her expressed concern about serious illness may be driven by family or media influences, which could bolster her catastrophizing.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification with tendencies to catastrophize symptoms, likely driven by health anxiety and emotional distress. - Severity: Moderate to severe. Her anxious language and behavioral signs significantly influence her report, possibly exaggerating perceived severity and underreporting some aspects of her physical state. - Areas most affected: Emotional components and perceived severity of symptoms (e.g., eye symptoms, dizziness), with some slight minimization of the physical intensity or scope of symptoms. - Reliability: Self-reporting is likely affected by heightened anxiety; she may overstate fears while underplaying more benign aspects. Her emotional state influences the perception and communication of her physical symptoms.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Specific details about the chronology and intensity of her eye symptoms, actual visual testing, or neurological examination findings. Her reluctance or vague descriptions suggest she may not be fully honest or clear about all experiences. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical discomfort might be more severe than described; she may be shielding her anxiety or not fully acknowledging symptoms she fears are too serious. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of severe illness (tumor, cancer) is magnified, influenced by her emotional distress; her fixation on worst-case scenarios affects her perception. - True timeline: Symptoms have likely been gradually worsening over weeks, but her emotional overlay might distort her perceived immediacy or severity, inflating her concern about rapid deterioration or danger.",

We also want to understand any neurological or migraine symptoms, and how her anxiety influences her experience. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating whether her visual disturbances are related to migraines, transient ischemic events, or somatic anxiety responses is key. Clarifying her orthostatic symptoms and fatigue further guides consideration of POTS versus other causes. - Patient factors: Sofia's vague yet emotionally charged descriptions suggest she may withhold details or minimize symptoms. Our questions should gently probe for specifics without making her feel judged or scrutinized, encouraging openness. - Interview phase goals: Narrow down symptom characteristics, distinguish between potential neurological, autonomic, or psychiatric origins, and explore her understanding and concern levels.

    "input": "A 16-year-old female presents with reports of ongoing fatigue, episodic dizziness especially upon standing, brief visual disturbances including flashes and blurriness, and difficulty concentrating. The visual symptoms are described as sudden and fleeting, often accompanied by feelings of numbness or weakness and headache. She expresses concern over serious neurological conditions, although her reports are influenced by anxiety, which may exaggerate the perceived severity of her symptoms. Physical examination and further testing are necessary to determine the underlying cause, but her symptoms are consistent with autonomic or psychosomatic contributions, with objective signs likely to be less severe than her subjective experience suggests.1. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension Justification: The episodes of dizziness upon standing directly suggest orthostatic hypotension, especially in a young person experiencing fatigue and possibly volume depletion or autonomic instability. Her lightheadedness and brief visual disturbances can be explained by decreased cerebral perfusion related to sudden posture change, aligning with autonomic dysregulation.  2. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura Justification: Brief visual disturbances like flashes and blurriness, along with headache, strongly suggest migraine with aura. The episodic nature and subjective visual symptoms support this, especially since migraines can cause aura phenomena and associated neurological symptoms. Anxiety may exacerbate symptom perception but does not negate the typical migraine pattern.  3. Diagnosis: Psychosomatic Disorder / Anxiety-Related Symptoms Justification: Her concern about neurological conditions, combined with anxiety, likely amplifies her perception of symptoms. Anxiety can produce somatic complaints such as dizziness, fatigue, and visual disturbances, and her symptoms may be partly psychosomatic or exaggerated by psychological factors.  4. Diagnosis: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) Justification: While BPPV typically causes vertigo with positional changes, her episodic dizziness and visual disturbances could relate, but this diagnosis is less favored given the absence of specific vertigo triggers or duration, making it a lower probability compared to other causes.  5. Diagnosis: Dehydration or Sleep Deprivation-Induced Symptoms Justification: Fatigue and dizziness could relate to dehydration or inadequate sleep, common in adolescents, possibly contributing to autonomic symptoms. Though less specific, these are important considerations, especially if lifestyle factors are involved.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs emotional and somewhat vague language, saying \"really scary,\" \"kind of sudden,\" and \"don\u2019t know,\" which reveals distress but also a lack of precise description. The words \"really\" and \"scary\" show emotional amplification, potentially heightening perceived severity. - Information flow: She offers initial details about her visual symptoms, but her explanations are somewhat inconsistent and rely heavily on subjective feelings. She waits for questions but responds openly, indicating a willingness to share but also emotional vulnerability. - Response style: Her answers tend to be elaborative when discussing fears, but more vague concerning specific symptom timelines, possibly reflecting anxiety-driven over-interpretation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is limited evidence of intentional withholding; however, she exhibits vagueness in describing symptom specifics, perhaps to avoid discomfort, which may obscure accurate assessment. - Minimization behaviors: She does not appear to downplay her symptoms significantly; instead, she seems to focus on magnifying her fears rather than minimizing. - Amplification patterns: She explicitly describes her visual disturbances as \"really scary\" and \"unsettling,\" and emphasizes her fears of serious illness like tumors or cancer, indicating emotional overreaction. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal signs; her openness suggests comfort in discussing symptoms, though her nervous tone hints at underlying anxiety. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion or memory lapses; responses are consistent but tinged with emotional distortion. - Family influence: Not directly observable, but her intense fears may be influenced by family or external sources (e.g., internet info about diseases), although not explicitly stated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification bias, as she emphasizes fears of severe illness and describes symptoms with emotional exaggeration, possibly to seek reassurance or due to genuine anxiety. - Severity: Moderate. The clear presence of distress and exaggeration impacts the reliability of her self-reporting, especially regarding symptom severity and urgency. - Areas most affected: Visual symptoms and concerns about seriousness; these are described with high emotional charge, risking overestimation of danger. - Reliability: Moderate; while she reports real sensations, her emotional bias skews perception, so clinical judgment should consider underlying anxiety influencing symptom reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully able to distinguish between actual severity and anxiety-related perceptions. She might minimize others aspects (e.g., duration or triggers) or avoid discussing specifics that increase her anxiety. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs that contradict her fears, such as non-specific nature of visual disturbances, could be under-communicated or misinterpreted. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of tumors or serious neurological issues are heightened, potentially overestimating threat due to anxiety. - True timeline: The reported sudden onset and distress align with actual symptoms but are emotionally colored; physical symptoms like flashes or numbness could be less alarming upon detailed investigation.",

    "input": "A 16-year-old female presents with episodic dizziness, brief visual disturbances including flashes and blurriness, and fatigue. The dizziness and visual symptoms occur suddenly, lasting only a few seconds, and are often triggered by rapid head movements. She also reports headaches and sensations of numbness or weakness during episodes but denies difficulty speaking or more persistent neurological deficits. Her concerns about serious illness are influenced by anxiety, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity. Objective clinical assessment and testing are necessary to evaluate for benign causes such as orthostatic issues or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, while also considering psychosomatic contributions related to anxiety.Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She mixes specific symptom descriptions with vague and emotional language, such as \"really scary\" and \"kind of sudden,\" indicating emotional distress intertwined with uncertainty. - Information flow: She shares detailed symptom narratives proactively, yet her descriptions are heavily influenced by her fears and emotional responses, which sometimes overshadows factual clarity. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate and emotionally loaded, often amplified by anxiety, with a tendency to emphasize worst-case scenarios.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear withholding, but her reliance on vague and exaggerated descriptions suggests she might be concealing her true level of concern or focusing on worst fears. - Minimization behaviors: She appears to downplay the duration and perhaps severity (\"last a few seconds\") while simultaneously emphasizing their frightening nature, indicating an internal conflict. - Amplification patterns: She amplifies the severity of her symptoms and potential diagnoses, possibly to seek reassurance or due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signs of discomfort or shame about her health status, evident in her nervous tone and seeking reassurance. - Confusion/memory issues: Minor inconsistencies in timing and description, likely due to anxiety rather than cognitive impairment. - Family influence: Not directly evident, but her heightened concern about serious conditions suggests possible external influences like media or family fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Anxiety amplification bias, as her responses are heavily colored by fear and emotional distress, shaping her perception of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, because her anxiety influences her narrative and may overstate severity, but her overall consistency allows reasonable clinical interpretation. - Areas most affected: Her presentation of symptom severity and perceived risk of serious pathology are most biased by her anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate, as her emotional state compromises objectivity. Her detailed descriptions are helpful but require cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully convey the true duration, frequency, or functional impact of her symptoms; her focus on severity may overshadow concise reporting. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual duration and possibly the frequency of visual disturbances might be longer or more persistent than described. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of severe, possibly life-threatening conditions is likely inflated; her emotional responses exacerbate perceived threat. - True timeline: The reported gradual worsening aligns with anemia development, but her perception is likely distorted by her emotional state, leading to an overestimation of urgency.  **In sum, Sofia exhibits moderate anxiety amplification, influencing her communication by emphasizing severity and projecting fears into her symptom narrative, which requires careful, empathetic clinical navigation.**",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need to clarify the typical duration and triggers of her visual episodes, particularly whether she notices any patterns related to head movements, anxiety, or other factors. Additionally, confirming whether she experiences any neurological symptoms like numbness or weakness outside of episodes helps differentiate benign vertigo from more serious conditions. - Diagnostic priorities: Exploring the details of the episodes (duration, triggers, associated sensations) will help confirm or refute BPPV and rule out other neurological causes. Understanding her concern level and emotional response will guide readiness for discussing management. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and tendency to elaborate suggest responses may be influenced by anxiety, so questions should be gentle, specific, and aimed at eliciting clear, factual descriptions without increasing her anxiety. - Interview phase goals: To acquire definitive info about her episode characteristics, explore red flags (e.g., weakness, speech difficulty), and assess her emotional state for shared decision-making readiness.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions targeting the specifics of her episodes\u2014timing, triggers, associated symptoms. - Information target: Duration, onset, positional triggers, presence of other neurological symptoms, and emotional context. - Communication approach: Phrase questions simply and empathetically, validating her worries while gently guiding her to precise details. - Expected value: Clarifies the episodic pattern, helps differentiate BPPV from other causes, and prepares for discussiing treatment options confidently.\nANSWER: \"Sofia, thank you for sharing so much detail. To help us understand these episodes better, can you tell me, during the times you experience the flashes or blurry vision, how long do they usually last? Are they just a few seconds, or do they sometimes last longer? Also, when you notice these symptoms, do they tend to happen more when you move your head quickly or when you're feeling very anxious or upset? And, outside of these visual symptoms, do you ever feel numbness, weakness, or have trouble speaking during these episodes?\"",
