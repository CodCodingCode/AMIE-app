    "input": "Patient demographics: adult female (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: recent onset of visual disturbances, primarily floaters, with associated mild visual blurring and ocular soreness, with heightened sensitivity to light. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing dark shadows or floaters and intermittent blurring of vision for approximately ten days. She describes her eye as feeling dull and sore and notes increased light sensitivity. While she emphasizes the worsening nature of these symptoms and her concerns about potential serious outcomes, her emotional distress may lead to overestimation of symptom severity. She denies any reports of flashes of light, sudden visual field loss, or significant eye pain beyond a dull ache. No other systemic symptoms are reported; the history of trauma or previous eye disease has not been disclosed. Additional symptoms such as flashes or sudden field changes have not been confirmed and require further inquiry. Her timeline appears consistent but may be influenced by anxiety. Associated symptoms: No confirmed reports of flashing lights, visual field deficits, severe pain, nausea, or systemic illness; the presence of floaters, mild visual blurring, and eye soreness are established. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The presence of floaters, mild blurring, and ocular soreness for ten days. - Medium confidence: The extent of symptom severity and emotional amplification; her fears and perceived worsening may overstate actual clinical severity. - Low confidence: Specific exacerbating symptoms or additional visual disturbances like flashes or field loss have not been yet confirmed. - Missing information: Details on visual flashes, sudden vision changes, trauma history, prior eye conditions, systemic symptoms, and specific symptom severity scores.1. Diagnosis: Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) Justification: Floaters and mild visual blurring are classic symptoms of PVD, especially in adults over 50, but can present earlier; spontaneous vitreous separation causes floaters, often benign but warrants exclusion of retinal tears.  2. Diagnosis: Retinal Tear or Detachment Justification: Dark shadows or floaters with associated visual disturbances can indicate retinal tears/detachments; urgent to rule out to prevent vision loss, especially if worsening or new symptoms develop.  3. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Intermediate or Anterior) Justification: Ocular soreness and light sensitivity with mild blurring can suggest inflammation; Uveitis often presents with floaters and photophobia, though less common without systemic symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage Justification: Dark floaters and vision disturbance may result from hemorrhage within the vitreous; often associated with trauma or diabetes, but can occur idiopathically.  5. Diagnosis: Inflammatory or Infectious Conditions (e.g., Endophthalmitis) Justification: The mild soreness and visual disturbances could be early signs of intraocular inflammation or infection, though absence of severe pain or systemic symptoms lowers suspicion.  6. Diagnosis: Age-Related Macular Degeneration (Dry) Justification: Mild blurring and floaters can be early signs; more common in older adults, though typically gradual; unlikely to cause sudden floaters.  7. Diagnosis: Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Justification: Visual blurring and light sensitivity may be seen; often affects middle-aged adults, usually unilateral.  8. Diagnosis: Cataract Progression Justification: Visual blurring and light sensitivity are typical; however, floaters are less prominent in cataracts, and onset is usually gradual.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (Primary Open-Angle) Justification: Elevated intraocular pressure can cause visual field changes, but floaters are uncommon; no mention of peripheral field loss yet.  10. Diagnosis: Migraine-associated Visual Disturbances Justification: Visual blurring and floaters can be visual phenomena, but typically episodic and with aura; less likely given symptom duration and nature, but included for completeness.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs specific, emotionally charged language when describing her symptoms, such as \"making me pretty nervous\" and \"really sensitive to light.\" She combines clinical observations (\"floaters,\" \"blurry\") with emotional expressions, indicating a mix of factual reporting and anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering detailed symptoms and background information promptly without much prompting. Her responses are organized, flowing sequentially, which reflects clarity and openness. - Response style: Her elaboration is consistent, thorough, and emotionally expressive. She does not evade questions; instead, she emphasizes her worries to ensure her concerns are understood.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; she shares her history and fears openly. - Minimization behaviors: No clear signs; she emphasizes worsening symptoms and fears, suggesting she does not minimize her condition. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional language (\"making me pretty nervous\") suggests some amplification, possibly influenced by anxiety but supported by her detailed history. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; no signs of discomfort about her symptoms or background. - Confusion/memory issues: Not present; her timeline is clear and consistent. - Family influence: No indication; responses are self-contained.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, characterized by heightened concern and anxiety expressed about her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as her anxiety appears genuine and may influence her perception but does not seem to distort her factual reporting significantly. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and prognosis, particularly her fears about vision loss. - Reliability: High overall; she provides detailed, coherent, and logically ordered information, indicating reliable self-reporting with emotional overlay.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully appreciate the possibility of asymptomatic features of systemic or infectious causes, or may underestimate some subtle signs. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not strongly indicated in her responses; she overemphasizes rather than downplays. - Concerns probably amplified: Her expression of fear about losing vision and anxiety about serious disease may exaggerate actual risk perception. - True timeline: She reports symptom progression accurately; her emotional response may inflate perceived urgency but the timeline itself appears factual.",
    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration phase, I want to deepen understanding of her experience with the symptoms by encouraging elaboration. Given her emotional distress and detailed initial report, exploring her perception and broader context is vital. To do so, an open-ended prompt focusing on her experience and how the symptoms have affected her will help foster trust and gather more nuanced information. This will also help identify any other concerns or details she hasn't yet mentioned.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about how these vision changes have been affecting you day to day, and what it's been like for you during this time.\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a ten-day history of ocular floaters, mild intermittent blurring of vision, and ocular soreness, accompanied by increased light sensitivity. She reports her symptoms as worsening, but her emotional distress may lead to overestimation of severity. There is no confirmed report of flashes of light, sudden vision loss, or systemic symptoms. Examination should include assessment for retinal detachment, inflammation, or other causes of floaters and visual disturbances, with particular attention to signs suggesting more urgent pathology that the patient may not fully communicate. Further targeted inquiry is necessary to confirm the presence of flashes, evaluate for systemic or prior ocular trauma, and determine if her symptom severity is greater than initially described.1. Diagnosis: Posterior Uveitis (Choroiditis or Intermediate Uveitis) Justification: Presence of floaters, ocular soreness, light sensitivity, and mild blurring suggest intraocular inflammation; posterior uveitis is common and can present with these symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage Justification: Floaters and blurred vision are typical; often causes by retinal tears or systemic vascular disease, especially if symptoms persist, although no acute trauma noted.  3. Diagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (early or dry form) Justification: Floaters and mild visual disturbance can occur in early AMD, especially in older adults; light sensitivity may be secondary.  4. Diagnosis: Retinal Break or Tear Justification: Floaters can be a sign of retinal detachment risk; no flashes or vision loss reported currently but warrants consideration due to progression potential.  5. Diagnosis: Choroidal Neovascular Membrane (Associated with AMD) Justification: Can cause floaters and visual disturbance, particularly in older adults, though less likely without more severe visual signs.  6. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Ocular soreness and light sensitivity can occur; however, floaters are less typical, making this less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Cataract-related symptoms Justification: Mild blurring and light sensitivity can be related; though floaters are less prominent, less likely given presentation duration.  8. Diagnosis: Pterygium or Pinguecula Justification: Causes light sensitivity and irritation but not floaters or ocular soreness primarily; lower likelihood.  9. Diagnosis: Corneal or Conjunctival Foreign Body Justification: Can cause soreness and light sensitivity; floaters less typical unless trauma caused intraocular debris.  10. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis Justification: Visual symptoms with soreness, but typically presents with pain on eye movement and central visual loss, not just floaters or light sensitivity; less likely given current features.

Her emotional expressions like \"trying not to freak out\" reflect discomfort and anxiety. Her descriptions blend specific symptoms with emotional qualifiers, indicating a mix of factual reporting and emotional overlay. - Information flow: She readily volunteers her timeline and symptoms early but tones down her reporting with brief background details unless prompted. Her responses are organized but often include emotional commentary that emphasizes her distress, revealing a balance between informational transparency and emotional expression. - Response style: She responds directly to questions but interjects emotional and subjective comments, elaborating on her feelings and their impact, which signals openness but also emotional vulnerability.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding; she generally shares her symptoms openly but may be downplaying how severe they feel initially. - Minimization behaviors: She initially describes her symptoms as \"just floaters\" and \"not that bad,\" implying some minimization, but she quickly reveals worsening issues. - Amplification patterns: Her statements like \"making me pretty nervous\" and \"it\u2019s been hard\" suggest some emotional amplification of her distress, though her direct concern about losing her vision indicates genuine anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance when framing her symptoms (\"just floaters,\" \"trying not to freak out\") could indicate mild embarrassment about her emotional response or perception of severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; her timeline is consistent and detailed. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses; her responses appear internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate symptom minimization combined with emotional amplification bias, primarily driven by anxiety. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she underplays initial symptoms but exhibits significant emotional distress, which could distort her perceived severity. - Areas most affected: Her initial description of severity and impact on daily life may be understated; her emotional state amplifies her perception of danger. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her report is generally honest but filtered through her emotional lens, so clinical interpretation should consider her anxiety\u2019s influence.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: True extent of visual impairment and pain severity could be more profound than described. She may also underreport systemic signs if present. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her initial description suggests less severity; the actual impact on vision and discomfort might be worse. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of losing vision and the degree of distress may be exaggerated by anxiety, possibly inflating her perceived risk. - True timeline: The progression may be faster or more significant than she reports, given her increasing distress and recent worsening.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a ten-day history of floaters, intermittent blurry vision, ocular soreness, and light sensitivity. She reports her symptoms as worsening and expresses concern about the severity; however, her emotional distress may influence her perception and reporting of symptoms. While she denies experiencing flashes of light, sudden vision loss, or systemic symptoms, it is likely she has experienced transient flashes or brief episodes that she has not fully reported. The clinical suspicion includes possible retinal pathology such as a retinal detachment or inflammatory processes, but objective findings require ophthalmologic examination. Further assessment should focus on identifying red flags like flashes, sudden vision loss, or eye trauma, with awareness that her communication biases may lead to underreporting of transient or minor symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Uveitis / Intermediate or posterior uveitis Justification: The patient\u2019s ocular soreness, light sensitivity, floaters, and worsening symptoms over ten days are characteristic of intraocular inflammation. Uveitis commonly presents with floaters, photophobia, and ocular discomfort. No systemic symptoms or vision loss suggest it is localized intraocular inflammation rather than systemic disease. These features too align more with uveitis than other ocular conditions.  2. Diagnosis: Vitreous detachment (Posterior vitreous detachment) Justification: Floaters and intermittent visual changes over a period of days are typical for posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). The absence of flashes or sudden vision loss lessens the likelihood of retinal detachment but PVD remains a common, benign explanation for floaters and can cause intermittent symptoms that worsen with vitreous liquefaction or traction.  3. Diagnosis: Retinal detachment (or tear) Justification: While less likely given the lack of flashes, sudden vision loss, or flashes reported, retinal detachment remains a concern because floaters and visual disturbances can be early signs. The description of floaters warrants consideration, although her symptoms are more gradual and less severe, so current probability is lower but still active differential.  4. Diagnosis: Anterior uveitis (iritis) Justification: Light sensitivity and ocular soreness can be seen in anterior uveitis. However, the presentation with floaters and intermittent blurry vision suggests posterior segment involvement is more prominent; thus, while similar symptoms are possible, it\u2019s less probable than posterior uveitis.  5. Diagnosis: Infectious endophthalmitis Justification: This is considered less likely given the subacute course without systemic infection signs, no trauma, or recent surgery reported, but still a consideration given intraocular inflammation symptoms. It remains lower in probability but included due to its severity and need for prompt diagnosis if suspected.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of specific descriptions (\"dark spots,\" \"blurry,\" \"dull ache\") and somewhat vague or minimizing terms (\"just floaters,\" \"not that bad\"), suggesting an attempt to be truthful but also to not alarm excessively. The emotional language (\"really nervous,\" \"scared\") conveys genuine concern. - Information flow: They primarily volunteer general symptoms but tend to answer directly when asked, showing cooperative but cautious communication. They offer some detail proactively, yet may withhold nuanced symptoms like flashes or systemic feelings unless specifically prompted. - Response style: Responses are mostly straightforward and organized, elaborating when questioned but avoiding extraneous details; their responses are emotionally charged when discussing fears, indicating underlying anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: They do not mention flashes of light, which are common with such visual disturbances; this could be an omission due to forgetfulness, confusion, or an attempt to downplay additional symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptive phrases like \"not that bad\" and \"just floaters\" indicate an effort to diminish perceived severity. They may be downplaying the urgency or seriousness of their condition. - Amplification patterns: Their expressions of fear (\"really nervous,\" \"scared,\" \"worried it might be serious\") suggest they are amplifying their concern about potential blindness, which seems driven by genuine anxiety but may heighten perceived risk. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but their cautious language and focus on worst-case scenarios could reflect underlying unease with their symptoms or uncertainty. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent and logical. - Family influence: No clear evidence of external influence on responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of minimization (downplaying specific symptoms) and amplification (exaggerating fears), perhaps driven by underlying anxiety. - Severity: Moderate; they are somewhat truthful but tend to omit certain details and focus on their fears, affecting accuracy. - Areas most affected: Likely the reporting of specific symptoms such as flashes or systemic signs, which seem underreported. Their fear-driven amplification influences their overall concern. - Reliability: Moderate; while generally cooperative and truthful, their anxiety and tendency to self-censor particular symptoms suggest we should interpret their report with cautious skepticism regarding the full symptom spectrum.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully reporting transient flashes, or systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise) that could be relevant. Their focus on visual details might overshadow other signs of systemic infection or inflammation. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of symptoms like flashes, sudden vision changes, or systemic illness signs might be underreported; they describe their pain as mild and downplay associated symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: The fear of total vision loss is heightened; their anxiety may be inflating the perceived risk of severe damage. - True timeline: The progression likely aligns with their report\u2014symptoms began about ten days ago and worsened\u2014but their emotional state might magnify perceived worsening, making actual progression appear more rapid or severe than it is.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The patient\u2019s current description lacks specific details about any flashes of light, the timing of blurred vision episodes, and the presence of systemic symptoms that could distinguish between different ocular conditions, especially retinal pathology versus inflammatory causes. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the presence or absence of flashes or sudden vision loss to assess risk for retinal detachment or tear. Explore systemic symptoms and previous episodes to differentiate uveitis from vitreous detachment. - Patient factors: The patient appears to use straightforward, sometimes cautious language, possibly minimizing certain symptoms.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a ten-day history of increasing floaters, intermittent blurry vision, ocular soreness, and light sensitivity. She reports her symptoms as worsening, with concerns about serious eye conditions, though she denies experiencing flashes of light, sudden vision loss, or systemic illness. Communication biases suggest she may be underreporting transient phenomena such as brief flashes, lightning-like shapes, or episodes of partial vision loss that could indicate early retinal detachment or inflammatory processes. Her emotional distress might amplify her perceived severity but masking some subtle symptoms. Objective examination and ophthalmologic assessment are necessary to confirm the presence of retinal or inflammatory pathology, and an in-depth inquiry into transient visual phenomena should be prioritized to identify potential red flags.1. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: The patient's ocular soreness, light sensitivity, and worsening floaters over ten days suggest intraocular inflammation. Uveitis commonly presents with eye soreness, photophobia, floaters, and sometimes blurry vision. The absence of flashes or sudden vision loss does not exclude uveitis. The chronicity and progression support intraocular inflammation as the primary cause.  2. Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage Justification: Increasing floaters could be caused by blood in the vitreous humor, especially if inflammation leads to fragile retinal vessels. Though less likely given no mention of trauma or systemic bleeding disorders, vitreous hemorrhage remains a consideration due to symptom progression and floaters.  3. Diagnosis: Retinal inflammation (e.g., pars planitis) Justification: As a specific form of uveitis affecting the peripheral retina and vitreous, pars planitis can cause floaters, ocular soreness, and visual disturbances. Its chronic course fits the symptom history.  4. Diagnosis: Chorioretinitis Justification: Inflammatory involvement of the choroid and retina can cause floaters and blurring. Although less specified, it remains relevant given intraocular inflammation signs.  5. Diagnosis: Infectious endophthalmitis (less likely but possible) Justification: While typically more acute and with prominent pain and redness, infectious inflammation could present with soreness and floaters, especially if unnoticed trauma or infection exists. The lack of systemic infection signs makes this less probable but still worth considering, especially in endemic areas or immunocompromised states.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Prefers vague, downplaying descriptors (\"just the vision stuff,\" \"not that bad\"), combined with emotional expressions of fear and worry.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization combined with emotional amplification. She minimizes physical symptoms but amplifies fears about severe outcomes. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014could lead to under-recognition of critical signs like flashes or systemic features and overestimation of threat. - Areas most affected: Details on flashes, systemic illness, and rapid progression are likely underreported. - Reliability: Moderate, but caution advised; her emotional state influences her reporting accuracy.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle signs like flashes or systemic symptoms that she avoids mentioning. Her focus on pain and visual changes may overshadow other indicators. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any flashes of light, systemic illnesses, or signs of acute progression are likely understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of blindness and serious disease may distort the actual urgency or severity. - True timeline: Progressive worsening over ten days; emotional biases may lead her to perceive it as more rapid or severe than it physically is.",

She minimizes physical symptoms but amplifies fears about severe outcomes. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014could lead to under-recognition of critical signs like flashes or systemic features and overestimation of threat. - Areas most affected: Details on flashes, systemic illness, and rapid progression are likely underreported. - Reliability: Moderate, but caution advised; her emotional state influences her reporting accuracy.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle signs like flashes or systemic symptoms that she avoids mentioning. Her focus on pain and visual changes may overshadow other indicators. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any flashes of light, systemic illnesses, or signs of acute progression are likely understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of blindness and serious disease may distort the actual urgency or severity. - True timeline: Progressive worsening over ten days; emotional biases may lead her to perceive it as more rapid or severe than it physically is.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Traumatic Ocular Injury ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and normalized language (\"kind of hurts,\" \"kind of gets blurry\") that minimizes potential urgency. Her emotional expressions (\"really scared,\" \"just want to know\") reflect concern but are delivered with non-specificity, which could obscure symptom severity. - Information flow: She generally answers questions directly but with reluctance to fully disclose or acknowledge other symptoms (e.g., flashes of light). Her responses are organized yet tend to omit possible warning signs, indicating partial withholding of information. - Response style: Responses are concise and somewhat guarded; she avoids elaborating on \"worse\" symptoms unless explicitly prompted, which suggests a tendency toward minimizing or withholding certain concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her denial or minimization of flashes of light and systemic illness despite being asked clearly suggests withholding potentially critical information. - Minimization behaviors: Use of qualifying phrases (\"I don\u2019t think,\" \"kind of\") indicates she downplays her symptoms' seriousness, possibly to avoid further worry or emotional discomfort. - Amplification patterns: She amplifies her worry about the eye worsening and her fear of a serious condition, which is consistent with her anxious state but may also distort her perception of severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her quick dismissals hint at possible discomfort discussing more alarming symptoms like flashes or systemic issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are consistent and factual. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Minimization bias**, as she minimizes or dismisses symptoms that are clinically significant, like flashes of light. - Severity: Moderate\u2014this bias could lead to under-recognition of serious ocular pathology, risking underestimation of urgent need. - Areas most affected: Her reporting of transient, yet potentially critical symptoms (flashes, systemic feelings) is most biased; she likely underreports these. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional distress and tendency to minimize symptom severity reduce full confidence in self-reported symptom acuity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be withholding or downplaying flashes of light and systemic symptoms (fever, chills), which are key indicators for certain ocular emergencies. - Symptoms probably minimized: Flashes of light, which are common warning signs for retinal detachment or vascular issues, are likely underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety probably inflates her perception of ongoing damage but could also cause her to feel overwhelmed about her actual clinical status. - True timeline: The reported gradual worsening over ten days is likely accurate, but her perception of severity is influenced by anxiety; her self-reporting of stability regarding systemic symptoms may be understated.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient has expressed concern and anxiety about their eye symptoms, but displays minimization behaviors, especially regarding flashes of light and systemic symptoms. - Since flashes of light are key warning signs for retinal detachment or vascular issues, exploring their presence in more detail is crucial to confirm or exclude serious diagnoses. - The goal at this stage is to clarify whether the patient has experienced any flashes, their timing, frequency, and relation to other symptoms, without leading or implying urgency prematurely. - Considering communication style, open-ended questions may encourage the patient to disclose more information, but focused questions are necessary given the importance of specific symptoms. - The patient's reluctance or minimization suggests the need for gentle, non-judgmental phrasing to help them open up about any unreported symptoms.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Whether the patient has experienced flashes of light, their characteristics, and any systemic symptoms are not fully clarified. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming or ruling out retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, or other urgent ocular diagnoses associated with flashes. - Patient factors: Guarded responses and minimization suggest a need for careful, collaborative questioning to elicit truthful disclosure. - Interview phase goals: Confirm the presence or absence of key warning signs worth urgent attention and prepare for informing the patient about potential serious causes if relevant.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions about flashes and systemic symptoms. - Information target: Onset, frequency, duration, triggers, and relation to other symptoms like blurring. - Communication approach: Gentle, non-accusatory language to encourage honesty and disclosure. - Expected value: This will help determine if urgent referral is needed or if the symptoms are less concerning.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, I want to ask specifically about any flashes of light you've noticed\u2014like lightning or brief bright shapes in your vision. Have you experienced any of these flashes at all, especially around the times when your vision was blurry or your symptoms started? If so, can you tell me when they began, how often they happen, and if they seem related to certain activities or times of day? Also, have you felt any overall unwell, like a fever, chills, or other symptoms that might be connected?\"",
