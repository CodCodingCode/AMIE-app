    "input": "An adult patient presents with a rapidly enlarging, bleeding skin lesion that has developed over approximately three weeks. The lesion measures about a dime in diameter, exhibits a shiny, pink, pearl-like appearance with occasional reddish-purple discoloration, and has experienced bleeding and ulceration. The patient reports no pain but expresses concern about the lesion's growth and potential seriousness. No systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise are reported, although these could be underappreciated. The patient has a history of outdoor exposure through gardening and fishing, which may have influenced skin health. Further physical examination and diagnostic procedures, including biopsy, are recommended to determine the lesion's nature and to guide appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma Justification: The lesion's shiny, pearl-like appearance with central ulceration and reddish-purple discoloration is characteristic of nodular basal cell carcinoma, which is common in adults with sun exposure history. Its rapid growth and bleeding are typical features.  2. Diagnosis: Pyogenic granuloma Justification: Rapidly growing, bleeding, ulcerated skin lesion with a reddish-purple color can be characteristic of pyogenic granuloma, which often develops after minor trauma, common in outdoor activities.  3. Diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma Justification: An enlarging, ulcerated, bleeding lesion over weeks could represent an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, especially given sun exposure history; risk factors include outdoor activity.  4. Diagnosis: Melanoma Justification: Although less typical, a pigmented or reddish lesion that enlarges quickly and bleeds warrants consideration of melanoma, especially if discoloration is prominent.  5. Diagnosis: Dermatofibroma (atypical) Justification: Usually benign, but rapid growth is atypical; possible but less likely given the lesion's features.  6. Diagnosis: Sebaceous hyperplasia Justification: Usually presents as small, yellowish papules, not rapidly enlarging or bleeding, making it less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma Justification: Rapidly growing skin tumor that can resemble squamous cell carcinoma; often develops over weeks with potential for ulceration.  8. Diagnosis: Amelanotic melanoma Justification: Presents as a non-pigmented lesion that can enlarge quickly and bleed, but less common than melanoma.  9. Diagnosis: Hemangioma Justification: Vascular lesion, often present at birth or in childhood, and less likely to develop rapidly in adults without prior history.  10. Diagnosis: Cutaneous metastasis Justification: Unlikely without other systemic findings, but rapid growth of a skin nodule can sometimes be metastatic disease, especially in an adult.

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a rapidly enlarging, ulcerated skin lesion on the arm measuring approximately 10 millimeters in diameter. The lesion exhibits a shiny, pink, pearl-like appearance with areas of reddish-purple discoloration and has experienced bleeding episodes over the past three weeks. The patient reports no pain but has concerns about its growth and potential seriousness. The lesion's initial development was likely slower, with recent rapid change due to recent ulceration and bleeding. There are no reported systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise; however, these could be underreported. A thorough physical examination and biopsy are recommended to determine the lesion's nature and guide management decisions.1. Diagnosis: Amelanotic Melanoma Justification: Rapid growth, ulceration, bleeding, and pink appearance raise suspicion for melanoma lacking pigment; melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer requiring prompt diagnosis. 2. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Justification: Common skin cancer that can present as ulcerated, bleeding, raised lesions, often on sun-exposed areas; can develop rapidly and ulcerate. 3. Diagnosis: Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma Justification: Common skin cancer presenting as shiny, pearly, pink nodules that may ulcerate; tends to grow slowly but can sometimes enlarge rapidly if ulcerating. 4. Diagnosis: Pyogenic Granuloma Justification: Vascular lesion that develops quickly, often ulcerates and bleeds easily; common on extremities following minor trauma. 5. Diagnosis: Merkel Cell Carcinoma Justification: Aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor presenting as rapidly enlarging, shiny, firm red or purple nodule; requires urgent diagnosis due to high metastatic potential. 6. Diagnosis: Metastatic Skin Cancer Justification: Rapidly enlarging skin lesions could be metastases from internal malignancies; parasitic or infectious causes are less likely given the presentation. 7. Diagnosis: Kaposi Sarcoma Justification: Vascular lesion that can appear purple or reddish, ulcerate, and bleed; more common in immunocompromised patients. 8. Diagnosis: Hemangioma (Adult Type) Justification: Vascular lesion that can be shiny and pink, sometimes ulcerated, though usually benign and slow-growing. 9. Diagnosis: Cutaneous Infection (e.g., Pyoderma) Justification: Usually presents with more signs of infection, such as pain or systemic symptoms; less likely to enlarge rapidly without other infectious signs. 10. Diagnosis: Sebaceous Cyst with Superimposed Infection Justification: Can enlarge, rupture, and bleed if infected, but generally less rapidly enlarging or ulcerated without infection signs.

His tone includes emotional language expressing fear and frustration, indicating strong anxiety. The use of narratives to describe history and impact suggests emotional overlay rather than purely clinical focus. - Information flow: He is forthcoming in providing details about how it changed (\"started as just a little bump\") and how it affects him, often elaborating beyond direct questions. There is a pattern of tangent storytelling, especially when relating the lesion's visual features and daily impact, which may reflect emotional distress or difficulty keeping responses strictly factual. - Response style: Responses are elaborate and detailed, with some hesitations and tangential avoidance, indicating possible difficulty processing or managing anxiety about the lesion, and an attempt to express concern while possibly minimizing in tone.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited evidence; he appears eager to describe the lesion but may downplay earlier symptoms (\u201cdidn\u2019t think much about it\u201d), possibly underestimating initial concern. - Minimization behaviors: The initial lack of concern (\"nothing much to think of\") suggests early minimization. He emphasizes \u201cjust a bump,\u201d possibly to rationalize neglect of earlier signs. - Amplification patterns: His detailed focus on visual and bleeding features, along with expressions of worry about cancer and spread, suggest he amplifies the seriousness of these symptoms, possibly to legitimize his distress or seek reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; he discusses openly but with some hesitations, possibly indicating modest discomfort with discussing health fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of confusion; timelines seem consistent but colored by emotional distress. - Family influence: Slight inference that family or social factors might be influencing his concern (\"stress lately,\" yard work), but no direct evidence of family affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Over-worrying/Amplification bias, as he intensely focuses on the problematic features, bleeding, coloration, and rapid growth, which intensifies his perception of threat. There is also some potential initial minimization, but his current narrative suggests concern is elevated. - Severity: Moderate to severe\u2014his emotional distress inflates perceived danger, possibly leading to overestimation of severity; combined with some initial downplaying, the bias impacts reliability. - Areas most affected: His perception of lesion danger (\"Could this be cancer?\") and his emotional state (\"really scared\") are most biased by amplification. His explanations about progression and impact may be exaggerated due to anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; the patient communicates openly but is influenced strongly by emotional bias, so his report should be corroborated with objective observations and perhaps further questioning to clarify true timeline and severity.

    "input": "An adult male presents with a skin lesion on the arm that has enlarged from a small, inconspicuous spot to approximately one centimeter in diameter over three weeks. The lesion is characterized by a shiny, pink, pearl-like appearance with areas of reddish-purple discoloration and episodes of ulceration leading to bleeding. He reports no pain but expresses concern about rapid growth and potential malignancy. The lesion's recent change appears aggressive, but its initial presentation was likely more subtle and less alarming. The patient has a history of extensive sun exposure through outdoor activities such as gardening and fishing, with possible prior sun damage. No systemic symptoms are reported. Given the lesion's features\u2014size, coloration, recent ulceration, and bleeding\u2014it warrants prompt dermatological evaluation with possible biopsy to exclude skin cancer, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's emotional distress and communication patterns suggest that the early evolution was probably less rapid than described, and current concern may be influenced by anxiety. Further detailed history and physical examination are necessary to clarify the lesion\u2019s characteristics and guide management.1. Diagnosis: Basal Cell Carcinoma Justification: The lesion's shiny, pearly appearance with reddish-purple areas and ulceration is characteristic of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), especially in sun-exposed skin with a slow initial growth that has recently accelerated, causing ulceration and bleeding. BCCs are common in sun-damaged skin, tend to grow locally, and may become ulcerative (\"rodent ulcer\"). The recent aggressive change supports this diagnosis as BCCs can ulcerate and bleed as they invade locally.  2. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Justification: The ulceration, bleeding, and reddish-purple discoloration are also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which often arises in sun-damaged skin. SCC tends to grow more rapidly than BCC and can ulcerate, presenting as a firm, ulcerated lesion with irregular borders. The non-painful nature does not exclude SCC, which can be painless. The history of sun exposure and recent growth supports this diagnosis as a probable.  3. Diagnosis: Amelanotic Melanoma Justification: Although less common, amelanotic melanoma could present as a pink, shiny nodule enlarging rapidly with ulceration and bleeding, especially given the recent aggressive growth. Lack of pigmentation makes it more challenging to identify, but melanoma can occasionally lose pigment and appear as a pink or reddish nodule. The rapid change and ulceration raise suspicion, though it is slightly less likely given the described appearance.  4. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma Justification: Keratoacanthoma often appears as a rapidly enlarging, dome-shaped, keratinous nodule that can ulcerate. Since it grows quickly over weeks and may resemble SCC histologically, it fits into the differential, especially considering the rapid presentation. However, it\u2019s usually less likely to bleed extensively or have the pink, pearl-like shine described.  5. Diagnosis: Actinic (Solar) Keratosis transforming into squamous cell carcinoma Justification: Chronic sun damage can cause actinic keratoses, which may evolve into invasive SCC. The lesion's sun-exposed location and history support this, but actinic keratosis itself is usually flat and less likely to have ulcerated and enlarged rapidly as described. It\u2019s included as a lower-probability condition but part of the sun-damaged skin spectrum.  STOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, emotionally charged, and storytelling language, e.g., \"kinda like a little pearl,\" \"pretty quick,\" and \"freaked out,\" indicating a tendency toward narrative over concise descriptions. His responses are elaborative, often including extraneous details about his outdoor activities and personal history, which serve to contextualize his concern but also introduce potential distractions. - Information flow: He is forthcoming with background stories and details about his activities and past sun exposure, volunteering information proactively, but the core clinical description of symptoms fluctuates between specific (size, appearance) and vague (initial onset feelings). His responses are more organized into stories than direct symptom descriptions. - Response style: The responses are elaborative and sometimes tangential, with a pattern of storytelling-driven dialogue. He exhibits emotional expression (fears, worries) but also attempts to rationalize or minimize his early symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited evidence; he seems quite open, but some initial underplaying (\"not that bad,\" \"didn't think much about it\") suggests possible minimization of early symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: He minimizes the initial lesion's significance, noting it was \"just a tiny spot\" and \"didn't bother me at first,\" which could mask the true early course. - Amplification patterns: He amplifies his current concern\u2014describes the lesion as \"so big and shiny\" and \"freaked out\"\u2014possibly overstating the urgency due to emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slightly hints at discomfort when mentioning his outdoor activities and sun exposure, possibly feeling some shame about perceived negligence, but no overt shame signals. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence, responses are consistent, though some timeline details are generalized. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family affecting responses; he seems primarily self-focused or influenced by personal fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of emotional amplification and some minimization of early signs. His storytelling suggests a tendency to dramatize symptoms now while downplaying initial perceptions. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014his concern is real, yet he minimizes the initial presentation, which might obscure the actual progression timeline. - Areas most affected: Early onset reporting is potentially understated, impacting accuracy; current concern seems somewhat exaggerated but aligns with genuine fear. - Reliability: Moderate; he's mostly honest but comfort with storytelling may skew the precise timeline and severity of initial symptoms.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: He probably underestimated or ignored the lesion early on; details about initial appearance, exact onset, and subtle symptoms are likely understated. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early lesion description (\"tiny spot,\" \"not that bad\") likely downplays more significant initial signs, perhaps with less concern but more danger. - Concerns probably amplified: His current fears about spreading and severity are heightened; emotional distress influences his perception, possibly leading to over-estimation of urgency. - True timeline: The lesion may have started smaller and less alarming than portrayed; rapid growth and bleeding are real, but the prior understated description suggests a longer, less intense course than he admits.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The initial appearance, exact onset timing, and progression details are uncertain due to patient\u2019s storytelling tendency.

    "input": "An adult male presents with a progressively enlarging skin lesion on the arm that began as a small, painless, pink, shiny bump approximately three weeks prior. The lesion increased in size from a small, pea-like prominence to approximately 10 millimeters, now exhibiting a shiny, pearl-like appearance with areas of reddish-purple discoloration. Recently, it has undergone superficial ulceration with episodes of bleeding. The patient does not report pain or systemic symptoms such as fever or fatigue. He has a history of extensive outdoor exposure, including gardening and fishing, with past sunburns, which are relevant risk factors. His detailed history suggests slow initial growth with recent apparent acceleration, although his concern and description may be affected by anxiety, potentially amplifying perceived severity. Examination and biopsy are necessary to evaluate for skin malignancy, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical assessment should include detailed physical examination and exploration of any additional symptoms, with attention to psychological factors influencing his reporting.1. Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma Justification: The lesion\u2019s pearly, shiny appearance, localized growth over weeks, and recent superficial ulceration are characteristic features of basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin malignancy in sun-exposed areas. The history of sun exposure and prior sunburns supports its development. Its slow progression and superficial ulceration align with typical BCC behavior, and the lack of systemic symptoms makes it less likely to be aggressive.  2. Diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma Justification: The lesion's recent superficial ulceration, bleeding, reddish-purple discoloration, and rapid recent change are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, which often presents as ulcerated, reddish, scaly or keratotic lesions in sun-exposed skin. The lesion's evolution over weeks with surface ulceration supports this diagnosis, especially given the patient\u2019s outdoor exposure history.  3. Diagnosis: Melanoma Justification: The presence of reddish-purple discoloration, recent changes, and a shiny, raised lesion raises concern for melanoma, especially if pigmentation varies or irregular borders are observed. Melanoma can develop de novo or from pre-existing nevi and can ulcerate or bleed; although less classic than BCC or SCC, melanoma remains a differential due to recent change and pigmentation.  4. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma (a benign but rapidly growing keratinizing tumor) Justification: The lesion\u2019s rapid growth from a small bump to 10 mm with surface ulceration can resemble keratoacanthoma, which is a keratinizing cutaneous tumor that looks interchangeable with SCC but tends to grow rapidly and may regress spontaneously. Its appearance can mimic malignancy, warranting careful consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Pyogenic granuloma Justification: Its superficial ulceration and bleeding align with pyogenic granuloma features; however, its initial presentation as a painless, shiny bump and slow increase over weeks are less typical. Nevertheless, it remains in the differential given ulceration and bleeding episodes.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient combines specific descriptors (\"shiny,\" \"pink,\" \"like a pearl\") with vague phrases (\"maybe,\" \"kind of\"), reflecting some comfort with detail but also hesitance to be fully precise\u2014likely to softening perceptions or express uncertainty. Emotional expressions (\"freaks me out,\" \"worried\") convey the intensity of feelings that color their descriptions. - Information flow: They tend to provide detailed recounting proactively, especially about lesion appearance and progression, but also include tangential information about sun exposure, family history, and past activities, which might serve to contextualize or justify their fears. - Response style: Responses are elaborative and narrative-heavy, with some tangential extensions, especially when discussing concerns or background, indicating a tendency to tell stories rather than give brief answers.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt signs; they are open but may unintentionally omit minor details about subtle symptoms like itching or systemic issues. - Minimization behaviors: Use of soft language (\"not that bad,\" \"didn't bother me\") and emphasis on how quickly it changed to possibly underplay the severity of initial symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Clear exaggeration of the lesion's rapid growth and pathological concern (\"freaks me out,\" \"getting super quick\"), driven by anxiety and fear of serious illness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation (\"maybe,\" \"I guess\") suggests mild discomfort or shame about their situation, but overall they seem willing to discuss openly. - Confusion/memory issues: Timeline consistency indicates good recall; no confusion observed. - Family influence: Mentions of brother\u2019s skin issues and their relevance hint at personal vulnerability, perhaps increasing anxiety.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, leading them to perceive their lesion as more threatening than possibly warranted, which influences their narrative. - Severity: Moderate; their emotional distress affects perception but their detailed and coherent responses suggest they are not entirely unreliable. - Areas most affected: Their perception of progression speed and danger, possibly inflating the threat based on worry and familial history. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy but emotionally biased\u2014details are likely accurate, yet their concerns are magnified by anxiety.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle early symptoms like itching, tenderness, or systemic signs may be omitted or minimized, as their focus is on growth, appearance, and fear of cancer. - Symptoms probably minimized: They may underreport discomforts or less alarming signs; their emphasis on growth and bleeding suggests more severe symptoms might be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Their expressed fears about cancer spreading or being deadly appear heightened, possibly overestimating actual risk. - True timeline: Likely consistent with reported progression, but their perception may overstate the speed or severity due to anxiety-driven exaggeration.",
    "output": "THINKING: To refine the differential diagnosis between basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, keratoacanthoma, and pyogenic granuloma, I need more specific details about the lesion's characteristics, especially features that distinguish malignancies from benign conditions. Since the patient reports superficial ulceration and recent rapid change, exploring symptoms like itching, tenderness, and bleeding patterns will be helpful. Given his history of outdoor exposure and sunburns, I also want to assess if there are any other skin or systemic symptoms. His communication style seems narrative and anxiety-influenced, so framing questions to gently clarify details without provoking further worry is important. The goal in this focused clarification phase is to establish the lesion's precise nature, progression, and associated symptoms to guide biopsy and management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about specific lesion features, associated symptoms, and progression. - Information target: Presence of pain, tenderness, itching, bleeding frequency, and changes in color or border; timeline details; any systemic or additional skin symptoms. - Communication approach: Use gentle, clarifying prompts to avoid heightening anxiety, ensuring the patient feels comfortable providing specific details. - Expected value: These questions will help differentiate between more benign lesions like keratoacanthoma or pyogenic granuloma and malignant lesions like BCC, SCC, or melanoma, shaping diagnostic priorities.\nANSWER: You mentioned that the lesion has recently begun to ulcerate and bleed. Can you tell me if you've noticed whether it's itchy, tender, or painful at all? Also, have you observed any changes in its color or border\u2014like becoming more irregular or darker? And aside from bleeding, have you experienced any other symptoms such as increased size quickly, crusting, or any other new skin changes around it?",

    "input": "A middle-aged adult male presents with a skin lesion on the arm that began approximately three weeks ago as a small, painless, pink, shiny bump about the size of a pea. Over the past week, it has enlarged rapidly to approximately 10 millimeters, with a shiny, pearl-like appearance and areas of reddish-purple discoloration. The lesion has recently ulcerated superficially and experienced episodes of bleeding. The patient reports no significant pain or systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise, though his emotional description suggests concern about severity. His history includes extensive sun exposure from outdoor activities such as gardening and fishing, with past sunburns, which may contribute to skin cancer risk. Given the lesion's rapid recent growth, surface ulceration, and bleeding, further evaluation including physical examination and biopsy is necessary to determine whether the lesion represents a malignant process. Communication patterns indicate possible underreporting of pain and systemic symptoms, so clinical assessment should explore these areas carefully.Basal Cell Carcinoma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs a mix of vague and emotional language, which can obscure precise clinical details. Phrases like \"kinda like a little pearl\" and \"sometimes it crusts over\" lack specificity, but expressions like \"really scared\" and \"freaking me out\" show emotional distress. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming with details about symptoms and personal history, but some details (e.g., exact onset, discomfort) could be underreported or minimized, perhaps to reduce perceived severity. - Response style: Responses are elaborative and context-rich, often including additional observations or concerns intrusively, tending toward tangential storytelling that reveals emotional tension.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Mild hesitations or euphemisms (\"not that bad,\" \"really\"), suggesting some minimization or reluctance to emphasize seriousness. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying discomfort and symptom severity, possibly to avoid overwhelming or confront the gravity of situation. - Amplification patterns: Emotional expressions (\"freaking me out,\" \"it\u2019s been changing, and it\u2019s freaking me out\") heighten perceived threat, possibly as a coping mechanism. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt expressions but the use of dismissive phrases about symptoms indicates possible discomfort with acknowledging severity. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies in timing (\"maybe three weeks ago\" versus \"last week\") but overall consistent. - Family influence: Mentions brother\u2019s health but no overt reaction to this; seems to use familial history to contextualize fears rather than external pressure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of minimization of actual physical symptoms, coupled with emotional overstatement of worry, creating a complex bias. - Severity: Moderate, as there's evidence of underplaying physical signs while emotionally magnifying concern. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and timeline accuracy, where physical discomfort might be understated. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; the patient's perceptions are influenced by emotional distress, but their descriptions of progression seem plausible.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of symptoms such as tenderness or systemic effects, which could suggest more aggressive pathology. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical discomfort, subtle signs of systemic invasion, or early progression might not be fully disclosed. - Concerns probably amplified: Level of danger or urgency is likely heightened by emotional distress, impacting perception. - True timeline: Likely faster progression than perceived, especially given rapid growth, bleeding, and crusting, emphasizing need for prompt assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: Need to clarify whether the lesion ever caused inconvenience, discomfort, or symptoms like itching or tenderness, which helps distinguish different skin lesion types and assess aggressiveness. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm if the rapid growth and ulceration are associated with symptoms typical of malignant lesions (e.g., basal cell carcinoma) or other conditions such as infections or benign growths. - Patient factors: The patient\u2019s tendency to minimize symptoms and emotional distress suggests questions should be straightforward, gentle, and aimed at eliciting detailed, honest responses about physical sensations and timeline. - Interview phase goals: Final confirmation of diagnostic criteria, i.e., whether features like ulceration, bleeding, and growth pattern align with malignancy, and assessing any remaining red flags or symptoms that could suggest alternate diagnoses or systemic involvement.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions addressing the presence or absence of specific symptoms like pain, tenderness, itching, or other changes (e.g., color, border). - Information target: Clarify symptom details, such as whether there's been any tenderness or pain, what the healing or crusting looks like, and any new symptoms since the lesion's appearance. - Communication approach: Frame questions in a non-threatening way, acknowledging reported concerns (\"It sounds like it's been changing quite a bit, and I want to understand if it ever bothers you physically\u2014has it been itchy or tender anywhere?\") to reduce minimization. - Expected value: These questions will help confirm or challenge the suspicion of malignancy, rule out signs of infection or other causes, and strengthen diagnostic certainty before discussing management.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like the lesion has changed quite a bit and you're understandably worried. I want to ask, have you noticed if the area has become tender, itchy, or painful at all, or does it feel the same as when it first appeared? Also, since it started bleeding and crusting, have you seen any other symptoms like increased size, color changes, or anything else around it that might help us understand what's happening?\"",
