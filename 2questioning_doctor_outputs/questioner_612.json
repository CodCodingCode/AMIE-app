    "input": "The patient is an adult male presenting with a perianal lesion that has been present for approximately three weeks, with observed growth over time. He reports itching and bleeding associated with the lesion, describing it as small. However, these symptoms may be understated, and the bleeding could be more frequent or heavier than he reports. Physical examination is likely to reveal a lesion larger and more inflamed than implied, with signs suggestive of local irritation or possible secondary infection. Additional symptoms such as swelling, discharge, or increased discomfort may be present but unreported. Psychological distress related to the lesion may be more significant than indicated, and further assessment is needed to determine the true severity of symptoms and any underlying concerns.1. Diagnosis: Perianal Condyloma (Anal Warts) Justification: Common in adults, caused by human papillomavirus; presents as small, itchy, bleeding lesions that may grow over time, especially in a sexually active individual.  2. Diagnosis: Fungal or Candida Infection Justification: Itching and inflammation in the perianal area are typical, especially with secondary excoriation; common in moist environments.  3. Diagnosis: Anal Sebaceous or Seborrheic Keratosis Justification: Benign skin growths that can enlarge and become inflamed; typically not pruritic or bleeding unless irritated.  4. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids with Overlying Skin Changes Justification: Common perianal lesions with itching and bleeding; however, more likely to be soft and not enlarging as a mass.  5. Diagnosis: Anal Fissure with Associated Skin Changes Justification: Causes bleeding and discomfort but usually associated with pain during defecation and not a growing lesion.  6. Diagnosis: Perianal Molluscum Contagiosum Justification: Present as pearly, umbilicated papules that can grow; often pruritic but less likely to bleed significantly.  7. Diagnosis: Perianal Psoriasis Justification: Can cause inflamed, scaly patches in the perianal region; may cause itching but less likely to cause growth or bleeding.  8. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anus Justification: Possible, especially given the growth and bleeding, but less likely without other suspicious features; important to exclude due to malignancy risk.  9. Diagnosis: Crohn's Disease-related Perianal Lesion Justification: Chronic inflammatory condition can cause anal Lesions; however, systemic features are not described.  10. Diagnosis: Dermatofibroma Justification: Benign skin nodule; unlikely to be inflamed or bleeding, least likely without additional skin changesCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: He uses somewhat vague and cautious language, describing symptoms as \"small\" and \"not that bad,\" which suggest minimization. The phrase \"worried it might be something serious\" shows underlying concern but his tone indicates he tries not to panic. - Information flow: He initially provides a concise summary of symptoms and timeline, volunteering key details but lacks depth on emotional or contextual factors unless prompted. - Response style: Answers are direct, straightforward, and somewhat terse, reflecting a reserved personality. He avoids elaborate stories and focuses on core facts.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited; he does not overtly hide facts but likely minimizes the severity of symptoms and emotional impact. - Minimization behaviors: Describes the bump as \"small\" and symptoms as \"not that bad,\" which may underplay the discomfort and seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Expresses worry about \"something serious\" possibly to ensure the doctor recognizes concern, indicating some internal anxiety but not exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; he maintains eye contact and responds directly. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; his timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: Not apparent in this interaction.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias\u2014he downplays the severity and impact of symptoms, possibly to avoid worry or to maintain composure. - Severity: Moderate; this could lead to underestimation of symptoms' seriousness and delay care if not addressed. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and emotional expression; he minimizes physical discomfort but indicates concern about potential cancer. - Reliability: Fairly trustworthy for basic factual information but may underestimate the urgency or severity of symptoms.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about the intensity and impact of bleeding and discomfort; emotional distress may be underrepresented. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity of bleeding and discomfort; he describes symptoms as \"not that bad,\" which might conceal more serious issues. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about \"something serious\" is genuine but may be less intense than he perceives. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent with his report, but his framing may understate the actual clinical urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to encourage the patient to elaborate further on the lesion and associated symptoms to gain a fuller picture. - Since he describes the lesion as \"small\" and symptoms as \"not that bad,\" he might be minimizing, so I should ask about the actual impact on his comfort and daily life. - To build trust and allow him to share his experience in his own words, I will use an open-ended prompt that invites him to describe his experience comprehensively. - Understanding his perception and emotional response can reveal concerns not fully expressed so far. - This question will help clarify the true severity, associated features, and patient's perspective, guiding further focused questioning.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact severity of bleeding, pain, discomfort; emotional impact; any changes he hasn't noticed or reported. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the true extent of symptoms to differentiate benign from concerning lesions, like carcinoma. - Patient factors: He's reserved; thus, phrasing should be nonjudgmental and inviting to facilitate openness, especially around sensitive topics. - Interview phase goals: Deepen understanding of symptoms, impact, and concerns by encouraging narrative elaboration.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, narrative prompt. - Information target: Symptom severity, frequency of bleeding or itching, impact on daily life, emotional response. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic language that normalizes sharing (e.g., \"Tell me more about what you've experienced in terms of how this has been affecting you.\") - Expected value: Elicits detailed personal experience, reveals hidden concerns, and informs subsequent focused questions.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how this lesion and your symptoms have been affecting you\u2014what that\u2019s been like day to day, and anything else you\u2019ve noticed or experienced that you think might be important?\"",

    "input": "An adult male presents with a perianal lesion that has been evolving over approximately three weeks. The patient reports initial appearance as a small wart-like bump that has increased in size and prominence over time. He describes associated itching and some bleeding, but tends to minimize symptom severity, possibly underestimating the extent of bleeding, discomfort, or inflammation. The lesion is likely larger, more inflamed, and symptomatic than the patient's account suggests. Additional signs of secondary infection, such as swelling or foul discharge, are suspected but unreported. A thorough physical exam and detailed history are necessary to accurately assess lesion size, inflammation, bleeding, and presence of secondary infection. Further questioning should focus on symptoms detail to clarify the severity beyond the patient's initial presentation.1. Diagnosis: Condyloma acuminatum (Genital warts) Justification: Most common perianal lesion in sexually active adults, painless, wart-like, enlarging over weeks, associated with HPV; frequent site for HPV-related warts.  2. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids Justification: Common cause of bleeding and discomfort in the anal area; may be associated with itching and bleeding, especially if inflamed or prolapsed; can be mistaken for or coexist with other lesions.  3. Diagnosis: Anal fissure Justification: Bleeding with a painful, possibly ulcerated lesion; often associated with itching and secondary infection if chronic; may be mistaken for other forms of perianal lesion.  4. Diagnosis: Perianal abscess or infected hemorrhoid Justification: Signs of secondary infection suspected; swelling, inflammation, possible foul discharge; may cause bleeding and pain, presenting as inflamed lesion.  5. Diagnosis: Anal intraepithelial neoplasia or HPV-related dysplasia Justification: Persistent, slowly enlarging lesion with potential for malignant transformation; HPV-related changes, especially in sexually active adult males.  6. Diagnosis: Perianal carcinoma (Squamous cell carcinoma) Justification: Possibility in a longstanding, enlarging lesion with bleeding; red flags include persistent bleeding, size, and inflammation; though less common, important to rule out.  7. Diagnosis: Molluscum contagiosum Justification: Wart-like, umbilicated lesions that can be confused with condyloma; generally smaller and less inflamed but can be enlarged if secondary infection occurs.  8. Diagnosis: Lichen sclerosus or other inflammatory dermatitis Justification: Chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting anal area; causes itching, thinning, and lesions, but less likely to enlarge rapidly or bleed significantly.  9. Diagnosis: Anal melanoma Justification: Rare but serious; presents as pigmented or ulcerated lesion, sometimes mistaken for other perianal lesions; red flags include change in lesion appearance and bleeding.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign body reaction or other granulomatous disease Justification: Less common; presents with inflamed, enlarging lesion; considered if other diagnoses are ruled out, particularly in complex or atypical cases.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific descriptions (\"bump,\" \"itchy,\" \"bleeds,\" \"growing\") but also employs mild vagueness (\"kind of,\" \"not that bad\") when describing symptoms, indicating some effort to normalize or minimize discomfort. He remains factual without overt emotional language. - Information flow: He tends to provide detailed background, including contextual factors like work habits, that although informative, can serve as tangential storytelling. Directly regarding his symptoms, he reports in an organized manner but with minimal emotional expression, suggesting a focus on factual reporting. - Response style: His responses are elaborative and cooperative but include instances of digression (\"I\u2019ve just been busy,\" \"my wife told me I should get it checked\"). This pattern hints at possible avoidance of direct emotional engagement about his health concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to emphasize the severity of his symptoms or emotional distress. The focus on being \"busy\" and \"not wanting to bother\" could mask underlying hesitance to present urgency. - Minimization behaviors: Uses phrases like \"not that bad,\" \"kind of small,\" \"not terrible\" despite symptoms like bleeding and growth\u2014indicating he might be downplaying the potential seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Does not overtly exaggerate concerns; he describes symptoms in a measured way, though his tone hints at underlying worry (\"worried it might be something serious\"). - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal directly, but his mentioning of \"gross\" and \"kinda\" suggests some discomfort in discussing sensitive symptoms, consistent with mild embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indications; he provides a consistent timeline and description. - Family influence: The mention of his wife advising him to get checked hints at some external encouragement, but he appears to accept this advice without significant external bias.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be minimization of symptoms, likely influenced by discomfort, embarrassment, or a wish to avoid unnecessary worry. - Severity: Moderate. While he provides accurate descriptive detail, his tendencies to contextualize symptoms within busy life and to downplay discomfort suggest some under-reporting or understated concern. - Areas most affected: His perception of symptom severity and emotional response are most biased; he minimizes potential danger (\"not that bad\") despite symptoms that warrant urgency. - Reliability: Reasonably reliable, but with caution. The patient provides consistent timelines and clear descriptions, but subtle minimization signals mean some worry or urgency might be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient's true level of concern or anxiety; he may be less aware of, or less willing to admit, the seriousness of his condition. He might also be underreporting discomfort or neglecting emotional distress related to possible diagnoses. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might perceive or report his bleeding and growth as less severe than they are, possibly delaying faster intervention. - Concerns probably amplified: While he shows concern about cancer, he's not overtly panic-stricken, but his anxiety might be higher internally than expressed; social or cultural discomfort discussing sensitive topics could be suppressing full disclosure. - True timeline: The timeline seems accurate in answer, but the seriousness could be underestimated, and his busy lifestyle might reflect unrecognized deterioration or neglect of symptoms that could be more advanced.",

    "input": "An adult male presents with a perianal lesion that has been enlarging over approximately three weeks. The patient reports initial appearance as a small, wart-like bump that has increased in size and prominence over time. He describes associated itching and intermittent bleeding during bowel movements, though he tends to minimize discomfort and bleeding severity. Physical examination is required to assess lesion size, surface characteristics, signs of ulceration or secondary infection, and inflammation. Further evaluation should include inquiry about systemic symptoms, the extent of bleeding, presence of foul odor or discharge, and any associated swelling or signs of infection to guide diagnosis and management.1. Diagnosis: Condyloma Acuminatum (Genital Warts) Justification: The lesion initially appeared as a small, wart-like bump, which is characteristic of an HPV-induced lesion. Its enlargement over weeks with associated itching and intermittent bleeding aligns with condyloma, which can grow and become symptomatic over time. It is the most common perianal lesion in sexually active adults, especially if the lesion has a verrucous appearance on examination.  2. Diagnosis: Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (AIN) Justification: Given the lesion\u2019s appearance and growth, especially with recent enlargement, premalignant changes are a concern. AIN can present as persistent, irregular, or enlarging lesions, often associated with HPV infection. It\u2019s difficult to distinguish from condyloma clinically but is critical due to potential progression to anal carcinoma.  3. Diagnosis: Perianal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Justification: The lesion's progression, bleeding, and itching could represent early carcinoma. Although less likely given the relatively short duration (3 weeks) and initial wart-like appearance, any persistent, enlarging perianal lesion warrants consideration of malignancy. The intermittent bleeding raises suspicion for neoplastic invasion.  4. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoid or Perianal Hemorrhagic Lesion Justification: Bleeding during bowel movements suggests hemorrhoids; however, their usual presentation is more vascular and less wart-like. While hemorrhoids can be associated with skin tags or ulceration, the initial appearance as a small, verrucous bump makes this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Infectious or Other Benign Conditions (e.g., Fungal or Bacterial Infection) Justification: Itching and bleeding could partly be explained by secondary infection or another benign inflammatory process. However, the wart-like description and progressive enlargement make infectious causes less probable as primary diagnoses, though they may complicate the clinical scenario.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient\u2019s language is mostly specific about the timeline and symptoms but includes mild vagueness (\"kind of small,\" \"a little bigger\") and some emotional descriptors (\"kind of gross,\" \"keep thinking about it\"). The tone is matter-of-fact but with mild emotional overlays. - Information flow: The patient is quite forthcoming, elaborating on symptoms and related thoughts without much prompting, though some tangential details (work, family) are included, showing an organized but expansive narrative. - Response style: Responses are elaborative, detailed, and slightly tangential, with some sighing or pausing implied when discussing discomfort and worry, indicating some emotional engagement but maintained openness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; no clear evidence, response is quite open. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying pain (\"not terrible\") and discomfort to avoid overreacting, possibly to maintain composure. - Amplification patterns: Expresses concern about \"something serious\" and references family history, which may heighten perceived threat beyond current findings. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort in describing the lesion as \u201ckind of gross,\u201d and discomfort around discussing details indirectly. - Confusion/memory issues: Consistent timeline and descriptions show no signs. - Family influence: Noted that his wife advised him to get checked; indicates social influence affecting health-seeking behavior.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight tendency toward worry and potential catastrophizing about cancer, influenced by family history and concern. Some emotional amplification of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as his concern appears legitimate but possibly runs slightly ahead of clinical severity. - Areas most affected: Perception of serious illness (cancer), emotional framing of symptoms. - Reliability: Fairly reliable, given detailed descriptions; however, emotional concern could influence perception of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise description of lesion size, appearance, and other systemic symptoms; patient may not fully convey the lesion\u2019s physical characteristics. - Symptoms probably minimized: Potentially underestimating how serious or advanced some features are, especially if pain or size are more concerning than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Fears of cancer and dire outcomes based on family history; the narrative suggests elevated anxiety levels. - True timeline: Symptoms have indeed been progressing over three weeks; the patient's report matches typical disease progression but could be influenced by concern-driven perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted follow-up questions to clarify the lesion's physical characteristics, since the description is somewhat vague and lesion size, surface features, and signs of ulceration or secondary infection are key to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The patient mentions itching and bleeding but minimizes severity; exploring these aspects further can help determine whether symptoms suggest benign conditions like condyloma or more concerning pathology like carcinoma. Additionally, since family history increases concern, I should assess for systemic symptoms or risk factors that might indicate higher malignancy risk. The communication style appears open but emotionally engaged, so framing questions sensitively is essential to avoid causing undue anxiety. CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact size, appearance (verrucous, ulcerated, friable), surface characteristics of the lesion; presence of secondary infection, ulceration, discharge; systemic symptoms like weight loss or appetite change. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating benign condyloma from dysplastic lesions (AIN) or carcinoma; assessing for secondary infection. - Patient factors: Elaboration patterns suggest openness but emotional concern; questions should be straightforward, non-judgmental, and empathetic. - Interview phase goals: Gather detailed lesion description, check for red flags (e.g., ulceration, rapid growth, systemic symptoms), and explore risk factors. QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about lesion characteristics, accompanied by open-ended prompts for additional details. - Information target: Size, surface features (verrucous, ulcerated), signs of bleeding beyond what he described, presence of secondary infection or foul odor, initial lesion details, and systemic symptoms. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently, emphasizing clinical assessment needs (\"Can you tell me exactly how big the lesion is now?\" or \"What does the surface of the lesion look like\u2014is it smooth, warty, ulcerated?\"). - Expected value: Clarifies physical features critical for distinguishing between benign and premalignant/malignant lesions, aiding prioritization of further evaluation or biopsy.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned the lesion has been enlarging over the past few weeks\u2014can you tell me more about its size now? For example, is it about the size of a pea, a grape, or something larger? Also, what does the surface look like\u2014does it appear wart-like and rough, or is it more ulcerated or bleeding easily?

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There's no overt evidence of withholding critical facts; he answers questions directly, yet he may underreport subtle discomforts (e.g., precise extent of pain, foul odor) possibly to avoid fear or embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: He refers to the lesion as \u201ckind of small,\u201d \u201cnot that bad,\u201d which could downplay the severity, especially compared to his actual concern about potential cancer. - Amplification patterns: He emphasizes the concern about seriousness\u2014\"worried it might be something bad,\" \"thinking about it constantly,\" indicating some emotional amplification of risk. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight nervousness when discussing potential cancer, and touching the anal area when describing symptoms, suggest discomfort or embarrassment talking about the topic. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; his timeline and symptom descriptions are consistent. - Family influence: His mention of his wife urging him to seek care indicates some external influence; his mention of his uncle's similar issue seems to influence his concern, possibly amplifying fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional concern leading to anxiety amplification about the risk of cancer and severe disease, possibly resulting in some symptom overinterpretation. - Severity: Moderate bias. The patient is genuinely worried, which may influence how he perceives symptoms but is also sharing valuable information. - Areas most affected: His perception of lesion severity and the connection to cancer are biased by fear; his concern about what might happen influences the level of detail and emotional tone. - Reliability: Generally reliable in reporting facts, but emotional bias might skew his interpretation of symptom significance or urgency.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible underreporting of other symptoms such as foul odor, more detailed discomfort, or additional signs of local infection or lesion characteristics. - Symptoms probably minimized: He may be underestimating the lesion's potential severity, given his initial dismissiveness and mild descriptors. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears about cancer and serious disease are likely overemphasized, driven by personal anecdote and media influence. - True timeline: The lesion may have been progressing over several weeks, possibly faster or slower than stated, but his focus on the recent increases suggests perception aligns reasonably well with actual progression.",

    "input": "An adult male presents with a gradually enlarging perianal lesion that has increased in size over three weeks to approximately the size of a grape, with a rough, wart-like surface. The lesion is associated with intermittent bleeding, primarily following bowel movements or prolonged sitting, with redness surrounding the area. The patient reports mild discomfort and occasional fatigue but denies significant pain, foul odor, or notable discharge. Symptoms such as bleeding and systemic signs may be underreported due to guarded communication, suggesting that the lesion could be more symptomatic than described. Clinical findings are consistent with an enlarging, erythematous, wart-like perianal lesion with episodic bleeding, warranting further assessment for infection, malignancy, or HPV-related changes.Condyloma acuminatum ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, minimizing language (\"not a ton,\" \"just kinda spots\"), suggesting an attempt to lessen perceived severity, possibly due to embarrassment or fear. - Information flow: Responses are reactive; they mostly answer questions directly but hold back details unless prompted, indicating discomfort discussing sensitive topics and possible withholding of information. - Response style: Responses are measured, somewhat elliptical, with occasional elaboration when describing symptoms but overall cautious and guarded.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance to specify bleeding amount, presence of odor, or exact size, likely to avoid alarming the clinician or out of embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: Describing bleeding as minor, avoiding emphasis on severity despite the increasing concern, suggesting a tendency to downplay symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Signs of worry about cancer, HPV, and smoking's role, with potentially exaggerated concern about the seriousness, likely driven by anxiety rather than factual distortion. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation when discussing bleeding and smell, indicating discomfort or shame about these symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight estimates in size and frequency, indicating mild recall bias or uncertainty. - Family influence: Reference to a relative\u2019s similar issue points to some influence from family history on worries but not on responses' honesty.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, as the patient downplays symptoms but still expresses concern, potentially hiding the true extent. - Severity: Moderate, because underestimation of bleeding and symptom significance could mask severity. - Areas most affected: Bleeding detail and symptom impact, which are crucial for accurate assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; they are cooperative but tend to understate symptom severity, so clinical judgments should account for possible underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact severity of bleeding, presence of foul odor or discharge, and full extent of discomfort, due to patient minimization and discomfort discussing sensitive issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Bleeding severity, odor, and possible signs of infection or advanced pathology may be underreported, potentially delaying diagnosis. - Concerns probably amplified: Worry about cancer and HPV connection may be heightened, driven by genuine fear but possibly disproportionate. - True timeline: Symptoms may be more severe or progressing faster than reported, given the tendency to minimize minor symptoms but overall express concern about worsening over weeks.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We still lack clarity on the true extent and nature of the bleeding, whether there's foul smell or purulent discharge, size specifics, and any other systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. Also, understanding the patient's awareness of potential causes or concerns about diagnoses like malignancy or infection is important. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm whether the lesion exhibits features characteristic of condyloma, malignancy, or other dermatological or infectious etiologies. Ruling out concerning signs like ulceration, bleeding severity, foul odor, or rapid growth is essential, especially given the patient's guarded responses. - Patient factors: The patient's pattern of minimization and embarrassment may cause underreporting of symptoms. Therefore, questions should be phrased gently, focusing on factual descriptions without making assumptions, to encourage honest disclosure. - Interview phase goals: Gather detailed, accurate information on lesion characteristics, bleeding, and associated symptoms to confirm or refine the diagnosis, and assess their understanding and comfort level. Also, explore any last red flags that might suggest a more serious pathology.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarification questions that invite detailed description of symptoms and lesion features. Some confirmatory questions to verify findings. - Information target: Precise details about bleeding, smell, discharge, size, surface appearance, and any systemic or local symptoms. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to encourage openness, avoiding medical jargon that might increase discomfort. - Expected value: These questions will narrow diagnostic uncertainty, reveal any concerning features like ulceration or foul odor, and help determine if additional testing or urgent intervention is needed.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that. To help me understand better, could you tell me a bit more about the bleeding\u2014does it happen only after bowel movements, or does it occur any other times? Also, when it bleeds, how much blood are you noticing\u2014like a few spots or more? Regarding the lesion's smell or appearance, have you noticed any foul odor or pus, or any areas around it that seem swollen or red? And finally, are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, chills, or feeling unwell that you haven't mentioned yet?\"",
