    "input": "A woman in her 30s or 40s presented with an incidental finding of an adrenal gland lump identified on imaging performed for gastrointestinal complaints. She reports experiencing fatigue, shakiness, and increased growth of hair on her face and chest, suggestive of hyperandrogenism. Her communication style is straightforward and emotionally restrained, which may lead to underreporting of emotional distress or psychological impact. Further assessment should explore her emotional well-being, extent of physical changes, and any additional symptoms to fully understand her clinical status.1. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting adrenal cortical tumor (adrenal adenoma or carcinoma) Justification: The presence of an adrenal mass with signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism) strongly suggests an adrenal tumor producing androgens; adrenal tumors are a known cause of hyperandrogenism in women.  2. Diagnosis: Adrenal cortical hyperplasia Justification: Bilateral or unilateral hyperplasia can produce excess androgens, and may present with similar signs; however, the incidental mass favors a tumor, making hyperplasia slightly less likely.  3. Diagnosis: Ovarian androgen-producing tumor (e.g., Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor) Justification: Ovarian tumors can cause hyperandrogenism, but the identified adrenal mass makes adrenal origin more probable; ovarian tumors are less commonly incidental findings.  4. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure Justification: Could cause hyperandrogenic features, but no history of androgen use or supplementation provided; less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Justification: Common cause of hyperandrogenism, yet typically not associated with adrenal masses; less supported given imaging findings.  6. Diagnosis: Adrenal metastasis from another primary tumor Justification: Rare, but metastatic tumors can produce hormones; considered less likely without evidence of primary malignancy.  7. Diagnosis: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (adrenal enzyme defects) Justification: Usually presents earlier in life; unlikely as an incidental finding in this age group with no mention of longstanding symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Adrenal incidentaloma with non-functional tissue Justification: May be benign and non-secreting; inconsistent with signs of hyperandrogenism.  9. Diagnosis: Pituitary or hypothalamic disorder causing hyperadrenalism Justification: Less likely; primary endocrine tumor unlikely to present as an incidental adrenal mass.  10. Diagnosis: Ectopic ACTH production Justification: Typically causes cortisol excess rather than isolated androgen excess; less likely given presentation.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses simple, direct language to describe her symptoms, with some emotional undertones (\"really tired,\" \"kind of shaky,\" \"more hair on my face and chest\"). - Information flow: She is forthcoming with initial symptom details and the reason for her visit, volunteering information about the lump and her symptoms without hesitation. - Response style: Her responses are concise, organized, and consistent, showing a cooperative and honest communication style, though she maintains some emotional restraint.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence at this stage; she appears open about her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: No evident downplaying; her descriptions suggest genuine concern rather than minimization. - Amplification patterns: Not apparent; she shares symptoms cautiously and appears aware of their significance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; her tone and openness indicate no shame or embarrassment about her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: None observed; her timeline and details are consistent. - Family influence: No explicit signs of external influence affecting her responses; she communicates independently.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal bias evident here; she seems to be honest and straightforward, with no significant signs of withholding or distortion. - Severity: Mild or negligible; her responses are reliable at this point. - Areas most affected: Likely her emotional response rather than factual reporting, as she shows concern but not denial or exaggeration. - Reliability: Fairly high; her clarity and consistency support trusting her self-reporting at this stage.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Deeper fears, potential denial, or unacknowledged emotional impacts that she might not voice out explicitly. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possibly her emotional impact or severity perception might be understated, but her concern indicates genuine awareness. - Concerns probably amplified: She may over-focus on the seriousness of the lump rather than her overall health consequences, but this is supported by her questions about \"seriousness.\" - True timeline: Her reported timeline seems accurate and consistent; no contradictory information suggests distortion.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given her straightforward communication style and focus on physical symptoms, I want to understand her emotional perspective and how these changes are affecting her daily life. Exploring her thoughts about the symptoms and their impact can open up spaces for her to share concerns she might not have mentioned yet. Since she reports noticing increased hair growth and feelings of tiredness, I should also inquire about how these symptoms are influencing her overall well-being and daily functioning to further inform diagnosis and care.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Her emotional state, understanding of her condition, and any unspoken worries. - Diagnostic priorities: Explore physical and emotional impact, and gather her perspective on the significance of her symptoms. - Patient factors: Her straightforward and restrained style suggests responses may be brief; questions should be gentle and open-ended. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, understand her subjective experience, and identify any emotional or psychological considerations.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage detailed, personal responses. - Information target: Her personal experience of symptoms, how they began, how she perceives their seriousness. - Communication approach: Use empathetic language, validate her experience, avoid medical jargon. - Expected value: Gaining insight into her emotional and psychological response, which may influence her overall health context.\nANSWER: \"It sounds like you've been noticing some changes and it's understandable to feel concerned.

    "input": "A middle-aged female patient was found to have an adrenal mass incidentally during imaging for gastrointestinal complaints. She exhibits physical signs consistent with hyperandrogenism, notably increased facial and chest hair. She reports experiencing fatigue and shakiness but communicates in a guarded manner, which suggests her reported severity of these symptoms may be underestimated. She appears emotionally reserved and confused about the timeline of her symptoms, indicating the possibility of more significant psychological impact or additional symptoms that she is hesitant to disclose. Further assessment is necessary to evaluate her emotional well-being, clarify the progression of her physical symptoms, and identify any additional systemic or psychological symptoms that may be overlooked due to communication barriers.1. Diagnosis: Adrenal Cortical Adenoma Producing Androgens Justification: The presence of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass along with hyperandrogenism suggests an androgen-producing adrenal adenoma, which is common in middle-aged women presenting with increased facial and chest hair.  2. Diagnosis: Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma Justification: An adrenal mass with hormonal activity, especially in middle-aged women, raises concern for carcinoma, which may produce excess androgens and cortisol, especially if signs of hormonal excess are present.  3. Diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome (Exogenous or Endogenous) Justification: Fatigue suggests cortisol dysregulation; an adrenal mass could be producing excess cortisol leading to features of hypercortisolism, although further signs would be needed to support this diagnosis.  4. Diagnosis: Ovarian PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) Justification: Hyperandrogenism with hirsutism is common in PCOS; however, the adrenal mass makes primary ovarian pathology less likely but still a differential consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma Justification: As an adrenal tumor, pheochromocytoma is crucial to rule out, especially with systemic symptoms like shakiness, which could represent catecholamine excess.  6. Diagnosis: Nonfunctional Adrenal Incidentaloma Justification: The mass may be incidental and non-secreting; however, her symptoms suggest hormonal activity making this less likely.  7. Diagnosis: Metastatic Adrenal Lesion Justification: Less common in the absence of known primary malignancy but should be considered, especially with an adrenal mass in middle age.  8. Diagnosis: Adrenal Myelolipoma Justification: Usually incidental and benign, typically not hormonally active; less likely given hormonal symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Psychological or Psychiatric Disorder (e.g., Anxiety, Depression) Justification: Her guarded demeanor and confusion could reflect psychological factors, but this does not explain the adrenal mass or hyperandrogenic features directly.  10. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Late-Onset) Justification: Usually presents in adolescence, but some forms can present later with hyperandrogenism; less probable but important to exclude.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses simple, straightforward language but employs vague phrases like \"kind of\" and \"sort of,\" indicating some hesitancy or emotional shielding. Her expressions of confusion and nervousness enrich her responses with emotional nuance. - Information flow: She tends to be reactive rather than proactive, responding mainly when asked, and doesn\u2019t volunteer extensive background, possibly to protect her privacy or due to discomfort. - Response style: Her replies are concise and somewhat guarded, with occasional emotional disclosures. She avoids detailed elaboration unless encouraged.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited sharing about her social and family background, possible hesitation about fully disclosing emotional distress. For example, she doesn't mention family history beyond a general \"I don\u2019t really have any\" statement. - Minimization behaviors: Use of hedging language (\"kind of,\" \"I guess\"), possibly downplaying the emotional impact or severity, making her experience seem less intense. - Amplification patterns: She appears emotionally sensitive, perhaps over-worried, but does not overtly exaggerate physical symptoms; her expressions are consistent with anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervousness and self-soothing behaviors like rubbing her neck suggest some discomfort discussing her symptoms, especially emotional or personal aspects. - Confusion/memory issues: She indicates some uncertainty about her symptoms' meaning and progression, evident in her use of vague language and phrases like \"kind of messing with me.\" - Family influence: Minimal evidence; responses seem internally motivated, with no clear external influence visible.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate emotional bias, characterized by anxiety and some defensiveness reflected in vague language and guarded responses. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state influences her communication, possibly leading to underreporting or over-worrying, but factual symptom reporting remains relatively intact. - Areas most affected: Emotional expression about symptoms and background details, which may be affected by her nervousness. - Reliability: Moderately reliable, with some potential for emotional distortion; physical symptom descriptions seem dependable, but her emotional responses could skew her perception of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about her emotional well-being, social support, or internal coping, which may influence her overall health perception. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be underreporting the severity or impact of her fatigue and weakness due to emotional discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Her nervousness and confusion suggest she may be over-worried about her health and prognosis. - True timeline: Her reported progression appears plausible, but emotional factors might influence her perception of worsening symptoms, potentially exaggerating her distress.  In summary, Emily's communication is characterized by mild emotional bias, with tendencies toward vagueness and guarded responses that may slightly affect the accuracy of her symptom description. Her responses are helpful but should be supplemented with attentive probing into her emotional state and social context for a comprehensive assessment.",

    "input": "A middle-aged female patient was found to have an incidental adrenal mass during imaging performed for gastrointestinal complaints. She exhibits physical signs consistent with hyperandrogenism, including increased facial and chest hair, and reports symptoms of fatigue and shakiness. While she describes these symptoms as moderate, they are likely more severe and persistent, given her guarded communication style and potential underreporting. She also reports feelings of confusion about the timeline of her symptoms and indicates emotional distress, though she appears hesitant to fully disclose emotional or psychological concerns. Additional physical features such as weight gain and oily skin are likely present but not explicitly reported. The clinical presentation suggests hyperandrogenic state possibly related to adrenal pathology, with physical signs and systemic symptoms likely more pronounced than reflected in her subjective report. Further assessment is needed to clarify her emotional wellbeing, systemic symptoms, and symptom timeline.1. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting Adrenal Adenoma Justification: The presence of an incidental adrenal mass combined with clinical signs of hyperandrogenism strongly suggests an adrenal cortical adenoma secreting androgens. These tumors can produce excess androgens leading to hirsutism, oily skin, weight gain, and systemic symptoms like fatigue. The lack of overt cortisol excess signs reduces suspicion of Cushing's syndrome, but partial hyperandrogenism aligns with adenoma's secretory profile.  2. Diagnosis: Adrenocortical Carcinoma Justification: Although less common, adrenocortical carcinoma can produce high levels of androgens, causing significant hyperandrogenic features and an adrenal mass. The systemic symptoms (fatigue, shakiness) and physical signs could be explained by high tumor burden or hormonal excess. Malignancy is a concern given the incidental mass and symptom severity.  3. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic) Justification: Non-classic CAH can present in middle age with signs of hyperandrogenism, though it usually manifests earlier. The systemic symptoms and hyperandrogenic features could be consistent, but it\u2019s less likely given the incidental mass and lack of congenital history.  4. Diagnosis: Ectopic Androgen Production Justification: Rare, but ectopic production from tumors elsewhere (e.g., lung, gonads) could mimic adrenal hyperandrogenism. The adrenal mass makes primary adrenal origin more probable, but ectopic sources remain a differential consideration if no adrenal pathology was found.  5. Diagnosis: Ovarian Hyperthecosis or PCOS Justification: Ovarian causes like hyperthecosis or PCOS can cause hyperandrogenism but are less likely to account for an adrenal incidentaloma. The systemic symptoms are more suggestive of an adrenal source, making ovarian pathology less probable but still in the differential.

Her answers are organized around physical symptoms, but emotional and psychological details are less accessible. - Response style: She provides brief, mostly straightforward answers with some hedging. Her physical descriptions are clearer; emotional and subjective feelings are expressed with hesitation and qualifiers.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited emotional disclosure and use of hedging suggest she might underreport emotional distress. - Minimization behaviors: Frequent use of \"just,\" \"kind of,\" and \"not really\" indicate efforts to downplay or minimize her worries and symptoms. - Amplification patterns: No significant exaggeration observed; her concerns appear proportionate but possibly understated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation and leaning forward when discussing her emotional feelings suggest some discomfort or shame about emotional vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline and statements are consistent. - Family influence: No overt evidence, responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization and hedging bias, leading her to understate emotional distress and possibly the severity of her feelings. - Severity: Moderate; her language suggests she\u2019s not fully revealing her emotional struggles, which can distort clinical understanding. - Areas most affected: Emotional state and perceived severity of her symptoms are most biased; physical complaints are more transparently reported. - Reliability: Self-report on emotional impact should be interpreted cautiously, as she minimizes her internal distress, though her physical symptoms are more likely trustworthy.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her psychological and emotional responses, including worries or fears, may be underreported, risking an incomplete picture of her mental health. - Symptoms probably minimized: The extent of her emotional distress and internal anxiety is likely understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Physical symptoms are probably reported more honestly than her emotional reactions; she might be over-focused on physical changes while internally feeling more distressed than she admits. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but emotional adaptation may be less advanced than her external report suggests, given her hedging language.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about her emotional state, specifically how distressing she finds these symptoms, and any coping mechanisms; clarification of the timeline and progression of physical and emotional symptoms; specifics about systemic symptoms like fatigue or shakiness; her response to previous similar episodes; and family history related to endocrine or adrenal conditions. - Diagnostic priorities: Further explore her systemic symptoms and physical signs to differentiate between adrenal pathology, systemic illness, or other hormonal causes; assess for associated symptoms that could help distinguish among her differential diagnoses. - Patient factors: Her vague and minimization language suggests she might downplay emotional concerns; questions should be gently probing to elicit more detailed responses without triggering defensiveness. - Interview phase goals: Narrow down the timeline of her symptoms, gauge the severity and impact more precisely, and explore the emotional and systemic symptoms to inform the likelihood of different diagnoses.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and open-ended questions that gently probe her experience, especially about emotional impact, symptom progression, and systemic features. - Information target: Emotional distress, symptom timeline, physical symptom severity, triggers, and worsening factors. - Communication approach: Phrase questions in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, acknowledging her previous responses, to encourage more complete disclosure. - Expected value: These responses will clarify the emotional and systemic impact, help differentiate between possible diagnoses, and uncover any additional concerns she may not have explicitly shared.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned feeling only moderately distressed about your symptoms, but sometimes people underreport how worried or overwhelmed they feel.

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged female who was incidentally found to have an adrenal mass during imaging for unrelated symptoms. She exhibits physical features consistent with hyperandrogenism, including increased facial and chest hair and skin changes such as oiliness and weight gain. She reports experiencing fatigue and shakiness but likely underestimates the severity of these symptoms and may be experiencing more significant emotional distress than she acknowledges. She shows signs of confusion about the timeline and progression of her symptoms, which suggests they may have developed more rapidly or intensely than she perceives. Overall, her physical signs suggest a prominent hyperandrogenic state possibly related to adrenal pathology, with systemic and emotional symptoms that are probably more severe than her subjective reports reflect.1. Diagnosis: Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma Justification: The presence of an adrenal mass along with signs of hyperandrogenism (increased facial and chest hair), skin oiliness, and weight gain suggest a functional adrenal tumor secreting androgens. Carcinoma is a concern given the systemic symptoms and the size and incidental nature of the adrenal mass, and it can produce virilizing hormones, aligning with her physical findings.  2. Diagnosis: Adrenal Adenoma (Functional, Virilizing) Justification: An adrenal adenoma capable of secreting androgens fits the clinical picture given the hormonally active adrenal mass and hyperandrogenic features. Though typically benign, functional adenomas can cause similar symptoms, and it remains high among differentials.  3. Diagnosis: Exogenous Androgen Exposure or Related Endocrine Disorder Justification: Although less likely given the physical signs and adrenal mass, unintentional or unrecognized exogenous androgen exposure may produce hyperandrogenic features and systemic symptoms. Still, less consistent with the incidental adrenal mass.  4. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Justification: PCOS can cause hyperandrogenism and skin changes; however, it typically doesn\u2019t involve adrenal masses or such systemic features, making this less likely but still a differential.  5. Diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome (Adrenal or ACTH-dependent) Justification: The presence of skin oiliness and weight gain can occur in Cushing\u2019s syndrome, but significant virilization suggests androgen excess from adrenal sources rather than cortisol hypersecretion. It remains a less probable but possible diagnosis to consider given certain skin features.

Her responses are organized but tend toward brevity, suggesting hesitance. - Response style: Responses are mostly concise, with a tendency to minimize or mask feelings. She is cooperative but demonstrates subtle discomfort by softening her disclosures, which could limit the richness of her emotional insight.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Frequent hedging language, reluctance to fully elaborate on her emotional state, and subtle physical signs like neck rubbing or sighing suggest she\u2019s downplaying the emotional toll. - Minimization behaviors: She consistently downplays the severity (\"not that bad,\" \"kind of,\" \"a little\") when describing her feelings, suggesting she may consider her distress or worries as less serious than they are. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s little evidence she is exaggerating her symptoms; most language points to underreporting concerns. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitancy to discuss her emotional worries openly and reliance on vague expressions indicate potential discomfort or shame about vulnerability. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of memory or timeline distortions are present; her statements appear consistent. - Family influence: Limited information, but her guarded tone might suggest some external influence to control how openly she expresses distress.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is emotional masking/minimization, as she consciously or unconsciously underreports her emotional distress and severity of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, because while she shares some concerns, her subdued language and subtle physical cues suggest her internal distress is likely more intense than expressed. - Areas most affected: Her emotional response to her physical symptoms and the perceived impact on daily functioning are most biased; her physical complaints seem reasonably reported but her emotional state is under-voiced. - Reliability: Her self-reporting should be cautiously trusted. She presents as cooperative but underestimates her emotional and possibly physical distress, so clinicians should explore deeper and observe behavioral cues carefully.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of her emotional and psychological distress is probably undercommunicated, potentially masking deeper anxiety or frustration. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her level of internal turmoil about her body changes or fears of seriousness might be worse than she states. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be over-worried about the physical implications, but her expressed fears are likely less intense than her actual internal experience. - The true timeline of her emotional response may be more complex; she has developed some anxiety and stress level that she underestimates verbally, but physical cues suggest more internal distress than acknowledged.",

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of her emotional and psychological distress is probably undercommunicated, potentially masking deeper anxiety or frustration. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her level of internal turmoil about her body changes or fears of seriousness might be worse than she states. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be over-worried about the physical implications, but her expressed fears are likely less intense than her actual internal experience. - The true timeline of her emotional response may be more complex; she has developed some anxiety and stress level that she underestimates verbally, but physical cues suggest more internal distress than acknowledged.",

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged female who was incidentally found to have an adrenal mass during imaging conducted for unrelated symptoms. She exhibits physical signs consistent with hyperandrogenism, including increased facial and chest hair, oily skin, and weight gain. She reports experiencing fatigue and shakiness beginning approximately a few weeks prior, with a gradual onset that correlates with increased physical activity. She also expresses concern and confusion regarding her body changes and overall condition, indicating emotional distress that may be underrepresented. Her communication patterns\u2014using softening language and vague descriptors\u2014suggest she may be minimizing the severity of her symptoms and emotional impact, which could be more significant than apparent. Further assessment of her emotional well-being, sleep patterns, and additional systemic symptoms is indicated to fully characterize her clinical state.Adrenal androgen-secreting tumor ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses softening words like \"just,\" \"kind of,\" and \"a little,\" indicating an attempt to minimize her symptoms or discomfort. She also displays some emotional words like \"freaked out\" and \"more worried,\" reflecting genuine concern but within moderate limits. - Information flow: She responds primarily to direct questions, with some hesitation and hedging, showing a tendency to hold back full extent of her distress unless prompted. Her answers are organized but often contain vague qualifiers. - Response style: She tends to be concise, with responses that are direct but softened, possibly to avoid appearing more anxious or overwhelmed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of hedging and softening language suggests she may be concealing the full depth of her emotional response, possibly to avoid appearing overly vulnerable. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just not normal\" and \"kind of freaked out\" point to downplaying her physical and emotional symptoms, underestimating their impact. - Amplification patterns: She admits to feeling \"freaked out\" and \"more worried sometimes,\" indicating she experiences real worry, but she does not appear to overstate her symptoms beyond this. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; her tone is open, though she does seem somewhat anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: Some uncertainty about the timeline (\"maybe a few weeks ago\") reflects normal adolescent recall rather than cognitive impairment. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence on her responses; her disclosures appear genuine and solely based on her perception.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, as her language suggests she downplays her distress but does not deny symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as this could lead to underestimating her emotional and physical severity and affect clinical judgment. - Areas most affected: The emotional impact and possibly the severity of her physical discomfort; her verbal softening may hide deeper anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; her responses are honest but tend to understate her discomfort, so clinicians should explore further to gauge true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her full emotional distress level and the severity of her anxiety might be underreported, which could lead to under-assessment of her need for psychological support. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her physical symptoms' impact may be more significant than she admits, possibly masking severity. - Concerns probably amplified: She visibly admits to worry, which aligns with her sincere emotional response, so her worry is real but not exaggerated. - True timeline: The gradual development fits her description; her vague phrasing indicates some recall uncertainty rather than deception.  In summary, Emily's communication demonstrates mild to moderate minimization bias, with some hedging and vague language, especially around her emotional symptoms and severity. Clinicians should explore these areas further to ensure a more accurate understanding of her true state.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, focused questions to clarify the specific diagnostic features of hyperandrogenism and assess for any red flags that might suggest alternative diagnoses such as adrenal carcinoma or other endocrine disorders. Given her physical signs and recent onset of fatigue and shakiness, it\u2019s important to confirm the presence and severity of her androgen excess symptoms and explore possible systemic features. Since her emotional response might be minimized, I should include questions that gently delve into her level of distress and understanding. Exploring her sleep, appetite, and any other systemic symptoms could help detect broader endocrine issues. I also want to gauge her awareness and concerns about her body changes to prepare for shared decision-making.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused, specific questions about symptom progression, severity, and impact - Explicitly confirm key features of hyperandrogenism per diagnostic criteria - Explore her emotional understanding and concerns - Ask about other systemic symptoms to rule out broader endocrine issues - Use collaborative language to make her comfortable sharing more detailed info - Gather information on her readiness and practical considerations for treatment planning\nANSWER: Based on what you've shared so far, it seems like your body has been changing quite a bit recently, and your feelings of fatigue and shakiness have added to your worry. To help clarify, can you tell me if you've noticed any other changes, like changes in your voice, muscle weakness, or appetite? Also, how are your sleep patterns\u2014are you sleeping normally, or do you feel tired during the day? Lastly, how worried do you feel about these symptoms, and what are your main concerns about what's happening to your body? This will help us understand everything better before discussing the next steps together.",
