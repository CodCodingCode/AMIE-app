    "input": "A patient presenting with subjective feelings of abnormal sensations and an urgent sense of deterioration reports significant distress but without current physical examination data. The emotional charge may amplify her perception of severity, necessitating objective assessment of vital signs, hydration status, neurological function, and medication adherence to accurately determine her clinical condition.1. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder (e.g., panic attack or generalized anxiety disorder) Justification: The subjective feelings of abnormal sensations, urgent sense of deterioration, and significant distress without objective findings suggest a primary psychiatric process such as anxiety or panic, especially if emotional charge amplifies perception of severity.  2. Diagnosis: Somatic Symptom Disorder Justification: Persistent physical sensations and distress without clear organic findings, often with disproportionate emotional response, consistent with somatic symptom disorder in appropriate clinical context.  3. Diagnosis: Neurological disorder (e.g., peripheral neuropathy or seizure activity) Justification: Subjective abnormal sensations could reflect neurological causes such as neuropathy or focal neurological events, though absence of objective findings makes this less certain.  4. Diagnosis: Medication side effect or withdrawal Justification: If the patient is on medications or has recently changed medication regimens, side effects can manifest as abnormal sensations or feelings of deterioration.  5. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia or ischemia (e.g., angina or panic-related cardiovascular symptoms) Justification: Urgent sense of deterioration raises concern for cardiac etiology, especially if coupled with symptoms like chest discomfort or palpitations, though no physical findings are available.  6. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism or metabolic imbalance Justification: Metabolic disturbances can produce sensations of unease or sensory abnormalities, especially in elderly or those with underlying conditions.  7. Diagnosis: Psychogenic pseudoseizures or functional neurological disorder Justification: The subjective sensation of deterioration and distress, without physical findings, may reflect a dissociative or functional disorder.  8. Diagnosis: Substance intoxication or withdrawal Justification: Given the emotional charge and abnormal sensations, intoxication or withdrawal states (from alcohol, drugs, or medications) could lead to perceptual disturbances.  9. Diagnosis: Infectious causes (e.g., encephalitis or CNS infection) Justification: Although less likely without physical or neurological deficits or systemic signs, infections can present with sensory abnormalities and distress.  10. Diagnosis: Structural brain lesion (e.g., stroke, tumor) Justification: Serious \"can't miss\" diagnosis to consider, especially if neurologic deficits develop; but in the absence of findings or deficits, less likely initially.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged, urgent language (\"need help fast,\" \"really strange,\" \"worse today\") combined with straightforward symptom descriptions. She does not verbosity, but her tone emphasizes distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming about her symptoms, providing relevant details quickly, though her descriptions are more emotional than clinical, and she may omit contextual factors like her management lapses. - Response style: She responds directly but with a sense of urgency and concern, often elaborating on her fears, which shows openness but also emotional overlay influencing her reporting.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; her responses are open, though psychological distress might cause subtle underreporting of contextual issues like her medication adherence or substance use triggers. - Minimization behaviors: Little; she presents her symptoms as severe and worsening, not trivializing her condition. - Amplification patterns: Her tone\u2014and phrases like \"need help fast\"\u2014indicate amplification of her distress and perceived urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she openly discusses her condition and recreational drug use. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent; her timeline and symptom descriptions are clear and coherent. - Family influence: None; she lives alone and provides responses without external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, driven by her anxiety and fear, leading her to perceive and report her symptoms as more severe and urgent than perhaps the objective clinical picture. - Severity: Moderate; her honesty and clarity are intact, but emotional distress influences her perception of urgency and severity. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and urgency; less affected in factual reporting of physical symptoms. - Reliability: Generally reliable for physical symptom description but potentially inflated in perceived severity due to emotional state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not consciously report underlying factors such as inconsistent insulin use or recent drug intake that could worsen her condition. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of her metabolic derangement could be underestimated if her focus remains on her distress rather than clinical signs, but her descriptions indicate real trouble. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of serious outcomes and distress likely cause her to perceive her situation as more dire, possibly prompting overestimation of her risk status. - True timeline: The symptoms' progression seems consistent with her report; however, her emotional distress may intensify her perception of rapid deterioration.",
    "output": "THINKING: The goal here is to deepen understanding of the patient\u2019s experience with her symptoms, particularly their onset, how they have evolved, and what she perceives as contributing factors. Given her high distress and urgency, I need to encourage her to elaborate on her story without leading her, ensuring she feels heard and safe. Exploring her feelings about her symptoms and their impact can also clarify her perception of severity and help identify anxiety or other psychological components. Since her report is emotionally charged, I should phrase questions gently and openly to foster trust and openness.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Specific details about when her sensations started, what she thinks might worsen or improve them, and how she related these sensations to her daily life. - Diagnostic priorities: Understanding temporal progression to differentiate between acute and chronic phenomena, and to identify triggers or protective factors. - Patient factors: Her distress, emotional language, and clear articulation suggest readiness to share, but her urgency demands careful pacing. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, collect a detailed narrative about her symptoms\u2019 development, and elicit her perspective on what causes or alleviates her distress.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Primarily open-ended to allow her to narrate her experience and identify her perceptions. - Information target: Timeline of symptoms, perceived triggers, and changes over time. - Communication approach: Use empathetic and non-judgmental language to validate her experience and encourage elaboration. - Expected value: Gaining a detailed, personal account will help contextualize her symptoms, inform differential diagnosis, and establish rapport.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your sensations and feelings have changed over time\u2014from when they first started to how they\u2019re feeling today?

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a history of increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, and jitteriness, with reported decreased urine output today. Her account suggests dehydration and possible metabolic disturbance; however, her emotional state and communication style indicate her perception of rapid deterioration may be exaggerated. Objective assessment, including vital signs, hydration status, neurological examination, and pertinent laboratory tests, is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. Further evaluation is needed to confirm physical findings and determine severity.1. Diagnosis: Diabetes Mellitus (likely type 1 or type 2) Justification: Increased thirst and dry mouth are classic hyperglycemia symptoms; fatigue is common, and decreased urine output can occur with osmotic diuresis or dehydration secondary to hyperglycemia. 2. Diagnosis: Central Diabetes Insipidus Justification: The combination of increased thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, and jitteriness may indicate an inability to concentrate urine, suggestive of ADH deficiency. 3. Diagnosis: Dehydration due to other causes (e.g., inadequate fluid intake, gastrointestinal losses) Justification: The subjective perception of deterioration and dry mouth support dehydration, especially if intake has been low or losses increased. 4. Diagnosis: Borderline or early Hyperthyroidism Justification: Symptoms like jitteriness, fatigue, and increased thirst could be related to hyperthyroidism, which affects metabolic rate. 5. Diagnosis: Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) Justification: Fatigue, dehydration, dry mouth, and jitteriness may be signs of cortisol deficiency impairing fluid and electrolyte balance. 6. Diagnosis: Severe Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Jitteriness and perception of rapid deterioration could be exaggerated anxiety response; though less likely to cause dehydration. 7. Diagnosis: Hypercalcemia Justification: Fatigue, dehydration, and neuromuscular symptoms might suggest hypercalcemia, although decreased urine output is less characteristic. 8. Diagnosis: Chronic Kidney Disease or Acute Kidney Injury Justification: Decreased urine output suggests renal impairment, which can cause dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. 9. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia Justification: Jitteriness and fatigue with dry mouth can occur in hypoglycemia; however, increased thirst is less typical. 10. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Polydipsia Justification: Excessive water intake can cause hyponatremia and dehydration symptoms, but the decreased urine output suggests otherwise.  STOP HERE.STEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS: - Minimizing language: No clear minimization phrases like \"only\" or \"just,\" but she downplays the peeing volume today by saying she hasn't peed much, implying her perception of severity is based on her current experience. - Amplifying language: She emphasizes worsening, describing her symptoms as \"keeps getting worse,\" and feels \"more tired\" and \"kind of jittery,\" which indicates concern but not exaggeration. - Vague language: Uses \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" and \"sort of,\" which suggest some uncertainty or an attempt to sound less alarmed. - Emotional language: Her distress is evident in her description of worsening symptoms and concern about her health status.  STEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS: - Response length: Her answers are concise but contain emotional qualifiers that reflect her feelings. - Directness: She answers directly but incorporates emotional cues, which demonstrate her anxiety. - Information volunteering: She freely shares her symptom timeline and progression, suggesting trust in the scenario but possibly underestimating severity. - Consistency: Her responses are consistent about symptoms worsening and the timeline, indicating reliable self-reporting.  STEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION: - Information withholding signs: No overt signs; she seems willing to share details. - Minimization behaviors: She might downplay her peeing today (\"barely gone at all\") but aligns with her perception of severity. - Amplification patterns: Not evident; she describes worsening but avoids excessive exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of shame or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight hesitation, but overall her timeline remains coherent. - Family influence: None apparent; responses are personal and direct.  STEP 4 - BIAS SEVERITY ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight anxiety bias influencing her perception\u2014she perceives her symptoms as worsening and urgent, which aligns with her emotional state. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional distress may heighten perceived severity, though her descriptions are consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom progression is most biased by her anxiety, possibly amplifying her concern about how bad things really are. - Reliability: Overall, her self-report seems honest with symptoms consistent over responses, but emotional distress may lead to some overestimation of danger.  STEP 5 - CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully disclose all behaviors affecting her condition, like possible inconsistent medication adherence or substance use details influencing her symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: She might understate her current urination volume or severity, as she focuses on the worsening and discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about getting worse and needing urgent help are clear, which might inflate her actual clinical urgency. - True timeline: The progression is probably faster and more severe than she perceives, given the rapid deterioration typical of ketoacidosis.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has already described her current symptoms and her perception of worsening. To further understand her experience, I should explore how these symptoms affect her daily life and her level of concern, which will help gauge the impact and urgency. Additionally, understanding her perspective on what might have led to these symptoms could provide clues about associated behaviors or recent changes. Given her anxious tone, I want to approach this gently to foster rapport, encouraging her to share more about how her symptoms influence her routine and what worries her most.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: The eye symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling appearing over two days after physical activity are characteristic of conjunctivitis, especially conjunctivitis that can follow minor exposure or irritation. The absence of severe pain, vision changes, or systemic symptoms makes it the most probable. It explains the acute onset and bilateral eye involvement commonly seen in conjunctivitis.  2. Diagnosis: Traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage or minor trauma-related inflammation Justification: The recent soccer activity may have caused minor trauma leading to subconjunctival hemorrhage or irritation. The swelling and redness can correspond to minor trauma-induced hemorrhage or inflammation, fitting with the timing after physical exertion.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or superficial injury Justification: Playing soccer increases risk of accidental minor eye injuries, such as corneal abrasions, which can cause redness, tearing, and swelling. The quick onset and recent activity support this, although usually associated with foreign body sensation or pain, which was not mentioned.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely without mention of itching or a history of allergies, allergic conjunctivitis can present with redness and tearing. Its inclusion reflects common differential considerations; however, the lack of allergy-specific features reduces its rank.  5. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: The swelling and redness could suggest superficial eyelid infection, especially if eyelid swelling is prominent. Though less specific, it remains a consideration because of the clinical presentation, necessitating further assessment of systemic signs.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Lisa often employs vague and hedging words like \"kind of\" and \"probably,\" which hinder precise understanding. Her language alternates between emotional descriptors (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") and non-specific terms (\"off,\" \"bad,\" \"worse\"), indicating emotional distress but difficulty in articulating exact symptoms. - Information flow: She is somewhat guarded, providing minimal details unless prompted directly, and her responses are scattered with qualifiers. Her answers seem organized but limited, possibly due to anxiety or uncertainty. - Response style: Her style is concise and somewhat elliptical, with responses that seem designed to communicate essential feelings without elaboration. She shows some hesitations, reflecting discomfort or lack of clarity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague answers and hesitation about timing or severity suggest she might be omitting details, either intentionally or due to difficulty recalling. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her symptoms, for example, with \"really off\" instead of more precise severity, likely underestimating her actual clinical state. - Amplification patterns: Fears about collapsing could be exaggerated by anxiety, prompting her to overstate the potential danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her hedging and hesitation hint at some discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about symptom chronology indicates possible mild cognitive or emotional interference with Memory recall. - Family influence: Not evident; responses seem internally motivated with no external interjection.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be minimization compounded by anxiety-related uncertainty, which affects her clarity and objectivity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014 this bias could lead to underestimation of symptom severity and delaying urgent intervention, but she does acknowledge severity enough to seek help. - Areas most affected: Her description of symptom intensity and timeline are most biased, obscuring potential clinical urgency. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional state and language suggest she may underreport or misjudge some aspects, but her distress aligns broadly with a severe metabolic disturbance.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details of her dehydration level, electrolyte balance, and mental state may be understated, impairing full clinical assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be experiencing more profound disturbances (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, altered consciousness) than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of collapse may be driven by anxiety rather than actual physical decline, though caution is warranted. - True timeline: The progression might be more sudden or severe than her vague account indicates; her discomfort and hesitations suggest a more urgent deterioration.  This analysis indicates that while Lisa provides some useful information, her communication biases\u2014particularly minimization and vagueness\u2014necessitate a careful, comprehensive assessment to avoid underestimating her condition.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with acute-onset weakness, lightheadedness, dry mouth, increased thirst, and jitteriness, with symptoms reportedly worsening over the past day. The patient describes feeling very tired and \"off,\" with an abrupt onset of physical sensations, suggestive of significant dehydration and possible metabolic imbalance such as hyperglycemia or early diabetic ketoacidosis. Their communication indicates emotional distress and anxiety, which may lead to underreporting of symptom severity. No current laboratory data is available to confirm the metabolic status. Further assessment should include evaluation of medication adherence, blood glucose, and ketone levels, along with checking for additional symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. The clinical picture strongly warrants vigilant monitoring and investigation for severe dehydration and metabolic derangements, with recognition that the patient\u2019s perception may underestimate the true severity.1. Diagnosis: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Justification: The abrupt onset of symptoms, including weakness, dehydration signs (dry mouth, increased thirst), and the patient feeling \"off,\" strongly suggests DKA, especially in the context of hyperglycemia and metabolic imbalance. While laboratory data are pending, DKA typically presents with dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and ketonemia that align with the symptom picture.  2. Diagnosis: Severe Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) Justification: The presentation of acute weakness, dehydration, and altered mental state may also fit HHS, especially with dehydration and hyperglycemia. The absence of clear reporting of nausea or vomiting doesn't exclude HHS, but the rapid evolution suggests DKA more likely; nonetheless, HHS remains a strong consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Dehydration/Volume Depletion Justification: Dry mouth, increased thirst, lightheadedness, weakness, and fatigue are typical of dehydration, likely secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. It is a supportive diagnosis, but may coexist with DKA or HHS rather than being primary.  4. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Stress Reaction Justification: The patient's reported emotional distress and jitteriness could contribute to perceived symptom severity and hyperglycemia secondary to stress-induced hormonal changes; however, they do not fully explain the physical symptoms, but might exacerbate metabolic derangements.  5. Diagnosis: Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Hyponatremia or Potassium disturbance) Justification: Symptoms like weakness and lightheadedness could indicate electrolyte abnormalities common in diabetic crises. Although specific labs are absent, electrolyte disturbances are probable and contribute to the clinical picture.  STOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs softening and vagueness (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") in describing her symptoms, indicating a possible attempt to make her experience seem less alarming or to avoid judgment. Her emotional descriptors such as \"really tired,\" \"all jittery inside,\" and \"really off\" convey genuine concern and distress. - Information flow: She tends to answer questions directly but with hesitations and qualifies statements, suggesting a balance between honesty and a tendency to minimize or moderate her disclosures. She provides essential details but may withhold more uncomfortable aspects like medication adherence or substance use. - Response style: Her responses are fairly elaborative but scattered, reflecting anxiety and emotional overwhelm. She maintains a generally organized narrative but shows signs of distress that could impede clarity.

She appears to minimize the speed and severity of her symptoms due to fear or uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate, since she articulates key concerns but softens or downplays some aspects, especially regarding the rapid progression. - Areas most affected: The timeline of symptom worsening and her adherence behaviors are most biased, possibly underestimating the urgency. - Reliability: Fairly reliable for subjective feelings but potentially conservative on details that could escalate her clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Accurate details on her insulin adherence and substance use, both crucial for understanding her deterioration risk. - Symptoms probably minimized: The speed and severity of her decline might be understated; she may not be fully aware of the potential for rapid worsening. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about collapse and serious outcomes are evident, which could lead to heightened clinician concern that might overestimate her current physiological state. - True timeline: The progression overall appears genuine but may be slightly more abrupt or severe than described, considering her high distress and possible biases toward minimizing.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with an acute onset of increased thirst, dry mouth, fatigue, jitteriness, weakness, and lightheadedness. The symptoms reportedly worsened over the past day and began abruptly, suggesting a rapid progression of dehydration and potential metabolic imbalance. The patient communicates in vague, emotionally charged terms and hesitates to specify details about associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or mental confusion, indicating possible symptom minimization or withholding. Objective assessment should focus on signs of dehydration, mental status, and laboratory evaluation for hyperglycemia, ketone levels, and acid-base status to determine if early diabetic ketoacidosis or other metabolic disturbances are present. Further targeted questions are necessary to clarify the presence of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, as well as medication adherence, to inform appropriate management.Diabetic ketoacidosis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses vague, emotionally charged words like \"really off,\" \"feel right\" without precise symptom detail; avoids technical medical language, favoring lay descriptions. Demonstrates some hesitation, indicating possible discomfort or attempt to minimize. - Information flow: Tends to provide basic observations but is reluctant or unable to elaborate on specific symptoms when asked in detail, indicating withholding of certain information or difficulty articulating complex states. - Response style: Responses are generally brief and somewhat inconsistent\u2014e.g., describing symptoms as coming on \"suddenly\" but with limited detail about associated symptoms like nausea\u2014suggesting cautious sharing or uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Failing to disclose details about nausea, vomiting, or mental confusion when directly asked suggests withholding potentially worsening symptoms, possibly to avoid concern or due to shame/discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Describes feelings in broad, non-specific terms (\"really off\", \"just feels weird\") rather than detailed account, possibly underestimating severity. - Amplification patterns: No clear overstatement; her expressions seem more cautious and reserved, indicating underreporting rather than exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs; however, hesitation and incomplete answers imply some discomfort with full disclosure. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs; the inability to respond fully about symptoms like nausea or mental clarity might hint at mild confusion or reluctance to admit severity. - Family influence: No evidence of direct external influence; responses seem personally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization, evident from the tendency to give vague, non-specific responses and avoid discussing certain symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014important symptoms like nausea or mental status changes are not clearly communicated, impacting clinical judgment. - Areas most affected: Mental clarity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the full extent of severity are underreported. - Reliability: Self-report is somewhat compromised; cautious responses suggest she might be hiding or underplaying critical features of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about nausea, vomiting, confusion, and severity of mental status changes are probably underreported or withheld, which are crucial for diagnosing DKA. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity of her mental confusion or loss of consciousness signs may be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety and fear may lead her to overstate her distress or focus on feeling \"off\" rather than critical physical signs. - True timeline: The actual progression could be more rapid or severe than suggested\u2014her vague descriptions may conceal worsening metabolic derangements.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, focused questions to clarify the presence of key features of diabetic ketoacidosis, such as nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, and severity of symptoms, as there's concern that the patient might be minimizing or withholding information. It\u2019s important to gently elicit concrete details without leading or intimidating, considering her vague responses and potential discomfort. Given her hesitant communication, phrasing questions in a collaborative and open manner will help improve disclosure. The goal is to confirm or rule out signs of metabolic disturbance that require urgent management.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about gastrointestinal symptoms, mental status, level of alertness, and severity of lightheadedness. - Diagnostic priorities: Determine presence of nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, and severity of dehydration - all critical for diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). - Patient factors: Her vague, emotionally charged language and hesitation suggest a need for gentle, concrete, non-judgmental questioning. - Interview phase goals: Final clarification of symptoms, assessing for red flags, and establishing understanding of her current state to inform urgent management decisions.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, concrete questions about specific symptoms. - Information target: Nausea, vomiting, mental status changes, severity of dizziness, duration of symptoms, and any other associated signs she might not have mentioned. - Communication approach: Use simple, non-threatening language: \u201cCan you tell me if you\u2019ve felt nausea or vomited at all since your symptoms started?\u201d or \u201cHave you noticed whether your thinking has become more confused or if you\u2019ve felt more sleepy than usual?\u201d - Expected value: These questions will help confirm key diagnostic criteria for DKA or other metabolic emergencies and guide urgent treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"Earlier, you mentioned feeling really off and jittery, and I want to make sure I understand exactly what you're experiencing. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting since these symptoms began? Also, have you felt more confused, sleepy, or have you had any difficulty thinking clearly? These details are important to help us figure out the best way to support you now.\"",
