    "input": "An adult patient presents with a two-day history of right eye redness, swelling, and yellowish discharge. She reports discomfort with eye movement and touching the eye, indicating possible conjunctivitis or ocular inflammation. Although she expresses concern about worsening symptoms and potential vision loss, there is no current evidence of severe ocular pathology. She may be experiencing mild, unreported visual disturbances such as slight blurriness or floaters. Further assessment is necessary to evaluate for subtle visual changes, monitor symptom progression, and determine the severity of the ocular condition.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: The yellowish discharge, redness, and swelling are characteristic of bacterial conjunctivitis, which is highly prevalent and typically presents with purulent discharge and conjunctival inflammation.  2. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely given the yellow discharge, viral conjunctivitis can cause conjunctival redness and discomfort; often associated with watery discharge and possible lymphadenopathy.  3. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness with discharge could relate to inflammation of eyelid margins; typically causes crusting and irritation.  4. Diagnosis: Keratoconjunctivitis (corneal involvement) Justification: Discomfort with eye movement and touching, plus possible visual disturbances, may suggest keratitis, which requires prompt identification to prevent vision loss.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely given the yellow discharge, allergic reactions cause redness and itching, sometimes with mucus; usually bilateral and associated with allergy history.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Swelling, redness, discomfort with eye movement raise concern for orbital cellulitis, especially if symptoms worsen or systemic signs develop; a serious \"can't miss\" diagnosis.  7. Diagnosis: Episcleritis or Scleritis Justification: Ocular inflammation causing redness and discomfort; typically less associated with discharge but should still be considered.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Anterior) Justification: Discomfort with eye movement and visual changes can occur in uveitis; less common but important to consider, especially if symptoms progress.  9. Diagnosis: Traumatic Ocular Injury Justification: Although not indicated, trauma could cause similar signs; no history of trauma suggests lower likelihood.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign Body or Other Corneal Pathology Justification: Could cause localized inflammation and discomfort; none reported but should be kept in mind if symptoms persist or worsen.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific and emotionally charged language (\"really bothering me,\" \"pretty uncomfortable,\" \"hurts when I touch\"), emphasizing her distress but avoiding overly technical or clinical terminology. Overall, her language is straightforward and self-expressive. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with personal history and detailed symptom descriptions. She shares background proactively and responds directly, maintaining an organized and transparent flow of information. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and honest, with a tendency to expand on her concerns when prompted, demonstrating openness and cooperation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear signs; she seems willing to disclose all relevant details. - Minimization behaviors: Evidence is limited; she emphasizes her discomfort but does not dismiss or downplay the severity. - Amplification patterns: Her worry about potential vision loss could reflect anxious amplification, but her descriptions align reasonably with her symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she appears comfortable discussing her health. - Confusion/memory issues: No indications; her timeline of symptom progression is logical and consistent. - Family influence: No signs that external influence affects her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional concern and health-related anxiety influencing her perception, possibly causing slight overestimation of severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her openness and clarity suggest most information is accurate, but her worry might lead to some exaggeration of the risk level. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and potential complications; her concern about vision may be overemphasized. - Reliability: Fairly reliable; she provides consistent, detailed accounts, though her emotional state could slightly bias the perceived urgency.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might understate the rapidity of symptom onset or severity, or fail to mention other less obvious symptoms such as mild vision disturbances. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possibly the initial severity of discomfort or the true extent of discharge, if driven by worry or distraction. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of losing sight suggests over-concern; actual risk may be less severe than perceived. - True timeline: Her symptom progression appears plausible, but her heightened worry might lead to overestimating how quickly things worsened or the severity of damage.  This analysis indicates a generally cooperative patient who communicates openly but may be influenced by anxiety, particularly regarding potential serious outcomes.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to gather more detailed information about the patient's symptoms to understand their nature, severity, and impact. - Since she describes discomfort and redness, it's important to explore the progression and whether other symptoms like vision changes, pain, or systemic signs have occurred. - Her emotional concern about vision loss suggests that understanding her perception of her visual function is critical. - An open-ended question can help her express her experience more fully and reveal anything that hasn't been mentioned yet.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about the onset, progression, associated visual symptoms, and functional impact. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if there are signs pointing toward more serious conditions like keratitis or orbital cellulitis. - Patient factors: She uses clear, emotionally charged language, suggesting that an empathetic, reassuring tone will help her feel comfortable sharing more. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, encourage elaboration, and gather comprehensive symptom details to guide further assessment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Open-ended question to promote detailed storytelling. - Target: Symptom history, visual disturbances, progression, impact on daily life. - Approach: Gentle, empathetic, and patient-centered, acknowledging her worries while encouraging her to share her full experience. - Value: Will help identify features suggestive of specific diagnoses and gauge the severity and urgency.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about how you've been feeling with your eye\u2014when the redness and swelling first started, what changes you've noticed since then, and how this has been affecting your vision or daily activities.\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (e.g., viral) Justification: Common after activity, presenting with redness, tearing; unlikely to cause significant swelling but a primary cause to consider, especially with infectious exposure.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Sudden onset after physical activity, eye redness, tearing, possibly associated with trauma from soccer (e.g., fingernail or foreign body contact).  3. Diagnosis: Ocular trauma (e.g., contusion or subconjunctival hemorrhage) Justification: Recent sports activity involving contact, presenting with redness and swelling; trauma can cause hemorrhage or contusion.  4. Diagnosis: Hyphema Justification: Bleeding into anterior chamber due to trauma; redness and swelling after soccer heighten suspicion; may be less obvious without eye pain details.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Presents with redness, tearing, swelling; less likely due to recent trauma but possible if pre-existing allergies.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Inflammation within the eye; presents with redness and tearing but less likely acutely post-exercise without other symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Usually causes eye pain, redness, tearing; less likely in young individual without additional symptoms but important to consider.  8. Diagnosis: Ocular foreign body Justification: Contact sports can cause foreign body implantation leading to irritation, redness, tearing; trauma context supports this.  9. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness around the eye, often after trauma or minor skin breach; signs may include eyelid swelling.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital fracture with orbital edema Justification: Trauma from sports may cause fracture leading to swelling, redness, and restricted eye movement; less likely without mention of diplopia or enophthalmos, but important to consider.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, descriptive language indicating real concern, such as \"really bothering me,\" \"red,\" \"swollen,\" and \"uncomfortable.\" Her responses are organized, showing a logical flow of information, reflecting clarity and honesty. There is an emotional component, but it appears proportionate to her discomfort rather than exaggerated. - Information flow: She is quite forthcoming, volunteering relevant details like symptom onset, progression, and impact on her daily life. Her responses are consistent and organized, signaling good recall and minimal withholding. - Response style: She elaborates on her feelings without digression, providing enough detail to inform assessment while maintaining clarity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None evident; she seems open and willing to share all relevant information, especially about the progression and impact of symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Unlikely; her detailed descriptions suggest she perceives her symptoms as significant. - Amplification patterns: Slight concern about severity or potential outcomes (like vision loss), possibly influenced by anxiety, may slightly inflate her perceived risk but are rooted in her genuine distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; she is open about her symptoms and history. - Confusion/memory issues: None observed; her timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: No evidence in her responses; her disclosure appears personal rather than influenced by others.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification of severity, particularly regarding fears of vision loss; also possible valorization of her discomfort due to distress. - Severity: Mild to moderate\u2014her concern is genuine, but her focus on worst-case outcomes may slightly overstate actual risk at this stage. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity and potential complications, like vision loss, are most biased, driven by emotional state rather than evidence-based assessment. - Reliability: Overall, her self-reporting can be trusted but should be supplemented with clinical examination to accurately gauge severity, as her concern may influence perception.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may be hesitant to thoroughly discuss her sexual history or emotional impact, which could be relevant for diagnosis or counseling. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident here; her detailed description suggests she is accurately reporting her discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about blindness and severity may be slightly exaggerated due to anxiety, potentially leading to overestimation of progression risks. - True timeline: The reported timeline appears accurate\u2014symptoms started a couple of days ago and have worsened; no reason to doubt this based on her responses.  Overall, Maria's communication is honest and detailed, with some influence of anxiety potentially amplifying her concerns about severity and outcomes. Her responses indicate reliable self-reporting, though clinical correlation is necessary to confirm the severity and rule out overreaction.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The question should now aim to explore additional aspects of her eye symptoms that haven't been covered yet, such as how her overall activity or environment might have contributed, or how her symptoms are affecting her emotional well-being. - Since she has described the physical aspects and timeline, I want to understand her personal experience more deeply, including her feelings about the situation and any worries that haven't been voiced. - It\u2019s important to build rapport and show genuine concern while gently guiding her to share more about her perspective. - This stage aims to foster trust and gather qualitative information that may influence understanding of the symptom severity, impact, and any psychosocial factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type: Open-ended to encourage elaboration. - Target: How her symptoms affect her daily life, emotional state, or any additional context she might see as relevant. - Approach: Use gentle language that validates her experience and emphasizes curiosity rather than interrogation. - Value: To gain richer insight into her personal impact and possible underlying concerns that influence her perception.\nANSWER: \"That sounds quite uncomfortable.

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a two-day history of conjunctivitis characterized by redness, swelling, purulent discharge, and eye pain. Physical exam may reveal conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid swelling, and discharge consistent with conjunctivitis. Pain appears to be affecting daily activities, but physical severity may be less intense than patient reports. Visual acuity is expected to be mildly affected or within normal limits; no systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise are currently reported. The progression over two days suggests an infectious conjunctivitis rather than an emergent ophthalmic emergency. Further assessment, including a physical examination and inquiry about vision change and systemic symptoms, is necessary to confirm diagnosis and rule out other ocular or systemic conditions.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: The presence of purulent discharge, rapid onset over two days, redness, swelling, and eye pain strongly suggest bacterial conjunctivitis, which is common in adults and typically causes such symptoms. It explains the purulence and rapid progression.  2. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: Viral conjunctivitis often presents with redness, watery discharge, and mild discomfort. Although purulent discharge is less typical, it can occasionally be present, and the acute onset is characteristic. It remains a leading cause of infectious conjunctivitis.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Symptoms include conjunctival redness and swelling; however, typically associated with itchy eyes and bilateral involvement, often with a history of allergies. The absence of itching or systemic allergy signs makes this less likely but still plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Keratoconjunctivitis (e.g., adenoviral) Justification: Given the description, adenoviral conjunctivitis (a subtype of viral conjunctivitis) could cause similar symptoms, especially with vesicular conjunctivitis and preauricular lymphadenopathy, which may not be specified here but is typical.  5. Diagnosis: Chalazion or Hordeolum Justification: These represent eyelid lesions with swelling but usually do not cause conjunctival redness or purulent discharge from the conjunctiva itself. They are less likely given the described diffuse conjunctivitis symptoms, but included for completeness as eyelid infections.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific, emotionally charged language (\"really bothering,\" \"scared I might lose my sight\") indicating high anxiety. She does not employ minimizations; instead, she emphasizes severity. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with details, volunteering relevant background, and maintains a consistent focus on her symptoms and fears. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and emotionally expressive, revealing her distress and concern. She emphasizes how symptoms impact her daily life.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None apparent; she is openly sharing her concerns and history. - Minimization behaviors: Absent; her descriptions tend to magnify her symptoms and fears. - Amplification patterns: Evident in her focus on potential vision loss and describing pain as \"really hurting,\" which suggests her anxiety may inflate her perception of severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: Not evident from her responses; she seems to speak about herself directly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification bias, as she seems to overstate the severity and danger of her symptoms driven by fear of vision loss. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given her emotionally intense language and focus on worst-case outcomes. - Areas most affected: Her appraisal of symptom severity, pain level, and potential blindness. - Reliability: Moderate; her physical descriptions are likely accurate, but her perceived threat level is heightened by anxiety, requiring careful clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be underreporting less concerning symptoms like mild pain or minor discomfort, but her focus seems to be abnormally intense, possibly leading her to overstate her condition. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her actual physical pain might not be as severe as she conveys; her emotional state inflates perceived severity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of blindness and severe damage is overemphasized compared to clinical likelihood, but it is rooted in real distress. - True timeline: The progression, as reported, seems consistent; her emotional response may be amplifying perceived rapid worsening.

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a two-day history of redness, swelling, and purulent discharge from the eye, accompanied by ocular pain and discomfort. The physical findings are consistent with conjunctivitis, most likely infectious, with objective signs including conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema, and purulent discharge. The patient denies any current visual disturbances such as blurriness or spots, although her emotional concern about potential vision loss may influence her perception of symptom severity. There are no systemic symptoms like fever or malaise reported. Communication patterns suggest her subjective experience might be amplified by anxiety, but physical signs point to localized conjunctival inflammation without evidence of systemic illness. Further examination, including visual acuity testing and detailed ocular assessment, is necessary to confirm the severity and rule out other ocular conditions.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: The presence of purulent discharge, rapid onset (2 days), conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema, and ocular pain are classic features of bacterial conjunctivitis. The patient's symptoms are localized with no systemic signs, strongly supporting bacterial etiology as the most probable.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Viral conjunctivitis often presents with redness, watery discharge, and discomfort. Although less likely given the purulent discharge, it remains common and can occasionally cause similar presentation, especially in early stages, but less fitting due to the purulence seen here.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Typically presents with itching, bilateral redness, and watery discharge. Less likely here because of the purulent discharge and pain, but still possible if allergic reaction coexists.  4. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Presents with eyelid swelling and redness, potentially with mild pain, but lacks systemic illness or signs of deeper tissue involvement. Less probable without systemic symptoms or signs of tissue abscess.  5. Diagnosis: Corneal ulcer Justification: Presents with pain and redness, potential discharge, and visual changes. Less likely here due to no reported visual disturbances, and conjunctivitis symptoms dominate.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses direct but slightly hedged language like \"kind of scared\" and \"really hard to do my usual stuff,\" balancing honesty with emotional modulation. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming when asked direct questions; she spends elaborating on symptoms but waits for prompts to share details. - Response style: Her responses are detailed and coherent, showing she\u2019s open but manages her emotional expression, avoiding panic.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt signs; she seems willing to disclose her full experience. - Minimization behaviors: Slight downplaying with phrases like \"just keeps getting worse\" may mask the actual severity level. - Amplification patterns: Her expressed fears about losing her sight could be exaggerated emotionally rather than physically. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; her tone is open and casual. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; her timeline and details are consistent. - Family influence: No apparent influence on responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, primarily through expressed fears about vision loss. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional concern could lead to overestimation of threat and influence how she perceives her symptoms. - Most affected areas: Her perception of symptom severity and outcome fears. - Reliability: Generally reliable for physical symptoms, but her emotions may bias her perceived threat level.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully recognize or report subtle symptoms like slight itching, mild visual fluctuations, or early signs of worsening. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical findings appear consistent, but her high anxiety may lead her to overlook or understate mild symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of losing sight are likely driven by anxiety, possibly inflating her perceived risk. - True timeline: The progression aligns with her account\u2014initial redness and discharge worsening over days\u2014so her timeline appears accurate, though her emotional response may influence her perception of urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need to clarify whether the patient has experienced any visual changes or worsening symptoms, which could suggest complications like corneal involvement or more severe infection. Also, need details about associated symptoms such as itching or sensitivity that help differentiate infectious from allergic conjunctivitis. - Diagnostic priorities: Establish whether the redness and discharge are primarily purulent and unilateral, pointing towards bacterial conjunctivitis, or if watery discharge and bilateral involvement suggest viral or allergic causes. Also, explore for signs of systemic or deeper tissue involvement to rule out cellulitis or corneal issues. - Patient factors: The patient provides detailed responses but tends to emotionally amplify her concerns, especially about vision loss; questions should be empathetic and clarifying to ensure accurate symptom characterization without increasing anxiety. - Interview phase goals: Narrow the differential to confirm whether bacterial conjunctivitis remains most likely, identify any signs suggestive of complications, and assess the severity to guide treatment urgency.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, yet open enough to capture any subtle or new symptoms, particularly regarding vision and associated ocular changes. - Information target: Visual disturbances, severity of eye pain, presence of itching or light sensitivity, progression of symptoms, and any signs of deeper or systemic infection. - Communication approach: Phrase questions compassionately to encourage honest responses, acknowledging her fears but gently guiding her to specify symptoms that help refine the diagnosis. - Expected value: Clarify whether her current presentation is purely conjunctivitis or if there are red flags indicating a need for urgent intervention or different diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned before that the main issues are redness, swelling, and discharge, but just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurriness or spots, or has your eye been particularly sensitive to light?

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a two-day history of conjunctival redness, eyelid swelling, and mucopurulent ocular discharge, consistent with infectious conjunctivitis. She reports ocular pain that she describes as steady and discomforting, along with light sensitivity and intermittent blurriness of vision. While she denies systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise, her cautious and minimized communication style suggests that her actual symptom severity may be greater than reported. Objective findings are expected to include conjunctival hyperemia, eyelid edema, and purulent conjunctival discharge. Given her guarded responses, further examination focusing on visual acuity, pain assessment, and exposure history is warranted to accurately determine the severity and potential underlying cause.Bacterial Conjunctivitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria often uses vague or mild descriptors (\"just uncomfortable,\" \"kinda scared,\" \"sometimes blurry\") that soften her actual distress level, potentially obscuring the true severity of her symptoms. Her emotional expressions reveal concern but are coupled with minimizing language that underplays the physical impact. - Information flow: She tends to provide surface-level information unless specifically prompted, demonstrating a tendency to withhold details about sensitive topics like her sexual history and recent travel. Her responses are organized but cautious, often avoiding elaboration. - Response style: Her responses are generally concise, with brief elaborations mainly after probing questions. She rarely volunteer additional context, indicating discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids elaborating on her sexual history and recent travel, possibly due to perceived stigma or discomfort. She responds with minimal details unless asked directly, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose relevant background. - Minimization behaviors: Use of phrases like \"just uncomfortable,\" \"maybe not that bad\" point to downplaying her symptoms, possibly to avoid perceived overreaction or embarrassment. - Amplification patterns: Not strongly present; she appears more cautious than exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Lack of explicit signs, but her tendency to understate or hedge certain details suggests subtle discomfort with discussing sensitive information. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence. - Family influence: No explicit evidence of influence affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The key bias is minimization, particularly of symptom severity and personal history, likely driven by embarrassment, privacy concerns, or anxiety about potential implications. - Severity: Moderate\u2014the underdisclosure could lead to underestimating risk factors, but she provides enough symptom detail to inform initial assessment. - Areas most affected: sexual history and recent travel details, which are relevant to her infection risk but are underdisclosed. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-report provides useful but potentially incomplete information, warranting cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: full extent of risky behaviors, prior infections, or other relevant exposures; details about her sexual partners and exact travel circumstances. - Symptoms probably minimized: the true severity of her visual disturbance or pain may be greater than reported, given her soft language. - Concerns probably amplified: her fear of losing sight might be an over-internalized worry rather than reflecting actual risk, though valid given her symptoms. - True timeline: progression might be more rapid or severe than she admits; her hedging suggests the evolution of symptoms could be underestimated.  Overall, Mar\u00eda's communication exhibits a moderate level of minimization and guarded disclosure, which could impact clinical assessment accuracy. Effective engagement should involve reassurance and carefully targeted questions to uncover unspoken concerns or relevant history.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We still need to confirm whether her symptoms fulfill the full diagnostic criteria for bacterial conjunctivitis, specifically regarding the severity of discharge, presence of eyelid edema, and any systemic or exposure factors. - Diagnostic priorities: Ruled out other causes like viral conjunctivitis or allergic conjunctivitis, which may present similarly but differ in management. Also, need to assess for signs of more serious ocular conditions like keratitis or uveitis. - Patient factors: Mar\u00eda tends to minimize or hedge her symptoms, so questions should be clear, direct, and gentle to elicit more accurate information without causing alarm or defensiveness. - Interview phase goals: Confirm her symptom severity, ensure no red flags like visual loss or systemic illness, and gauge her understanding and concerns to prepare for potential diagnosis confirmation.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions that clarify the severity and progression of her symptoms, along with confirmatory queries based on her responses. - Information target: Specific details about the nature of her discharge, eye pain characteristics, visual symptoms, and any recent exposure or risk factors. - Communication approach: Phrase questions in a non-judgmental, open-ended manner that reassures her she can honestly share her experience, while guiding towards specific symptom details. - Expected value: This will help solidify whether her presentation matches bacterial conjunctivitis criteria or if there are red flags suggesting a more serious pathology requiring different management or urgent referral.\nANSWER: \"Maria, I appreciate you sharing your experience so far. To make sure I understand the full picture, can you tell me more about how your eye feels right now\u2014has the redness and swelling been constant, or does it come and go? Also, regarding the discharge\u2014has it been thick, greenish, or more watery? And have you noticed if your vision is blurry or if there's any increase in light sensitivity? Lastly, do you remember any recent exposure\u2014like being around someone with a similar eye infection, or any recent activities that might have caused this? These details will help me confirm the best way to support you.\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Maria often uses vague or mild descriptors (\"just uncomfortable,\" \"kinda scared,\" \"sometimes blurry\") that soften her actual distress level, potentially obscuring the true severity of her symptoms. Her emotional expressions reveal concern but are coupled with minimizing language that underplays the physical impact. - Information flow: She tends to provide surface-level information unless specifically prompted, demonstrating a tendency to withhold details about sensitive topics like her sexual history and recent travel. Her responses are organized but cautious, often avoiding elaboration. - Response style: Her responses are generally concise, with brief elaborations mainly after probing questions. She rarely volunteer additional context, indicating discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose.
