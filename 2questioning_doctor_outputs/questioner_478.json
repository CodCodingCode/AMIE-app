    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Recent physical activity (soccer) increases risk of foreign body, typically presenting with redness, tearing, swelling, and possibly pain or sensation of something in the eye.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or allergic) Justification: Common cause of eye redness and tearing; however, less likely to cause significant swelling or occur immediately after sports without other systemic signs.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma during soccer could result in a corneal scratch, causing redness, tearing, and discomfort; symptoms often onset shortly after injury.  4. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness suggest localized infection near the eyelid; recent activity and trauma increase risk, but less systemic signs are typical.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid contusion Justification: Impact during sports can produce swelling and bruising around the eyelid, mimicking other inflammatory signs.  6. Diagnosis: Hordeolum (stye) Justification: Could present with redness and swelling, but typically involves localized eyelid swelling and tenderness; less directly related to recent activity unless trauma caused secondary infection.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Serious infection involving the orbit, usually with pain, proptosis, double vision, and systemic symptoms; less likely in short timeframe without deeper symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma (unlikely) Justification: Symptoms of redness and tearing could match, but typically presents with pain, haloes, and increased intraocular pressure, usually in older or predisposed patients.  9. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes eye redness and tearing, but usually involves pain, photophobia, and decreased vision; less related to recent sports trauma.  10. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Chronic eyelid inflammation causing redness and swelling; less likely to have rapid onset after physical activity.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses straightforward, emotionally charged language (\"really yellow,\" \"worse every day\") with some vague descriptors (\"kind of a dull ache\"), indicating a mixture of genuine concern and possible minimization. - Information flow: He volunteers key symptoms efficiently but is reluctant to share background details unless prompted, showing selective disclosure likely influenced by his discomfort or anxiety. - Response style: Responses are concise yet emotionally laden; he emphasizes worsening and distress, possibly to elicit empathy and reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance to mention smoking history and family cancer history unless asked suggests reluctance or forgetfulness, potentially hiding relevant risk factors. - Minimization behaviors: Symptoms like \"kind of a dull ache\" or \"not much of an appetite\" could be understated, possibly to avoid sounding alarmist or to tone down perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: Phrases such as \"worse every day\" and \"I feel worse\" may reflect exaggeration influenced by anxiety, serving to reinforce his distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoidance or sidelong glances when discussing weight loss point to mild discomfort, possibly shame or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of disorientation; timeline of symptoms appears coherent. - Family influence: Not evident from the interaction.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is anxious amplification\u2014his focus on worsening symptoms and desire for reassurance heighten perceived severity. - Severity: Moderate, as anxiety influences the presentation but does not completely distort facts. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of pain and distress are most affected by bias; background risk factors may be underreported, affecting risk assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; self-report is influenced by anxiety-related biases, so some details may be overstated or understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Background risk factors like detailed smoking history and family cancer history may be concealed or minimized, impacting full risk stratification. - Symptoms probably minimized: Pain severity may be understated, and systemic symptoms like weight loss could be more profound than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: His sense of urgency and distress seem magnified by anxiety, possibly overstating current severity. - True timeline: Symptoms' progression is likely gradual; the emphasis on rapid worsening may reflect anxiety-driven exaggeration rather than actual rapid decline.",
    "output": "THINKING: Using systematic reasoning, I recognize the importance of exploring the patient's overall experience with the eye symptoms and any related factors that might influence diagnosis and management. Given his emotional tone and potential anxiety, I want to establish trust and gather detailed information about how these symptoms have affected his daily life, as well as any other related concerns or background health details he might not volunteer spontaneously. Since he mentioned the onset after playing soccer and worsening over days, I will also gently probe into possible trauma, risk factors, and his understanding.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about any recent eye trauma, other systemic symptoms, health behaviors (like smoking), and family history are missing and could influence differential diagnosis. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the nature of symptoms and context to differentiate between foreign body, infection, trauma, or other causes. - Patient factors: His emotional language and possible anxious presentation suggest a need for gentle, validating questions that do not escalate worry. - Interview phase goals: Obtain a detailed, open-ended description of symptoms and their impact, while fostering rapport and understanding his perspective.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage elaboration on symptom experience and contextual factors. - Information target: Symptom development, triggers, associated features, perceived severity, functional impact. - Communication approach: Frame the question empathetically, acknowledging his distress, and use language that invites honest sharing. - Expected value: Will provide insight into his subjective experience, reveal potential triggers or systemic issues, and guide further focused exploration.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how these eye symptoms have been affecting you day to day? For example, when you notice the redness or the discomfort, what kinds of things have you found yourself doing differently or avoiding?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral) Justification: The tearing and redness suggest conjunctival inflammation; viral conjunctivitis is common after exposure to outdoor or crowded settings like sports. Symptoms are acute and bilateral, fitting typical conjunctivitis presentation.  2. Diagnosis: Ocular trauma (corneal abrasion or superficial injury) Justification: Recent soccer activity raises suspicion of minor trauma leading to corneal abrasion, causing redness, swelling, tearing, and discomfort. Symptoms often onset after injury.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Characterized by redness, tearing, and swelling; however, less likely given recent onset post-activity and absence of itching or history of allergies.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Could cause localized redness/swelling following strenuous activity or trauma; onset two days ago may fit, but usually presents as a distinct red patch, less tearing.  5. Diagnosis: Anterior uveitis Justification: Presents with redness and tearing; though less likely given the recent sports activity, it remains a differential for inflammatory eye conditions needing prompt recognition.  6. Diagnosis: Ethmoid or nasal sinus infection (sinusitis) Justification: Sinus infection can cause periocular swelling and redness; less common acutely after sports but possible.  7. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Presents with eyelid swelling and redness; recent activity increases suspicion of trauma allowing infection entry, but systemic signs unlikely.  8. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: More severe, with significant swelling and potential proptosis; less likely without systemic symptoms or significant trauma.  9. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Causes redness and eye pain, but typically presents with decreased vision, halos, and very painful eye, which are not described here.  10. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: Can cause eye redness and tearing; usually associated with corneal lesions, but less likely without previous history or pain description.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices tend toward emotional and concern-driven rather than clinical or precise; he uses terms like \"really yellow\" and \"feel worse every day,\" emphasizing his worry. - He provides organized, straightforward information when asked directly but may withhold or understate emotional reactions; he tends to focus on physical symptoms rather than emotional impact. - His response style is mostly direct but limited in emotional detail; he hesitates slightly when discussing his feelings, indicating some discomfort sharing emotional distress openly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Evidence of information withholding is subtle but includes limited expression of emotional fear; he states \"I get kind of scared\" but doesn\u2019t elaborate further, possibly feeling ashamed or unsure. - Minimization behaviors appear through his emphasis on feelings of not feeling hungry and only describing the numerical weight loss without elaborating on how it affects his daily life. - Amplification patterns are present in his focus on the potential seriousness (\"something really serious\") and concern about cancer spread, which may be exaggerated by health anxiety. - Embarrassment or shame is subtly indicated by his brief mention of fear without elaboration, suggesting discomfort with emotional vulnerability. - No obvious confusion or memory issues are noted; responses are consistent. - There's no clear evidence of family influence affecting his responses; the focus remains on personal health fears.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - The primary bias is anxious amplification, where he magnifies the threat of serious illness, particularly cancer, likely driven by concern and uncertainty. - Severity is moderate; while he accurately reports physical symptoms, his emotional responses are heightened and may distort his perception of danger. - The most biased areas are his emotional reactions and perceived severity of symptoms, with physical descriptions relatively factual. - Self-reporting on physical symptoms is fairly reliable; however, emotional bias could lead to overestimating danger.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information probably involves the depth of his emotional distress, specific catastrophic thoughts, and how his anxiety influences his perception of symptoms. - His physical symptoms are likely more severe or distressing than he reports, especially given the rapid progression implied. - His worries about severity and spread are probably exaggerated, fueled by anxiety rather than purely factual concern. - The true progression of symptoms may be faster or more intense, but his emotional state might cause him to perceive it as milder or more manageable than it actually is.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with recent-onset jaundice, fatigue, decreased appetite, and abdominal discomfort, with symptoms gradually worsening over several weeks. He reports feeling weaker and more tired, with an associated dull and sharp abdominal pain. While he perceives these symptoms as severe and expresses significant concern about serious illnesses such as cancer, his emotional distress may be amplifying his perception of severity. Physical examination findings are not available at this time, and further systematic assessment is needed to evaluate for signs of systemic illness, liver dysfunction, or other underlying pathology. Additional history and examination are required to clarify the full clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Liver cirrhosis with decompensation Justification: The slow progression of jaundice, worsening fatigue, and abdominal discomfort are characteristic of chronic liver disease, potentially in a decompensated state. Although physical exam findings are not yet described, the systemic symptoms suggest underlying chronic pathology, and cirrhosis can cause jaundice due to impaired bilirubin clearance. The patient\u2019s concern about serious illness and systemic symptoms align with a chronic process rather than acute transient causes.  2. Diagnosis: Biliary obstruction (e.g., gallstone or malignancy) Justification: Jaundice with abdominal discomfort suggests possible biliary obstruction, especially if caused by stones or tumors blocking the common bile duct. The gradual worsening aligns with a slowly enlarging obstructive process, and the systemic symptoms could reflect cholestasis-associated malaise.  3. Diagnosis: Hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Justification: The concern about serious illnesses such as cancer and the gradual symptom progression raise suspicion for primary liver malignancy. These can present with jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort, often in the context of underlying cirrhosis, which supports this as a plausible diagnosis.  4. Diagnosis: Viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C) Justification: Viral hepatitis causes insidious onset jaundice, fatigue, and anorexia, fitting the pattern of recent hepatic inflammation. Symptoms are often gradual and systemic, and the concern about serious illness could reflect chronic hepatitis with developing cirrhosis or acute exacerbation.  5. Diagnosis: Liver metastases from an extrinsic primary tumor Justification: Although less common, metastatic disease to the liver can cause secondary jaundice and systemic symptoms. The patient\u2019s concern about serious illness could be consistent with underlying malignancy elsewhere, with hepatic involvement as a manifestation.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged phrases (\"scary,\" \"really bad\") intertwined with somewhat vague descriptions (\"kind of scary,\" \"sometimes sharp\"), suggesting heightened anxiety but an attempt at clarity. - Information flow: Mostly forthcoming with symptom descriptions; however, emotional fears are expressed more tentatively, indicating openness but also internal distress. - Response style: Nevertheless, the responses are elaborative and organized, showing that he\u2019s trying to communicate his worries clearly, even if his emotional state influences his tone.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; he readily discusses symptoms and fears, indicating openness. - Minimization behaviors: There\u2019s little evidence of symptom minimization; he seems to emphasize severity but does not downplay symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Yes; his concern about \"something really bad\" and \"scary\" reflects emotional amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation or tentative language regarding fears suggests some discomfort discussing emotional fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence; his timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Not indicated; responses are internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, especially regarding prognosis and severity concerns. - Severity: Moderate; his anxiety appears to significantly color his perception of future outcomes but does not distort factual symptom reporting. - Areas most affected: His fears about cancer spread and prognosis, which may lead to overly catastrophic thinking. - Reliability: Fair; physical symptom reports are accurate but emotionally heightened, so some overestimation of threat is likely.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possibly his coping mechanisms or social support details; he seems primarily focused on fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not evident; he emphasizes symptoms strongly. - Concerns probably amplified: Yes; fears of cancer metastasis and dire prognosis are exaggerated by his anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms appear to have a gradual course; his report is consistent, suggesting valid chronology but heightened emotional reaction.  # Short Answer",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to explore the character and quality of his jaundice further, as it can help differentiate between liver failure, biliary obstruction, and malignancy. - Given his concern about \u201csomething really bad,\u201d I should assess for additional systemic symptoms that may suggest malignancy or advanced liver disease. - His emotional distress may amplify perceived severity, so it's important to distinguish what symptoms are objectively present versus what may be influenced by anxiety. - Understanding the progression timeline of specific symptoms, especially pain and jaundice, will help clarify etiology. - In this context, asking about associated symptoms like stool and urine changes can provide clues about cholestasis or liver function. - To address his fears directly, I might inquire if he\u2019s experienced any fever, chills, or recent weight changes, which are features of infections or malignancy.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused questions about systemic features (e.g., fever, rash, joint pains) that would point toward infectious or autoimmune causes. - Open-ended questions about the timeline and evolution of symptoms to clarify progression. - Gentle inquiry into his understanding of symptoms to assess health literacy and emotional impact. - The goal is to elicit specific information about associated systemic symptoms and clarify his emotional perceptions.\nANSWER: You mentioned that your jaundice has been gradually worsening over a few weeks, and you're feeling more tired.

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a several-week history of jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and sclera, along with increasing fatigue, decreased appetite, dark urine, and pale stool. The patient reports mild abdominal discomfort with occasional sharp episodes but denies fever, rash, or joint pains. Physical signs such as jaundice are identified through examination, though further assessment is necessary to evaluate for hepatomegaly or other signs of liver involvement. The patient's concerns about serious illness, such as cancer, appear influenced by emotional distress, which may heighten perceived symptom severity. Additional systemic symptoms could be present but are likely underreported due to anxiety. Objective findings and systematic evaluation are required to determine underlying pathology and severity.1. Diagnosis: Viral Hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis A, B, or C) Justification: The several-week duration of jaundice coupled with systemic symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, dark urine, and pale stool is typical of viral hepatitis. It is a common cause of prolonged jaundice in adults and can present with mild abdominal discomfort. The absence of other systemic autoimmune features makes hepatitis a highly probable, primary hepatocellular source of injury.  2. Diagnosis: Biliary Obstruction (e.g., Gallstones, Cholestasis) Justification: The presence of jaundice with dark urine and pale stool suggests cholestasis. Mild abdominal discomfort with occasional sharp episodes could indicate transient obstruction, possibly from gallstones or biliary sludge. While less likely than hepatitis without evident risk factors, it remains high on the differential because of cholestatic pattern of symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Alcoholic or Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Justification: Fatigue and jaundice over several weeks can also be caused by underlying chronic liver disease, such as NASH or alcoholic hepatitis, especially if there is a risk factor history (not explicitly given, but presumed to be present or possible). These conditions can cause progressive hepatocellular injury with subclinical progression initially.  4. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Hepatitis Justification: Although typically associated with autoimmune features or joint/rash symptoms, autoimmune hepatitis remains a differential due to systemic illness component and chronicity. The patient\u2019s lack of classic autoimmune signs makes this less likely but still possible, especially in the context of ongoing liver inflammation.  5. Diagnosis: Liver or Biliary Malignancy (e.g., Hepatocellular carcinoma or Cholangiocarcinoma) Justification: The concern about serious illness such as cancer indicates suspicion. The prolonged jaundice and systemic symptoms could represent an underlying malignancy. Although less common in initial presentation, it must be considered particularly if risk factors are present or if other causes are ruled out.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged language (\"scared,\" \"worried,\" \"terrible\") which highlights high anxiety levels. While mostly specific in describing symptoms (yellow eyes, weight loss, stomach pain), some responses contain vagueness (\"kind of,\" \"almost\"). They tend to emphasize the severity of symptoms through descriptive adjectives, indicating amplification. Emotional language dominates, but the responses are generally structured and organized. - Information flow: They tend to volunteer key details (e.g., worsening yellowing, weight loss, stool and urine color change), showing open communication. However, their descriptions are influenced by worry, possibly leading to overstatement of symptom impact. They answer straightforwardly but with emotional undertones, often echoing fear. - Response style: Responses are elaborative upfront but include emotional embellishments. They acknowledge symptoms and fears without excessive tangential information, primarily focusing on their anxieties.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Little evidence, as they are generally forthcoming, but emotional embellishments may obscure true severity; fear may lead to overinterpetation rather than withholding. - Minimization behaviors: There is scant evidence here; they acknowledge symptoms clearly without trivializing. They do downplay their physical discomfort slightly (\"a dull ache but sometimes sharp\"), but overall, they express significant concern. - Amplification patterns: Clear overemphasis on severity of consequences (\"terrible,\" \"really bad,\" \"something really serious\") and worry about cancer spreading.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification; the patient exhibits strong emotional responses and overconcern about the seriousness, likely skewing perception of symptoms and prognosis. - Severity: Moderate; emotional distress influences descriptions but they do communicate key clinical details, although fears may lead to overestimating the gravity. - Areas most affected: Perceived severity and prognosis (e.g., fears of cancer, spread, and death) are most affected by amplification bias. Symptom descriptions are relatively accurate but colored by anxiety. - Reliability: Moderate; while they report physical symptoms straightforwardly, emotional overactivation might inflate perceived severity, making some aspects less reliable for objective assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Real concern about emotional impact indicates they may not clearly differentiate between their anxiety-driven fears and actual clinical danger. They might not be fully conveying their physical discomfort levels, minimizing or not recognizing subtle symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: They may understate or rationalize symptoms such as bowel color change or discomfort severity, influenced by emotional distress. - Concerns probably amplified: Their fears about cancer, spreading, and death are likely exaggerated by anxiety, which may distort risk assessment and influence decision-making. - True timeline: The reported timeline appears consistent but might be skewed by the patient's focus on worsening symptoms.

Further history and diagnostic testing are necessary to evaluate for hepatobiliary pathology, including hepatitis, biliary obstruction, or other causes, with attention to possible underreporting of risk factors and additional systemic or physical signs.Acute or Chronic Hepatobiliary Disease (likely hepatitis or biliary obstruction) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged words like \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and \"worried,\" mixed with vague phrases such as \"more and more,\" suggesting an emotional overlay that magnifies perceived severity. While describing symptoms with some detail, they tend to frame their experiences within a fearful narrative. - Information flow: The patient tends to volunteer broad concerns initially but is hesitant or minimal when asked specific questions about exposures or behaviors; this indicates a tendency to withhold or clarify only when prompted, possibly due to embarrassment or fear. - Response style: Responses are somewhat elaborative concerning fears and feelings but concise regarding factual details, showing an emotional approach rather than detailed clinical reporting.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance or ambiguity about risky behaviors like alcohol use or travel, suggesting possible reluctance due to shame or fear of judgment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying their symptoms as \"more and more terrible\" rather than giving precise descriptions; suggesting they aim to avoid alarming the clinician or feel they should cope without emphasizing the severity. - Amplification patterns: Repeated use of \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" indicating emotional amplification possibly leading to overestimation of danger, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reticence about lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol), hinting at underlying shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence, responses are consistent, indicating good chronological recall. - Family influence: No direct indication; responses seem primarily internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, as evidenced by emotional overstatement of symptoms and fears about seriousness and spread. - Severity: Moderate; emotional distress influences their perception and reporting, but they remain cooperative and reasonably explicit. - Areas most affected: Perception of the severity and urgency of symptoms (\"terrible,\" \"worst\"), and fear of malignancy spreading. - Reliability: Moderate; clinical signs are probably accurate, but emotional distortion may amplify perceived severity or hide some behavioral factors.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about their social habits or exposures due to embarrassment; possible underreporting of risky behaviors or substance use. - Symptoms probably minimized: Clinical reality may be worse, with more systemic signs or risks, but the emotional focus may overshadow some objective detail. - Concerns probably amplified: Their fears about cancer and spreading are likely exaggerated; driven by anxiety, they may perceive a worse prognosis than medically indicated. - True timeline: Symptom progression appears consistent with clinical deterioration, but emotional distress might make it seem more sudden or severe than it objectively is, which could influence urgency in management.",
    "output": "THINKING: - To confirm the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease, it\u2019s important to clarify specific criteria such as the duration and pattern of jaundice, presence of additional systemic symptoms, and any signs of liver dysfunction. - Given the emotional distress and potential underreporting of risk factors, I need to gently explore exposures like alcohol, medications, or risky behaviors without causing defensiveness. - This stage aims to finalize diagnostic certainty; therefore, questions should be focused on confirming key features like the pattern of jaundice and associated symptoms, while also assessing patient's understanding and emotional state. - Additionally, I should be attentive to any red flags that might suggest complications or alternative diagnoses, and ensure the patient feels ready to discuss management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused questions targeting specific diagnostic criteria for hepatitis and biliary obstruction (e.g., onset, progression, associated symptoms). - Open-ended elements to gauge patient understanding and emotional response, combined with gentle probing regarding exposures. - Communication should be sensitive, emphasizing collaboration to validate the patient's experience, while guiding toward diagnostic clarity. - These questions will help confirm if their presentation aligns with hepatobiliary causes and whether they are prepared for subsequent treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared so far, I want to make sure I understand the pattern of your jaundice and symptoms a bit more clearly. Could you tell me if the yellowing of your skin and eyes has been gradually worsening over the past few weeks, or did it come on suddenly? Also, have you noticed if the discomfort you feel is constant or comes and goes? To help clarify, have you experienced any recent changes in your stool color\u2014like becoming lighter\u2014or dark urine? And, thinking about your overall health, have you noticed any other new symptoms, such as fever, swelling in your abdomen, or worsening fatigue? Understanding these details helps me confirm whether your symptoms fit with certain conditions like hepatitis or a block in your bile ducts.\"",
