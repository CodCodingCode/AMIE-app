    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral) Justification: Typical presentation includes redness, tearing, and swelling; common after exposure to infectious agents, especially in active individuals; rapid onset within a few days. 2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma during soccer could cause superficial corneal injury leading to redness, tearing, and discomfort; onset within days is consistent. 3. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye irritation and redness following physical activity or minor trauma; symptoms coincide with recent sports participation. 4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness can occur with allergen exposure, though less likely immediately after sports unless an allergen is involved. 5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness; often chronic but can acutely flare with irritation. 6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Rapid onset swelling, redness, and tenderness, possibly with fever or systemic symptoms; important to rule out but less likely without systemic signs. 7. Diagnosis: Uveitis (iritis) Justification: Presents with redness and tearing, though usually accompanied by pain and photophobia; less likely given rapid onset post-sport. 8. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Eye redness, swelling, tearing can occur, but typically presents with severe pain, halos, visual acuity changes, which are not described. 9. Diagnosis: Herpes keratitis Justification: Corneal ulcer or infection causing redness and tearing; possible, especially if there's a history of herpes, but no mention of pain or visual loss. 10. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Traumatic activity increases risk; presents with redness and tearing; urgent to consider but less certain without direct evidence.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs specific, emotionally charged descriptions of her symptoms, like \"terrible headache\" and \"like the room is spinning,\" which indicate genuine distress but also heightened emotional state. Her responses are direct and organized, showing cooperation. - Information flow: She readily volunteers her core symptoms aligning with her distress, providing a structured account, suggesting openness. She does not seem reluctant to share pertinent information. - Response style: She offers detailed symptom descriptions, emphasizing her distress, indicating an elaborate and emotionally driven response style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she openly states her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not apparent; she describes her symptoms as severe and distressing, not downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional expressions (e.g., \"terrible headache,\" \"really dizzy\") suggest some amplification driven by anxiety but are likely reflective of her genuine experience. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; she appears willing to describe her symptoms without hesitation. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; her account is coherent and consistent. - Family influence: No evidence of external influence; responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, driven by her anxiety about her health and acute distress. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional state heightens her perception of symptom severity but does not distort factual reporting. - Areas most affected: Her expression of symptom severity and emotional state; her focus on fears about her health may overemphasize the urgency, though her descriptions are accurate. - Reliability: Generally reliable for core symptoms, though emotional distress may heighten perceptions, so clinical judgment should consider her anxiety level.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Possible detailed description of worsening or preceding symptoms; she may not recall subtle signs or progression details due to her current distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely; she emphasizes severe symptoms clearly. - Concerns probably amplified: Her emotional state likely amplifies concern, especially regarding her prognosis, but her symptom descriptions are valid. - True timeline: Likely accurate; she reports sudden onset with clear symptom escalation, consistent with stroke presentation.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning based on the clinical context to formulate an open-ended question that facilitates detailed exploration of her eye symptoms and their impact. Since she already described the onset and some features, I need to gently prompt her to elaborate on her experience, how it affects her daily life, and any other details that might help differentiate among the potential diagnoses. Building rapport with an empathetic, non-leading question is crucial at this stage, especially considering her emotional distress and need for reassurance.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: She hasn't detailed how her symptoms have evolved since onset, associated symptoms like pain or visual changes, or any prior eye issues. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify presence of pain, visual disturbances, trauma, or systemic features to distinguish causes like conjunctivitis, corneal trauma, or more serious conditions. - Patient factors: Her emotionally charged reporting suggests she may be expressive but also anxious; open-ended questions should reduce pressure and encourage her to share comfortably. - Interview phase goals: Establish trust, gather a comprehensive picture of symptoms, assess functional impact, and gauge her understanding and concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to elicit a broad, detailed description. - Information target: Symptom characteristics, progression, associated features, and impact. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing that invites her to tell her story in her own words without feeling judged or hurried. - Expected value: This will deepen understanding of her current condition and guide further focused inquiry.\nANSWER: \"That must be very uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about how your eye symptoms have been since they started? For example, have you noticed anything else happening, like changes in your vision, pain, or any other sensations?\"",

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with recent visual disturbances characterized by blurry and asymmetrical vision, along with headache, dizziness, and imbalance that began gradually and may have worsened over time. She reports eye redness, swelling, and tearing following recent trauma sustained during sports activity. Her descriptions suggest her symptoms could be more severe and persistent than she reports, with potential underlying issues such as double vision or visual field deficits that she may be minimizing or withholding. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate her visual functions, associated neurological signs, and the full scope of her symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Traumatic ocular injury (e.g., hyphema, corneal abrasion) Justification: Recent sports trauma with eye redness, swelling, tearing suggests an injury involving the anterior segment of the eye, possibly causing blurred vision and other symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Optic neuritis Justification: Visual disturbances with asymmetry, headache, and potential progression could indicate inflammatory optic nerve involvement, especially if symptoms worsened gradually.  3. Diagnosis: Increased intracranial pressure or mass lesion (e.g., tumor, hemorrhage) Justification: Headache, dizziness, imbalance, and visual disturbances might be caused by intracranial pathology exerting pressure on visual pathways or affecting the cerebellum.  4. Diagnosis: Ischemic or vascular event (e.g., transient ischemic attack or stroke) Justification: Sudden or gradual visual symptoms combined with dizziness and imbalance prompt consideration of cerebrovascular causes affecting visual or neurological centers.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic brain injury (concussion or contusion) Justification: Recent trauma with neurological symptoms suggests possible brain injury contributing to visual and balance issues.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis or scleritis Justification: Eye redness, swelling, tearing following trauma could reflect intraocular inflammation, possibly affecting vision.  7. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura Justification: Headache and visual disturbances, especially if episodic, might be migraine-related, though trauma history makes this less likely as a primary cause.  8. Diagnosis: Temporomandibular joint dysfunction or cervicogenic dizziness Justification: Dizziness and imbalance could be referred symptoms involving the neck or jaw, particularly if the trauma involved the face/neck.  9. Diagnosis: Detachment or retinal injury Justification: Visual loss and asymmetry post-trauma raise concern for retinal detachment or tear, which can cause persistent visual disturbances.  10. Diagnosis: Neurological or psychiatric conditions (e.g., somatization) Justification: If symptoms are inconsistent or possibly underreported, a non-organic or psychiatric component could be considered, though less likely given trauma history and ocular signs.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends toward vague, non-specific descriptions (\"kind of blurry,\" \"sometimes one looks different\"), possibly minimizing or downplaying her eye issues. - Information flow: She is reluctant or hesitant to disclose full details about her eye symptoms unless explicitly asked; her responses are concise and defensively cautious. - Response style: Responses are minimal and conservative, avoiding elaboration, which could be driven by discomfort or a desire not to overstate symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She openly admits she hasn't thought much about her eye symptoms and isn\u2019t sure if they are important, indicating possible withholding or minimization. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying visual disturbances with vague terms, not emphasizing frequency or severity. - Amplification: Not evident; she generally underreacts or gives understated descriptions. - Embarrassment/shame: No clear signs; her hesitation appears rooted more in minimization than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent. - Family influence: None evident in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Minimization/information withholding, mainly regarding her eye symptoms. - Severity: Moderate, as her vague descriptions limit a full understanding, risking underestimation of her neurological deficits. - Most affected areas: Visual symptoms and their potential significance for stroke assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; her descriptions suggest need for further probing to accurately gauge her neurological status.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing information: Specifics of her visual disturbances, such as extent and impact, likely underreported. - Symptoms minimized: The severity and potential danger of her visual changes could be greater than her words imply. - Concerns amplified: Overall stroke worry is clear, but her eye symptoms may not match her perceived severity or concern levels. - True progression: Visual symptoms may be more persistent or severe than indicated; her brevity suggests possible unawareness or deliberate understated reporting.  Thus, her communication indicates moderate minimization bias that may obscure important visual deficits critical for accurate diagnosis and management.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The previous questions have established some information about her eye and neurological symptoms, but her responses were minimal and somewhat vague, indicating minimization or hesitance. I need to gently encourage her to elaborate on her visual experiences without making her feel pressured or judged. - Exploring her perception of how these symptoms are affecting her daily life and her understanding of their significance can reveal concerns or fears she might have yet to voice. - Since she has experienced trauma, I should also inquire about how her symptoms have changed over time and if she has noticed any new or worsening issues, especially regarding detailed visual function. - This approach aligns with the early exploration phase's goals: building rapport and gathering richer, detailed information to guide further assessment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Use open-ended questions that prompt her to describe her experience and perspective. - Focus on her personal sense of her vision and any functional impact. - Phrase questions in a caring, non-judgmental manner to facilitate trust. - Expect to gain insight into the severity, progression, and personal significance of her symptoms, which could influence differential diagnosis and urgency.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what your vision has been like\u2014what you notice day to day and how it may have changed since it first started?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal Foreign Body Justification: The recent soccer activity suggests possible trauma; redness, swelling, tearing are common signs; foreign body introduction during play can cause these symptoms acutely. The onset within two days supports trauma-related etiology, especially with physical activity involving the eye.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Sudden onset after playing sports, with redness and tearing, are classic for a corneal scratch or abrasion caused by contact with grass, dirt, or a foreign object. Swelling and tearing further support this, especially as a trauma-related injury.  3. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (Allergic or Infectious) Justification: Redness and tearing are hallmark features; though typically more bilateral and less associated with swelling suggestive of trauma, conjunctivitis can be triggered or exacerbated in active outdoor settings. Less likely given the recent trauma, but still possible.  4. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: While tears and redness can occur, uveitis usually presents with pain, photophobia, and decreased vision\u2014none of which are described here. Still, it remains in the differential, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.  5. Diagnosis: Intraocular Injury (e.g., Hyphema) Justification: Although trauma can cause intraocular injury like hyphema, absence of mention of vision changes or visual disturbances lessens likelihood. Still, it needs consideration given the recent activity causing ocular trauma.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague and softening language (\"kind of blurry,\" \"not sure if important\") to possibly avoid alarm or shame, while also using emotionally charged words (\"terrible,\" \"worst\") to seek reassurance. - Information flow: Responses tend to be reserved and require prompting; she is reluctant to volunteer details about her visual symptoms unless directly asked, indicating guarded communication. - Response style: Her answers are brief, hesitant, and sometimes non-specific, suggesting discomfort or uncertainty in fully expressing her concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague description of vision issues and hesitation to elaborate point to partial disclosure, potentially omitting more critical details. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying visual disturbances and using non-specific descriptions imply she is minimizing their clinical importance. - Amplification patterns: The strong language about headache and dizziness suggests genuine distress but could also reflect an emotional amplification driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Reluctance to fully describe eye symptoms indicates possible discomfort discussing or fear of seeming overly anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: No overt signs, but vague descriptions hint at some difficulty articulating or fully understanding the significance. - Family influence: No evident external influence; responses seem personally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is information withholding/minimization regarding visual symptoms, influenced by discomfort or uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate, as key neurological symptoms (vision changes) are underdescribed, which could delay diagnosis. - Areas most affected: Visual symptoms and their functional impact are most biased; this is vital for stroke assessment. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014core symptoms are present, but some critical details require cautious interpretation due to reluctance to fully disclose.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably concealing the full extent of her visual disturbances, which could be more significant or persistent. - Symptoms probably minimized: Visual deficits might be worse or more disruptive than her comments suggest. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety may lead her to overstate headache and dizziness severity, but her vague descriptions indicate underlying fear or shame. - True timeline: Visual changes may be more subtle or progressive than reported, but her hesitations make it hard to establish an accurate timeline.  (Note: This analysis supports a careful, empathetic approach, validating her feelings while gently exploring her eye symptoms in more detail.)",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s responses indicate she is hesitant to fully disclose the extent and nature of her visual symptoms, which suggests we need to gently clarify her experiences without causing discomfort or defensiveness. Since she mentions vague visual difficulties and emotional distress about her head symptoms, it\u2019s crucial to distinguish whether her visual complaints are recent, persistent, or episodic, and to explore associated features such as pain, photophobia, or field defects. Understanding the timeline and severity can help differentiate between ocular, neurological, or systemic causes. Additionally, her emotional cues suggest she may feel unsure or embarrassed, so framing questions empathetically is important. I need to target her vague descriptions, and be specific about the nature of her visual symptoms, while inviting detailed, honest responses.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise description of her visual disturbances (e.g., blurred, double, visual field loss), onset, duration, and impact; any associated neurological symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether her visual symptoms are recent or intermittent; rule out neurological causes like transient ischemic attacks, migraine, ocular trauma, or other systemic issues. - Patient factors: Her vague, hesitant communication suggests she may minimize symptoms; questions should be open-ended but gently probe specifics. - Interview phase goals: Obtain a clearer picture of her visual experience, assess for red flags (e.g., sudden loss, visual field defects), and evaluate impact on functioning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions that encourage elaboration on her visual experiences, and close-ended questions to clarify specific features. - Information target: Nature, timing, severity, associated symptoms, and impact of visual disturbances. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental phrasing to put her at ease, validating her feelings while seeking concrete details. - Expected value: Clarifies the true characteristics of her visual symptoms, helping to distinguish neurological vs. ocular causes.\nANSWER: \u201cYou mentioned experiencing some vague changes in your vision and feeling kind of blurry, but you also seemed unsure if it\u2019s very important.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or minor trauma-related injury Justification: The sudden onset of eye redness, swelling, tearing after playing soccer suggests trauma, possibly leading to corneal abrasion. The proximity of symptom onset to activity supports this. Such injuries often cause irritation, tearing, redness, and swelling, especially in the context of physical activity where blunt trauma or foreign bodies are common.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are characteristic of conjunctivitis. Although the recent activity could be incidental, infection remains a common cause of these symptoms. Lack of mention of mucopurulent discharge initially may favor viral, but bacterial cause cannot be excluded given the presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Allergic reactions can cause conjunctival redness, tearing, and swelling. However, the acuteness and activity-associated onset make this less likely unless there's a history of allergies, which isn't provided. Still, it remains a differential especially if initial findings are more diffuse.  4. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Though less likely given the rapid onset post-activity, uveitis can cause redness and tearing, often with pain or photophobia. Lack of itchiness or prior ocular history makes this less probable but still within consideration due to the presentation of ocular inflammation.  5. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Foreign bodies, such as dirt or debris from playing soccer, can cause redness, swelling, tearing, and irritation. Although less specific, trauma-related activity raises suspicion for a retained foreign object causing localized irritation.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and hesitant language (\"kind of blurry,\" \"not quite right,\" \"a little blurry\"), reflecting a tendency to understate or minimize her symptoms. Her emotional distress is evident with phrases like \"worst headache,\" which exaggerates her suffering, likely driven by anxiety. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to fully disclose her visual symptoms, often waiting for direct prompts. Her responses are organized but guarded, showing she is cautious about revealing too much and may be hiding concerns. - Response style: Responses tend to be minimal and hedged, with frequent qualifiers such as \"I think,\" \"maybe,\" and \"off and on.\" She responds indirectly to questions about severity and frequency, possibly to avoid alarming the clinician or due to uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She minimizes her visual symptoms, avoids specifics about sudden or double vision, and seems unsure if she should mention certain details, indicating hesitance in full disclosure. - Minimization behaviors: Her language diminishes the severity or frequency of her symptoms (\"a little blurry,\" \"not quite right\"), suggesting she may be underrating the danger or personal impact. - Amplification patterns: The description of her headache as \"the worst I've ever had\" may serve to amplify her emotional distress, potentially exaggerating her urgent concern due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her hesitation and uncertainty about whether her vision symptoms are important suggest she might feel embarrassed or unsure about their significance, leading her to minimize. - Confusion/memory issues: While responses are internally consistent, her uncertain language reflects emotional confusion or fear more than cognitive issues. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but her cautiousness may be affected by internalized worry or health anxiety, rather than family pressure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is minimization of key symptoms, especially visual disturbances, to downplay their severity and avoid unnecessary concern. - Severity: Moderate, as she provides vague and cautious responses that likely underrepresent her actual symptoms. - Areas most affected: Visual symptoms are most biased, as she understates their severity and frequency. Her headache and dizziness seem reasonably reported. - Reliability: Moderate; she is generally honest but cautious, meaning her reports should be interpreted with mindful consideration of possible underreporting.

    "output": "THINKING: - The patient has a guarded communication style, using vague language for visual symptoms, which suggests she might be minimizing the severity or details. - Since the initial questions focused broadly on visual changes, here I should target specific features that help distinguish between possible diagnoses like optic neuritis, retinal issues, or more common causes like refraction or minor trauma. - Given she's described her vision as \"kind of blurry\" and \"off and on,\" I need to clarify whether these are persistent or episodic, as well as whether she experiences additional features like flashes, floaters, or pain, to narrow the differential. - Additionally, exploring related neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness, or neurological deficits) can help evaluate for possible neurological causes versus ocular surface issues. - Her hesitance means I should phrase questions clearly, gently prompting her to elaborate without pushing too hard. - I'm aiming to clarify the nature and severity of her visual disturbances, check for associated neurological or ocular symptoms, and assess possible risk factors.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise characteristics, timing, and associated features of her visual disturbances; presence of flashes, floaters, pain, or neurological deficits; any previous episodes or similar symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating ocular surface trauma from neurological causes (e.g., optic neuritis) or retinal pathology; ruling out central causes if neurological signs are present. - Patient factors: Her cautious, minimalistic communication suggests I should use targeted, concrete questions to reduce uncertainty while remaining empathetic. - Interview phase goals: Gain detailed understanding of her visual symptoms\u2014timing, quality, associated symptoms\u2014and assess whether her descriptions suggest a need for urgent evaluation.

Her statements could mask a more severe problem. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s no overt exaggeration; concern seems moderate. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of shame, just hesitation and vagueness. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight hesitations and non-specificity may hint at some uncertainty but no strong evidence of cognitive deficits. - Family influence: No clear signs of external influence or pressure affecting responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Minimization bias** \u2014 she appears to minimize her visual disturbances, perhaps to avoid worry or due to lack of understanding of their severity. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 her vague language and reluctance suggest her perception of her symptoms is less alarming than they might actually be. - Areas most affected: Visual symptoms, especially the frequency and intensity (\"off and on,\" \"feels fuzzy\"), are underreported, which could lead to underestimating urgency. - Reliability: Moderate \u2014 her responses are cautiously guarded and non-specific, so trust should be tempered with clinical correlation and further probing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might underreport serious visual changes like double vision, persistent blurriness, or visual loss, which could signify more urgent pathology. - Symptoms probably minimized: The potential severity of her visual disturbances may be greater than she indicates, risking under-recognition of underlying neurological concerns. - Concerns probably amplified: Her overall concern about the stroke and health may be exaggerated relative to her visual symptoms, but her focus on vague sensations could obscure critical signs. - True timeline: The intermittent and vague nature of symptoms complicates accurate judgment; underlying progression may be more rapid or severe than her account suggests.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need to clarify if she has experienced any sudden or persistent vision loss, double vision, or other specific ocular phenomena that she might not have mentioned. Also, understanding the triggers, duration, and frequency of her visual episodes will help differentiate between possible diagnoses such as migraine aura or retinal issues. - Diagnostic priorities: Rule out retinal events, transient ischemic attacks, or migraine-related phenomena. Exploring characteristics like sudden loss vs. gradual change, the presence of visual field deficits, or other neurological symptoms is essential. - Patient factors: Given her guarded communication style and tendency to use vague language, questions should be carefully focused and confirmatory to elicit specific details without making her feel pressured or alarmed. - Interview phase goals: To obtain definitive information about any serious or persistent visual disturbances, assess for red flag symptoms, and confirm the nature and pattern of her visual episodes to support diagnostic certainty.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Use a combination of focused and confirmatory questions to clarify the presence or absence of red flag features such as sudden loss, double vision, or persistent changes. - Information target: Specific episodes, their characteristics, relationship to triggers, whether they resolve fully, and any associated neurological signs. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently but clearly, inviting her to specify and verify her experiences. - Expected value: This will help confirm whether her symptoms align with migraine aura or suggest alternative causes like vascular or retinal pathology, guiding further management.\nANSWER: \u201cTo help me better understand your visual symptoms, can you tell me if you've ever experienced a sudden complete loss of vision in one eye or a part of your visual field that doesn't come back quickly? Also, have you noticed any double vision, flashing lights, or any sensation of your vision looking different in one eye compared to the other? And when these episodes happen, do they last just a few moments, or do they stick around for longer? Knowing these details will help me clarify what's going on and the best next steps for you.\u201d",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient prefers vague, non-specific descriptors (\"a little blurry,\" \"feels fuzzy,\" \"kind of blurry\"), which minimize the perceived severity of her symptoms. She balances honesty with reluctance, possibly avoiding alarm. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant initially, volunteering limited details and responding cautiously, suggesting a guarded communication style. She seems attentive but hesitant to fully disclose the extent of her symptoms unless prompted. - Response style: Her responses are concise, sometimes hedging (\"I think,\" \"maybe\"), indicating uncertainty or discomfort. She maintains generality rather than elaborating on specific features, which could hide underlying severity.
