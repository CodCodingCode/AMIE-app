    "input": "A female adult presents with a three-day history of urinary burning, increased urinary frequency, hematuria, chills, and subjective feverish sensations. The presentation is consistent with acute urinary tract infection, potentially progressing to pyelonephritis. While the patient's self-reported symptoms are vivid and suggest significant illness, her distress may amplify perceived severity. Systemic symptoms such as malaise and fatigue are likely present but underreported. No additional symptoms or findings have been documented at this time, and further assessment is necessary to confirm physical findings, vital signs, and laboratory investigations.1. Diagnosis: Acute Pyelonephritis Justification: Systemic symptoms such as chills and subjective fever with urinary symptoms suggest infection involving the kidneys; typical presentation includes flank pain, fever, chills, and dysuria, consistent with pyelonephritis.  2. Diagnosis: Acute Cystitis Justification: The urinary burning and increased urinary frequency are hallmark signs of cystitis; hematuria can also occur but systemic symptoms are usually milder unless progression occurs.  3. Diagnosis: Urolithiasis with possible urinary tract infection Justification: Hematuria and urinary symptoms could be caused by kidney stones causing irritation/infection, especially if colicky flank pain is present, although pain specifics are not given.  4. Diagnosis: Gonococcal or Chlamydial Urinary Tract Infection Justification: Sexually transmitted infections can cause urinary symptoms and hematuria, especially in sexually active women; systemic symptoms are less common but possible with disseminated infection.  5. Diagnosis: Interstitial Cystitis Justification: Chronic bladder pain and urinary symptoms, typically not associated with systemic features, but should be considered when infectious causes are ruled out.  6. Diagnosis: Vaginal or Uterine Infection (e.g., Pelvic Inflammatory Disease) Justification: Female reproductive infections can cause urinary symptoms and systemic illness; however, the primary presentation usually includes pelvic pain and vaginal discharge.  7. Diagnosis: Urethritis Justification: Causes urinary burning and frequency, especially in sexually active women, often with or without systemic symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Bladder Tumor Justification: Hematuria and urinary symptoms may be due to neoplasm but less likely given the acuteness and systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Renal or Urinary Tract Malignancy Justification: Usually presents with hematuria but tends to have a more insidious onset; less likely in the acute setting.  10. Diagnosis: Gynecologic infection or pathology (e.g., ovarian cyst rupture) Justification: Can cause abdominal and urinary symptoms, but systemic febrile symptoms are less typical unless complicated.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, emotionally charged language (\"really terrible,\" \"burning so badly,\" \"shivering and feverish,\" \"blood in my urine\"), indicating her distress and emphasizing symptom severity. Her descriptions are detailed rather than vague, and she clearly articulates her main concerns. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering detailed symptoms right away (\"started with burning... now I feel like I always have to go... shivering and feverish... blood in urine\"). She responds fully to the initial question without deflecting or minimizing, suggesting a pattern of openness. - Response style: She provides elaborative, explicit descriptions prompted by her distress. Her responses are direct, with a sense of urgency, but not scattered or tangential. She maintains focus on her symptoms and fears.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding; she appears eager to share pressing details about her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not present. She reports her symptoms vividly and emphasizes their severity. - Amplification patterns: She may be amplifying her distress explicitly but in response to her actual symptoms, not as a bias, so her report appears aligned with her subjective experience. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not notably evident; her tone is open and distressed without signs of shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion about timeline or symptoms; her report is consistent. - Family influence: No clear indicators of external influence affecting her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The patient\u2019s communication seems to be primarily affected by heightened emotional distress rather than cognitive biases like minimization or denial. Her symptoms and fears are congruent, driven by genuine concern. - Severity: Moderate severity due to intense emotional state amplifying her expression of distress, but her information is accurate and detailed. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and her concern for her baby, which are heightened by her anxiety, may cause her to overestimate the danger. - Reliability: High trust in her self-report; despite emotional distress, her descriptions are specific and consistent, indicating honest communication.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be withholding basic details but may underestimate her ability to communicate about her symptoms. Less likely to withhold critical info; however, her emotional state could obscure her perception of how serious her condition truly is. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely, as her descriptions are vivid and detailed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of the impact on her baby may be overestimating actual risk due to her anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms appear to have worsened over the past three days, consistent with her report, though her emotional distress might be magnifying her perceived severity and urgency.  Thus, her communication is mostly clear and emotionally genuine, with her primary bias being heightened emotional response influencing her perception of the severity rather than deliberate withholding or minimization.",
    "output": "THINKING: The key information gaps include a detailed understanding of how her symptoms have evolved over time beyond the initial three days, whether she's experienced any pain or other localizing signs such as flank pain, and her overall impact on daily functioning. Since she's emotional and distressed, open-ended questions that allow her to express her full experience without leading her toward specific conditions are essential. Exploring her concerns and fears about her health and her baby\u2019s wellbeing can provide insight into her emotional state and how it influences her perception of symptoms. Given her vivid descriptions, I want to encourage her to elaborate on her experience to individualize her understanding of the timeline, severity, and context.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about symptom progression, associated localizing signs, functional impact, and emotional state. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarifying the pattern of her symptoms, presence of flank pain or systemic signs, and understanding her impact. - Patient factors: She is emotionally expressive and detailed; questions should be gentle, validating, and open-ended. - Interview phase goals: Gather broad, detailed symptom information, establish rapport, and understand her concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to allow elaboration on her experience and concerns. - Information target: Symptom evolution, presence of pain or other localizing symptoms, daily impact, and worries. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, inviting her to share her story in her own words. - Expected value: This will deepen understanding of her symptom pattern, reassure her, and help prioritize diagnostic considerations.\nANSWER: \"That sounds like a really uncomfortable experience. Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed or if anything else has come up since they first started three days ago? For example, have you noticed any new types of pain, or anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?\"",

    "input": "A female adult presents with a three-day history of urinary burning, increased urinary frequency, hematuria, chills, and a subjective feeling of fever. These symptoms are indicative of an acute urinary tract infection, with possible progression toward pyelonephritis. While systemic symptoms such as malaise and fatigue are likely present, they may be underemphasized by the patient due to distress. Further physical examination, vital signs assessment, and laboratory investigations are necessary to evaluate the extent of systemic involvement and confirm the diagnosis.1. Diagnosis: Acute pyelonephritis Justification: The combination of urinary burning, increased frequency, hematuria, chills, and subjective fever suggests urinary tract infection with systemic involvement, characteristic of pyelonephritis, especially with systemic symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Uncomplicated cystitis Justification: Urinary burning, frequency, and hematuria are typical of cystitis; however, systemic symptoms like chills and fever point more toward upper tract involvement.  3. Diagnosis: Interstitial cystitis Justification: Chronic bladder pain and urinary symptoms without systemic signs; less likely given the recent onset and systemic features here.  4. Diagnosis: Urinary calculi (nephrolithiasis) Justification: Hematuria and urinary symptoms can be caused by stones; however, systemic symptoms are less typical unless there is an infection or obstruction.  5. Diagnosis: Bacterial prostatitis (if male, but patient is female, so unlikely) Justification: Relevant in males, causes urinary symptoms and systemic signs; not applicable here.  6. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease Justification: Can cause pelvic pain and urinary symptoms but less specifically associated with hematuria and systemic fever in this context.  7. Diagnosis: Urethritis Justification: Usually causes dysuria and urinary frequency; systemic symptoms are uncommon.  8. Diagnosis: Kidney or bladder tumor Justification: Hematuria can suggest malignancy, but systemic symptoms like fever and chills are less typical unless advanced or infected.  9. Diagnosis: Vesicoureteral reflux Justification: Usually a pediatric condition, less likely in an adult presenting acutely.  10. Diagnosis: Appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology Justification: Can cause systemic symptoms; however, urinary symptoms are not main features.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She opts for emotionally charged, specific descriptors (\"really terrible,\" \"so badly,\" \"shivering\") that emphasize her distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering detailed symptoms without prompting, which suggests openness driven by urgency. - Response style: Responses are direct, concise, and focused on symptom severity; little tangential elaboration.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Anxiety-driven amplification of symptoms, leading to heightened perceived severity. - Severity: moderate\u2014her descriptions likely reflect real distress but may be influenced by heightened emotion. - Most biased areas: urgency perception, concern for fetal safety. - Reliability: moderate; her report is honest but may be influenced by emotional distress, possibly inflating severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: subtle signs of emotional distress or less severe symptoms, possibly underreported if she perceives them as insignificant. - Symptoms probably minimized: none apparent; she clearly reports significant symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: her fears about harm to her baby and the severity of her condition seem heightened by anxiety. - True timeline: her symptom progression appears accurate, but her perception of severity may be exaggerated by her emotional state.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: Adult female. Chief complaint: Urinary symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection, with concern about severity. Present illness: The patient reports a 3-day history of urinary burning, increased urinary frequency, blood in urine, chills, and subjective feeling of fever. She describes her symptoms as overwhelming and emphasizes distress, which indicates emotional amplification affecting her perception of severity. Likely, she is experiencing more systemic symptoms\u2014such as malaise or flank pain\u2014than she is able or willing to communicate fully. She may also be experiencing additional systemic manifestations like nausea or general weakness that have not been explicitly reported. She expresses worry about her pregnancy and potential harm, which is understandable but may be driven by anxiety; her actual physical presentation warrants further objective evaluation. Associated symptoms: Chills and subjective fever are reported; other systemic symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, flank pain, or malaise may be present but are underemphasized. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The patient's report of urinary burning, increased frequency, hematuria, chills, and subjective fever. - Medium confidence: The severity and extent of systemic symptoms, which are likely amplified but not precisely quantified. - Low confidence: The patient's emotional description may overstate her perception of urgency; she may be withholding or minimizing additional symptoms. - Missing information: Vital signs, physical examination findings, laboratory investigations (urinalysis, urine culture), and obstetric status to fully assess infection severity and maternal-fetal safety.1. Diagnosis: Acute pyelonephritis Justification: The combination of urinary symptoms (burning, increased frequency, hematuria), systemic signs (chills, subjective fever), and rapid onset supports pyelonephritis. She exhibits systemic manifestations that suggest an ascending infection affecting the kidneys, especially considering her distress and potential systemic symptoms like malaise or flank pain which may be underreported. Her concern about severity aligns with this diagnosis, and the risk to pregnancy warrants urgent attention.  2. Diagnosis: Cystitis (bladder infection) Justification: The initial urinary symptoms\u2014burning, frequency, hematuria\u2014are classic for cystitis. However, her systemic symptoms (chills, subjective fever) suggest that if this is cystitis, it has progressed or is complicated, making pyelonephritis more probable. Still, cystitis remains a strong component of her presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) Justification: Hematuria and systemic symptoms like chills could be related to renal calculi causing obstruction and inflammation, leading to infection or hematuria. However, without mention of pain characteristic of stones (severe flank colic), this is less likely but remains a differential.  4. Diagnosis: Acute prostatitis (less likely in women but included as a consideration for urinary symptoms with systemic infection) Justification: Less probable given gender; mostly relevant if male. Not applicable here.  5. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervicovaginal infection Justification: Given urinary symptoms and systemic illness, this is less probable. Symptoms are more consistent with urinary tract pathology than solely gynecological infection, but coexisting infections could contribute.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged, urgent language (\"terrible,\" \"really scared,\" \"so much all at once\") which indicates high anxiety. She describes her symptoms vividly but with strong emotional framing. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with her main symptoms\u2014pain, burning, blood\u2014indicating openness; however, her responses are heavily weighted with her emotional reactions, possibly overshadowing detailed medical explanations. - Response style: Her responses are somewhat elaborate, combining symptom descriptions with emotional concerns, which reveals her distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None clearly; she appears eager to share her experience. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; her symptoms are described in strong, vivid terms. - Amplification patterns: She amplifies her emotional distress\u2014\"so much all at once,\" \"really scared\"\u2014which suggests her fears are heightened. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No visible signs, but her quick speech and emotional openness might indicate a desire for urgent reassurance. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses suggest personal concern rather than external influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as she emphasizes her distress and fears which could overstate the perceived severity. - Severity: Moderate, affecting her emotional expression but not significantly distorting her actual symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her perception of urgency and danger to her baby; her emotional state likely inflates her depiction of severity. - Reliability: Fairly reliable on her physical symptoms, though her emotional overlay suggests her perceived severity should be interpreted with awareness of her distress.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not adequately communicate her understanding or specific concerns about the medical process; her focus is on her emotional distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not apparent; she vividly reports her symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about harming her baby and her own health are likely overemphasized due to anxiety. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to have progressed rapidly and severely, consistent with her report but possibly perceived as more urgent because of her emotional state.  Thus, her communication pattern shows high emotional reactivity that magnifies her distress, which is common in anxious pregnant patients facing serious symptoms. Recognizing this helps tailor reassurance and clear guidance to address both her physical needs and emotional state.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need detailed information about any additional systemic symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, or dizziness; her vital signs and physical exam findings; her obstetric status; and her current hydration and medication use. Clarifying these will help distinguish between uncomplicated cystitis and more severe infections like pyelonephritis. - Diagnostic priorities: Given her reports of chills, subjective fever, blood in urine, and significant distress, prioritizing evaluation for pyelonephritis is essential. Differentiating whether her symptoms are due to cystitis, pyelonephritis, or obstructive causes like stones requires specific symptom clarification. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and vivid descriptions suggest she may overstate symptom severity or emphasize her fears. Gentle, empathetic questioning that validates her experience while requesting specific symptom details will help get clearer clinical information. - Interview phase goals: At this stage, aim to refine whether systemic symptoms like flank pain, nausea, or rigors are present, assess her obstetric status, and gather vital signs and physical symptoms to evaluate severity and risk.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to clarify systemic symptoms and physical signs, open-ended to explore her understanding and concerns. - Information target: Clarity on flank pain, nausea, physical examination findings, obstetric details, and hydration status. - Communication approach: Frame questions sensitively, acknowledging her distress while emphasizing the need for specific information to help ensure she and her baby are safe. - Expected value: Obtaining precise symptom characteristics and warning signs will help distinguish between possible diagnoses and inform urgency.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing all that\u2014it's really helpful.

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with a three-day history of urinary burning, increased urinary frequency, hematuria, chills, and a subjective fever, suggestive of a urinary tract infection with possible renal involvement. She reports back and flank pain, dizziness, and nausea, with a history of attempting to hydrate and rest, but she is feeling very weak. Her emotional distress appears to amplify her perception of illness severity, and some systemic symptoms may be exaggerated. Physical examination and vital signs are required to assess her true physiological status, as her communication indicates possible anxiety-related overestimation while some symptoms such as flank pain and systemic discomfort are objectively present. Further diagnostic workup is necessary to evaluate for complications and ensure appropriate treatment, especially considering her pregnancy.1. Diagnosis: Acute Pyelonephritis Justification: The combination of urinary symptoms (burning, frequency, hematuria), flank pain, systemic symptoms (fever, chills, weakness), and nausea strongly suggests upper urinary tract infection. The presence of systemic symptoms indicates renal involvement, consistent with pyelonephritis. Her history of being pregnant adds urgency due to higher risk of complications.  2. Diagnosis: Urinary Tract Infection (Cystitis) Justification: The lower urinary symptoms (burning, increased frequency, hematuria) are classical for cystitis. Although systemic symptoms are more typical of pyelonephritis, the initial presentation could include uncomplicated cystitis, especially if systemic signs are mild or developing.  3. Diagnosis: Renal Abscess Justification: Persistent and worsening systemic symptoms, flank pain, and hematuria in a patient with pyelonephritis heighten suspicion for abscess formation. Although not confirmed yet, she is at risk, necessitating further imaging.  4. Diagnosis: Obstructive Uropathy (e.g., ureteral calculus) Justification: Flank pain and urinary symptoms may be due to obstruction, potentially causing or complicating infection. However, absence of explicit colicky pain or imaging evidence makes this less likely initially.  5. Diagnosis: Early Sepsis Secondary to UTI/Pyelonephritis Justification: Systemic signs (fever, chills, weakness, dizziness) in the setting of probable pyelonephritis raise concern for sepsis. This diagnosis guides urgent management considerations, especially important in a pregnant patient.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Her language combines specific symptom descriptions (\"burning when I pee,\" \"pain in my back\") with emotional expressions (\"really scared,\" \"so much all at once\"), indicating high emotional involvement. She sometimes uses vagueness (\"sometimes,\" \"like\"), possibly to avoid focusing on severe aspects or due to anxiety. - Information flow: She generally shares her symptoms openly but tends to emphasize emotional impacts over details like precise symptom duration or intensity. Her responses are organized but filtered through her worry. - Response style: Elaborative and emotionally charged, often describing her feelings alongside physical symptoms, which suggests her anxiety influences her communication heavily.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to mention vomiting severity and recent BP or check-ups suggests some omissions, possibly due to worry or distraction. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying vomiting (\"I haven't actually vomited\") and potentially underreporting systemic severity. - Amplification patterns: Overstatement of dizziness, weakness, and fear for her baby, likely driven by anxiety, possibly inflating perceived danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her focus on her pregnancy's safety could reflect internalized maternal concern. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant evidence; responses are coherent and logical. - Family influence: Indirectly suggested by her preoccupations with her baby's wellbeing, which might be influenced by familial or partner concerns.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplifying bias, where her emotional state inflates the severity of her symptoms and fears. - Severity: Moderate to severe; her intense worry significantly colors her perception and description of symptoms. - Areas most affected: Severity and interpretation of physical sensations, emotional distress about her pregnancy, and concern for her baby's health. - Reliability: Moderate; her physical symptoms are real but likely viewed through a lens of high anxiety, which may distort their perceived severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may avoid mentioning some physiological details (e.g., exact blood pressure, vomiting severity) due to concern or distraction. - Symptoms probably minimized: She could be underreporting vomiting or systemic signs of worsening infection. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about her baby and her own health are likely heightened beyond objective danger, fueling her distress. - True timeline: Symptoms appear to have been escalating rapidly, consistent with her report, but her emotional state might magnify their perceived impact, possibly making her feel worse than the clinical picture indicates.  # Short Answer",

Her emotional distress likely heightens her perception of severity, potentially overestimating her physical deterioration. Some systemic signs such as dehydration and neurological changes may be underreported or muted by anxiety. Objective findings are necessary to determine the extent of systemic involvement and guide management, considering her communication pattern indicates the importance of corroborating subjective symptoms with clinical evaluation.Pyelonephritis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged words like \"really terrible,\" \"so much all at once,\" and \"so hard to breathe,\" indicating high emotional arousal. She employs some vagueness (\"like near my kidneys,\" \"sometimes\"), possibly to avoid precise detail. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming with her urgent symptoms but mixes factual reporting with emotional elaboration, which could influence perception of severity. She seems to openly share her distress but may skip over some details that feel too burdensome to describe. - Response style: She provides detailed symptom descriptions when prompted but tends to embed her emotional response within her report, reflecting her distress. Her responses are elaborate, especially when expressing concern about her baby.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to specify specifics about her recent medical history and how her daily functioning is impacted, possibly to avoid revealing perceived weakness. - Minimization behaviors: She mentions trying to rest and hydrate but downplays the potential severity, possibly underreporting how much her functioning is compromised. - Amplification patterns: Her strong emotional language (\"really overwhelmed,\" \"so awful,\" \"so hard to breathe\") indicates emotional amplification which might overstate actual physical severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild discomfort in discussing her urinary symptoms and overall health status; no overt shame evident but some hesitance. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about recent checks and symptom stages, but nothing significant. - Family influence: No data suggesting external influence; responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as her distress appears to inflate her perception of symptoms and danger. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional responses heavily color her report, which could lead to an overestimation of illness severity. - Areas most affected: Her perceived urgency and worry about her baby, and her physical symptoms' severity are most biased. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014she is honest but her emotional state likely distorts the perceived severity of her condition.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She probably underreports her functional impairment, daily limitations, or her previous health examination details. - Symptoms probably minimized: The extent of her functional weakness and perhaps subtle signs of systemic illness may be underrepresented. - Concerns probably amplified: Worrying excessively about her baby's health and her own health, possibly driven by her anxiety rather than objective severity. - True timeline: Symptom progression appears consistent, but her emotional reaction could make the timeline seem more rapid or severe than the actual physical progression.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify if her symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for pyelonephritis as opposed to less severe urinary tract infection, considering her emotional distress may influence her perception of severity. Gather necessary clinical details\u2014such as symptom specifics, functional impact, recent medical evaluations\u2014that haven't been fully clarified. The goal here is to confirm whether systemic signs suggest more serious infection requiring urgent intervention, while acknowledging her emotional state and communication style. Focused, empathetic questions are needed to obtain objective information relevant for diagnosis and safety assessment, especially about her physical findings and recent healthcare contact.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Confirmation of systemic signs such as persistent high fever, chills, flank tenderness, neurological changes, and recent medical assessments. - Diagnostic priorities: Establish whether she has signs of systemic infection and organ involvement indicative of pyelonephritis versus uncomplicated cystitis. - Patient factors: Her emotional amplification may lead to overreporting, but her detailed descriptions suggest she is open; question phrasing should minimize re-traumatization and build trust. - Interview phase goals: Finalize symptom characterization, evaluate severity, assess potential for complications, and check for contraindications to outpatient management or the need for urgent care.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, close-ended questions to clarify specific symptoms and signs. - Information target: Presence of high fever, persistent chills, flank tenderness, urinary symptoms, recent healthcare contact, and impact on daily functioning. - Communication approach: Frame questions gently to encourage honest reporting, e.g., \"To understand how you're feeling physically, can I ask if you\u2019ve had any ongoing fever or chills today?\" - Expected value: Confirm systemic involvement, ruling in or out pyelonephritis, and determine urgency of care needs.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing how overwhelmed you feel. To help me understand your condition better, can you tell me if you still have a fever or chills today, and whether you\u2019ve noticed any persistent pain in your back or sides that could point to your kidneys? Also, have you checked or been told your temperature recently, or had any recent visits to a healthcare provider for your symptoms?\"",
