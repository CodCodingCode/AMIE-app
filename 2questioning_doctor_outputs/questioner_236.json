    "input": "The patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with a two-day history of high fever exceeding 102\u00b0F, accompanied by systemic symptoms including muscle aches, headache, chills with rigors, sweating episodes, weakness, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms such as cough and sneezing. While she reports significant discomfort, her emotional expression and detailed reporting suggest her perceived severity may be somewhat amplified by anxiety. Objective signs of respiratory distress or mental status changes are not documented at this time. Further assessment of respiratory function, hydration status, and potential systemic complications is recommended to determine the severity and to rule out pneumonia or other serious conditions. Additional inquiry into subtle symptoms like shortness of breath, chest discomfort, dizziness, or mental confusion is necessary to complete the clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Influenza Justification: High fever, systemic symptoms (muscle aches, headache, chills), respiratory symptoms (cough, sneezing), occur over two days, consistent with typical influenza presentation, especially during flu season.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial pneumonia Justification: Fever >102\u00b0F, cough, systemic symptoms, and potential respiratory compromise make bacterial pneumonia a strong consideration, particularly in an older adult.  3. Diagnosis: Other viral respiratory infections (e.g., RSV, parainfluenza) Justification: Similar symptoms to influenza but may present outside peak flu season; respiratory symptoms and systemic signs are common.  4. Diagnosis: Atypical bacterial infection (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) Justification: Can cause community-acquired pneumonia with systemic symptoms, often less abrupt in onset but can present with fever and cough in older adults.  5. Diagnosis: Sepsis secondary to respiratory infection Justification: Systemic signs and high fever raise concern for sepsis; particularly in elderly, even without overt hypotension or mental status changes initially.  6. Diagnosis: Sinusitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Fever, headache, nasal symptoms (sneezing), potentially persistent or worsening symptoms, common in this age group.  7. Diagnosis: Covid-19 or other coronavirus infection Justification: Respiratory symptoms with systemic features; can cause high fever and cough, especially relevant given ongoing COVID-19 considerations.  8. Diagnosis: autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (e.g., vasculitis) Justification: Less likely but possible given systemic inflammation; absence of specific findings reduces likelihood but remains a differential.  9. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism Justification: Respiratory symptoms and systemic signs should prompt consideration if risk factors present, but less likely due to absence of chest pain or hypoxia.  10. Diagnosis: Heart failure exacerbation Justification: Fatigue, weakness, potential for pulmonary symptoms, but less likely given predominant respiratory symptoms and fever.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs detailed, expressive descriptions indicating her discomfort is genuine. Her language is emotionally charged, e.g., \"feeling really awful,\" \"so weak and tired,\" which highlights her distress rather than minimization. - Information flow: She volunteers extensive information upfront, showing openness and a desire to be understood. She is well-organized in her responses and reluctant to withhold details. - Response style: She is elaborate and descriptive, providing a comprehensive picture of her symptoms and concerns.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None evident; she appears forthcoming. - Minimization behaviors: Minimal; she emphasizes her symptoms' severity, indicating she perceives her condition accurately or possibly tends to overstate due to anxiety. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional tone and detailed description suggest some amplification of her distress, consistent with an anxious personality. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not present; she is open, polite, and engaged. - Confusion/memory issues: Absent. - Family influence: Her mention of catching illness from grandkids reflects concern about exposure but doesn't indicate response bias.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slightly amplified concern about severity, driven by age and worry, but overall her report seems accurate. - Severity: Mild; her detailed and consistent account suggests minimal distortion. - Areas most affected: Her perception of risk and seriousness, possibly inflating her sense of danger due to anxiety. - Reliability: Fairly high; her honesty and verbosity support trustworthy self-reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Given her openness, little critical info is probably withheld. However, she may overestimate risk, which could influence her emotional state. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not applicable; she emphasizes how bad she feels. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of serious illness and susceptibility at her age are likely heightened, which is understandable but may color her perception. - True timeline: The progression aligns with typical flu onset\u2014symptoms started two days ago and worsening, which she reports clearly.

    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration phase, it\u2019s important to build rapport and deepen understanding of the patient's experience. Since she has outlined her symptoms and concerns already, I should explore how these symptoms began, their progression, and how they\u2019re affecting her daily life, to better grasp the severity and context. Asking about her perspective on her illness can also reassure her that I value her input, which can help establish trust. Given her detailed report, open-ended questions that encourage elaboration on her experience will be most effective here.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise timeline of symptom development, specific functional impacts, and her concerns about severity. - Diagnostic priorities: Further understanding of symptom progression, onset details, and associated factors to differentiate between viral, bacterial, or other causes. - Patient factors: Her expressive and detailed communication style suggests she responds well to open-ended prompts; her anxiety might lead to some amplification, but trust appears high. - Interview phase goals: Encourage elaboration on her initial symptoms, explore the course and fluctuations, and understand her personal experience and worries.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, encouraging detailed narrative. - Information target: Symptom onset, changes over time, current severity, any new or worsening symptoms, impact on daily activities, and her emotional response. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathic, language that invites her to tell her story fully without feeling hurried or judged. - Expected value: This will enrich the symptom timeline and help identify any additional signs that may influence management and diagnosis.\nANSWER: \u201cTell me more about how these symptoms started and how they\u2019ve been evolving over the last couple of days.

    "input": "The patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with a two-day history of high fever over 102\u00b0F, systemic muscle aches, headache, chills with rigors, sweating episodes, weakness, fatigue, cough, and sneezing. Her description of symptoms indicates significant systemic illness, consistent with a viral infection such as influenza. However, her emotional communication patterns suggest her perception of severity may be heightened by anxiety, potentially leading to exaggeration of symptoms. Objective clinical signs such as respiratory distress or mental status changes are not currently documented but require assessment. Further evaluation is necessary to rule out complications like pneumonia, dehydration, or other systemic issues, and additional inquiry into mild or subtle symptoms that she may be minimizing or unaware of is recommended.1. Diagnosis: Influenza Justification: Acutely high fever (>102\u00b0F), systemic muscle aches, headache, chills with rigors, sweating, cough, and sneezing strongly suggest influenza, which is common in this age group during flu season.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial Pneumonia Justification: Cough and systemic symptoms raise concern for pneumonia, especially if accompanied by abnormal lung findings or oxygen desaturation; common complication of influenza.  3. Diagnosis: COVID-19 Justification: Similar symptoms including fever, cough, weakness; prevalence warrants inclusion in differential, particularly in the current context.  4. Diagnosis: Other Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (common cold) Justification: Cough, sneezing, mild systemic symptoms; less severe but possible; however, the high fever and rigors favor more serious infections.  5. Diagnosis: Dehydration Justification: Fever, sweating, weakness, and fatigue increase risk of dehydration, especially if fluid intake is inadequate.  6. Diagnosis: Sinusitis Justification: Headache, cough, sneezing; may occur secondary to viral infections; usually milder but possible.  7. Diagnosis: Early Presentation of Sepsis Justification: High fever with systemic symptoms might indicate early sepsis, especially if bacterial superinfection exists; warrants close monitoring.  8. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome Justification: Fatigue and systemic symptoms are nonspecific but must be ruled out, especially in elderly females, though lack of chest pain reduces likelihood.  9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Patient's perception of severity may be heightened by anxiety, which can mimic or exaggerate symptoms, though physical findings are primary.  10. Diagnosis: Influenza Complication (e.g., Encephalopathy or Myositis) Justification: Rare but possible severe complications of influenza; considering if neurological or muscular symptoms significantly worsen.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally loaded, descriptive phrases like \"feeling really awful,\" \"so much I have to change clothes,\" signaling high experiential engagement. She responds straightforwardly but with emphasis on severity, demonstrating genuine distress. There is a mixture of specific symptom descriptions and some mild emotional exaggeration, consistent with anxiety-driven reporting. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming, volunteering key details about symptom onset, progression, and concerns. Her responses are organized around her main complaints, indicating clarity rather than scattershot data. - Response style: She provides elaboration on her experience without excessive tangential details, showing a direct, honest reporting style, though influenced by her anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None apparent; she openly states her symptoms and concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Very little evidence; she clearly emphasizes the severity (\"really awful,\" \"so much I can\u2019t get comfortable\"). If anything, she might slightly understate her functional impairment. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional descriptions and repeated worries about serious outcomes suggest some amplification due to anxiety but not exaggerated dishonestly. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; her tone and openness indicate comfort with sharing. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline from onset to present is consistent. - Family influence: Mention of grandchildren and living in a crowded building possibly heightens her concern about infectiousness, indicating her family situation influences her worries.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification of symptoms and concerns regarding severity. - Severity: Moderate, as her emotional state colors her perception but does not distort her descriptions of core symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her perceived seriousness of illness and fears about complications like pneumonia, which are amplified by anxiety. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy regarding her symptoms, but her heightened concern may lead her to overestimate how severe or urgent her condition truly is.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might underreport functional limitations or her capacity to manage daily activities; she may also have unspoken worries about her ability to recover. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possible that her fatigue or inability to sleep is more debilitating than she reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of worsening or developing complications like pneumonia is heightened by anxiety. - True timeline: Symptom onset and progression seem accurately reported, though her emotional state could lead to perception of rapid deterioration.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to explore her understanding and feelings about her illness to deepen rapport and assess her perception of severity. - Since she's expressing worry and describing symptoms vividly, I should ask about her thoughts and concerns in her own words. - It's important to gauge whether she perceives her illness as more serious than typical, which may influence her management behaviors. - This adds an emotional and cognitive dimension to her symptom description, enriching the data for differential diagnosis. - Framing an open-ended question that invites her to share her feelings about her illness will help me understand her overall experience and worries.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, focusing on her thoughts and emotional response. - Information target: Patients\u2019 perception of severity, concerns about illness, understanding, and emotional impact. - Communication approach: Gentle and validating language that encourages sharing without making her feel judged or worried about saying the \"wrong\" thing. - Expected value: Gaining insight into her mental state, health beliefs, and degree of anxiety, which can influence both diagnosis and therapeutic rapport.\nANSWER: \"That sounds very difficult, and I can see you're really worried about how serious this might be.

    "input": "The patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with a two-day history of high fever exceeding 102\u00b0F, systemic muscle aches, headache, chills with rigors, episodes of profuse sweating, weakness, fatigue, cough, and sneezing. These symptoms are consistent with a viral illness, likely influenza. Objective assessment should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, respiratory distress, or mental status changes, recognizing her potential undervaluation of functional impairment. Further inquiry is necessary to determine the severity of her weakness, ability to perform daily activities, and to identify any subtle or worsening symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or confusion that could indicate complications. Her communication biases suggest she might be experiencing more profound functional decline and systemic illness than she reports, emphasizing the importance of careful physical examination and targeted questioning.1. Diagnosis: Influenza Justification: The acute onset of high fever, myalgia, headache, chills, sweating, cough, and sneezing over two days aligns closely with influenza, especially in an older adult during flu season. The systemic nature and rapid progression support this as the primary diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Other viral respiratory infection (e.g., COVID-19) Justification: Similar respiratory and systemic symptoms with rapid onset could also be due to other viruses like COVID-19. Age and symptom pattern make it plausible, though influenza remains more probable given typical presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial pneumonia Justification: The cough and fever could indicate secondary bacterial pneumonia, especially if initial viral infection worsens or if physical exam reveals respiratory findings, but current evidence favors a viral etiology.  4. Diagnosis: Sinusitis or other URIs Justification: Headache, cough, and sneezing can suggest sinusitis; however, the high fever and systemic aches are more characteristic of influenza or viral illness rather than isolated sinus infection.  5. Diagnosis: Dengue fever or other tropical infection Justification: Systemic high fever with rigors and sweating might be seen in tropical infections; however, absent epidemiological clues, this remains less likely.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague and hedging language (\"kind of started,\" \"like I was all sore\") which can obscure symptom severity. She employs emotional descriptors (\"really bad,\" \"so much,\" \"feel really sick\") highlighting distress but may overstate fear or worry. - Information flow: She seems somewhat guarded initially, revealing key symptoms when prompted but withholding full detail unless specifically asked. Her responses are organized but surface-level, reflecting possible hesitations in full disclosure. - Response style: She provides concise answers but switches to more detailed descriptions when asked about progression, indicating a moderate tendency to withhold full extent of symptoms or to minimize them voluntarily.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The use of vague language and hedging suggests she might be underreporting the full severity of her symptoms, especially regarding weakness and functional limitations. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just really sick and tired\" suggest she is downplaying symptom severity, possibly to avoid appearing overly fragile or to keep focus on her worry. - Amplification patterns: The emphasis on feeling \"really sick,\" \"so much sweating,\" and \"so bad\" indicates she carefully amplifies certain symptoms in her narrative, perhaps seeking reassurance or validation of her distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs, but her language might reflect some discomfort discussing the full impact of her illness. - Confusion/memory issues: Timeline appears consistent, so no evidence of confusion. - Family influence: Mentioning catching illness from grandkids could heighten her anxiety, possibly leading to overemphasis or bias towards believing her condition is worse.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization of physical symptoms coupled with emotional amplification; she underrepresents how weak or debilitated she feels, while overexpressing her worry. - Severity: Moderate, since her vague language and hedging can impact accurate assessment but her overall responses are fairly coherent. - Areas most affected: Severity of weakness and functional impairment; her focus on emotional worry may skew perceived danger. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional state and language suggest some under- or over-reporting, so clinical judgment should consider subtle inconsistencies.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: True extent of her weakness and how it limits her daily activities; she may understate signs of deterioration. - Symptoms probably minimized: Degree of fatigue and functional impact is likely more severe than reported. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about serious illness and hospitalization reflect genuine anxiety, which may influence her reporting. - True timeline: Symptom progression might be more rapid or severe; her descriptions suggest she perceives her illness as serious, but her language indicates some minimization, so the actual severity could be understated.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise assessment of her current level of weakness, impact on daily functioning, and identification of any new or worsening respiratory or neurological symptoms that could suggest complications. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm the severity of systemic illness, rule out signs of respiratory compromise or dehydration, and gather details differentiating influenza from other viral etiologies such as COVID-19. - Patient factors: Her tendency to use vague language and emotional exaggeration suggests I should ask for concrete examples and clarify her functional status with specific questions, while empathizing with her distress. - Interview phase goals: Clarify the extent of her weakness, functional limitations, any new or worsening respiratory symptoms, and her understanding of her illness.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to quantify weakness and functional impairment, and confirmatory questions for new symptom development. - Information target: Severity of weakness, ability to perform activities of daily living, presence of shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, or chest pain. - Communication approach: Use gentle, specific prompts acknowledging her previous responses to encourage detailed, honest reporting without making her feel judged. - Expected value: This will refine assessment of illness severity, identify potential complication signs, and guide need for urgent intervention.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned feeling really weak and tired. Can you tell me specifically how your strength compares to before you got sick\u2014are you able to get up from a chair, walk around your house, or do your usual activities?

    "input": "The patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with a two-day history of high fever exceeding 102\u00b0F, systemic muscle aches, headache, chills with rigors, episodes of profuse sweating, and cough. She reports feeling weak and tired, but her responses suggest her actual functional capacity is more impaired than she indicates, with probable difficulty in performing basic activities such as standing or walking. She appears to minimize her symptoms and limitations, possibly due to protective biases. No overt signs of respiratory distress were documented, but subtle functional declines and systemic effects are likely present. Further specific inquiry into her ability to perform daily activities and assessments for dehydration or respiratory compromise are indicated to obtain an accurate clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial Community-Acquired Pneumonia Justification: The patient's high fever, cough, systemic muscle aches, and signs of systemic illness are consistent with pneumonia. Age increases risk for bacterial pneumonia, and rapid symptom onset with rigors suggests a bacterial etiology rather than viral. Although no overt respiratory distress is noted, subtle functional decline supports pulmonary infection as the underlying cause.  2. Diagnosis: Sepsis secondary to pneumonia Justification: The systemic symptoms, high fever, chills with rigors, and weakness indicate a potential progression to sepsis, especially considering her age and possible impaired immune response. The episodes of profuse sweating and overall functional decline further support a systemic infectious process that could lead to sepsis if untreated.  3. Diagnosis: Influenza or another viral respiratory infection Justification: Viral illnesses like influenza present with high fever, myalgias, headache, and cough, which align with her symptoms. The rapid onset and systemic features make a viral etiology plausible, particularly in the context of current epidemiological trends. However, the severity and rigors lean slightly more toward bacterial causes.  4. Diagnosis: Atypical pneumonia (e.g., Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila) Justification: While less likely given the severity and systemic signs, atypical pneumonia can manifest with high fever, cough, and mild respiratory distress. They tend to cause less intense rigors but cannot be excluded without further testing, especially in an elderly patient.  5. Diagnosis: Acute Viral or Bacterial Bronchitis Justification: The cough and systemic symptoms could reflect bronchitis, especially in early stages, but given the degree of systemic illness and high fever, this is lower on the list. It does not fully account for the systemic features or the severity of symptoms, but it remains a differential diagnosis to consider.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation and non-specific responses to questions about her strength and activity levels suggest she may be withholding the full extent of her functional impairment. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying her weakness (\"haven\u2019t tried to do very much,\" \"just feel so tired\") to possibly avoid sounding too fragile. - Amplification patterns: Not apparent; she appears somewhat subdued and hesitant rather than overly worried or alarmist. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but her vague answers may reflect discomfort about her weakness or reluctance to alarm. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence. - Family influence: No clear influence observable from her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, evident in her tentative language and reluctance to specify her limitations, possibly to avoid appearing more ill or dependent. - Severity: Moderate, as her responses suggest she may hide the severity of her functional decline. - Areas most affected: Her physical capacity and daily functioning details, which are understated. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reporting likely underestimates her true impairment, so clinicians should probe with specific functional questions.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The full extent of her weakness and whether she's able to perform basic activities, which could influence treatment planning and safety assessments. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her degree of functional impairment and fatigue; she may be more debilitated than her responses indicate. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about serious illness or complications, which are understandable but may not fully reflect her actual capabilities. - True timeline: The reported symptom progression appears plausible but could be more severe or rapid in reality, given the potential for underreporting of functional decline.",

Her communication pattern indicates possible underestimation of her physical deficits, necessitating further objective assessment of mobility, hydration, and respiratory function.Severe influenza or bacterial pneumonia ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She favors vague and moderate descriptors like \"can't really do much\" and \"feel too exhausted,\" indicating some hesitance to specify extent. Her emotional tone reveals concern, but she avoids dramatization, possibly to maintain composure. - Information flow: She answers questions directly but limits detail unless prompted. She does not volunteer extensive information about her activities or symptoms, reflecting cautious sharing. - Response style: Responses are concise, somewhat guarded, and consistent, with no tangential elaborations. She shows resistance to revealing the full extent of her disabilities without explicit questioning.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She may be intentionally underreporting the severity of her functional impairment, as evidenced by her vague descriptions and reluctance to specify about her activities or limits unless pressed. - Minimization behaviors: Her statements minimize how difficult her daily activities have become, likely underestimating her actual disability. - Amplification patterns: While she expresses concern, she possibly exaggerates her worry to solicit reassurance, especially about her ability to recover, revealing moderate anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Her indirectly downplaying her disability suggests discomfort or shame about her declining function. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indicators. - Family influence: No explicit signs, responses appear internally generated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate underreporting of physical limitations combined with anxiety-driven exaggeration of concern. - Severity: Moderate, because her self-assessment appears somewhat understated regarding her functional status, influenced by emotional factors. - Areas most affected: Functional ability, particularly her perception of weakness and activity restrictions, which are central to severity assessment. - Reliability: Slightly compromised; her anxiety might lead to over-worrying about health risks, but her factual responses are generally coherent.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise quantification of her weakness, daily activity restrictions, and subtler symptoms like dizziness or balance issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: Degree of her functional impairment and fatigue; she might be more incapacitated than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about health deterioration and hospitalization risks, possibly overestimating threats. - True timeline: The decline may be more sudden or profound than her report suggests, indicating that her self-perception may lag behind her actual physical status due to emotional factors.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need to clarify her actual functional limitations, specifically whether her mobility and self-care activities are as severely affected as she reports, and whether there are any subtle or additional symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath, or confusion that could influence diagnosis or management. - Diagnostic priorities: Given her high fever, systemic symptoms, and weakness, differentiating between severe influenza, bacterial pneumonia, or possible dehydration or other systemic infections remains critical. Confirming the extent of her functional impairment and any signs of respiratory compromise will guide urgency and treatment. - Patient factors: Her guarded communication pattern, tendency to minimize symptoms, and possible anxiety require a sensitive, collaborative question approach that encourages honesty without causing defensiveness or worry. - Interview phase goals: To obtain precise details about her current physical state, assess for red flags suggesting complication (e.g., dehydration, respiratory distress), and confirm whether her reported limitations are consistent with her overall illness.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to quantify her functional status and explore any additional symptoms. Confirmatory questions to verify her reports and explore potential red flags. - Information target: Degree of weakness and functional impairment, presence of dizziness, breathlessness, or confusion, and understanding of her illness severity. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, gentle language to help her feel safe sharing full information, emphasizing that understanding her true situation is important for providing the best care. - Expected value: This will help confirm or refute the severity of her impairment, identify red flags needing urgent attention, and clarify her needs for treatment plans.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me about feeling very weak and unable to do your usual activities, I\u2019d like to understand a bit more about how you're doing today. For example, are you still able to get out of bed or walk around your house on your own, or are these activities becoming more difficult? Have you noticed any new dizziness, trouble breathing, or feeling faint when you move or stand up? Knowing these details will help us see how your illness is affecting you right now and ensure we\u2019re taking the right steps to help you recover comfortably.\"",
