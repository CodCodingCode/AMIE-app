    "input": "The patient's communication reveals moderate modesty regarding initial symptoms and possible underreporting of early discomforts, while current systemic and dermatological symptoms are emphasized, possibly overinterpreted by her. Her descriptions suggest that the initial genital discomfort could be more persistent or severe than reported, and the systemic symptoms may be amplified or more comprehensive than she indicates. She may be withholding details about specific exposures, prior episodes, or additional associated signs such as discharge or foul odor. Recognizing these biases, the clinical vignette should reflect that her current complaints are well-documented but that early or less overt symptoms might be more significant and warrants further probing for complete assessment. Patient demographics: 28-year-old woman. Chief complaint: Persistent discomfort down there, joint pains, skin bumps, and systemic sensation of feverishness.1. Diagnosis: Sexually Transmitted Infection (Syphilis)\nJustification: Genital discomfort paired with systemic symptoms and skin lesions (such as bumps) suggests secondary syphilis, which commonly presents with skin rash, mucous patches, and systemic symptoms, especially in young women.\n2. Diagnosis: Autoimmune/connective tissue disorder (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)\nJustification: Multi-system involvement including skin, joints, and systemic symptoms like fever align with SLE, common in women of reproductive age. The skin bumps and joint pains are characteristic features.\n3. Diagnosis: Gonorrhea or Chlamydia with disseminated infection\nJustification: Persistent genital discomfort and joint pains may represent disseminated gonococcal infection, which often causes dermatitis, tenosynovitis, and polyarthralgia in sexually active young women.\n4. Diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus Infection\nJustification: Persistent genital discomfort and possible skin lesions could indicate herpes, which may sometimes be associated with systemic flu-like symptoms, particularly if not fully reported.\n5. Diagnosis: Psoriasis or other dermatologic condition with joint involvement (Psoriatic arthritis)\nJustification: Skin bumps and joint pains could represent psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis, especially if skin findings are characteristic, though systemic symptoms are less typical.\n6. Diagnosis: Reactive Arthritis (Reiter\u2019s syndrome)\nJustification: Often occurs after urogenital or gastrointestinal infections, presenting with genital discomfort, skin lesions, and arthritis.\n7. Diagnosis: Viral exanthem (e.g., viral hepatitis or mononucleosis)\nJustification: Systemic symptoms like fever and skin bumps could be part of viral infections, though genital discomfort is less characteristic.\n8. Diagnosis: Disseminated Bacterial Infection (e.g., tuberculosis)\nJustification: Though less common, systemic symptoms and skin lesions can occur in disseminated bacterial infections, especially in immunocompromised states.\n9. Diagnosis: Early localized Lyme disease or other vector-borne illnesses\nJustification: Fever and skin manifestations could suggest a tick-borne illness, though genital discomfort is less typical unless coincidentally affected.\n10. Diagnosis: Less likely autoimmune or infectious diagnoses (e.g., sarcoidosis, other vasculitides)\nJustification: These are important to consider but less likely without specific additional findings; still part of comprehensive differential.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: She alternates between vague descriptions (\"stuff,\" \"a little bumps\") and more emotive expressions (\"felt like I was burning up\"), balancing non-specificity with attempts to convey seriousness.\n- Information flow: Generally forthcoming, with a narrative structure that spans from early to recent symptoms. She provides a detailed timeline, indicating a desire to be understood.\n- Response style: Elaborate and detailed, with patterns of adding context and clarifying her experience rather than minimal or evasive answers.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance or tendency to downplay initial or sensitive symptoms (vaginal discomfort, skin lesions), possibly to avoid embarrassment or minimize perceived severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of vague terms for symptoms (\"stuff,\" \"kind of tender,\" \"a little bumps\") to lessen their apparent severity, which could obscure the full clinical picture.\n- Amplification patterns: Vivid descriptions of systemic feelings (\"burning up\") suggest she may try to convey urgency, perhaps to compensate for perceived underreporting of initial symptoms.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Vague discussion of vaginal discomfort indicates potential modesty or discomfort discussing intimate symptoms.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in emphasis on timeline but overall coherent; no clear evidence of memory impairment.\n- Family influence: No observable signs within her responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimized reporting of initial and sensitive symptoms, possibly combined with modesty bias.\n- Severity: Moderate\u2014some symptoms may be understated, affecting the clinical picture without fully distorting it.\n- Areas most affected: Early symptoms (vaginal discomfort, skin lesions) are most likely to be understated or less elaborated.\n- Reliability: Moderate trust\u2014her openness for most symptoms suggests reliability, but her subtle language choices indicate some degree of bias toward downplaying certain information.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Details of early or less obvious symptoms, behaviors, or exposures related to initial discomfort.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of initial vaginal symptoms and perhaps the skin lesions, which might be more problematic than described.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Her vivid account of systemic reactions may be heightened, reflecting distress rather than objective severity.\n- True timeline: The progression probably reflects reality, though the emphasis on recent worsening might overshadow the initial severity or duration of earlier symptoms.",

    "input": "A 28-year-old woman presents with complaints of persistent discomfort in the genital area that began approximately one week ago, which she initially described as mild and non-specific. Over the past few days, she reports the development of intermittent joint pains affecting her wrists and ankles, as well as tender skin bumps on her arms and legs that appeared about two days prior. She also experienced chills and a subjective fever yesterday morning. While she emphasizes systemic symptoms and dermatological findings, her account suggests that the initial genital discomfort may have been more significant than she reports, potentially underplaying its severity. There is no explicit mention of abnormal vaginal discharge or foul odor, but further assessment is needed to evaluate for local signs of infection or inflammation. The timeline indicates that the primary systemic and dermatological symptoms developed subsequent to the initial genital discomfort, though communication biases suggest her early symptoms might have been more bothersome or persistent than described. Additional details regarding vaginal discharge, urinary symptoms, and exposure history are necessary for comprehensive evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's Syndrome)\nJustification: The combination of genitourinary symptoms, joint pains, and skin lesions suggests reactive arthritis, particularly if there was recent genital discomfort; this commonly affects young adults and presents with conjunctivitis, urethritis, arthritis, and skin lesions.\n2. Diagnosis: Sexually Transmitted Infection (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis infection)\nJustification: Genital discomfort, potential history of exposure, and systemic features could be linked to an STI, which can cause urethritis and related systemic symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Psoriatic Arthritis\nJustification: The tender skin bumps (papules or plaques) on extremities could be psoriasis, which can be associated with psoriatic arthritis, presenting with joint pain and skin changes.\n4. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: Young women are at risk; systemic symptoms, skin findings, and joint pains are characteristic, though the skin lesions are unspecified, the systemic presentation makes it a possibility.\n5. Diagnosis: Gonorrheal or Chlamydial Urethritis or Cervicitis\nJustification: Initial genital discomfort could relate to bacterial STI, potentially progressing or associated with systemic symptoms if disseminated.\n6. Diagnosis: Disseminated Gonococcal Infection\nJustification: Can cause skin pustules or dermatitis, joint pains, and genital symptoms, especially if initial genital infection was unrecognized.\n7. Diagnosis: Viral Exanthem or Viral Infection (e.g., Parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr Virus)\nJustification: Viral illnesses can cause systemic symptoms, joint pains, and skin lesions; however, genital discomfort is less common.\n8. Diagnosis: Disseminated Candidiasis or Other Fungal Infection\nJustification: Less likely without immunosuppression, but skin bumps could be fungal lesions; systemic symptoms are less typical.\n9. Diagnosis: Hairy Cell Leukemia or Hematologic Disorder\nJustification: Rare at this age; unlikely given primary presentation, but systemic involvement and skin lesions can rarely align.\n10. Diagnosis: Contact Dermatitis or Allergic Reaction\nJustification: Skin bumps and discomfort could fit, but systemic symptoms like fever and joint pains are less characteristic and less likely.\nSTOP HERE.

    "input": "A 28-year-old woman presents with a history of genital discomfort beginning approximately one week ago, characterized by a burning sensation and a subjective feeling of abnormality. She also reports recent development of intermittent joint pain affecting her wrists and ankles, tender skin bumps on the extremities that appeared within the past two days, and recent chills accompanied by a subjective fever. Communication suggests her initial genital discomfort may have been more persistent and bothersome than she acknowledges, and she may be withholding details regarding symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge or local inflammation. The systemic and dermatological manifestations appear recent but are likely more severe than she describes, given her guarded reporting style. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to clarify the presence of local signs of infection or inflammation.1. Diagnosis: Genital herpes (Herpes Simplex Virus)\nJustification: The genital discomfort with a burning sensation suggests herpetic outbreak; HSV is common in young women, and initial episodes typically last about a week with systemic symptoms possible.\n2. Diagnosis: Chlamydial or gonococcal cervicitis/infection\nJustification: Common STI presenting with genital discomfort; may be asymptomatic or cause mucopurulent discharge and local inflammation, often with minimal initial systemic symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: Young woman with joint pain, skin bumps, and systemic symptoms such as fever/chills suggests autoimmune disease; skin and joint involvement support this.\n4. Diagnosis: Reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome)\nJustification: Affects young adults; characterized by arthritis, skin changes, and sometimes mucous membrane involvement following infection, aligning with her joint and skin findings.\n5. Diagnosis: Sebaceous or epidermal skin cysts\nJustification: The skin bumps appearing recently could be benign cysts; less likely to explain systemic symptoms but common skin findings.\n6. Diagnosis: Cephalva or molluscum contagiosum\nJustification: Skin bumps on extremities could fit these viral/bacterial skin infections, though less associated with systemic symptoms.\n7. Diagnosis: Psoriatic arthritis\nJustification: Skin and joint findings in a young woman suggest psoriasis, which can involve joint inflammation, although no skin plaques are described explicitly.\n8. Diagnosis: Disseminated gonorrhea infection\nJustification: Gonorrhea can cause systemic symptoms, including joint pain (gonococcal arthritis) and skin lesions, especially if untreated.\n9. Diagnosis: Fibromyalgia\nJustification: Widespread joint pain and subjective systemic symptoms could suggest fibromyalgia, though less consistent with acute systemic signs and skin findings.\n10. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or local skin infection\nJustification: The skin bumps could be infected areas; however, systemic symptoms and multiple lesions favor a more systemic process.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague and somewhat dismissive language (\"weird,\" \"not sure,\" \"kinda\") that may mask true severity.

    "input": "Patient demographics: 28-year-old woman. Chief complaint: Ongoing genital discomfort, systemic symptoms, and skin changes, with potential underreporting of severity and specific local signs. Present illness: The patient reports a one-week history of genital discomfort characterized by a burning sensation and a feeling of abnormality. She also notes the recent onset of intermittent joint pain affecting the wrists and ankles, which she describes as come and go. Over the past two days, she has observed tender skin bumps on her arms and legs. Systemic symptoms began more acutely with chills and feelings of being hot and shivery, suggestive of a possible fever. However, she describes her initial genital discomfort as persistent but not worsening, and she does not clearly acknowledge symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, soreness, or local inflammation\u2014though these may be present but underreported. The timeline indicates systemic and dermatological signs are recent and potentially more severe than suggested, but communication hesitations hinder a complete assessment.1. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: The patient exhibits multisystem involvement\u2014skin manifestations (tender bumps), joint pain affecting wrists and ankles, systemic symptoms (chills, feeling hot, shivery), and ongoing genital discomfort. SLE commonly presents with skin rashes or bumps (e.g., malar rash, discoid lesions, or immune complex vasculitis), arthralgia or arthritis, constitutional symptoms, and sometimes genital or mucosal involvement. The systemic nature, recurrent joint pain, and skin findings are characteristic of SLE, making it the most probable of autoimmune conditions.\n2. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Small Vessel Vasculitis)\nJustification: The tender skin bumps on arms and legs suggest small vessel vasculitis (like leukocytoclastic vasculitis), which can cause palpable purpura, skin nodules, or bumps linked with immune complex deposition. This could also explain systemic symptoms and joint involvement. Given the skin findings' tender nature and systemic signs, vasculitis remains a strong differential, especially if skin biopsy confirms immune complex involvement.\n3. Diagnosis: Infectious Causes such as Sexually Transmitted Infection or Other Systemic Infection\nJustification: While less likely given the systemic autoimmune signs, infectious etiologies (e.g., disseminated gonorrhea or syphilis, viral infections like hepatitis or HIV) can produce systemic symptoms, skin findings, and genital discomfort. Absence of localized infectious signs makes this less probable but still a consideration, especially with systemic symptoms like chills and shivering.\n4. Diagnosis: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or other connective tissue disorder\nJustification: RA typically involves small joints like wrists and ankles, and systemic symptoms can occur; however, the skin findings described are less characteristic. Still, considering RA due to joint involvement is justified, although the skin and systemic signs lean more toward SLE or vasculitis.\n5. Diagnosis: Psoriasis or Other Dermatoses with Systemic Manifestations\nJustification: Skin bumps could theoretically be related to psoriasis or other dermatologic conditions. However, the systemic symptoms and joint pain make psoriasis less likely as the primary diagnosis but is considered due to skin findings and systemic overlap syndromes.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague, non-specific, and hesitant wording, often using softening phrases like \"kinda,\" \"not sure,\" and \"weird,\" which dilute the clarity of symptom descriptions.\n- Information flow: Responses are somewhat reluctant and minimal, primarily driven by explicit questions; they avoid volunteering detailed or sensitive information unless explicitly prompted.\n- Response style: The style appears cautious, slightly scattered in that they defer certainty, indicating discomfort or shyness about disclosing certain symptoms openly.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient avoids definitively stating whether symptoms have worsened or persisted, indicating reluctance to fully disclose.\n- Minimization behaviors: Language that downplays symptom severity (\"not sure if it\u2019s worse,\" \"kind of,\" \"weird\") suggests they are minimizing discomfort or concern.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration; responses tend toward understatement, likely to avoid shame or embarrassment.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Use of shamed self-references (\"stupid,\" \"embarrassed\") and hedging reflects discomfort discussing genitourinary symptoms, impacting open sharing.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Some vagueness about symptoms\u2019 status suggests internal uncertainty rather than memory lapses.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence, but discomfort could be internally influenced or due to societal notions about discussing such issues.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization bias, primarily evidenced by the patient's downplaying and vague descriptions of symptoms, especially regarding genital discomfort.\n- Severity: Moderate, as responses show uncertainty and avoidance but do not entirely deny symptoms.\n- Areas most affected: Genital symptoms and systemic symptom severity are most biased; patient underrepresents their true experience likely due to embarrassment.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses are cautious, indicating that self-reporting should be interpreted with awareness of possible underreporting.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Full extent of genital discomfort, persistent or worsening symptoms, and possibly other related signs the patient opts not to share.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The severity or persistence of discomfort and systemic symptoms like fever or joint pain may be greater than described.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress, embarrassment, or shame about sexual health could cause under-disclosure, hiding true symptom severity.\n- True timeline: The actual progression might be more rapid or severe; the patient\u2019s tentative language suggests they may be underestimating or hiding the true course.\nThis analysis indicates the need for sensitive inquiry, reassurance, and perhaps indirect questioning to elicit more accurate symptom reporting.",

    "input": "The patient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with a one-week history of genital discomfort characterized by a burning or abnormal sensation, which she reports as persistent but not worsening, and tends to minimize or hedge in description. She also reports recent systemic symptoms including chills, feeling hot, and shivering, which may suggest fever. She describes intermittent joint pain affecting wrists and ankles, which she reports as come-and-go. Additionally, she has observed tender skin bumps on her arms and legs over the past two days. Communication patterns indicate she may underreport or conceal certain symptoms, such as abnormal vaginal discharge or additional local signs, which warrants further gentle inquiry. The timeline suggests systemic and skin symptoms are relatively recent and possibly more severe than stated, but she communicates with some hesitance, affecting full assessment. Missing information includes detailed local genital findings, presence of any abnormal discharge, itching, soreness, or other signs, as well as comprehensive systemic symptom severity and duration.1. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: The combination of systemic symptoms (chills, feeling hot, shivering), skin findings (tender bumps on arms and legs which could be subacute cutaneous lupus lesions), and intermittent joint pain aligns with SLE, which commonly affects women of this age and can present with systemic, cutaneous, and joint manifestations. The skin bumps may represent lupus panniculitis or vasculopathic lesions. The systemic symptoms suggest ongoing inflammation or autoimmunity.\n2. Diagnosis: Infectious etiology\u2014Herpes simplex virus (HSV) or other sexually transmitted infection\nJustification: Genital discomfort with burning sensation raises possibility of herpes, especially if lesions or ulcers are present (though not explicitly seen). Herpes can cause systemic symptoms like mild fever and malaise, and possibly affect the skin and mucous membranes. Given the iterated nature of genital symptoms and the underreporting of local signs, recurrent herpes remains plausible, noting that some skin bumps might be mistaken or early lesions.\n3. Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis\nJustification: The tender skin bumps on arms and legs could be Gottron\u2019s papules or similar eruptions seen in dermatomyositis, which can also involve systemic symptoms and joint pain. Although less common in this presentation without classic muscle weakness, dermatomyositis can manifest initially with skin and joint symptoms and systemic features.\n4. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Cutaneous Small Vessel Vasculitis)\nJustification: The tender skin bumps and systemic symptoms may be explained by vasculitis, which can cause palpable purpura, systemic illness, and joint involvement. The systemic symptoms support an inflammatory or autoimmune vascular process.\n5. Diagnosis: Reactive Arthritis\nJustification: The combination of genital discomfort, joint pains, and skin lesions could be consistent with reactive arthritis, especially given recent onset and systemic features. However, the absence of confirmed infectious trigger (e.g., GI or genitourinary infection) makes this less certain. Still, it's included as a lower-ranked potential.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and hedging language, such as \"kind of,\" \"not really,\" and \"I think,\" particularly regarding sensitive symptoms, which indicates discomfort or reluctance.\n- Information flow: They tend to be hesitant, providing minimal details unless prompted repeatedly, and often hedge responses, suggesting withholding of full information. Their responses are organized but cautious.\n- Response style: Responses are minimal, sometimes non-specific, and show signs of emotional discomfort; they avoid elaborate descriptions of sensitive symptoms.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of hedging (\"I think,\" \"not really sure\") and vague descriptions indicate possible withholding or downplaying symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Describing discomfort as \"just uncomfortable\" or \"not really pain\" suggests they minimize the symptom severity intentionally.\n- Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; responses are restrained, potentially to avoid embarrassment.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Expressed discomfort sharing details about genital symptoms and concern about how they might be perceived highlight internal shame or embarrassment.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Uncertainty about whether symptoms have changed or worsened (\"I don\u2019t really know\") indicates possible hesitance or difficulty articulating their experience.\n- Family influence: Not observable from the responses provided.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be *minimization and concealment* influenced by embarrassment, leading to subjective underreporting of symptoms.\n- Severity: Moderate; key symptoms may be underrepresented, affecting clinical reliability.\n- Areas most affected: Genital discomfort and associated signs are most biased, as the patient downplays or avoids detailed discussion.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses are affected by emotional factors and hesitance, so clinical interpretation should consider potential underreporting.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient may not disclose the full extent of genital discomfort, discharge, or lesions, which are crucial for diagnosis.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The severity or presence of ongoing genital and systemic symptoms might be worse than described.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Their embarrassment may cause over-cautious responses, but overall they might under-report symptoms.\n- True timeline: The progression might be more rapid or severe than they report, given their hesitance and minimization.\nOverall, the clinician should be aware of potential underreporting and consider gentle probing or reassurance to elicit more accurate symptom details.",

    "input": "The patient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with a one-week history of genital discomfort described as burning or abnormal sensation, which has persisted without clear worsening or improvement. She reports recent systemic symptoms including chills, feeling hot, and shivering, which have begun in the past few days. She has observed tender, small, reddish bumps on her arms and legs that appeared approximately two days ago; she is uncertain about their initial appearance. She reports ongoing genital discomfort but is reserved about local signs such as discharge, soreness, or sores, and these may be underreported due to her guarded communication. The overall presentation suggests a potential infectious or inflammatory process affecting the genital area and skin, with recent systemic symptoms that could indicate a systemic illness; however, some symptom severity may be underestimated. Further detailed history and examination are necessary to clarify local signs and systemic illness severity.1. Diagnosis: Secondary Syphilis\nJustification: The presence of tender, reddish bumps on the skin along with systemic symptoms such as chills and feeling hot aligns with secondary syphilis, which often presents with a diffuse rash\u2014including on extremities\u2014and systemic symptoms. The genital discomfort may be related to mucocutaneous involvement or regional lymphadenopathy. Although classic secondary syphilis rash is often non-tender and involves the palmar and plantar surfaces, variations can occur, and systemic *flu-like* symptoms are common. The history of persistent genital discomfort could reflect primary or early secondary stages, especially if there was a primary chancre unnoticed or unreported.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral Exanthem (e.g., Varicella or herpes zoster)\nJustification: The recent appearance of small, tender, reddish skin bumps over arms and legs could be consistent with viral skin eruptions, notably varicella (chickenpox) or herpes zoster, especially if the skin lesions are vesicular or polymorphic. The systemic symptoms of chills and feeling hot can accompany viral illnesses. While the patient describes bumps as tender and red, which is less typical for classic varicella vesicles, prodromal or atypical presentations may occur.\n3. Diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection\nJustification: HSV infections can cause genital discomfort with regional tenderness, burning, or abnormal sensation. While the patient reports no clear sores or ulcerations, initial HSV lesions sometimes present as erythematous, tender papules or clusters that might be underreported, especially if guarded. Systemic symptoms are less prominent but can sometimes be present.\n4. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or other bacterial skin infection\nJustification: The description of tender, reddish bumps might be consistent with localized bacterial skin infections like cellulitis or folliculitis, especially given their tender nature. However, the systemic symptoms suggest a broader infectious process rather than localized skin infection alone. This is considered less likely but still possible.\n5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune or inflammatory dermatosis (e.g., erythema multiforme)\nJustification: The skin findings could reflect an immune-mediated process, especially if new lesions appeared recently. However, the systemic symptoms would be somewhat atypical unless associated with infection or medication reactions. Nonetheless, it remains in differential due to the skin findings.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient's wording leans toward vagueness and minimization, using phrases like \"a little weird feeling,\" \"not really pain,\" and \"kind of tender,\" which suggests an attempt to downplay or avoid revealing full severity.\n- Information flow: Responses are generally reluctant and somewhat scattered, with the patient providing minimal details unless explicitly prompted, indicating guardedness.\n- Response style: They tend to be minimal and tentative, often hedging their answers and showing discomfort discussing sensitive topics, especially regarding their genital area.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Hesitation, vague responses about the onset and appearance of symptoms, and reluctance to specify details, reflect intentional or subconscious withholding.\n- Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms as \"not really pain,\" \"a little weird,\" and \"kinda tender\" suggests they are trying to reduce the perceived seriousness of their condition.\n- Amplification patterns: Not evident;
