    "input": "Patient demographics: 65-year-old man. Chief complaint: Sudden unilateral vision loss in the right eye. Present illness: Reports sudden loss of vision in the right eye occurring yesterday morning while reading. Describes the vision as blurry, especially in the central and lower visual fields. Mentions some fluctuations in vision clarity since onset, with periods of slight improvement. Does not report pain but expresses concern and fear about the condition. Given the language, the severity may be understated; actual impairment could be more significant. Timeline is focused on a recent onset with intermittent fluctuations, but details about prior episodes or other visual changes are limited.1. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion\nJustification: Sudden, painless vision loss with central and possibly inferior visual field defect, common in older adults due to embolism or thrombosis obstructing retinal blood flow; sudden onset makes it most probable.\n2. Diagnosis: Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION)\nJustification: Sudden painless monocular vision loss in an older patient, caused by ischemia of the anterior optic nerve head; fluctuations less typical but possible in evolving stages.\n3. Diagnosis: Ophthalmic Migraine (Visual Aura)\nJustification: Fluctuating visual symptoms and brief episodes of visual disturbance, although less likely given the severity and age; migraine can cause transient visual deficits.\n4. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment\nJustification: Sudden visual changes, especially if involving the lower visual field; however, typically involves floaters or flashes, which are not specified here.\n5. Diagnosis: Embolic Ischemic Stroke (Cortical Visual Impairment)\nJustification: Sudden visual symptoms with possible cortical involvement; less likely without other neurological signs but important to consider.\n6. Diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)\nJustification: Older patient with painless vision loss; requires assessment due to risk of bilateral blindness, especially if systemic symptoms are present (though not specified).\n7. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis\nJustification: Usually associated with pain and visual decline over days, more common in younger patients; less likely here.\n8. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage\nJustification: Sudden vision loss with floaters or curtain effect; not explicitly described but considered in differential.\n9. Diagnosis: Macular Degeneration (Dry or Wet)\nJustification: Common cause of visual impairment in older adults; typically gradual but can have acute decreases, especially wet AMD.\n10. Diagnosis: Intraocular Foreign Body or Trauma\nJustification: Sudden visual loss could relate to trauma; no history provided, so less likely, but must be considered in differential.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses mostly neutral, factual language but incorporates mild minimizations (\"a little better,\" \"not that bad\") and emotional expressions (\"scared\"). Their descriptions are somewhat vague, avoiding precise quantification of symptom fluctuations.\n- Information flow: They respond openly to direct questions but hold back detailed contextual information, possibly to maintain emotional control or avoid appearing overly alarmed. Their responses are organized but include vague qualifiers.\n- Response style: The patient tends to provide elaborated responses that include emotional content, but also uses vague terms that limit severity assessment, balancing honesty with self-protection.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence of withholding specific information; however, vague descriptors and mild minimizations suggest a tendency to downplay fluctuations or severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: The patient describes symptom variability as \"a little better sometimes and worse others,\" potentially underestimating the extent of fluctuating severity.\n- Amplification patterns: None evident; their anxiety seems genuine but not exaggerated.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, though mild hesitance in quantifying symptoms may indicate discomfort with perceived severity.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs of memory or timeline problems; their account seems internally consistent.\n- Family influence: External concern from the wife appears to influence their response, possibly causing slight underreporting to avoid alarming the clinician.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias, evidenced by vague descriptions and downplaying of symptom variability.\n- Severity: Moderate bias, as it could slightly distort assessment of symptom severity and progression, but not severely misleading.\n- Areas most affected: Fluctuation and severity of visual symptoms, due to language qualifiers.\n- Reliability: Fairly reliable for basic facts, though some details concerning *extent* and *severity* need cautious interpretation, as the patient may be subconsciously minimizing.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The true extent of symptom fluctuation and severity may be greater than reported, potentially obscuring the urgency of intervention.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Fluctuation in visual acuity and functional impact may be underreported.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety-related concerns are genuine but may be heightened by external influences; their actual perception of threat might be moderated.\n- True timeline: The timeline appears accurate but might underestimate ongoing fluctuations or progression severity, potentially leading to underappreciation of the urgency.",

    "input": "A 65-year-old man presents with a sudden onset of unilateral vision loss in the right eye, beginning yesterday morning. The visual disturbance is described as blurriness, predominantly affecting the central and lower visual fields, with intermittent fluctuation in clarity since onset. The patient denies eye pain but appears emotionally distressed, potentially influencing perceived severity. No additional neurological symptoms are reported at this time, but further assessment is necessary to confirm the absence of associated signs or subtler deficits.1. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion\nJustification: Sudden unilateral vision loss with visual field deficits, typical in patients over 50; often painless, caused by embolic occlusion leading to ischemia of the retina, can produce sudden, profound visual impairment.\n2. Diagnosis: Amaurosis Fugax (Transient Ischemic Attack of the Retina)\nJustification: Sudden, transient unilateral vision loss that fluctuates, common in embolic or thrombotic events affecting retinal circulation; typical in patients with vascular risk factors.\n3. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis\nJustification: Can cause sudden vision loss; usually painful with eye movement, but painless variants exist; visual field defects like central scotoma are characteristic.\n4. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Anterior)\nJustification: Sudden vision loss in older adults, often painless; typically affects the optic nerve head, can involve central and inferior visual fields as described.\n5. Diagnosis: Macular Degeneration (Neovascular or Atrophic)\nJustification: Common cause of central visual loss in the elderly; sudden loss less typical, but some forms can cause rapid deterioration; fluctuating vision may occur early.\n6. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment\nJustification: Can cause sudden visual field deficits; usually associated with floaters or flashes; painless, sudden visual loss in one eye.\n7. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage\nJustification: Sudden vision loss, potentially with floaters; painless; less likely to cause purely central visual field loss without other signs.\n8. Diagnosis: Diabetic Retinopathy with Acute Hemorrhage\nJustification: Common in diabetic patients leading to visual disturbances; sudden loss can occur from hemorrhages, but typically associated with known diabetics.\n9. Diagnosis: Intracranial Stroke involving Visual Pathways\nJustification: If visual disturbance is due to cortical events, would expect other neurological signs, which are absent here; less likely without additional deficits.\n10. Diagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration without Bleeding\nJustification: Usually leads to gradual vision loss, not sudden; fluctuating vision less characteristic in early stages.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged words (\"worried,\" \"scared\") and softens severity with vague terms (\"just happened,\" \"a little better\"), indicating a balance of concern and possible minimization.\n- Information flow: Generally forthcoming with key facts but may omit or downplay details that could be perceived as more severe, influenced by emotional distress.\n- Response style: Responses are detailed yet cautious, reflecting anxiety rather than deliberate withholding.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear withholding detected; responses are consistent and thorough, but emotional caution suggests some internal restraint.\n- Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just happened\" and \"a little better\" might downplay the actual severity or urgency.\n- Amplification patterns: The repeated emphasis on worry and fear indicates heightened emotional concern, possibly amplifying perceived severity.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity in describing symptom progression but aligned with typical anxiety-driven responses.\n- Family influence: Clear evidence the wife\u2019s concern influences patient responses, leading to increased expression of worry.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Anxiety/emotional bias, heightened by family influence, leading to increased distress and concern focus.\n- Severity: Moderate; emotional distress affects how symptoms are conveyed but responses are still coherent.\n- Areas most affected: Emotional expression and perceived severity are biased by worry, which could lead to overestimation of urgency.\n- Reliability: Generally reliable regarding factual recounting but emotionally driven responses may bias perceived seriousness.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient might underreport subtle symptoms or neurological deficits due to emotional distraction.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: They might be downplaying prior minor episodes or less obvious deficits.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The level of worry likely inflates the perceived severity, possibly affecting their assessment of urgency.\n- True timeline: The sudden onset appears accurate; emotional response likely heightens the perception of rapid deterioration.",

    "input": "A 65-year-old man presents with an acute onset of unilateral vision loss in the right eye that began yesterday morning. The vision in that eye is currently blurry, affecting central and lower visual fields, with intermittent fluctuations in clarity. The patient denies eye pain or other ocular discomfort, but communication patterns suggest he may be underreporting or minimizing associated symptoms. No neurological symptoms are described, though further assessment is required to exclude subtle deficits. The reported timeline indicates a sudden event, though some details about prior visual status remain uncertain. Additional examination and diagnostic testing are necessary to determine the underlying cause.1. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)\nJustification: Sudden, painless, monocular vision loss affecting the central visual field in an elderly patient suggests an embolic or thrombotic occlusion of the central retinal artery, which is a common cause of painless, sudden monocular vision loss.\n2. Diagnosis: Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion\nJustification: Intermittent and partial visual field defects affecting the lower field point toward an occlusion of a branch artery rather than the main artery, especially if fluctuations are present, indicating incomplete or transient blockage.\n3. Diagnosis: Ocular Ischemic Syndrome\nJustification: Could present with decreased vision over a short period, often in elderly with carotid artery disease; may cause patchy vision loss with fluctuating symptoms due to hypoperfusion.\n4. Diagnosis: Carotid Artery Disease with Embolization\nJustification: Emboli originating from carotid plaques can cause retinal artery occlusion; in an elderly man, this is a common source of embolic events leading to retinal ischemia.\n5. Diagnosis: Amaurosis Fugax\nJustification: Transient monocular vision loss caused by temporary retinal ischemia; could explain fluctuating vision if the occlusion is partial or embolic fragments temporarily clear.\n6. Diagnosis: Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)\nJustification: Presents with sudden painless vision loss, typically in older patients; although typically affects the optic nerve head, sometimes initial symptoms are ischemic in the posterior ciliary arteries affecting the optic disc and subsequent visual fields.\n7. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis\nJustification: Usually associated with pain on eye movement and often affects younger individuals; less likely here but included for completeness, considering no pain reported.\n8. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment\nJustification: Sudden visual field defects and visual loss could indicate detachment, though typically associated with flashes or floaters; less likely without such symptoms.\n9. Diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis\nJustification: Can cause ocular ischemia with sudden vision loss; red flags are age over 50 and painless loss, but absence of other symptoms (e.g., jaw claudication, systemic symptoms) makes it less likely initially.\n10. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage\nJustification: Could cause sudden vision loss but usually associated with floaters or hazy media; less likely given the described fluctuation and lack of hemorrhagic signs.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient\u2019s language is characterized by vagueness (\"kinda blurry,\" \"maybe worse\") and emotional expressions (\"it worries me,\" \"scared\"), indicating discomfort with detailed or objective reporting. There is a tendency to downplay severity, possibly to reduce anxiety or avoid alarming the clinician.\n- Information flow: The patient is somewhat reluctant to disclose full details and tends to respond briefly, offering information primarily when directly asked. The responses are organized around their immediate perception but lack elaboration.\n- Response style: Responses are concise, somewhat guarded, and emotionally driven, with a pattern of denying prior issues while emphasizing current distress.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient avoids fully describing past symptoms or the full extent of current vision changes, likely to minimize perceived severity or complications.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of vague descriptors (\"kinda blurry,\" \"maybe worse\") suggests an attempt to downplay seriousness, which could mask actual severity.\n- Amplification patterns: The emotional language (\"it worries me,\" \"scared\") indicates that the patient is experiencing heightened anxiety about the situation, which may amplify perceived urgency.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs but the brief, guarded responses could reflect discomfort discussing aging or health concerns.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Admitted difficulty recalling prior vision status, indicating some memory uncertainty about symptom onset or progression.\n- Family influence: The dominant influence of the wife\u2019s observations (\"my wife saw it,\" \"she's really upset\") suggests external emotional input shaping the patient's responses, possibly leading to over- or under-reporting based on family concern.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Emotional amplification combined with family-influenced responses, with some minimization. The patient\u2019s reported concern and fear significantly shape their narrative.\n- Severity: Moderate, because emotional distress is prominent, and there is some evidence of downplaying symptoms, but responses remain generally consistent.\n- Areas most affected: Subjective severity and timeline are most biased, as emotional states and family influence may distort their perception of the actual clinical picture.\n- Reliability: Moderate; self-reporting is influenced by emotional factors and external influences, so responses should be supplemented with objective examination and possibly collateral history.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Potential subtle prior visual changes, gradual symptom progression, or less obvious signs of chronicity are probably underreported.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The patient\u2019s description suggests they\u2019re underperceiving or minimizing severity, possibly due to fear or reluctance to acknowledge serious loss.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The emotional distress and fear contribute to overestimating threat, which may prompt urgent concern disproportionate to actual physical findings.\n- True timeline: The actual onset may have been insidious or less sudden than perceived; patient\u2019s perception is shaped by emotional response, which may cause an overstatement of abruptness.\nThis analysis indicates that while the patient is emotionally truthful about their worry, their response is influenced by anxiety and family input.

    "input": "A 65-year-old man presents with an acute unilateral vision loss in the right eye that began approximately 24 hours prior, described as blurry with fluctuating clarity affecting central and lower visual fields. He denies ocular pain, discomfort, or neurological deficits. Communication suggests possible underreporting of prior catchment symptoms or subtle disturbances, and emotional distress may influence his reporting. The onset is consistent with a sudden event, but further detailed history and examination are necessary to identify any antecedent symptoms or transient phenomena. No additional ocular or neurological symptoms have been reported, though more comprehensive inquiry is required to fully assess the history and rule out other causes.1. Diagnosis: Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NA-AION)\nJustification: The sudden unilateral vision loss with central and lower visual field involvement in an older patient suggests ischemic insult to the optic nerve head. NA-AION commonly presents with painless, sudden vision loss in patients over 50, often affecting central vision and sometimes lower fields. Fluctuation may reflect transient hypoperfusion or swelling resolving. No ocular pain supports this diagnosis. The age and clinical presentation are classic.\n2. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)\nJustification: Sudden sectoral or full-field central vision loss in an elderly patient can be due to CRAO. Fluctuating vision could be due to embolic events or incomplete occlusion episodes. The lack of pain favors this as well. However, the described visual disturbances affecting lower fields are less typical for CRAO, which usually causes more complete, painless vision loss.\n3. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) affecting visual pathways\nJustification: The episodic, fluctuating vision disturbances, especially affecting parts of the visual field, could be due to transient ischemic events in the posterior circulation, such as the posterior cerebral artery supplying visual cortex. However, the focal deficit on the right eye favors an anterior visual pathway lesion over cortical TIA.\n4. Diagnosis: Non-specific vascular or microvascular ischemia (early diabetic retinopathy or hypertensive microvascular disease)\nJustification: While possible, these usually cause more gradual changes or chronic visual field loss; sudden, acute loss is less characteristic.\n5. Diagnosis: Macular degeneration or choroidal pathology\nJustification: Usually causes gradual visual decline, not abrupt loss, and does not typically produce sudden, fluctuating visual field loss without other signs.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague, hedging phrases (\"I think,\" \"maybe,\" \"kinda\"), indicating hesitance to commit to specifics, which can mask the true timeline or severity. Emotional expressions (\"worried me,\" \"making me worried\") reflect distress that might influence their reporting.\n- Information flow: Responses are concise and somewhat guarded, with limited elaboration, especially on prior symptoms, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose or fear of confronting the full extent of their condition. The responses are organized but contain emotional overlays that may obscure clinical facts.\n- Response style: They tend to answer directly but with hedging and vagueness. When asked about progression, they provide honest but non-committal responses, balancing between disclosure and concealment of uncertainties.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of ambiguous language (\"I can't remember,\" \"maybe,\" \"kinda\") indicates selective disclosure, possibly to avoid admitting prior issues or because of difficulty recalling details.\n- Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"kinda blurry\" and \"a little worse\" suggest downplaying symptom severity, possibly to make the situation seem less dire or to reduce anxiety.\n- Amplification patterns: The emotional tone (\"worried me,\" \"making me worried\") may serve to emphasize their distress but does not overtly exaggerate physical symptoms, rather amplifies perceived emotional impact.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance to provide detailed prior history could reflect discomfort discussing health problems or fear of appearing vulnerable, although evidence is subtle.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Admission of uncertainty (\"I can't remember\") about prior visual status indicates either true memory lapses or avoidance, which may hinder accurate assessment of symptom progression.\n- Family influence: The patient's mention of their wife\u2019s concern suggests external emotional pressure, which likely heightens their worries and may bias responses toward expressing greater distress.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: The chief bias appears to be emotional distress-induced vagueness and possible minimization, compounded by familial influence, leading to under- or over-reporting certain details.\n- Severity: Moderate, because responses are generally honest but clouded by emotional and cognitive biases that reduce factual clarity.\n- Areas most affected: Timeline accuracy, prior health baseline, and full symptom severity are most biased, with emotional distress coloring responses.\n- Reliability: Moderate, as responses are consistent but influenced by emotional and memory biases, making them only partially trustworthy without corroboration.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Subtle pre-existing symptoms, detailed history of vision changes, and exact timeline are probably underreported due to vagueness and minimization.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The actual progression and severity of visual impairment may be worse than conveyed; the patient may have experienced earlier or more gradual deficits not acknowledged.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The expressed worry and fear could be overstated relative to their objective clinical picture, driven by emotional distress and family input.\n- True timeline: The onset may have been more insidious, with the patient accurately reporting suddenness out of alarm, but potentially missing minor earlier disturbances due to emotional buffer or recall bias.",

He describes the vision as blurry with fluctuating clarity, primarily involving central and lower visual fields. He reports no ocular pain, discomfort, or neurological deficits. The history indicates a sudden occurrence with no prior similar episodes; however, communication patterns suggest he may have minimized or overlooked subtle previous symptoms such as fleeting flashes, partial blind spots, or intermittent blurriness that could have preceded the acute event.

No associated symptoms like diplopia, headache, or neurological deficits have been identified. Confidence in the absence of prior warning symptoms is medium, owing to possible underreporting. Further inquiry into minor visual disturbances and detailed symptom history would be necessary for comprehensive assessment.1. Diagnosis: Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion (BRAO)\nJustification: The sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss with central and inferior visual field involvement aligns with a branch retinal artery occlusion affecting the affected retinal sectors. Fluctuating clarity can be due to transient ischemia or partial embolic obstruction. The absence of pain and neurological deficits supports an ocular ischemic event rather than central brain pathology.\n2. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Arteritic or Non-Arteritic)\nJustification: Sudden vision loss in an older adult can be caused by ischemic optic neuropathy, particularly if involving the optic nerve head. Although painless, it can cause altitudinal visual field loss. The variability in symptoms and age make this a leading consideration, especially in the absence of pain, but less likely if the visual defect is more localized to the retina's vascular territory.\n3. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)\nJustification: Although the presentation is more characteristic of a branch occlusion, CRAO remains a differential\u2014particularly if visual impairment is profound and involves the entire retina. The fleeting or fluctuating vision might not fully align unless partial or transient CRAO occurs, but initial suspicion should include it.\n4. Diagnosis: Embolic phenomena from carotid or cardiac sources\nJustification: Emboli are common causes of retinal arterial occlusions in this age group. Though not a standalone diagnosis, embolic disease explains the sudden presentation and implicates systemic vascular pathology, making subsequent cardiovascular or carotid workup essential.\n5. Diagnosis: Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)\nJustification: Common in older adults, NAION causes sudden monocular vision loss and may mimic other ischemic events. Typically involves optic disc edema, which isn't specified here, but its inclusion remains relevant given the age and presentation.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient tends toward minimal and vague language, using words like \"just\" and \"maybe\" that downplay the symptoms.

    "input": "The patient is a 65-year-old man presenting with an acute, painless loss of vision in the right eye that began approximately 24 hours prior to evaluation. He describes the vision as blurry with fluctuating clarity, predominantly affecting the central and lower visual fields, following a sudden onset while reading. He states he has no history of similar episodes but admits to seeing flickering clouds before the event, which could indicate transient visual phenomena. He reports no associated ocular pain, headache, or neurological deficits, though his emotional distress and focus on severity suggest that subtle warning symptoms like brief flashes or partial visual disturbances may have been overlooked or underreported. Communication biases indicate that some minor prior symptoms might have been minimized. Further detailed history about transient visual phenomena and neurological symptoms is warranted to better understand the underlying cause.1. Diagnosis: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)\nJustification: The sudden, painless monocular vision loss affecting the central field with a cloudy or blurry appearance, especially with a sudden onset while reading, closely matches CRAO; it's common in older patients with vascular risk factors. The flickering clouds could be transient visual phenomena preceding an occlusion, or related to embolic events. The acuity gradually worsening or fluctuating could align with partial occlusion or embolic movement. The absence of pain and other neurological symptoms supports this.\n2. Diagnosis: Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion\nJustification: The vision loss is localized to the central and lower visual fields, which could reflect a branch retinal artery block affecting specific quadrants. Fluctuating clarity may suggest partial or transient occlusion, and the location of symptoms supports a branch rather than a central occlusion.\n3. Diagnosis: Amaurosis Fugax (Transient Ischemic Attack of the Retina)\nJustification: The described flickering clouds prior to vision loss could be transient visual phenomena associated with embolic or ischemic embolus temporarily obstructing retinal circulation. Although the current loss is persistent, initial transient episodes are consistent with amaurosis fugax, which can herald more permanent occlusion if unresolved.\n4. Diagnosis: Retinal Vein Occlusion\nJustification: Although less likely given the acute, painless, central vision loss with cloudiness\u2014more characteristic of arterial issues\u2014retinal vein occlusion can cause sudden visual disturbance with blurred vision. The fluctuation in clarity might relate to edema or hemorrhages, although classically associated with more diffuse visual changes.\n5. Diagnosis: Ischemic Optic Neuropathy\nJustification: While it can cause painless monocular vision loss, ischemic optic neuropathy typically presents with more optic disc swelling and temporal disc pallor, which are not described here. Still, in an older patient with vascular risk factors, it remains in the differential, especially if subtle optic disc changes are present or overlooked.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses emotional language (\"worried,\" \"scared,\" \"worry\") and some vague descriptors (\"see some flickering stuff, like clouds\").
