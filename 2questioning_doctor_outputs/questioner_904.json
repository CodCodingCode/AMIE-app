    "input": "Patient is a 62-year-old woman presenting with a two-day history of acute ocular symptoms following recent eye surgery, including blurry and cloudy vision and ocular pain perceived as moderate but possibly more intense. Objective examination is needed to evaluate for signs of increased intraocular pressure, inflammation, or other post-surgical complications. The patient may be underreporting the severity of her symptoms and could have associated neurological symptoms such as nausea or light sensitivity that have not been disclosed. Further detailed inquiry and clinical assessment are essential to determine the urgency of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Sudden onset of blurry, cloudy vision and ocular pain are classic signs, especially post-surgery which can precipitate angle closure due to shifting intraocular structures. It is a sight-threatening, emergent diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Endophthalmitis Justification: Recent eye surgery raises concern for intraocular infection presenting with pain, vision changes, and cloudy media; a medical emergency needing prompt identification.  3. Diagnosis: Uveitis (post-surgical intraocular inflammation) Justification: Inflammation after eye surgery can cause ocular pain, cloudy vision, and photophobia, fitting her presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Corneal edema (e.g., postoperative edema or endothelial decompensation) Justification: Corneal edema can cause cloudy vision following ocular surgery, often associated with mild discomfort; supports post-surgical complication.  5. Diagnosis: Elevated intraocular pressure secondary to surgery or medication (ocular hypertension) Justification: Increased pressure may cause visual disturbance and ocular pain, particularly after intraocular procedures.  6. Diagnosis: Retinal detachment or tear Justification: Sudden visual changes, especially if accompanied by flashes or floaters (not specified but relevant), are potential post-surgical complications.  7. Diagnosis: Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy Justification: Although less common acutely after surgery, ischemic optic nerve damage can cause visual deterioration with ocular pain.  8. Diagnosis: Sinusitis or other nearby infection Justification: Ocular pain and blurred vision can sometimes reflect sinus or orbital infections, though less likely without systemic signs.  9. Diagnosis: Neuro-ophthalmic disorder (e.g., optic neuritis) Justification: Visual disturbances and ocular pain can occur, but less likely given recent surgery and acute onset.  10. Diagnosis: Cataract progression or residual postoperative refractive issues Justification: Less likely to cause acute pain or significant visual clouding within two days but considered as a less emergent differential.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses somewhat vague descriptors like \"kind of cloudy\" and \"pressure,\" possibly to soften her presentation. Her emotional phrase \"I'm really worried\" reveals underlying anxiety but balances clinical description. - Information flow: She volunteers key details such as recent surgery and symptom onset, yet may hold back detailed subjective sensations or emotional states, indicating a tendency to be somewhat reserved, perhaps to avoid sounding alarmist. - Response style: She gives detailed initial responses but may be hesitant or cautious, hinting at slight discomfort discussing her symptoms openly, likely due to anxiety about the progression or severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited elaboration on the post-surgical recovery and absence of specific details about symptom fluctuations suggest potential withholding of full scope. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her pain and vision issues with qualifying words (\"really strange,\" \"kind of cloudy,\" \"a little\"), which could reflect minimization or an attempt to appear less distressed. - Amplification patterns: Her explicit worry about losing her vision and asking about seriousness suggest her concerns might be more intense internally than she's showing outwardly. - Embarrassment/shame signals: There is no evident embarrassment; she seems earnest and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; her timeline is clear and consistent. - Family influence: She does not explicitly mention family input, but her living situation and visits suggest possible indirect influence on her willingness to seek help.  BIAS ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization bias, as she underplays certain symptom aspects but simultaneously exhibits genuine concern. - Severity: Moderate bias, because her language indicates some downplaying but her overall devoted concern and detailed account suggest honesty. - Areas most affected: Description of symptom severity and pain level are most biased; she might not fully convey how serious or urgent her situation is. - Reliability: Her self-report has credible elements but should be interpreted with awareness of possible underestimation, warranting objective examination to confirm severity.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She probably isn't fully conveying how intense her pain or pressure feels, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the provider. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of pain and pressure might be worse than described. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about blindness and seriousness, especially given her focus on the problem, are likely genuine but could be somewhat exaggerated by anxiety. - True timeline: The symptoms may be progressing faster or more severely than her perception suggests; she reports gradual worsening over two days, but the actual progression may be more acute.  This detailed analysis indicates that while her report appears honest, her language hints at some degree of minimization regarding symptom severity, which could influence clinical assessment and management.",

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with a two-day history of worsening right eye symptoms following recent ocular surgery. She reports experiencing visual impairment characterized by significant blurriness and cloudiness, with intermittent shadows or dark spots, which may be an underestimation of her true visual acuity reduction. She describes ocular pain as initially dull, now sometimes sharp, and associated with a sensation of intraocular pressure; however, her description suggests the pain could be more severe and persistent. There may also be unreported symptoms such as nausea, light sensitivity, or systemic signs indicative of intraocular inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, or retinal detachment. Given her anxiety-related communication style, her symptom severity might be understated, and objective findings might reveal more significant visual and physiological impairments requiring urgent evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Postoperative Endophthalmitis Justification: The rapid progression of visual decline, ocular pain, and recent ocular surgery strongly suggest an infectious intraocular inflammation. Endophthalmitis typically presents with pain, decreased vision, and possibly hypopyon; symptoms can worsen quickly. Although her pain has been described as dull transitioning to sharp, this may be underreported due to anxiety, and subtle signs may still indicate this severe complication. The timing (two days post-surgery) aligns with a postoperative infectious process, making it the top concern due to potential vision loss if untreated.  2. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment Justification: The description of intermittent dark shadows or spots, along with rapid visual decline, hints at possible retinal detachment, especially if the patient perceives a shadow or curtain effect. Post-surgical retinal tearing or detachment can present with sudden or subacute visual symptoms, especially in an older patient. Though pain is less prominent in retinal detachment, the severity and pattern of visual disturbance justify its high ranking. It requires urgent detection to prevent permanent vision loss.  3. Diagnosis: Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma or Secondary Glaucoma Justification: The sensation of intraocular pressure, worsening pain that may now be sharp, suggests elevated intraocular pressure, possibly due to a glaucomatous process worsening after surgery, such as angle-closure or secondary glaucoma (e.g., pigment dispersion or hyphema-related). The pain character and pressure sensation support consideration of increased intraocular pressure, which can cause visual impairment if sustained. Postoperative edema or blood can precipitate secondary glaucoma, making it a relevant differential.  4. Diagnosis: Postoperative Uveitis (Intraocular Inflammation) Justification: The description of ocular pain (initial dull, now sharp), visual blurriness, and signs of intraocular inflammation are consistent with uveitis. It can occur after surgery, especially if there's sterile inflammation or sensitivity. Uveitis can cause significant visual impairment and pain, sometimes associated with increased intraocular pressure, making it a plausible diagnosis, but generally less acutely severe than infectious endophthalmitis.  5. Diagnosis: Hemorrhage or Vitreous Hemorrhage Justification: Given the recent intraocular procedure, bleeding into the vitreous cavity (hemorrhage) could cause visual clouding, shadows, and deterioration. Although less common than other complications, hemorrhage can present with sudden visual distortion and may be associated with retinal tears or vascular injury. The absence of explicit reports of bleeding or floaters diminishes initial likelihood, but it's still a differential worth considering due to its potential severity.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret employs vague descriptors like \"kind of\" and \"pretty blurry,\" which moderate the severity of her symptoms and reflect some hesitancy or discomfort in fully expressing her concerns. Her tone mixes factual reporting with emotional qualifiers, indicating underlying anxiety. - Information flow: She discloses her symptoms initially but tends to downplay their severity with non-specific language. She provides relevant details but is cautious about alarming the provider; responses are organized but somewhat guarded. - Response style: She elaborates enough to convey her experience but avoids detailed severity descriptions, preferring to keep her explanations somewhat nebulous to avoid sounding overly distressed.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance to specify exact pain levels and visual acuity terms, possibly to prevent appearing overly worried or to avoid scaring herself. - Minimization behaviors: Use of vague language (\"kind of cloudy,\" \"pretty blurry,\" \"sometimes sharp\") suggests she may be unintentionally minimizing the true extent of her symptoms. - Amplification patterns: No evidence of overstatement; her descriptions seem consistent with her concern but do not appear exaggerated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her hedging language suggests some discomfort in fully articulating how bad her symptoms are. - Confusion/memory issues: None apparent; timeline and symptom descriptions are consistent. - Family influence: Indirectly, her mention of being close to her family and living alone indicates support but no direct responses altered by others.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild underreporting bias, mainly through vague language and hedging, likely aiming to avoid alarm or because of uncertainty about her symptoms\u2019 severity. - Severity: Moderate bias, since she reports serious symptoms, but her language suggests caution or underestimation. - Areas most affected: Pain and vision clarity are understated; she may not fully communicate how intense or disruptive her symptoms are. - Reliability: Slightly compromised; her descriptions are genuine but moderated.

    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: While we know she reports worsening symptoms over two days, details about the exact intensity of pain, precise visual acuity measurements, and any associated systemic or ocular symptoms (e.g., nausea, light sensitivity) are missing. Clarifying these could help distinguish between diagnoses like endophthalmitis versus retinal detachment or glaucoma. - Diagnostic priorities: Differential diagnosis hinges on confirming the severity of visual impairment and pain, as well as identifying features suggestive of infection (e.g., significant pain, redness, discharge) versus structural issues like retinal detachment or pressure rise. Understanding whether associated symptoms like nausea or photophobia are present would help. - Patient factors: Her hedging language and tendency to understate severity suggest we need to ask targeted, specific questions to elicit full symptom burden without provoking anxiety or prompting denial. - Interview phase goals: Focus now on obtaining concrete details about the severity and nature of her pain, the visual disturbance quality, and any other systemic or ocular symptoms to help refine the differential.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions to quantify symptom intensity, nature, and timing; confirmatory questions about associated symptoms. - Information target: Precise pain description and severity, visual acuity details, emergence of systemic or ocular symptoms, and any factors influencing these. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently and clearly to encourage detailed, honest responses; reassure that understanding symptom severity is crucial regardless of how she perceives her own experience. - Expected value: Gaining specific, quantifiable data on her symptoms will better identify or rule out urgent conditions like endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or glaucoma.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, thank you for sharing these details.

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with a two-day history of right eye symptoms following recent ocular surgery. She reports experiencing vision that is increasingly blurry and cloudy with intermittent shadows or dark spots, which may underestimate her actual visual impairment. She describes ocular pain as initially dull and sometimes sharp, with an intensity that she estimates as a 7 or 8 out of 10 at worst, though her description suggests the pain may be more severe; objective assessment is needed. She also reports a sensation of intraocular pressure and notes that the visual disturbances worsen with head movement. She denies systemic symptoms such as nausea or light sensitivity, but her detailed descriptions and hesitations in reporting may reflect underreporting of severity. The timeline indicates symptom progression over two days, though actual intensity and rapidity of developments could be underestimated due to her communication style. Additional signs and symptoms, including intraocular pressure, ocular examination findings, and imaging, are needed to evaluate for possible retinal detachment, intraocular inflammation, or other complications.1. Diagnosis: Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Justification: The progression of visual disturbances (blurry, cloudy vision with shadows or dark spots), worsening with head movement, coupled with recent eye surgery, strongly suggests retinal detachment. The rapid onset over two days and the presence of intraocular pain further support this diagnosis. It is a common post-surgical complication causing the described shadow or dark spot phenomena and typically worsens with positional changes.  2. Diagnosis: Intraocular Inflammation (Uveitis) Justification: The patient's ocular pain (initial dull, sometimes sharp) and recent surgery raise suspicion for post-surgical uveitis. Although she denies systemic symptoms, intraocular inflammation can cause pain, visual disturbances, and may complicate the postoperative course. However, the typical signs of anterior chamber cells, floaters, or keratic precipitates are not specified, making this less likely as the primary diagnosis but still relevant.  3. Diagnosis: Vitreous Hemorrhage Justification: Sudden visual blurring with shadows and dark spots could suggest vitreous hemorrhage, especially post-surgery, where bleeding could occur. Nonetheless, she reports no mention of floaters or blood in the anterior chamber, making this less probable but still a differential.  4. Diagnosis: Secondary Glaucoma (Elevated Intraocular Pressure) Justification: The sensation of intraocular pressure and worsening symptoms might point toward secondary angle-closure glaucoma, especially if intraocular pressure is elevated. Yet, there is no explicit mention of IOP measurements or other signs like visual field constriction, so this is considered lower probability but still relevant.  5. Diagnosis: Hyphema Justification: The description does not specify visible blood in the anterior chamber, and the presentation doesn't align as strongly with hyphema, but it's considered due to recent ocular surgery and intraocular pain. It remains less likely given the limited evidence but is relevant to exclude in postoperative patients.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient prefers vague descriptors (\"kind of a dull ache,\" \"pretty blurry\") and employs cautious, hedging phrases (\"maybe,\" \"not really sure\") that suggest discomfort with expressing full severity. She expresses emotional concern through words like \"worried\" and \"scared,\" but her language downplays physical intensity. - Information flow: She shares key symptoms readily but with limited detail on severity or impact, possibly to avoid appearing alarmist. When asked about pain severity, she offers approximate numbers that may underestimate her true experience. - Response style: Her responses are generally elaborate when describing symptoms but become more tentative when quantifying pain or distress, indicating discomfort or uncertainty in fully articulating her experience.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague and mild language (e.g., \"kind of a dull ache\") and uncertain severity ratings suggest she might be underreporting true discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"pretty blurry\" and \"pressure kind of a lot\" hint at an effort to minimize symptoms, possibly to avoid concern or due to difficulty judging severity. - Amplification patterns: Her focus on fears like blindness and high scores (\"maybe like a 7 or 8\") may reflect underlying anxiety that amplifies her concern, even if physical symptoms are less severe. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Polite tone, hedging, and reluctance to specify exact severity may indicate mild discomfort with openly acknowledging the worst aspects of her condition. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs; her responses are internally consistent but rely heavily on vague language, which could mask difficulty in precise framing. - Family influence: Not overtly evidenced but the context suggests she may tailor responses to perceived clinician expectations.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be minimization, as she consistently softens symptom descriptions and employs non-specific language, possibly to reduce anxiety or avoid overreacting. - Severity: Moderate. While she communicates concern clearly, her vague descriptors could conceal more severe underlying symptoms, risking underestimation of urgency. - Areas most affected: Pain severity and the immediacy of symptoms are most biased, as her language may understate how intense or threatening her condition truly is. - Reliability: Caution is warranted; her self-reporting is coherent but likely influenced by minimization, so objective measures and physical exam findings are essential for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact severity of pain, pressure, and visual disturbance; potential underreporting of the true intensity due to vagueness. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual pain may be worse than described; she might also perceive her symptoms as less urgent than they are. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about blindness and severity are genuine but may be influenced by anxiety and wish to avoid distressing disclosures. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent but could be more rapid or severe than her vague account suggests; her language softens the urgency, which may mask the true situation.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The current picture suggests significant concern about worsening postoperative eye symptoms, but her vague descriptors and hedging indicate potential underreporting of severity. - To refine the differential, I need to assess more precisely the character, timing, and impact of her pain and visual disturbances, as well as associated symptoms like floaters or light sensitivity, which could help distinguish retinal detachment from other causes. - Her communication style indicates minimization; therefore, focused, yet sensitive questions are necessary to uncover the true severity and impact of her symptoms. - Exploring triggers (like head movement), the progression of symptoms over time, and functional impact will help clarify urgency and the diagnosis. - It\u2019s also important to denote any associated signs (e.g., floaters) that support diagnoses like retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, and to verify the presence or absence of systemic signs, ruling out other causes.

She expresses emotional concern through words like \"worried\" and \"scared,\" but her language downplays physical intensity. - Information flow: She shares key symptoms readily but with limited detail on severity or impact, possibly to avoid appearing alarmist. When asked about pain severity, she offers approximate numbers that may underestimate her true experience. - Response style: Her responses are generally elaborate when describing symptoms but become more tentative when quantifying pain or distress, indicating discomfort or uncertainty in fully articulating her experience.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague and mild language (e.g., \"kind of a dull ache\") and uncertain severity ratings suggest she might be underreporting true discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions like \"pretty blurry\" and \"pressure kind of a lot\" hint at an effort to minimize symptoms, possibly to avoid concern or due to difficulty judging severity. - Amplification patterns: Her focus on fears like blindness and high scores (\"maybe like a 7 or 8\") may reflect underlying anxiety that amplifies her concern, even if physical symptoms are less severe. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Polite tone, hedging, and reluctance to specify exact severity may indicate mild discomfort with openly acknowledging the worst aspects of her condition. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit signs; her responses are internally consistent but rely heavily on vague language, which could mask difficulty in precise framing. - Family influence: Not overtly evidenced but the context suggests she may tailor responses to perceived clinician expectations.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias appears to be minimization, as she consistently softens symptom descriptions and employs non-specific language, possibly to reduce anxiety or avoid overreacting. - Severity: Moderate. While she communicates concern clearly, her vague descriptors could conceal more severe underlying symptoms, risking underestimation of urgency. - Areas most affected: Pain severity and the immediacy of symptoms are most biased, as her language may understate how intense or threatening her condition truly is. - Reliability: Caution is warranted; her self-reporting is coherent but likely influenced by minimization, so objective measures and physical exam findings are essential for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact severity of pain, pressure, and visual disturbance; potential underreporting of the true intensity due to vagueness. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual pain may be worse than described; she might also perceive her symptoms as less urgent than they are. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about blindness and severity are genuine but may be influenced by anxiety and wish to avoid distressing disclosures. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent but could be more rapid or severe than her vague account suggests; her language softens the urgency, which may mask the true situation.",

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with a two-day history of vision clouding, shadows, and flashes in her right eye, following recent ocular surgery. She reports that her vision has gradually worsened and describes ocular pain as a dull ache, sometimes sharper, with an estimated severity of 7 or 8 out of 10, though her descriptions suggest the possibility of higher actual discomfort. The visual symptoms tend to worsen with head movement, and she notes the presence of dark spots and flashes\u2014findings concerning for retinal detachment or intraocular hemorrhage. She denies systemic symptoms like nausea or light sensitivity but may be underreporting their severity. Given her hesitancy and the nature of her communication, her true symptom severity and acuity may be greater than she indicates, necessitating prompt detailed ocular examination and imaging to assess for serious postoperative complications.Retinal detachment ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient often uses vague and hedging language (\"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" \"pretty bad\"), which indicates some degree of uncertainty or reluctance to share full severity. Her emotional expressions (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") show distress that\u2019s not fully conveyed through her factual descriptions. - Information flow: She offers basic information proactively but holds back details like exact pain intensity or suddenness of symptom changes unless prompted. Her responses are organized but tend to include qualifiers that conceal full intensity. - Response style: Responses are cautious and somewhat guarded, balancing openness with a tendency to minimize or downplay symptoms. She elaborates more when prompted, but overall maintains a somewhat reserved communication pattern.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of vague qualifiers and reliance on uncertain descriptors suggest mild concealment or hesitance, possibly to avoid alarming the clinician. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her pain as \"kind of a dull ache\" and \"pretty bad\" yet assigns a moderate pain rating, indicating she might be underreporting the true distress. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes the pain as \"pretty bad\" and \"pretty much the same\" for days, which may serve to bolster the concern but could also reflect genuine ongoing distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal overt signs, but her cautious language and hesitation suggest some discomfort discussing the severity or potential outcomes. - Confusion/memory issues: No notable signs; responses are consistent and logical. - Family influence: No direct evidence, responses seem internally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response minimization and hedging bias, likely due to anxiety and uncertainty. - Severity: Moderate, because her hesitance and vague language could obscure the full extent of her symptoms. - Areas most affected: Pain severity and visual disturbance descriptions, which may be understated; her concern about blindness seems proportional but could represent heightened anxiety rather than factual urgency. - Reliability: Moderately reliable, but clinicians should verify symptom severity with objective data and encourage detailed description for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of pain and rapidity of vision deterioration may be underestimated; she might hesitate to fully disclose the worst intensity or sudden changes. - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual pain might be worse than described, and the visual symptoms may be more severe or urgent than she reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about blindness and severity is high, which could intensify her subjective distress beyond the clinical reality. - True timeline: Actual progression could be faster with more acute episodes, but her report suggests a gradual worsening, possibly masking rapid or severe developments.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to develop a question that addresses the remaining diagnostic uncertainties, particularly about the key features differentiating retinal detachment from other possible causes of visual disturbance. The patient\u2019s hedging language and possible underreporting of severity suggest I need a focused question that clarifies the acuity, nature, and onset of her symptoms. It's important to explore whether her visual changes are sudden or gradual, whether her pain is worse than she reports, and if any new symptoms like flashes or floaters are present, which are critical for confirming retinal detachment. Since she's cautious, a gentle, open-ended prompt might encourage more honest disclosure, but I want to keep it targeted to avoid missing urgent signs.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact severity and rapidity of symptom onset, presence of flashes or floaters, and pain characterization. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm features consistent with retinal detachment or other emergent ocular conditions. - Patient factors: Her possible underreporting due to anxiety or response minimization. Need to phrase questions that validate her account while probing for critical details. - Interview phase goals: Finalize assessment of symptom characteristics that confirm or exclude retinal detachment, assess urgency, and explore her understanding.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused open-ended to allow elaboration but steer towards specifics of symptom onset, severity, and associated symptoms. - Information target: Symptom timeline, suddenness, severity, presence of flashes/floaters, nature of pain, and any recent changes. - Communication approach: Gentle, reassuring, encouraging honesty. Phrasing that emphasizes importance of detailed description for her safety. - Expected value: Clarifies whether her clinical picture confirms retinal detachment as the most likely diagnosis or suggests alternative causes, guiding urgent management.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, to make sure I understand everything clearly, could you tell me how quickly your vision changed\u2014did it happen suddenly or gradually over a few days? Also, have you noticed any new flashes of light or floaters that weren\u2019t there before? And about your eye pain\u2014has it felt worse, sharper, or more intense recently, and would you say it\u2019s been consistent or fluctuating? These details will really help us figure out the best way to proceed to keep your eye safe.\"",
