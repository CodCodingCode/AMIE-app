    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Traumatic Conjunctivitis or Conjunctival Injury Justification: The sudden onset of redness, tearing, and swelling after playing soccer suggests possible mechanical irritation or minor trauma to the conjunctiva from debris or impact. It is common in sports-related eye injuries.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Recent activity involving physical exertion and potential trauma increases the risk for corneal epithelial disruption, presenting with redness, tearing, and discomfort.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Common in young individuals, can cause redness, tearing, and swelling; activity may have exposed the eye to allergens or irritants (e.g., pollen, outdoor allergens).  4. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: Often presents with redness and tearing; contagious nature and recent activity may be relevant, though typically bilateral and with other systemic signs.  5. Diagnosis: Preseptal (Periorbital) Cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness of the eyelid after activity, especially if trauma or minor skin break, can result in preseptal cellulitis; less severe than orbital cellulitis but still concerning.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Possible if eyelid swelling is severe, associated with pain, fever, or proptosis; urgent to differentiate from preseptal cellulitis.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Anterior Segment Inflammation) Justification: Less likely without pain or visual changes, but can present with redness; usually associated with systemic conditions.  8. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (Acute Angle-Closure) Justification: Typically presents with painful red eye and vision changes, less likely in this scenario without described pain, headache, or visual disturbance.  9. Diagnosis: Anterior Blepharitis or Eyelid Inflammation Justification: Common cause of eyelid swelling and redness, particularly if associated with crusting; possible after activity.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign Body in the Eye Justification: Playing sports could have led to foreign body entry; causes redness, tearing, and irritation, especially if corneal abrasion exists.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific and straightforward language, describing her symptoms directly without over-dramatization. Her phrases like \"feels really tired,\" \"heavy and painful,\" and \"itchy around my bottom\" are clear and concrete. - Information flow: She is quite forthcoming, providing relevant details proactively (\"I ate some raw pork last month\") and answering questions directly. Her responses are organized and consistent. - Response style: She tends to respond briefly and directly, with minimal tangential information. Her tone reflects concern but remains moderate.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she willingly shares key details about her symptoms and history. - Minimization behaviors: Slight, possibly due to modesty, but overall unlikely. She does not understate the severity of her symptoms; she acknowledges pain, weight loss, and itching openly. - Amplification patterns: No evident exaggeration; her concerns about her health seem proportional. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minor hesitation and cautious speech could suggest some discomfort discussing personal health topics but do not significantly impair information sharing. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of disorganized responses; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: The mention of living in poor sanitation conditions hints at a contextual influence on her health worries but does not appear to bias her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimal; she seems to communicate fairly accurately. Slight cautiousness might reflect cultural reticence rather than denial or distortion. - Severity: Mild; her responses seem honest and consistent, with some cultural cautiousness possibly influencing detail depth. - Areas most affected: Slight underexplaining of the severity and complexity of her symptoms, but overall, her statements are reliable. - Reliability: Fairly reliable; her responses are direct, specific, and consistent, though some cultural factors could subtly influence her openness.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: No major omissions evident; she provides relevant history and symptom description. - Symptoms probably minimized: Slight possibility that she downplays the severity or impact of her symptoms, perhaps underestimating pain or fatigue. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about seriousness and health impacts is genuine; no over-exaggeration detected. - True timeline: Her reported timeline seems plausible; her concern over recent weight loss and symptoms appearing over weeks aligns logically with disease progression, and there's no indication of distortion.  In summary, Maria's communication is largely transparent and accurate, with minor cultural cautiousness possibly leading to slight underreporting of emotional impact. Her responses lend themselves well to clinical assessment with trustworthiness, albeit with awareness of contextual influences.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Given the patient's history of eye symptoms following recent activity, I need to explore her experience of these symptoms in more detail, particularly how she perceives their onset, progression, and impact on her. - Understanding her perspective on how her eye feels and functions will help differentiate between possible causes like trauma, infection, or allergies. - Since she described redness, swelling, tearing, and recent activity, I should probe further into how these symptoms started and have changed over time, as well as any other associated symptoms. - Maintaining an open-ended, non-leading tone will promote rapport and elicit detailed information about her subjective experience. - Exploring her concerns about her eye and its impact on her daily life will help assess severity and need for urgent attention.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details about the onset, progression, and characteristics of her eye symptoms; any associated systemic or local symptoms; her understanding of the cause; and the impact on her daily activities. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating between trauma-related injury (like conjunctival injury or corneal abrasion), infectious causes (viral or bacterial conjunctivitis), allergic causes, or more severe conditions like cellulitis. - Patient factors: Her straightforward communication style suggests she provides clear information, but her tone indicates concern, so gentle, open-ended questions are appropriate to foster trust. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, gather detailed symptom history, understand her perspective and concerns, and identify any red flags necessitating urgent intervention.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage elaboration on the progress and nature of her eye symptoms. - Information target: Symptom timeline, change over time, severity, any associated symptoms (vision change, pain, discharge), and impact. - Communication approach: Framing questions in a considerate, non-judgmental manner to make her comfortable sharing details about her eye health and related concerns. - Expected value: Broader understanding of her symptom course, which aids in narrowing differential diagnoses and planning next steps.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your eye symptoms started and how they've been since then?

    "input": "An adult female presents with persistent redness, swelling, and tenderness of the eye following recent activity, beginning approximately two days prior. She reports discomfort to touch but tends to minimize symptom severity and duration. Tearing is present; no reported changes in vision or discharge are confirmed, though these areas require further assessment. Her communication pattern suggests she may be underreporting the severity and impact of her ocular symptoms. Additional detailed history and examination are necessary to evaluate for underlying infection, inflammation, or other ocular pathology.1. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: The presentation of eye swelling, redness, tenderness, and tearing following recent activity suggests superficial eyelid or periorbital infection, which is common and requires prompt treatment to prevent progression.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing, redness, and tenderness can be symptoms of allergic reactions; however, tenderness is less typical, but underreporting could mask allergic etiology.  3. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Redness and tearing are classic signs; tenderness is less prominent, but recent activity could aggravate symptoms. No significant discharge reported yet.  4. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Less likely due to absence of visual disturbances, proptosis, or pain with eye movement, but must rule out due to severity.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic ocular contusion or injury Justification: Recent activity might involve minor trauma causing edema and tenderness, especially if underreported.  6. Diagnosis: Chalazion or hordeolum (stye) Justification: Swelling and tenderness are typical, but usually localized and not described as persistent redness over the entire eye.  7. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Causes redness and mild discomfort; less likely to cause significant swelling or tenderness, but possible.  8. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Severe ocular pain, redness, and tenderness; less common, but needs exclusion due to seriousness.  9. Diagnosis: Thyroid eye disease (orbitopathy) Justification: Can cause swelling and redness; typically associated with thyroid symptoms, which are not reported.  10. Diagnosis: Ocular surface foreign body or corneal abrasion Justification: Could cause redness, tenderness, tearing after recent activity, but usually with more localized pain and potentially visual disturbances.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and slightly downplaying language (\"kinda stayed that way,\" \"hurt to touch\"), which suggests a tendency to minimize her eye symptoms. She avoids detailed descriptions, likely to avoid seeming overly concerned or to protect her privacy. - Information flow: She is somewhat reluctant to volunteer detailed information about her eye issues, sharing only basic facts unless prompted. Her responses are concise and organized but limited. - Response style: Her responses are minimal and direct when asked about her eye, with a tendency to avoid elaboration unless specifically probed, indicating some hesitance or discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Brief and vague description of the eye symptoms, avoiding details about duration, severity, or triggers. - Minimization behaviors: Using \"kinda\" and \"stayed that way,\" possibly downplaying ongoing or worsening symptoms. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes pain when touching her eye, which could be an overstatement to highlight her discomfort but may also be an honest expression. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Avoids eye contact when discussing her eye swelling and pain, possibly indicating discomfort or embarrassment. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; her timeline appears straightforward. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, though her reserved tone may reflect cultural modesty affecting disclosure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization and cautious disclosure bias, likely influenced by cultural norms or personal reticence. - Severity: Mild, as she provides key details but with some vagueness and she avoids elaborate descriptions. - Areas most affected: The description of her eye symptoms may be somewhat understated, potentially masking the severity or persistence. - Reliability: Moderately reliable for her stated symptoms; her reluctance suggests some underreporting, but core concerns are likely genuine.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The detailed course, severity, and responsiveness of her eye symptoms may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Possible ongoing or worsening eye swelling and pain may not be fully conveyed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her overall worry about seriousness appears genuine but may be influenced by her tendency to understate issues. - True timeline: The actual severity or persistence of her eye condition could be more significant than reported, requiring careful examination and possibly probing to clarify the full extent.",

    "input": "A female patient is presenting with a two-day history of persistent redness, swelling, and tenderness of the eye. She reports intermittent discomfort and a sensation of the eye feeling \"funny,\" with limited detail regarding visual changes or presence of discharge. Her descriptions suggest a moderate level of concern, but her communication indicates possible underreporting of symptom severity and impact. Clinical evaluation is necessary to determine the true extent of inflammation, assess visual function, and identify any additional ocular signs or systemic involvement.1. Diagnosis: Eyelid Cellulitis (Preseptal Cellulitis) Justification: The patient exhibits localized swelling, redness, tenderness, and discomfort limited to the eyelid region, consistent with eyelid cellulitis. The symptoms are suggestive of superficial tissue infection without signs of proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or systemic illness typical of orbital cellulitis. Her description of symptoms over two days aligns with a mild to moderate infectious process confined anterior to the orbital septum, making it the most probable diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Redness and limited discomfort could also result from conjunctival inflammation, common in infectious or allergic conjunctivitis. Although she reports tenderness and swelling, conjunctivitis usually presents with diffuse redness and discharge; the absence of discharge and other conjunctival signs makes this slightly less probable but still possible as a concurrent or initial pathology.  3. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: The persistent redness, tenderness, and sensation of \"funny\" eye could suggest intraocular or scleral inflammation. Scleritis often causes severe, deep ocular pain, which can be localized, and redness that is intense. The lack of detailed ocular pain description makes it less certain currently but remains a consideration given the severity of her symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: The intermittent discomfort and feeling of the eye being \"funny\" might reflect intraocular inflammation. However, the absence of visual disturbances or photophobia makes this less likely as a primary cause at this stage, ranking lower in probability but still within differential considerations.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: While presenting with redness, swelling, and tenderness, the clinical picture lacks systemic signs such as fever, proptosis, or ophthalmoplegia that would suggest orbital involvement. Therefore, orbital cellulitis is less probable at this point but remains a critical consideration if symptoms progress or systemic features develop.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and mild descriptors (\"feel funny,\" \"stayed that way,\" \"hurt to touch\") which suggest some minimization of her symptoms. She exhibits concern but avoids detailed descriptions, likely to not appear overly sick or alarming. - Information flow: She provides basic, pertinent information proactively but holds back detailed or fluctuating descriptions unless specifically prompted, indicating mild guardedness. - Response style: Her replies tend to be brief and cautious, revealing reluctance to elaborate and possibly to avoid emphasizing severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She hesitates to precise whether her eye symptoms have worsened or improved, avoids elaborate explanations about triggers, indicating possible withholding or minimization. - Minimization behaviors: Describes her eye as \"kinda stayed that way,\" which may mask ongoing or worsening symptoms. - Amplification patterns: No clear evidence of exaggeration; her concern appears proportionate, though her hedging may obscure her true state. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance when discussing her eye discomfort could suggest some discomfort with her symptoms but not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: Not evidenced clearly; responses align with her reports but lack detailed progression. - Family influence: No signs, responses are individual.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization or guarded reporting regarding her eye symptoms, mainly to avoid seeming overly ill or to prevent worry. - Severity: Mild, based on her vague descriptions and hesitations. - Areas most affected: Specifics of eye symptom fluctuation and severity are most biased; the patient may underreport worsening. - Reliability: Fair; her self-report is generally trustworthy but may understate the seriousness or variability of her eye condition, necessitating cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent, severity, and fluctuation of her eye symptoms; she may be concealing worsening or associated issues. - Symptoms probably minimized: The impact of her eye discomfort and functional impairment\u2014she might be experiencing more significant vision issues or pain than conveyed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about the eye and its effect on her day, which may be proportionate but could also reflect a tendency to ruminate or overstate due to anxiety. - True timeline: The onset appears recent (\"a few days ago\") with ongoing symptoms; however, she might be underestimating intermittent flare-ups or progression, so the clinical picture could be more dynamic than her narrative suggests.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: Need more detailed characterization of the eye symptoms, including changes in vision, presence of discharge, or systemic symptoms; also, clarification of the severity and progression\u2014whether symptoms are worsening, stable, or improving. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify signs that differentiate eyelid cellulitis from orbital cellulitis, conjunctivitis, or scleritis; particularly focus on systemic or ocular signs suggesting deeper involvement or intraocular inflammation. - Patient factors: The patient\u2019s vague and cautious communication pattern suggests she may minimize or hesitate to detail worsening symptoms; questions should be sensitive, non-threatening, and open to build trust for more accurate reporting. - Interview phase goals: Narrow down the differential diagnosis by focusing on specific symptom features, progression, and associated signs, to inform targeted examination and possible diagnostics.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions to elicit specific symptom details and progression; open-ended questions to allow patient to elaborate as comfortable; yes/no clarifications when needed. - Information target: Changes in vision, presence of discharge, severity of pain, systemic symptoms like fever, associated ocular findings (e.g., proptosis, eye movement restriction). - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing to encourage honest disclosure without judgment, acknowledging her cautiousness and avoiding pressing too hard on limited responses. - Expected value: Gaining clearer information about potential complication signs or systemic involvement, refining the differential to distinguish between superficial and deeper orbital pathology.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your eye symptoms have somewhat 'stayed that way,' but can you tell me if you've noticed anything about your vision\u2014like any blurriness or changes\u2014or if there's been any discharge from your eye?

    "input": "The patient is a woman presenting with persistent ocular redness, swelling, and tenderness that have lasted for several days, with subjective sensations of abnormal visual feelings and increased fatigue. She reports no significant discharge or worsening pain but describes her symptoms as stable, though communication biases suggest that underlying inflammation or early complication may be underrecognized. Ocular examination and systemic assessment are required to accurately determine the severity and progression of her condition, considering her cautious reporting style that may obscure the true clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: The persistent redness, deep ocular tenderness, swelling, and systemic fatigue strongly suggest scleritis, particularly anterior scleritis. The subjective visual disturbances and lack of significant discharge support an inflammatory process involving the sclera. Scleritis is known for deep, boring pain that worsens with eye movement or palpation, matching her tenderness. The chronicity and systemic symptoms reinforce this likelihood, as scleritis often associates with systemic autoimmune conditions.  2. Diagnosis: Anterior Uveitis (Iritis) Justification: Ocular redness, tenderness, and subjective visual changes can also reflect anterior uveitis, especially given her systemic fatigue suggesting an inflammatory or autoimmune process. Although anterior uveitis typically causes photophobia and floaters, these may be less prominent or unreported. The stability of symptoms does not exclude uveitis; however, tenderness is less characteristic than scleritis, but still possible.  3. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Episcleritis could cause our patient's redness and mild discomfort, usually less tender than scleritis, but given her description of tenderness and swelling, it appears less likely. Her systemic symptoms are less typical for episcleritis, which is often isolated.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Keratitis Justification: While corneal infection usually presents with significant discharge and pain, the lack of discharge and stable symptoms make keratitis less probable. However, infectious causes must be considered, especially if corneal involvement develops, so include for completeness.  5. Diagnosis: Early Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Orbital cellulitis presents with swelling, redness, tenderness, and systemic symptoms, but usually includes proptosis, limited ocular motility, and fever. Since these signs aren\u2019t reported, it\u2019s less likely but still worth consideration in the differential, especially if systemic symptoms worsen.

Her organized response pattern indicates she is trying to be cooperative but cautious. - Response style: Responses tend to be concise and non-committal, avoiding detailed descriptions to possibly avoid revealing greater concern or discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation to describe any worsening or specific features of her eye symptoms, coupled with vague language, suggests some withholding. - Minimization behaviors: Use of 'kind of' and 'stayed that way' points to downplaying actual symptom severity or progression. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration is evident; she appears to understate her discomfort. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight hesitation or tentativeness when discussing her eye discomfort, indicating possible discomfort or shyness. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident problems; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: Not notably present in responses; responses seem personally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Downplaying/minimization bias, as she appears to understate severity and progression of symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her responses are cautious, and her language reflects an effort to minimize, which could mask actual worsening. - Areas affected: Eye symptoms and possibly fatigue are most biased, with her perception that they haven't changed potentially inaccurate. - Reliability: Moderate: her self-report provides a baseline but may require objective assessment to ascertain real severity due to tendency to minimize.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Subtle worsening or functional impact of her eye condition may be underreported; she may not be fully aware of or willing to admit progression. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any worsening in vision or pain is likely understated, given her language. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry may be genuine, but her cautious language may exaggerate her fears to some extent. - True timeline: Her perception suggests stability, but subtle progression could be ongoing, necessitating careful clinical examination to clarify.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The current description suggests some uncertainty about the presence and extent of worsening symptoms, especially related to visual disturbances or systemic signs. It\u2019s also unclear whether the tenderness and redness are the same in intensity or if any subtle progression has occurred. Additional details about eye pain, photophobia, or visual changes are needed to differentiate scleritis from uveitis or other causes. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if her symptoms include features characteristic of scleritis, uveitis, or less likely conditions like episcleritis, to refine the differential diagnosis. - Patient factors: Given her reserved and cautious communication style, questions should be open-ended but focused enough to elicit specific symptom details without seeming confrontational, encouraging more honest reporting. - Interview phase goals: To identify signs of progression, particularly any new or worsening vision changes, pain intensity, or systemic symptoms, to better assess severity and activity.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused follow-up to probe for subtle changes or worsening that she might have underreported. - Information target: Nature and degree of any recent changes in eye symptoms (pain, redness, visual disturbances), and what triggers or alleviates them. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently, acknowledging her cautiousness, e.g., \u201cHave you noticed any new or different sensations in your eye since we last spoke? Like more pain, redness, or any changes in how it looks or feels?\u201d - Expected value: This will help uncover any signs of symptom progression, refine assessment of inflammation activity, and determine urgency or need for further evaluation.\nANSWER: \"Since you mentioned your eye has stayed the same, have you noticed any tiny changes or new feelings\u2014like if your vision has become a little blurrier, if the redness looks slightly different, or if there\u2019s any new discomfort, even if it seems minor?\"",

Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The presence of ocular redness, swelling, tenderness, and subjective visual disturbance. - Medium confidence: The stability of symptoms as reported, which may underestimate actual progression; the degree of ocular discomfort. - Low confidence: The true extent of inflammation or visual impairment, due to patient minimization and cautious reporting. - Missing information: Precise visual acuity, presence of discharge, systemic signs such as fever, and detailed ophthalmologic examination findings are needed to establish severity.Scleritis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague, cautious, and qualifying language, such as \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"possibly,\" which limits specificity. - Information flow: Responses are generally direct but minimal; they do not volunteer additional details unless directly asked, indicating reticence. - Response style: Responses are brief and measured, avoiding elaboration, possibly to prevent alarming or out of discomfort.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation in confirming visual changes despite symptoms; reluctance to assert severity reflects possible underreporting. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with words like \"a little blurry\" or \"doesn\u2019t seem to hurt more,\" potentially underestimating the problem. - Amplification patterns: No evidence of over-worrying; responses suggest careful understatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight uncertainty about visual symptoms suggests a mild discomfort discussing eye issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident memory or timeline inconsistencies observed. - Family influence: Responses seem internally guided; no clear signs of external influence affecting honesty.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias: Mild minimization, aimed at avoiding overstatement or discomfort, potentially leading to underestimation of actual visual impairment. - Severity: Moderate; the subtle downplaying could hide meaningful clinical findings. - Areas most affected: Visual symptoms are most biased, with possible underreporting of severity. - Reliability: Moderate; responses provide some accurate information but may underestimate actual severity, requiring objective assessment to confirm.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of visual impairment; patient may not be fully aware of or willing to communicate the severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Onset or progression of vision changes; the patient\u2019s cautious language may hide more serious deterioration. - Concerns probably amplified: Not particularly over-confident or anxious; responses suggest usual concern but not exaggerated. - True timeline: Actual visual changes might have developed more sharply or extensively than indicated, given the patient\u2019s tendency to understate.  Overall, the patient's communication exhibits mild to moderate minimization bias, especially around visual symptoms, which could hinder accurate clinical assessment without corroborating objective findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about the severity and specifics of visual changes, if any, and whether systemic or ocular signs are present or developing. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming if the eye symptoms meet criteria for ongoing activity or complications of scleritis, especially regarding visual impairment and systemic involvement. - Patient factors: Given the cautious and vague communication style, targeted, gentle, yet specific questions are needed to elicit clearer information while respecting her hesitance. - Interview phase goals: Clarify the current status of visual function, assess for any signs of worsening or systemic features, and explore her understanding and concerns before moving toward shared decision-making.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, with some confirmatory components to address uncertainty about visual changes and symptom stability. - Information target: Visual acuity, discharge, systemic signs, symptom progression, impact on daily life. - Communication approach: Clear, reassuring, with emphasis on understanding her experience without leading or alarming, to encourage honest and detailed responses. - Expected value: Gathering definitive information regarding her visual symptoms and systemic health, guiding evaluation of disease activity and urgency.\nANSWER: \"Thanks for sharing that. To make sure I understand correctly, have you noticed any specific changes in your vision\u2014like blurriness, double vision, or difficulty seeing clearly\u2014since your symptoms first started? And do you see any new discharge, light sensitivity, or anything else unusual in your eye now? Also, have you experienced any new or worsening pain, fever, or other symptoms that might suggest the inflammation is changing?\"",
