    "input": "The patient presents with a sudden onset of abdominal pain starting around the umbilical area and migrating to the lower right quadrant, associated with nausea, vomiting, feverish sensation, weakness, and decreased bowel movements. Communication patterns suggest an organized and factual reporting with minimal emotional exaggeration, indicating high-confidence descriptions, but there may be slight underreporting of symptom severity and functional impact. The patient may be minimizing how much the symptoms interfere with daily activities or sleep, thus actual severity could be higher. Certain symptoms such as pain, nausea, fever, and decreased bowel movements are well-established, but others like systemically severe symptoms or additional signs may be underreported. Additional details about the intensity, timing, and functional consequences are needed for comprehensive assessment. Patient demographics: 22-year-old male. Chief complaint: Acute abdominal pain initially around the umbilicus, migrating to the right lower abdomen, with associated nausea, vomiting, feverish sensation, weakness, and decreased bowel movement.1. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Classic presentation with peri-umbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, associated with nausea, vomiting, feverish sensation, weakness, and decreased bowel movements; common in this age group, and a typical differential consideration.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis\nJustification: Mimics appendicitis with right lower quadrant pain, often seen in young adults, can present with systemic symptoms like fever and nausea, and is a common benign mimic in this age group.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Can cause generalized abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fever; however, migration of pain and localized tenderness make it less likely, but still possible.\n4. Diagnosis: Crohn\u2019s disease flare involving the terminal ileum\nJustification: May present with right lower quadrant pain, systemic symptoms, and bowel disturbances; typically in older patients but can occur in young adults.\n5. Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion\nJustification: Usually affects females; less likely here but still part of differential for right lower quadrant pain.\n6. Diagnosis: Kidney stone (ureteral calculus)\nJustification: Can present with severe flank or lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting; often sudden, but less typical migration of pain compared to appendicitis.\n7. Diagnosis: Perforated peptic ulcer\nJustification: Can produce referred pain to the umbilical area, associated with systemic symptoms; migration pattern less typical.\n8. Diagnosis: Diverticulitis\nJustification: Common in older adults, but can cause right lower quadrant pain if involving the cecum; less probable in this age group.\n9. Diagnosis: Incarcerated inguinal hernia\nJustification: Can cause localized pain and systemic symptoms; unlikely without hernia history but considered.\n10. Diagnosis: Intestinal obstruction\nJustification: Decreased bowel movements and systemic symptoms are possible, but the migratory pain pattern favors other diagnoses; less likely as primary diagnosis.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses specific, clinical descriptions such as \"really bad pain,\" \"suddenly,\" \"kept getting worse,\" and \"feeling pretty sick,\" which indicate an attempt to provide concrete details without overt emotional exaggeration. There's little use of vague or emotionally charged language, suggesting a focus on factual reporting.\n- Information flow: Responses are clear, direct, and organized, conveying core symptoms without unnecessary elaboration. The patient volunteers key details without prompting, indicating an open communication style.\n- Response style: The responses are concise and focused, avoiding tangential information or explanations, which may suggest a desire to be efficient or a perception that extra details are unnecessary.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; the patient openly reports major symptoms relevant to diagnosis.\n- Minimization behaviors: Limited; the use of \"really bad\" and \"kept getting worse\" suggests some acknowledgment of severity, but overall, language remains measured.\n- Amplification patterns: Absent; the patient does not exaggerate symptoms beyond typical descriptors.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No evident discomfort or shame, as responses are straightforward.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; the timeline and symptom progression are consistent.\n- Family influence: Not apparent; responses are self-contained and internally consistent.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimal bias; the patient appears to communicate primarily with accuracy seeking to convey pertinent information plainly.\n- Severity: Mild; some underreporting of perceived severity (e.g., \"just kept getting worse\") could exist, but overall, communication is clear.\n- Areas most affected: Minor potential understatement of symptom intensity; clinical severity is probably slightly underestimated but within acceptable limits.\n- Reliability: Generally reliable; responses are consistent and relevant, with only slight caution needed for possible minor understatements of discomfort.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient might understate the degree of pain or discomfort, possibly minimizing perceived severity to seem cooperative or uninvolved emotionally.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The true intensity of pain and distress may be slightly worse than described; no explicit mention of pain's impact on daily activity.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Not evident; the patient maintains a calm, factual tone, suggesting no undue amplification.\n- True timeline: The progression appears accurate; symptoms started suddenly and worsened over time, aligned with typical appendicitis presentation.",

Present illness: The patient reports sudden onset of abdominal pain around the umbilicus that migrated to the right lower abdomen. He reports associated nausea, vomiting, feverish sensations, weakness, and a decrease in bowel movements. While he states the pain is severe enough to prevent normal activities and sleep, these functional impairments may be slightly exaggerated; the actual severity could be greater. No other symptoms such as chills, worsening fever, or additional systemic signs have been explicitly mentioned but may be present. The timeline suggests an acute process developing within the past 24 hours, with progression of symptoms as described.1. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Classic presentation with initial periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, associated with nausea, vomiting, feverish sensation, and decreased bowel movements; common in young adults.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis\nJustification: Presents with right lower quadrant pain and mild systemic symptoms, often mimicking appendicitis; more common in young adults.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Nausea, vomiting, systemic symptoms; however, less likely to cause migratory pain or localized right lower quadrant tenderness.\n4. Diagnosis: Meckel\u2019s diverticulitis\nJustification: Can cause acute localized abdominal pain, sometimes mimicking appendicitis; often in younger patients and involves the ileum.\n5. Diagnosis: Crohn's disease (initial flare)\nJustification: Right lower quadrant pain, systemic symptoms; less likely as an acute process but possible if undiagnosed.\n6. Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion\nJustification: Less likely given male gender; included for completeness if the patient were female.\n7. Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection or ureteral stone\nJustification: Can cause abdominal pain and nausea; however, typically not migratory and less localized to RLQ.\n8. Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy\nJustification: Not applicable in male; included to consider differential if context differed.\n9. Diagnosis: Inflammatory bowel disease (initial exacerbation)\nJustification: Similar to Crohn's; can cause localized abdominal pain and systemic symptoms.\n10.

Chief complaint: Acute abdominal pain starting around the umbilicus and migrating to the right lower quadrant, with associated nausea, vomiting, sensation of fever, weakness, and decreased bowel movements. Present illness: The patient reports a sudden onset of abdominal pain initially localized near the umbilicus that has migrated to the right lower abdomen and become constant and more severe over time. He describes associated nausea and vomiting, along with subjective feelings of being feverish and weak, and reports fewer bowel movements. While he states the pain significantly disrupts sleep and daily activities, these descriptions may be slightly exaggerated due to emotional distress. No systemic signs such as confirmed fever or chills have been explicitly reported. The symptoms suggest an acute abdominal process consistent with appendiceal inflammation, with possible underestimation or overstatement of severity based on communication biases. Further assessment of systemic signs and detailed gastrointestinal and systemic examination are necessary to confirm clinical findings.1. Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis\nJustification: Classic migratory abdominal pain from umbilicus to right lower quadrant, nausea, vomiting, fever sensation, and systemic weakness align with typical presentation of appendicitis; common in this age group.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Adenitis\nJustification: Similar right lower quadrant pain and systemic symptoms, often seen in young adults and caused by lymphoid tissue inflammation, can mimic appendicitis but usually has milder symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Nausea, vomiting, and generalized abdominal discomfort may suggest infectious gastroenteritis, though the localized pain pattern is less typical.\n4. Diagnosis: Cecal diverticulitis\nJustification: Inflammation of diverticula in the cecum can cause right lower quadrant pain resembling appendicitis, more common in slightly older adults but possible here.\n5. Diagnosis: Early Crohn's Disease Flare\nJustification: Crohn\u2019s can involve terminal ileum, causing right lower quadrant pain, diarrhea, and systemic symptoms, but less acute and more chronic.\n6. Diagnosis: Ovarian Torsion (less likely in male, but included for differential completeness in females)\nJustification: Right lower quadrant pain with nausea; not relevant here due to male patient but important as a differential in females.\n7. Diagnosis: Ureteral Stone\nJustification: Sudden onset of abdominal pain radiating to the groin, associated with nausea/vomiting, can cause similar presentation but usually more flank pain and hematuria.\n8. Diagnosis: Meckel's Diverticulitis\nJustification: Congenital diverticulum on the ileum can inflame and mimic appendicitis in young patients, causing similar migrating pain.\n9. Diagnosis: Constipation/Functional Bowel Disorder\nJustification: Decreased bowel movements and discomfort, but unlikely to cause migratory pain or systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting.\n10.

    "input": "Patient demographics: 22-year-old male Chief complaint: Sudden onset abdominal pain initially around the umbilicus, now localized to the right lower quadrant, with associated nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, weakness, and decreased bowel movements. Present illness: The patient reports a rapid onset of abdominal pain starting yesterday around the umbilicus, which has migrated to the right lower abdomen and became constant and more intense over time. He describes associated nausea and vomiting and states feeling feverish and weak, with a significant reduction in bowel movements. The attack of pain appears to be severe and persistent, affecting sleep and daily functioning. Communication suggests these reports are honest and coherent, but some symptoms, particularly subjective fever and overall weakness, may be emotionally exaggerated, potentially overestimating severity.1. Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis\nJustification: The hallmark features include sudden onset, initial peri-umbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, worsening over time, associated nausea and vomiting, subjective fever, and decreased bowel movements. These are classic signs of appendicitis. The patient's young age and typical symptom progression reinforce this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Lymphadenitis\nJustification: Common in young adults with clinical features similar to appendicitis, including right lower quadrant pain and systemic symptoms. Often associated with viral infections, which can cause lymphoid hyperplasia mimicking appendicitis, especially when the pain is migratory. The subjective fever and systemic symptoms could be explained here, but the specific pain migration pattern favors appendicitis.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Nausea, vomiting, systemic symptoms, and decreased bowel movements are consistent with infectious gastroenteritis. However, the localized right lower quadrant pain, especially with its migration, makes this less likely as the primary cause but still relevant as a differential, particularly if the pain is less localized or more diffuse at initial presentation.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian or Testicular Torsion (if applicable)\nJustification: In males, testicular torsion can mimic appendicitis with lower abdominal pain. However, the report does not specify testicular pain or swelling, and age-specific features are not detailed. It remains a consideration in male patients with lower abdominal pain but less likely here given the classical presentation of appendicitis.\n5. Diagnosis: Early Diverticulitis (less likely at this age)\nJustification: Typically affects older individuals, but can occasionally present in young adults. Pain often localizes to the left lower quadrant, but right-sided diverticulitis can occur. The absence of prior diverticulosis history and the clinical picture makes this less probable, but included as a lower-probability differential.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs specific, emotionally charged language (\"hurts so bad,\" \"worse than before\") indicating genuine distress.

    "input": "A 22-year-old male presents with a history of sudden onset abdominal pain beginning around the umbilicus yesterday and migrating to the right lower quadrant, where it remains constant and worsened over time. He reports associated nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, weakness, and decreased bowel movements. The pain describes as sharp initially, now more sore and worsened with movement and respiration; however, specific intensity measurements are not available. Systemic symptoms such as fever are reported subjectively without objective verification. The clinical picture suggests an acute ongoing intra-abdominal process, with features compatible with appendicitis or another localized inflammatory condition, though systemic and severity details may be underreported due to communication tendencies. Further examination and objective measurements are needed to confirm severity and systemic involvement.1. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: The evolution of pain from peri-umbilical to RLQ, persistence and worsening over time, along with associated nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, and decreased bowel motility, are classic features of appendicitis. The localized right lower quadrant tenderness and systemic symptoms support this diagnosis, making it the most probable cause of the clinical picture.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis\nJustification: This condition can mimic appendicitis with similar presentation of RLQ pain, especially in young adults. It often follows a viral illness and presents with lymphadenopathy in mesenteric nodes causing similar symptoms, but typically has less severe systemic signs and may involve less localized tenderness.\n3. Diagnosis: Ovarian pathology (e.g., ovarian cyst rupture or torsion)\nJustification: In females, ovarian cysts or torsion could cause RLQ pain and resemble appendicitis; however, in this 22-year-old male, this is irrelevant, thus unlikely.\n4. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: The nausea and vomiting could be due to gastroenteritis, but the localized migration of pain and worsening intensity, along with systemic signs, argue against a primary gastrointestinal infection.\n5. Diagnosis: Constipation or bowel obstruction\nJustification: Decreased bowel movements are noted, but the acute onset and localized pain pattern favor inflammation over mechanical obstruction, although it remains a consideration in differential diagnosis.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs somewhat vague and emotionally tinged descriptors, avoiding precise clinical terminology and opting for general expressions like \"really sore\" and \"keeps getting worse.\" This suggests an attempt to communicate distress without being overly detailed.\n- Information flow: They are relatively forthcoming but tend to incorporate additional emotional or subjective comments, indicating a pattern of elaboration rather than strict clinical accuracy.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborative, with a slight tendency to understate or generalize symptoms, possibly to manage emotional discomfort or because of difficulty articulating sensations.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No clear withholding; they share coherent progression of symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Subtle downplaying evident in descriptions like \"really sore\" rather than using more intense descriptors, possibly to avoid alarming.\n- Amplification patterns: No significant overstatement detected.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal; responses don\u2019t show discomfort about symptoms but may indicate emotional distress.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness in describing the pain's qualities could reflect limited vocabulary or difficulty articulating sensations more specifically.\n- Family influence: No evident influence seen in responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Slight minimization or vagueness bias; the patient avoids highly specific, vivid descriptions, possibly dampening perceived severity.\n- Severity: Mild bias, as responses are consistent but lack clinical specificity.\n- Most affected areas: The detailed characterization of pain qualities and intensity; descriptions may underrepresent actual severity.\n- Reliability: Fairly trustworthy but should be supplemented with objective examination due to the tendency for vague descriptions.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise descriptors of pain intensity, quality, and timing nuances, which are critical for assessment.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The patient may be understating pain severity or urgency, emphasizing general distress over specific features.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress indicates concern; they may be more worried than they express, but communication minimizes explicit alarm.\n- True timeline: Likely consistent with the patient\u2019s report, but their vagueness in describing pain could obscure subtle progression details, making objective assessment vital.",

    "input": "A 22-year-old male presents with an acute onset of abdominal pain initially localized around the umbilicus and now constant in the right lower quadrant, with reported worsening over time. He reports associated nausea, vomiting, subjective feeling of fever, weakness, and decreased bowel movements. The patient describes the pain as sharp initially, now more sore, and worsened by movement and breathing, with a self-rated intensity of 9 or 10 out of 10, likely reflecting emotional distress rather than precise measurement. No objective measurements of fever or systemic signs have been documented at this time. The clinical picture suggests acute intra-abdominal inflammation, such as appendicitis, although confirmation requires physical examination and laboratory assessment. Additional objective data, including temperature measurement and evaluation of systemic symptoms, are necessary to further assess severity and systemic involvement.1. Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis\nJustification: The presentation with initial peri-umbilical pain progressing to right lower quadrant, increasing severity, and associated nausea, vomiting, and systemic symptoms is characteristic of appendicitis. The pain description as sharp initially and now sore, worsened by movement and breathing, fits typical inflammatory intra-abdominal pathology involving the appendix.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Adenitis\nJustification: This condition can mimic appendicitis with RLQ pain, especially in young adults. It often follows an infectious prodrome and may cause similar systemic symptoms. However, it is less likely if systemic signs are pronounced or if imaging shows no lymphadenopathy, but its inclusion accounts for differential diagnoses with similar presentation.\n3. Diagnosis: Cecal Diverticulitis\nJustification: Can cause right lower quadrant pain similar to appendicitis, particularly in young adults. Its presentation overlaps with appendicitis, but it is less common in this age group, making it a consideration, especially if imaging indicates diverticula or localized cecal inflammation.\n4. Diagnosis: Small Bowel Inflammation (e.g., Crohn's Disease flare)\nJustification: Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum can cause RLQ pain, nausea, and systemic symptoms. But the abrupt onset and more localized pain emphasize an acute process like appendicitis over chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n5. Diagnosis: Ovarian pathology (e.g., ovarian torsion or cyst rupture)\nJustification: Ovarian conditions can present with acute RLQ pain in females; however, the patient is male, making this unlikely, but included as part of comprehensive differential considerations in similar clinical scenarios.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses detailed, specific descriptions regarding symptom locations and sensations, with some mild vagueness (\"like really sore\"). They tend to include emotional qualifiers (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") to convey distress, but avoid overly clinical language.\n- Information flow: Generally forthcoming with clear, consistent responses aligned with questions asked. They add emotional qualifiers, indicating openness tempered with mild discomfort.\n- Response style: Responses are elaborative in describing the pain and timing, and direct, though they sometimes include hedging (\"I don\u2019t know\") which suggests slight uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: No significant withholding; responses are open and detailed.\n- Minimization behaviors: Minimal; the patient describes severe, escalating symptoms convincingly.\n- Amplification patterns: Slight potential for emotional amplification, as they report high pain levels and emotional distress, but this seems authentic given the context.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Mild hesitations, possibly about not describing their pain perfectly or fear of not being understood.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; their timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent.\n- Family influence: Not apparent in responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Likely minimal bias; responses seem sincere with some mild emotional amplification, common in distressed patients.\n- Severity: Mild, as responses are consistent and detailed.\n- Areas most affected: Emotional expression and pain severity ratings, but overall data reliable.\n- Reliability: High; responses are coherent, detailed, and consistent with clinical presentation.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Emotional impact beyond physical symptoms, such as fear or anxiety about diagnosis, might be understated.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: No clear signs of minimization; severity is convincingly expressed.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress may heighten perceived severity slightly.\n- True timeline: Consistent with clinical signs; acute presentation aligns with patient report.\nOverall, this patient communicates honestly about their severe, worsening symptoms with mild emotional influences that could slightly elevate perceived severity but do not undermine report accuracy.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: 22-year-old male. Chief complaint: Acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and systemic symptoms, possibly more severe than initially communicated. Present illness: The patient reports sudden onset of abdominal pain beginning around the umbilicus and migrating to the right lower quadrant. He describes the pain as sharp initially, now more sore and constantly present, rated as 9 or 10 out of 10, with worsening over time. He reports nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, weakness, and decreased bowel activity. The patient states the pain worsens with movement and breathing. No objective temperature measurement or physical exam findings have been recorded; systemic signs are based on patient report and emotional cues.Acute appendicitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses mild, vaguer language (\"kind of,\" \"like a\") to describe symptoms, coupled with emotional disclosures (\"scared,\" \"overwhelmed\") which add emotional tone.\n- Information flow: Responses are primarily concise with some hedging, revealing reluctance or caution in full disclosure. They tend to speak openly about feelings once prompted.\n- Response style: The patient provides direct answers but softens details with qualifying language, indicating possible discomfort or a tendency to understate.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Hesitant about exact pain descriptions, fever, and temperature, hinting at potential underreporting.\n- Minimization behaviors: The use of \"kind of\" and \"maybe\" suggests some effort to downplay symptom severity.\n- Amplification patterns: While not overtly exaggerated, the pain scale at a high level indicates genuine distress, but the hedging introduces some uncertainty.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort in elaborating on symptoms, possibly to avoid seeming overly vulnerable.\n- Confusion/memory issues: None evident; responses are coherent and consistent.\n- Family influence: No signs present; responses seem independently generated.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, especially around fever and pain descriptors, likely to avoid alarming the provider.\n- Severity: Moderate; responses are generally truthful but include hedging, which impacts full symptom clarity.\n- Areas most affected: Fever description and pain's exact nature may be understated.\n- Reliability: Fairly trustworthy overall, but some caution needed due to hedging and vagueness.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The severity of fever and pain may be underestimated, risking underappreciation of disease extent.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Fever and the intensity of pain seem underreported.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Emotional distress (fear/scared) is genuine and possibly magnifying perceived severity.\n- True timeline: Sequence likely accurate; however, emotional factors may influence perceived intensity and urgency.\n# Short Answer\nSTEP 1 - LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:\n- Minimizing language: The patient employs both direct and hedging phrases like \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" and \"like\" to soften descriptions, indicating an attempt to downplay the severity of symptoms.\n- Amplifying language: The pain description \"really sore\" and the scale rating \"9 or maybe a 10\" suggest acknowledgment of high pain levels, though the use of \"maybe\" indicates some uncertainty or desire to avoid exaggeration.\n- Vague language: Frequent use of \"kind of,\" \"like,\" and \"maybe\" introduces vagueness, possibly to avoid appearing too distressed or to keep descriptions flexible.\n- Emotional language: Descriptors such as \"overwhelmed and scared\" point to significant emotional distress, which might amplify perceived severity but can also influence responses.\nSTEP 2 - RESPONSE PATTERN ANALYSIS:\n- Response length: Concise responses with occasional qualifiers, suggesting discomfort in elaboration and possible reluctance to disclose full extent.\n- Directness: Generally direct when answering scale and specific symptom queries, but qualifiers soften responses.\n- Information volunteering: The patient provides minimal extra information unless specifically asked, indicating cautious disclosure.\n- Consistency: Responses are internally consistent, describing symptoms progressing and emphasizing severity.\nSTEP 3 - BEHAVIORAL INDICATOR IDENTIFICATION:\n- Signs of information withholding: Hesitance in explicit symptom descriptions and temperature details, possibly to understate severity.\n- Minimization behaviors: Use of \"kind of,\" \"maybe,\" and soft language to avoid alarms.\n- Amplification patterns: The high pain scale score \"9 or maybe 10\" shows genuine distress but could also serve to have their pain acknowledged.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight discomfort indicated by hedging, possibly related to vulnerability.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion;
