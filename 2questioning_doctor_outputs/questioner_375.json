    "input": "The patient presents with a multi-symptom complaint, including headache, fatigue, dull chest pain radiating to the back, visual disturbances characterized by blurry vision in one eye, and abdominal cramps experienced over the past few weeks. While these symptoms are reported as progressively worsening, the patient appears hesitant and hesitant to fully specify the severity, particularly concerning the chest pain and visual changes. There is reason to suspect that the actual severity of chest discomfort and visual symptoms may be greater than reported, and some associated symptoms such as shortness of breath or neurological deficits could be unreported. Further detailed assessment is required to clarify the nature, intensity, and progression of these symptoms to fully evaluate potential underlying causes and urgency.1. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection\nJustification: The chest pain radiating to the back is characteristic; concerns about underreported severity suggest potential for life-threatening vascular event, especially in an adult patient.\n2. Diagnosis: Retinal Ischemia or Embolism (Retinal Artery Occlusion)\nJustification: Unilateral blurry vision suggests possible retinal artery occlusion, which may be linked to embolic or vascular pathology, possibly related to carotid or cardiac sources.\n3. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke\nJustification: Visual disturbances with other neurological symptoms and possible unreported deficits raise concern for cerebrovascular ischemia, especially if associated with vascular risk factors.\n4. Diagnosis: Cardiac Ischemia or Angina Pectoris\nJustification: Dull chest pain radiating to the back, exacerbated or unreported, could relate to cardiac ischemia, especially if other risk factors are present, and might be masked or underreported.\n5. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal or Abdominal Pathology (e.g., Gastroenteritis, Peptic Ulcer, or Other)\nJustification: Abdominal cramps over weeks suggest a potential gastrointestinal process, which might be related or incidental, but warrants consideration.\n6. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Large Vessel Vasculitis like Giant Cell Arteritis)\nJustification: Systemic symptoms including headache, visual disturbances, and arterial symptoms might be explained by vasculitic processes affecting cranial and large vessels.\n7. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: Headache and visual disturbances could be due to migraine, although the chest pain and systemic symptoms are less typical, but should be considered.\n8. Diagnosis: Infectious or Inflammatory Process (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, or other systemic infection)\nJustification: Systemic symptoms including fatigue, worsening over weeks, and multi-symptom involvement may be attributable to infectious causes.\n9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Psychogenic Disorders\nJustification: Symptoms may be partially functional or psychogenic in origin, especially if physical signs are less prominent, though this is less likely given the severity and combination of symptoms.\n10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism or Cardiac Thromboembolic Event\nJustification: Chest pain radiating to the back and potential unreported shortness of breath could suggest embolic events affecting pulmonary or cardiac circulation, although less supported by current data.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague, hedging language (\"pretty rough,\" \"sort of,\" \"a little\"), indicating an attempt to soften descriptions and possibly understate severity. They use emotional descriptors (\"worried,\" \"getting worse\") to convey concern but avoid detailed, clinical language.\n- Information flow: Responses are elaborative but contain hesitation and qualifiers, which suggest partial withholding of information. They volunteer general symptoms but avoid specifics about intensity or impact unless prompted, indicating selective disclosure.\n- Response style: The patient offers an organized overview but with signs of reluctance or discomfort, resulting in responses that are somewhat scattered and laden with qualifiers. There is a pattern of incremental revelation, hinting at possible underlying embarrassment or uncertainty.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of vague descriptors and hedging language, especially concerning the chest pain and vision changes, suggest withholding full severity details.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying fatigue and discomfort (\"pretty rough,\" \"just feeling really tired,\" \"sort of radiates\") demonstrates an effort to minimize symptoms' severity, possibly to avoid perceived alarm or embarrassment.\n- Amplification patterns: There is little evidence of exaggeration; rather, the patient may understate symptoms, which could hinder accurate risk assessment.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: Hedging language and reluctance to specify severity point toward discomfort discussing certain symptoms, possibly due to shame or fear.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs, but some hesitation may reflect uncertainty about detail accuracy.\n- Family influence: No direct evidence, but their cautious disclosures might be influenced by feelings of vulnerability possibly linked to social or familial perceptions.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Symptom minimization and partial withholding, chiefly evident in vague descriptions and avoidance of severity details.\n- Severity: Moderate, since the patient discloses enough to suggest urgency but hides true extent, which can impact clinical judgment.\n- Areas most affected: Chest pain and visual changes are most likely underreported in severity; fatigue seems under-described as well.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses are organized but contain hedging that diminishes complete trustworthiness. Additional probing may be necessary for accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The true severity and impact of chest pain and vision changes are probably greater than stated, potentially masking emergency features.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Chest pain and visual disturbances may be more intense or urgent than communicated.\n- Concerns probably amplified: Worry levels conveyed suggest genuine concern, but their understatement of symptoms could diminish perceived urgency, increasing risk of under-triage.\n- True timeline: Symptoms likely progressed more rapidly or severely than reported due to the patient's cautious language and possible reluctance to disclose full distress.",

    "input": "The patient is a [demographic details not provided] presenting with a primary concern of ongoing multisymptom complaints spanning at least the past few weeks. They report having a dull, continuous chest pain radiating to the back, and episodes of blurry vision in one eye, which they describe as worsening at times. They also report persistent headache, fatigue, and abdominal cramps. Objective assessment is limited by the patient's tendency to minimize symptoms, indicating that the true severity of chest pain and visual changes could be greater than reported. There are no current reports of additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, neurological deficits, dizziness, or weakness, but these cannot be excluded due to communication patterns. The timeline suggests gradual progression, but further detailed history and examinations are needed to accurately assess the severity, progression, and associated features of the patient's condition.1. Diagnosis: Large-vessel vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis)\nJustification: The patient's age and presentation of constitutional symptoms, limb or chest pain, and visual disturbances suggest large vessel inflammation, especially affecting the aorta and its branches, which can cause ischemic symptoms and visual changes.\n2. Diagnosis: Anterior or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nJustification: Episodic blurry vision in one eye with persistent headache raises concern for ischemic optic nerve injury, which could be secondary to vascular pathology such as vasculitis or hypertension.\n3. Diagnosis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\nJustification: Chest pain radiating to the back could be related to atherosclerosis affecting the aorta or coronary vessels, especially in older patients; however, multisystem symptoms suggest broader pathology.\n4. Diagnosis: Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm\nJustification: Continuous dull chest pain radiating to the back is characteristic of aortic dissection, especially if related to hypertension or structural weakness.\n5. Diagnosis: Giant cell arteritis\nJustification: While more common in older adults, this vasculitis presents with headache, visual disturbances, and systemic symptoms, fitting some aspects of the presentation, though less likely if the patient is younger.\n6. Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: Multisystem complaints including constitutional symptoms, abdominal cramps, and visual changes may be consistent with autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems, even in absence of skin findings.\n7. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis\nJustification: Episodic visual symptoms and headache could suggest demyelinating disease; however, the chest pain and abdominal cramps are less typical.\n8. Diagnosis: Infectious endocarditis or vasculitis\nJustification: Persistent multisymptom complaints and vascular findings could be due to infectious causes causing vasculitis or embolic phenomena.\n9. Diagnosis: Psychosomatic or somatic symptom disorder\nJustification: The tendency to minimize symptoms and the complex multisystem complaints could partly be psychosomatic; however, serious organic causes need exclusion first.\n10. Diagnosis: Renal or systemic hypertension-related vascular disease\nJustification: Although not explicitly mentioned, persistent headache and vascular symptoms might relate to hypertensive end-organ damage affecting vasculature, contributing to symptoms.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs softening words like \"kinda\" and \"just,\" indicating an inclination to lessen perceived symptom severity. Emotional expressions such as \"I'm just worried\" show internal concern but in a subdued manner.\n- Information flow: They are somewhat reluctant to divulge full details, offering vague responses unless prompted, and avoid elaborating on specific symptom impact.\n- Response style: Responses are concise, with selective detail, reflecting a tendency to avoid framing symptoms as severe or alarming.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of non-specific, mild descriptors (e.g., \"kinda dull,\" \"just like blurry\") suggests they might downplay the true severity of symptoms.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying pain and visual symptoms indicates possible underreporting; this could be driven by discomfort discussing serious issues or a desire to minimize concern.\n- Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration is evident; responses are subdued, indicating underreporting rather than overstatement.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The hesitation and mild language could reflect discomfort or shame about symptoms perceived as minor or worries about seeming overly anxious.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Responses display coherence and consistency, so no notable issues here.\n- Family influence: No explicit evidence, but possible subconscious influence to minimize symptoms might speak to social or familial dynamics.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Symptom minimization bias, mainly shown by softening language and vague descriptions.\n- Severity: Moderate; there's a clear tendency to understate symptoms, which could lead to incomplete assessment.\n- Areas most affected: Pain and visual changes are most biased, as these are described with mild terms inconsistent with possible clinical severity.\n- Reliability: Moderate; responses require cautious interpretation, and further probing is necessary for accurate assessment.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: The patient might not be fully disclosing the true extent of pain or vision impairment, potentially underestimating risks.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The chronicity and intensity of pain and visual disturbances could be greater than conveyed.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s worry is genuine but may be disproportionate or based on incomplete information, affecting their response.\n- True timeline: Symptoms could have deteriorated more rapidly or intensely than the patient admits, due to underplaying.\nOverall, vigilant, open-ended questions and reassurance are needed to uncover the more severe underlying issues behind the subdued language.",

    "input": "The patient is experiencing a persistent, dull chest pain and recent onset of blurry vision in one eye, with symptom onset dating back approximately two weeks for headache and fatigue, and more recent development of chest and visual symptoms. Based on communication patterns indicating symptom minimization, the true severity of chest pain and visual disturbances may be greater than reported. Additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, or nocturnal chest pain episodes have not been clarified but may be present. Further assessment with detailed symptom quantification, evaluation of functional impact, and exploration of associated features is necessary to accurately determine the underlying condition.1. Diagnosis: Ischemic stroke (cerebral ischemia)\nJustification: Recent visual changes and headache with neurological symptoms suggest possible ischemic event affecting visual cortex or occipital lobe; stroke is an urgent diagnosis requiring prompt recognition.\n2. Diagnosis: Central retinal artery occlusion\nJustification: Acute visual disturbance in one eye with a recent onset, seen in vascular occlusion; associated with embolic phenomena or systemic vascular disease.\n3. Diagnosis: Cardiac ischemia or angina\nJustification: Persistent chest pain raises concern for coronary artery disease, especially if symptom severity is underestimated; warrants urgent assessment.\n4. Diagnosis: Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis)\nJustification: Age likely >50 (implied), headache, vision changes, fatigue; this vasculitis can cause ocular ischemia and systemic symptoms, requiring prompt treatment.\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: Visual disturbances and headache align with migraine phenomena; however, the persistent nature and other systemic symptoms make this less likely than vascular causes.\n6. Diagnosis: Optic neuritis\nJustification: Blurry vision and recent visual changes could be suggestive; usually associated with pain with eye movement, and less typically with chest pain.\n7. Diagnosis: Cardiovascular amyloidosis or infiltrative cardiomyopathy\nJustification: Fatigue and chest discomfort could suggest systemic infiltrative process affecting both cardiac and ocular tissues, though less common.\n8. Diagnosis: Infective endocarditis\nJustification: If systemic symptoms like fatigue are prominent, with a possible embolic source causing visual symptoms, but no fever or signs of infection specified.\n9. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism\nJustification: Chest pain with possible dyspnea; however, absence of symptoms like sudden onset pleuritic pain or hypoxia makes this less likely considering timeline.\n10. Diagnosis: Ocular hypertension or glaucoma\nJustification: Blurry vision may result from increased intraocular pressure, but less likely as sole cause given systemic symptoms and other findings.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and qualifying language (\"kinda dull,\" \"kind of worse\"), which indicates an attempt to minimize perceived symptom severity.

    "input": "The patient presents with persistent, dull chest pain and recent onset of unilateral blurry vision, with symptoms dating back approximately two weeks for headache and fatigue, and more recent development of chest and visual symptoms. Given patient communication patterns indicating possible minimization, the actual severity and impact of these symptoms may be greater. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify symptom characteristics, associated features, and potential underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)\nJustification: The recent unilateral vision disturbance, headache, fatigue, and age-related considerations strongly suggest GCA, which commonly affects older adults, causes cranial ischemic symptoms, and can involve ocular arteries leading to vision loss. The systemic symptoms support an inflammatory vasculitis impacting the temporal and possibly ophthalmic arteries.\n2. Diagnosis: Giant Cell Vasculitis with aortitis or large-vessel involvement\nJustification: The chest pain may indicate large-vessel involvement, such as aortitis or other large-artery inflammation, which can cause constitutional symptoms, chest discomfort, and vision changes due to ischemia. GCA can affect large arteries beyond cranial branches, explaining both chest pain and ocular symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Ischemic Ocular Event (Retinal or Ophthalmic Artery Ischemia) secondary to vasculitis\nJustification: The recent unilateral blurry vision raising suspicion for ischemic optic neuropathy or retinal artery occlusion aligns with vasculitis-induced ischemia, particularly if associated with large vessel inflammation. This process explains the new visual symptoms.\n4. Diagnosis: Infectious or Neurological cause (e.g., Neurosyphilis, Toxoplasmosis, or Multiple Sclerosis)\nJustification: While less likely, infectious causes like syphilis or demyelinating conditions like MS can cause vision changes. However, the systemic symptoms and subacute course favor vasculitis over these etiologies, which are included as alternative considerations.\n5. Diagnosis: Neoplastic Process (such as lymphoma or metastatic lesion)\nJustification: The fatigue and headache could, in rare cases, relate to neoplastic infiltration affecting CNS or vascular structures. Nonetheless, the acute-to-subacute progression with systemic inflammatory signs makes this less probable than vasculitis.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient uses vague descriptors like \"kinda dull,\" \"like blurry,\" and phrases such as \"it\u2019s worse sometimes,\" indicating a tendency toward non-specific, possibly minimized symptom reporting. There is minimal use of emotional language, mostly neutral or uncertain descriptors.\n- Information flow: Responses tend to be brief and primarily reactive to questions, with limited elaboration.

They also report headache and fatigue originating approximately two weeks ago. The communication pattern suggests the symptoms may be more severe and impactful than conveyed, and further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify the severity, duration, and associated features. A comprehensive evaluation should include precise quantification of pain, detailed description of visual symptoms, assessment for other neurological or systemic signs, and evaluation of functional impairment.1. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The gradual unilateral vision change suggests optic neuritis, a common initial manifestation of MS. The systemic fatigue and headache can also be attributed to CNS inflammation. MS often involves demyelination affecting visual pathways and can present with gradual visual blurring, along with systemic neurological symptoms. The persistent chest pain may be unrelated but could also result from neurogenic or musculoskeletal consequences of central neurological issues.\n2. Diagnosis: Ischemic or Vasculitic Cranial Nerve or Ocular Vessel Disease\nJustification: The unilateral, gradually worsening vision blurriness could be due to ischemia of the retina or optic nerve from vascular occlusion. The systemic symptoms (headache, fatigue) and persistent chest pain suggest a vasculitic process (e.g., giant cell arteritis, vasculitis) affecting large or medium vessels, including ocular and cerebral arteries. The age and symptom pattern support this, especially considering the recent headache and vision changes.\n3. Diagnosis: Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumor\nJustification: The insidious onset of vision changes and headache raises concern for intracranial mass effect impacting the optic pathways or occipital cortex. The chronic chest pain may be incidental or linked to systemic effects of a neoplasm. A slowly enlarging tumor could account for gradually worsening vision and headache, especially if involving optic chiasm or adjacent structures.\n4. Diagnosis: Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis)\nJustification: The constellation of systemic symptoms, headache, fatigue, and ocular involvement suggests systemic vasculitis affecting small to medium vessels, including ocular and possibly lung or other systemic organs. This can cause ocular ischemia, vision loss, and systemic symptoms. Chronic chest pain may reflect vasculitic involvement of thoracic vessels.\n5. Diagnosis: Neoplastic Process (e.g., Lymphoma or Metastatic Disease)\nJustification: Progressive vision decline and systemic symptoms could be paraneoplastic or direct infiltration by a neoplasm, especially if associated with constitutional symptoms and persistent chest discomfort. This is lower in probability but still should be considered, particularly if imaging or lab findings point toward malignancy.\nSTOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient employs vague and minimization phrases such as \"kinda dull\" and \"not sudden,\" which serve to soften the perceived severity. There is minimal emotional language; responses focus on superficial descriptions, avoiding detailed expression of distress.\n- Information flow: They tend to be reserved and guarded, offering basic timelines but only elaborating when specifically questioned, indicating reluctance to fully disclose the extent of symptoms initially.\n- Response style: Responses are generally concise and somewhat evasive, with a tendency toward understatement. When prompted, they provide slightly more detail but still avoid emotionally charged or precise descriptions.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: Use of softening language (\"kinda,\" \"just kinda happens\"), deflecting full acknowledgment of symptom severity, suggests intentional or subconscious withholding.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the intensity (\"kinda dull,\" \"not painful\"), which may obscure the true clinical picture.\n- Amplification patterns: Absent; responses do not overstate symptoms.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but the reserved tone and minimization hint at possible discomfort in admitting severity.\n- Confusion/memory issues: Slight hesitance in timeline and symptom description may reflect uncertainty rather than cognitive impairment.\n- Family influence: No evidence of external influence affecting responses.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization with possible withholding, primarily evident through cautious language and subdued descriptions.\n- Severity: Moderate; it could significantly affect assessment accuracy if not countered, but responses remain generally consistent.\n- Areas most affected: Symptom severity and personal impact\u2014especially regarding chest pain and vision changes\u2014where under-reporting muddies clinical assessment.\n- Reliability: Moderate; self-report is somewhat trustworthy but likely undervalues true symptom burden and urgency.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Actual severity and impact of symptoms; the patient may be experiencing more intense pain or visual impairment than expressed.\n- Symptoms probably minimized: The true extent of chest pain and vision issues, which could be more disabling or alarming.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s worries about worsening may be genuine but understated; actual clinical risk may be higher.\n- True timeline: The progression may be more rapid or severe\u2014initial symptoms could have escalated faster or had greater impact than reported.",

    "input": "The patient presents with a history of persistent dull chest pain radiating to the back that has been ongoing for several weeks. They also report a unilateral, gradually worsening visual disturbance characterized by blurriness in one eye over a few days, without associated pain or light sensitivity. Additional symptoms include headache and fatigue beginning approximately two weeks prior. Communication patterns suggest possible underreporting of symptom severity, and the true extent of the patient's discomfort and impact on daily activities may be greater than described. Further detailed assessment is needed to clarify the nature, severity, and associated features of these symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis\nJustification: The patient exhibits a constellation of symptoms\u2014gradually worsening unilateral visual disturbance, headache, fatigue, and chest pain\u2014that are characteristic of large-vessel vasculitis, especially giant cell arteritis (GCA). The visual disturbance without eye pain aligns with ischemic optic neuropathy due to inflammation of the ophthalmic artery or its branches. GCA often affects the aorta and its major branches, which could explain the chest pain radiating to the back given its potential involvement of the aortic arch or thoracic vessels. The systemic symptoms further support this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Aortitis/Large-vessel Vasculitis\nJustification: The persistent chest pain radiating to the back suggests involvement of the thoracic aorta or other large vessels. Large-vessel vasculitis, including Takayasu arteritis (though less common in older adults) or GCA, can cause vessel wall inflammation, leading to pain, temporal artery symptoms, and orbital ischemia. The gradual progression and systemic nature fit with this, and it explains both the chest and ocular symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (AION) secondary to vasculitis\nJustification: The unilateral visual blurriness evolving over days supports ischemic optic neuropathy, a common complication in vasculitis-related ocular ischemia. The absence of pain is typical of ischemic optic processes. The vascular inflammation from GCA or large-vessel disease compromises blood flow, leading to optic nerve ischemia.\n4. Diagnosis: Systemic Inflammatory or Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Polymyalgia Rheumatica)\nJustification: The systemic symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and the vascular phenomena suggest an inflammatory systemic illness. Polymyalgia rheumatica often coexists with GCA and can explain systemic symptoms, although it doesn\u2019t directly cause the ocular or chest symptoms but indicates an underlying systemic inflammatory disorder.\n5. Diagnosis: Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease\nJustification: While atherosclerosis could contribute to vascular symptoms, the acuteness of visual changes, systemic inflammatory signs, and the progressive timeline favor vasculitis over atherosclerosis. However, it remains a less likely cause that can exacerbate ischemic events.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS:\n- Language choices: The patient prefers vague, soft qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"just like\") which serve to minimize perceived severity, and uses emotional words like \"worried\" to convey concern without detailing the physical impact.\n- Information flow: Tends to be cautious, providing only necessary info with reluctance to go into specifics, demonstrating guardedness possibly to avoid alarm or judgment.\n- Response style: Responses are concise and somewhat guarded, rarely elaborating beyond basic descriptions, which might limit clinical understanding.\nBEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS:\n- Information withholding signs: The patient avoids detailed descriptions of pain and visual symptoms, possibly to conceal true severity or due to uncertainty.\n- Minimization behaviors: Downplaying pain (\"kind of dull,\" \"not painful\") and slow onset of vision symptoms suggest intentional or subconscious minimization.\n- Amplification patterns: While there is internal worry, the responses lack exaggerated language, indicating limited amplification.\n- Embarrassment/shame signals: The mention of feeling \"embarrassed\" to discuss eye symptoms suggests discomfort with this topic, which may hinder full disclosure.\n- Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; descriptions are consistent, indicating clear recall.\n- Family influence: No direct cues; responses are self-contained.\nBIAS_ASSESSMENT:\n- Primary bias type: Minimization coupled with guarded communication, aimed perhaps at self-protection or due to discomfort.\n- Severity: Moderate; responses are controlled and avoid detail, but overall coherence suggests no serious disconnection.\n- Areas most affected: Detailed symptom characterization\u2014particularly pain intensity and specific ocular features\u2014are minimized.\n- Reliability: Moderate; self-reports are stable but likely underestimate true symptom severity, affecting clinical assessment accuracy.\nCLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS:\n- Information likely missing: Precise symptom intensity, pain characteristics, and detailed ocular symptoms (e.g., light sensitivity, eye pain).\n- Symptoms probably minimized: Severity and impact of chest pain and visual changes are understated, risking underappreciation of urgency.\n- Concerns probably amplified: The emotional worry about symptom impact is genuine but may not reflect actual severity.\n- True timeline: Symptoms may be more acute or severe than reported, given patients' tendency to downplay or minimize discomfort to reduce anxiety.",
