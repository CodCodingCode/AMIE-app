    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with an acute onset of chest pain described as stabbing, along with difficulty swallowing, sensations of rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and sweating. Her emotional distress appears to influence her perception of symptom severity, which may be amplified, though the symptoms are likely genuine. She may also have experienced or be experiencing additional symptoms such as dizziness or prior similar episodes that she has not disclosed. Further assessment of medical history, associated neurological symptoms, and additional clinical details is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Acute, stabbing chest pain radiating posteriorly, possible blood pressure variability, and neurological symptoms could suggest dissection. The severity and abrupt onset are classic. Age increases risk, and it\u2019s critical to exclude this \"can't miss\" diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Myocardial Infarction Justification: Chest pain with associated symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, and emotional stress could relate to ischemia. Although the pain is described as stabbing, MI can present variably, especially in women.  3. Diagnosis: Esophageal Spasm or Perforation Justification: Difficulty swallowing and chest pain with acute onset suggest esophageal pathology. Spasm can cause stabbing, chest discomfort, and may be worsened under stress.  4. Diagnosis: Panic Attack / Anxiety Disorder Justification: Emotional distress influencing symptom perception, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and shortness of breath could be manifestations of a panic attack, especially if cardiac and esophageal causes are ruled out.  5. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Justification: Though less acute, GERD can cause chest discomfort and swallowing issues, especially triggered or worsened by emotional or physical stress.  6. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Sudden-onset chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, and rapid heartbeat are characteristic. Less typical without other risk factors or hemoptysis but remains a critical consideration.  7. Diagnosis: Costochondritis Justification: Chest wall pain that can be sharp and localized, often exacerbated by movement or pressure, though less likely given systemic symptoms and seizure-like features.  8. Diagnosis: Cardiac Anxiety / Somatic Symptom Disorder Justification: Patients with heightened emotional distress might have amplified perception of symptoms, and this diagnosis could coexist with true pathology.  9. Diagnosis: Intracranial or neurological event (e.g., transient ischemic attack) Justification: Dizziness and neurological symptoms are not described explicitly, but if present, could be relevant; less likely without specific neurological deficits.  10. Diagnosis: Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Justification: Older woman with chest pain; however, unless previously known, less likely as an acute presentation compared to dissection but still a relevant differential.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret uses emotionally charged, exaggerated language such as \"terrible,\" \"so bad,\" and \"might be dying,\" indicating high anxiety. She also provides specific details about her symptoms but frames them within a context of fear, which can influence the perception of severity. Her responses are straightforward and detailed, suggesting openness rather than withholding. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering her recent esophageal surgery and symptom history without prompting, demonstrating a tendency to share important details promptly. Her answers are organized and coherent, reflecting a clear understanding and focus on her health issue. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate and emotionally expressive, often emphasizing how severe she feels, which aligns with her anxious personality trait. She tends to express her fears openly, showing a response style driven by distress rather than reticence or minimization.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No evident withholding; she appears eager to convey her symptoms and history, possibly to seek urgent help. - Minimization behaviors: There is little evidence of downplaying symptoms; she emphasizes the severity repeatedly, possibly to ensure her distress is acknowledged. - Amplification patterns: Yes, her language frequently amplifies the severity (\"terrible,\" \"excruciating,\" \"might be dying\"), underscoring her emotional state and concern, which could overstate the actual physical danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No obvious signs; she openly discusses her symptoms and fears. - Confusion/memory issues: Response is consistent and chronological, indicating no significant confusion or memory concerns. - Family influence: No direct evidence that family influences her responses; she appears primarily driven by her internal emotional state.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias due to her high anxiety levels, leading her to perceive and report her symptoms as more severe than they might objectively be. - Severity: Moderate; her distress significantly shapes her narrative, yet she provides detailed, credible symptoms, reducing concerns about false reporting. - Areas most affected: Her perception of symptom severity and emotional response, which may inflate her assessment of danger. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy regarding symptom description, but her emotional state could exaggerate perceived threat levels, warranting reassurance and careful interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Potential understated information might include minor symptoms that she trivializes or avoids mentioning due to anxiety, such as slight discomfort or less alarming sensations. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical danger may be overstated; actual condition might be less immediately life-threatening than her fears suggest, but her emotional exaggeration can lead to overestimation of urgency. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety amplifies her fear of dying, which may not correspond precisely to her actual risk level, requiring subtle reassurance. - True timeline: Likely her symptoms have escalated more rapidly due to anxiety, and her report may emphasize immediacy, though her recent surgery's relevance points to a serious underlying concern.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given the patient's presentation of multiple symptoms with emotional distress, it\u2019s important to further explore each symptom\u2019s characteristics, onset, and impact. She has described chest pain, difficulty swallowing, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and distress, but the details around when these symptoms started, how they have evolved, and what triggers or relieves them are still unclear. Understanding her perspective and concerns will also help clarify her emotional response and its influence on her symptom perception. Since she has a recent esophageal surgery, exploring her history with that procedure and any related symptoms could yield relevant insights. The critical goals are to build rapport, gather detailed symptom descriptions, and assess her understanding and worries about her health.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage comprehensive elaboration. - Information target: Symptom onset, progression, triggers, relieving factors, impact on daily life. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing to foster rapport and trust, especially considering her emotional state. - Expected value: This will help differentiate physical causes from anxiety-related symptoms, clarify the timeline, and guide subsequent focused questioning.\nANSWER: \u201cCan you tell me more about when you first started noticing these symptoms and how they have changed over time? For example, what was happening when the chest pain and other feelings first appeared, and have they been consistent or come and go?\u201d",

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with an acute onset of chest pain characterized by stabbing quality, associated with difficulty swallowing, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and sweating. Initial symptoms described as mild and burning in nature may have been understated; her current severe symptoms are likely genuine but influenced by emotional distress. She reports that early discomfort was less intense but has progressively worsened over time. Additional details regarding prior episodes, earlier subtle symptoms, and associated symptoms such as dizziness or nausea are needed to fully understand the progression and underlying cause.1. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Justification: The patient exhibits chest pain with associated tachycardia, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis, all classic signs of ischemic cardiac events. The acute onset and severity raise concern for myocardial infarction, which is common in this age group.  2. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: The stabbing quality of chest pain, acutely worsening, especially in an older woman, is highly suggestive. The presence of difficulty swallowing could relate to esophageal involvement or secondary to mediastinal extension of dissection.  3. Diagnosis: Esophageal Spasm or Reflux Esophagitis Justification: Difficulty swallowing with chest pain that was initially mild and burning aligns with esophageal causes. Emotional distress may exacerbate esophageal symptoms, though these are less likely to cause severe, worsening pain.  4. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and chest pain are hallmark features of PE, especially if the pain is pleuritic and associated with sudden deterioration.  5. Diagnosis: Pericarditis Justification: Chest pain that worsens with coughing or lying down and associated dyspnea could suggest pericardial inflammation. However, the stabbing quality and associated symptoms favor other diagnoses more.  6. Diagnosis: Pneumothorax Justification: Sudden onset chest pain with shortness of breath; less likely given her age and absence of tracheal deviation or hyperresonance, but remains within differential.  7. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Justification: Burning chest pain and difficulty swallowing could indicate GERD, but the progression to more severe symptoms makes this less likely as the primary cause.  8. Diagnosis: Costochondritis Justification: Chest wall pain can be caused by musculoskeletal inflammation but is unlikely to present with severe, progressive pain and systemic symptoms like sweating.  9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Emotional distress and symptoms of rapid heartbeat and sweating suggest a psychological component; however, the severity and progression point towards more serious physical causes.  10. Diagnosis: Esophageal Cancer Justification: Although possible in older women with swallowing difficulties, the acute onset and rapid progression favor more emergent diagnoses over malignancy, which typically presents more insidiously.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She switches between vague descriptions (\"like a burning\") and emotional exaggerations (\"terrible,\" \"so bad\"). The description of initial symptoms minimizes severity but quickly escalates when describing current distress. - Information flow: Her initial comments suggest guardedness or minimization, with more openness when discussing her history and worsening condition, indicating some selective transparency. - Response style: Brief and emotionally charged responses, with some effort to provide relevant history but possible underreporting of early symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She softens her initial symptom report, perhaps to avoid appearing overly anxious or to cope with fear. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"just a little bit\" and initial downplaying suggest she minimized early symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Her escalation in describing pain and distress reflects anxiety-driven exaggeration, likely influenced by fear of severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit evidence, but her reluctance to initially detail her symptoms might hint at a desire to appear less vulnerable. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent signs; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: None evident in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization combined with anxiety amplification\u2014she minimizes initial symptoms yet fully expresses intense fear as her condition worsens. - Severity: Moderate bias. It influences her perception of the timeline and severity, but her overt reporting of worsening suggests some accuracy in current depiction. - Most affected areas: Early symptom description and timeline detail, potentially leading to underappreciation of initial warning signs. - Reliability: Moderate. While her current report of severe distress is credible, earlier symptoms might have been underreported or downplayed.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Mild or early warning symptoms, such as initial swallowing difficulty or minor discomfort, may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early discomfort, perhaps the initial burning sensation, and the gradual onset could be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of dying and severe distress may be overemphasized, influenced by anxiety. - True timeline: The actual progression likely began with milder symptoms that she minimized, with escalation driven by increasing pain and fear.  In summary, her communication shows a pattern where initial mild symptoms are underreported, possibly to cope with or minimize her distress, while her current state amplifies her perceived severity due to anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The current clinical picture indicates that she experiences escalating episodes of chest pain, initially mild but now severe, accompanied by symptoms that could point to cardiac, esophageal, or other serious causes. - To refine the differential, I need to explore the initial signs and how her symptoms evolved, specifically focusing on early symptoms that might have been unnoticed or underreported. - Understanding her perspective on what she first noticed can help determine if she experienced warning signs earlier that she didn't recognize as significant. - Given her tendency to minimize early symptoms, open-ended questions that gently probe her awareness and any subtle sensations at the start are essential. - The goal is to build rapport and gather detailed timeline information, emphasizing her own description without leading her, to avoid biasing her report.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to encourage detailed, unprompted responses. - Information target: Timeline of initial symptoms, early sensations, any prior episodes, and her perception of changes over time. - Communication approach: Gentle phrasing that validates her experience and avoids making her feel judged or misunderstood, which is important given her guarded responses. - Expected value: This will help uncover any early warning signs or minor symptoms that might alter the diagnostic impression and clarify the progression of her condition.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me about what you first noticed when these symptoms started\u2014what sensations or feelings you had at the very beginning, even if they seemed small or not so bad at first?

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with an acute onset of severe, stabbing chest pain that has progressively worsened from a mild, burning sensation to current intensity. She reports difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and feeling cold. While initially describing her early symptoms as minor, her current presentation indicates genuine severe distress. She may have experienced earlier, milder symptoms that she minimized or did not recognize as significant. No additional information about prior episodes or associated symptoms has been provided, and her communication suggests emotional factors may influence her reporting. The clinical picture warrants urgent assessment for cardiac or esophageal pathology, with acknowledgment that early symptom severity might be underestimated.1. Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (Myocardial Infarction) Justification: The severe, stabbing chest pain radiating or worsening signals a high risk of myocardial infarction. The associated symptoms\u2014shortness of breath, sweating, rapid heartbeat, and feelings of cold\u2014all align with acute ischemic cardiac events. The progression from mild to severe indicates evolving myocardial injury. These features make ACS the top concern.  2. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection Justification: Sudden, severe chest pain described as stabbing/worsening is classic for aortic dissection. The patient\u2019s age and risk factors could increase suspicion. Symptoms like shortness of breath and possibly radiation of pain support this; dissection often causes acute distress and can mimic myocardial infarction but typically involves tearing pain.  3. Diagnosis: Esophageal Perforation (Boerhaave Syndrome) Justification: The recent onset of chest pain with difficulty swallowing, especially if associated with vomiting or increased intra-abdominal pressure, suggests possible esophageal rupture. The progression to severe pain and systemic symptoms (sweating, cold feeling) indicates potential mediastinal contamination \u2014 urgent but less likely than cardiac or vascular causes without additional vomiting history.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Pulmonary Embolism Justification: Rapid onset chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, and feeling cold point toward PE, especially in an older woman with risk factors. However, the nature of the pain as stabbing and the recent symptom evolution make this slightly less probable but still necessary to consider rapidly.  5. Diagnosis: Esophageal Spasm or Severe Reflux Justification: The initial mild burning sensation progressing to severe pain and difficulty swallowing could represent esophageal spasm or severe GERD. Although less immediately life-threatening, the symptoms fit with esophageal pathology, warranting consideration especially given the difficulty swallowing and symptom evolution.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs both vague and emotional language\u2014initially minimizing with \"little uncomfortable feeling,\" but then shifting to more intense descriptors like \"terrible\" and \"unbearable,\" reflecting fluctuating perceptions of severity. - Information flow: She tends to withhold some early details, revealing more after prompted, indicating a pattern of initial minimization and subsequent disclosure once she perceives increasing urgency. - Response style: Responses are generally concise but include some elaboration when describing symptom progression, showing an organized yet emotionally charged communication style.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The initial downplaying (\"didn\u2019t think much of it\") suggests she minimized early symptoms, which could obscure the true timeline and severity. - Minimization behaviors: Her initial description of symptoms as \"kind of\" or \"like\" a discomfort indicates a tendency to trivialize her experiences, potentially delaying urgent care. - Amplification patterns: Her emphasis on how quick and severe the symptoms became (\"then suddenly,\" \"so much worse\") may indicate heightened anxiety or an attempt to convey the seriousness more forcefully, but could also reflect genuine rapid deterioration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs; her distress appears rooted in fear rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident inconsistency; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: Not explicitly indicated, though living alone might lead her to be more cautious or cautious about her symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias\u2014she underreports early symptoms and perceived severity, likely due to anxiety or desire to handle things herself. - Severity: Moderate\u2014early signs are understated, which could impact assessment but the narrative overall aligns with a genuine severe onset. - Areas most affected: The early symptom description; accurate early assessment may be compromised. - Reliability: Moderate; her current high distress likely reflects actual severity, but initial self-reporting of symptoms may be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details of mild or initial symptoms\u2014her early discomfort may have been more significant than she admits, affecting timely diagnosis. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early warning signs, which could have predicted worsening, might have been underreported. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current panicked description may be somewhat exaggerated by anxiety, possibly leading to overestimation of urgency if taken at face value. - True timeline: The progression might have been more gradual initially, with her emphasis on rapid worsening possibly being influenced by anxiety and fear.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Clinical reasoning indicates that understanding her early symptoms is crucial, especially regarding the initial sensations and whether she experienced any mild discomfort that she now minimized. - Given the severity of her current presentation, clarifying whether she had prior similar episodes or warning signs could help differentiate cardiac or vascular causes from other etiologies. - Knowing if she had prior episodes of chest discomfort, even mild ones, will inform the likelihood of chronic or recurrent conditions and influence urgency assessment. - Her communication pattern suggests initial minimization; thus, a targeted question about subtle or brief discomforts in the past, even if she thought them insignificant, is important. - Also, exploring associated symptoms like episodes of indigestion, reflux, or prior episodes of swallowing difficulty can help distinguish between cardiac, esophageal, or other origins.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Question type: Focused, targeted question to uncover past symptoms with specific prompting. - Information target: Prior brief or mild chest discomfort, early warning signs, episodes of reflux or dysphagia. - Communication approach: Framing sensitively to encourage her to recall even minor or forgotten episodes, emphasizing that even small sensations are important. - Expected value: Clarifies whether her symptoms are truly new or part of a pattern, guiding differential prioritization.\nANSWER: \"Have you ever experienced any similar feelings of chest discomfort, even if they were just mild or brief, in the days or weeks before this episode?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Infectious conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Rapid onset after physical activity, redness, tearing, and swelling are characteristic of conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis is common and often associated with recent activity or exposure, whereas bacterial can also cause acute conjunctivitis with similar symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Trauma-related conjunctival injury Justification: Playing soccer predisposes to direct eye trauma, which can cause conjunctival swelling, redness, tearing, or subconjunctival hemorrhage. The timing suggests recent injury, though no trauma is explicitly reported.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden onset of eye redness following activity could be due to small vessel rupture leading to conjunctival bleeding. Swelling is less typical but can coexist with hemorrhage, especially if trauma occurred.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Common cause of redness and tearing, though typically has a longer history and bilateral symptoms; recent onset is less typical but cannot be excluded solely based on presentation.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis or other eyelid inflammatory conditions Justification: Swelling and redness can be due to eyelid inflammation, especially post-activity, though less likely given the predominant conjunctival symptoms and rapid onset after exercise.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may if present underreported any prior symptoms she perceived as minor or normal, possibly minimizing their significance. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her earlier reflux or mild swallowing difficulty might be underrepresented; she emphasizes the suddenness and severity, perhaps to justify her current fear. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of dying and urgency are likely exaggerated by her anxiety, which may focus her perception on worst-case scenarios. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent but possibly accentuated emotionally; she perceives the worsening as abrupt and severe, which aligns with her panic-driven presentation.  Overall, her communication shows emotional amplification bias strongly influenced by anxiety, making her current symptom report more dramatic than her baseline state, though she genuinely experiences distress.",

    "input": "A 62-year-old woman presents with severe, stabbing chest pain and dysphagia that developed insidiously over several days to weeks. She reports initial mild discomfort, such as reflux-like sensations, which she minimized, but these may have preceded her current symptoms. Currently, she experiences significant pain, inability to swallow liquids, shortness of breath, and autonomic symptoms such as chills and sweating. She denies recent trauma or eye/face injury. Her communication pattern suggests that early, less severe symptoms were likely understated, while her current presentation is genuine but possibly magnified by distress. The progression appears gradual rather than sudden, indicating the importance of investigating underlying causes that evolved over time.Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs both vague/minimizing language (\"like a little uncomfortable feeling\") early on and emotional, intense descriptors (\"terrible,\" \"unbearable\") as symptoms worsen. This pattern suggests initial underreporting followed by heightened distress expression. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming about her recent medical history but withhold details about early or minor symptoms until they become severe, indicating selective disclosure likely influenced by discomfort or fear. - Response style: Responses are generally direct but tend to downplay initial experiences. She elaborates more when describing current or severe symptoms, reflecting emotional distress and possibly a coping mechanism to avoid anxiety about minor symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Downplaying initial discomfort (\"didn't think much of it,\" \"not that bad\") suggests she minimizes early symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: The use of \"like a little uncomfortable feeling\" signals intentional or automatic minimization to reduce perceived seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Her description of current pain with powerful words indicates a tendency to emphasize severity once symptoms intensify. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses show coherence; no evident confusion or inconsistency. - Family influence: No clear evidence; responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Downplaying/Misperception bias\u2014initial symptom minimization could lead to underestimation of early disease progression. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she underreports prior minor symptoms but eventually stresses the severity, indicating moderate bias affecting early history. - Areas most affected: Early symptom description and timeline\u2014possible underreporting of subtle, less severe symptoms. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014current presentation is accurate, but early history may be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Early or minor symptoms, such as mild reflux or insignificant discomfort, are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial discomfort and reflux episodes may have seemed trivial from her perspective but could have been warning signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear and emotional state cause her to emphasize the current severity, possibly overestimating the immediacy of danger. - True timeline: Likely insidious onset with gradual worsening, but her perception frames it as sudden escalation.  **Overall**, her communication reveals a tendency to initially minimize symptoms, which could mask early warning signs. Her current intense descriptions suggest genuine distress, but the early history needs cautious interpretation to understand true symptom progression.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need to confirm whether the early, mild symptoms such as reflux or minor discomfort were actually present, as she tends to minimize or underreport these. Clarification of the timeline and severity of initial symptoms is essential to distinguish between a gradual insidious process like esophageal rupture versus other possibilities. - Diagnostic priorities: To solidify the diagnosis of esophageal rupture (Boerhaave), we must establish whether her symptoms fit the classic features (severe chest pain, vomiting, subcutaneous emphysema) and rule out other causes like cardiac, pulmonary, or gastrointestinal etiologies. - Patient factors: Her tendency to minimize early symptoms suggests I should phrase questions carefully\u2014encouraging elaboration without making her feel judged or defensive, perhaps using a gentle, collaborative tone. - Interview phase goals: Final clarification of the symptom timeline, characteristics, and her understanding while gently probing for any overlooked details or red flags that could alter management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions about early symptoms, timeline details, and any associated sensations or events. - Information target: Onset, nature, progression, and severity of initial reflux-like sensations, any minor discomfort, and whether she noticed anything unusual at that time. - Communication approach: Phrased softly to avoid eliciting defensiveness, framing as seeking to understand her experience comprehensively. - Expected value: Clarifies whether her insidious progression aligns with her current severe presentation, helping confirm or refute the diagnosis and ensuring we haven't missed subtle early warning signs.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like your symptoms started quite mild and you didn't think much of them at first. Could you tell me more about what those first sensations were like\u2014did you notice any reflux, minor discomfort, or sensations in your chest or throat\u2014maybe even before the pain really became severe? And how long did those early feelings last before things worsened?\"",
