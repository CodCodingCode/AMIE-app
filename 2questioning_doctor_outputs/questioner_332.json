    "input": "The patient is an adult individual presenting with complaints of light-headedness and abnormal sensations related to the heart. They express concern about the possibility of passing out but communicate in a cautious manner that suggests their symptoms and severity may be understated. Objective clinical features are consistent with potential dysautonomia, arrhythmias, or cardiovascular issues, though most details are not fully disclosed. Further assessment with detailed history-taking is needed to elucidate symptom frequency, accompanying signs, and the impact on daily life.1. Diagnosis: Vasovagal syncope Justification: Common cause of light-headedness and fainting episodes; often triggered by stress or standing, with symptoms like abnormal sensations common during prodrome.  2. Diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension Justification: Light-headedness and abnormal sensations on standing; common in autonomic dysfunction and secondary to medications, dehydration, or volume depletion.  3. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular block, supraventricular tachycardia) Justification: Heart-related sensations and concern about passing out point towards electrical disturbances; arrhythmias are a critical cause of syncope.  4. Diagnosis: Autonomic dysfunction/dysautonomia Justification: Symptoms suggest dysregulation of autonomic nervous system; supports the mention of dysautonomia as a possible underlying pathology.  5. Diagnosis: Structural heart disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy, valve disease) Justification: Can cause abnormal sensations and risk of syncope; although less specific without further testing, structural causes remain important to consider.  6. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic disorder Justification: Symptoms can include light-headedness, abnormal sensations, and heightened concern; frequently under-recognized but common.  7. Diagnosis: Medication side effects Justification: If the patient is on medications affecting blood pressure or heart rhythm, symptoms might be drug-related; needs review of medication history.  8. Diagnosis: Neurological causes (e.g., transient ischemic attack, seizure) Justification: Less likely based on description but must be considered due to abnormal sensations and risk of passing out; typically with additional neurological signs.  9. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia Justification: Can cause light-headedness and abnormal sensations; although less likely without other symptoms, it's a possible contributing factor.  10. Diagnosis: Psychiatric etiology (e.g., somatic symptom disorder) Justification: Symptoms may be underreported or understated; psychological factors can contribute to perception of symptoms, but less immediate threat unless associated with other findings.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, mild descriptors like \"a bit off\" and \"pretty light-headed,\" indicating minimization; emotional concern is present but expressed cautiously. - Information flow: Tends to be reserved, relying on brief, cautious responses, and waiting for prompts; overall organized but with some hesitance. - Response style: Predominantly minimal and direct; avoids detailed elaboration unless prompted, likely to avoid overreacting or revealing perceived seriousness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of non-specific phrases and hedging language suggests possible reluctance to fully disclose symptom severity. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with words like \"a bit\" and \"not that bad\" despite experiencing significant symptoms, indicating a tendency to understate issues. - Amplification patterns: While expressed concern about fainting, the actual ongoing severity may be worse than described, suggesting emotional amplification of fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but hesitance in fully detailing the impact could reflect discomfort with perceived seriousness. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: No clear evidence in the responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization and delayed acknowledgement of severity, combined with some anxiety-driven emotional amplification. - Severity: Moderate; the patient\u2019s downplaying may hinder early detection of critical issues. - Areas most affected: Severity, frequency, and impact of dizziness and irregular heart rhythms. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are somewhat guarded, requiring careful clarification to properly assess actual symptom burden.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: True extent and frequency of dizziness and arrhythmic episodes; patient may not be fully reporting episodes of fainting or severe discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of cardiac irregularities and dizziness, which could be more intense or frequent. - Concerns probably amplified: The emotional worry about passing out reflects genuine anxiety, which may influence perception. - True timeline: Symptoms may have been worsening more rapidly or severely than patient indicates, but he minimizes current reports possibly due to emotional coping or pride.  In summary, the patient exhibits moderate minimization bias, downplaying symptoms but also showing genuine concern. This suggests the clinician should explore symptom details carefully, corroborate with objective data, and address any emotional barriers to full disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration stage, it\u2019s important to gently encourage the patient to elaborate on their symptoms, especially considering they tend to minimize or understate their experiences. I want to explore their subjective experience more thoroughly, including the context of episodes, associated sensations, and impact, while being sensitive to possible emotional reluctance. Since they have concern about passing out, understanding how often and under what circumstances they notice these symptoms will help fill current information gaps. This question should also help set a collaborative tone, showing genuine interest and compassion to foster trust.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Details about the frequency, context, and severity of dizziness or abnormal sensations, and how these symptoms affect their daily life. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify episodes of light-headedness, potential triggers, and associated symptoms to differentiate between cardiovascular, neurological, or psychological causes. - Patient factors: The patient is reserved and minimizes symptoms; questions need to be open, nonjudgmental, and encourage elaboration without pressure. - Interview phase goals: Build rapport, gather rich descriptive data, and understand the patient\u2019s own perspective on their symptoms.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, non-leading to allow free narration. - Information target: Symptom characteristics\u2014timing, triggers, associated sensations, severity, and impact. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, gentle prompts that validate their experience and encourage detailed responses. - Expected value: Will help clarify symptom details that are currently understated, informing differential diagnosis and building trust.\nANSWER: \u201cCan you tell me more about what you\u2019ve been experiencing when you feel light-headed or the strange sensations you mentioned? For instance, how often do these happen, and is there anything that seems to bring them on or make them worse?\u201d",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with episodes of light-headedness, dizziness, and irregular heart sensations occurring multiple times daily, often triggered by rapid changes in posture. While the patient expresses concern about passing out, responses suggest that symptoms may be more frequent and severe than reported, potentially including episodes of syncope, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath that have not been fully disclosed. The overall pattern appears to be worsening, but detailed information regarding episode duration, severity, and associated features remains incomplete due to guarded communication. Further detailed history and targeted testing are advised to accurately assess the severity, underlying etiology, and necessary management plan.1. Diagnosis: Vasovagal Syncope Justification: Symptoms triggered by postural changes and episodes of light-headedness are characteristic; common in adults, often precipitated by stress or environmental factors, making this the most likely initial diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension Justification: Symptoms triggered by rapid postural changes suggest orthostatic blood pressure drops, common in adults, especially with volume depletion or autonomic dysfunction.  3. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia (e.g., Atrial or Ventricular Arrhythmias) Justification: Irregular heart sensations and episodes of dizziness could result from arrhythmias, which are critical to identify due to risk of syncope or sudden cardiac death.  4. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease) Justification: If episodes involve more severe symptoms such as chest discomfort, structural issues may cause arrhythmias or decreased cardiac output, especially in adults.  5. Diagnosis: Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Justification: Characterized by tachycardia and symptoms with postural changes, more common among younger adults but still plausible amidst frequent symptoms triggered by posture.  6. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: Can cause dizziness and irregular heart sensations; less likely as primary diagnosis given physical trigger factors, but should be considered as secondary.  7. Diagnosis: Medication side effects or substance use Justification: Certain drugs or substances can cause dizziness or arrhythmias; relevance depends on medication history, not specified here.  8. Diagnosis: Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Justification: Exaggerated response to carotid sinus stimulation during positional changes may cause syncope, mostly in older adults.  9. Diagnosis: Neurological causes (e.g., seizures, transient ischemic attack) Justification: Less likely given the pattern, but possible if episodes include neurological deficits; no specific signs described.  10. Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Justification: Less likely without typical anginal symptoms; if episodes of chest discomfort occur, should be considered nonetheless, especially in risk populations.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses somewhat vague terms (\"a few times a day,\" \"I don\u2019t really know\") indicating possible minimization or reluctance to provide detailed, alarming descriptions. Words like \"sort of\" suggest hesitance or uncertainty. - Information flow: The patient responds directly when asked but tends to keep details general, possibly to avoid exaggerating or alarming. They volunteer baseline information but with guarded language, indicating moderate openness. - Response style: Responses are short and somewhat cautious, not deeply elaborated, reflecting modest elaboration and a tendency to minimize perceived severity. BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Phrases like \"I don\u2019t really know\" about causes, limited detail on symptom severity, and vague frequency indicate some withholding or reluctance to fully disclose, possibly to avoid appearing overreactive. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying severity (\"a few times a day\", \"not really bad\"), framing episodes as minor or manageable, suggest an attempt to minimize concern. - Amplification patterns: There is minimal amplification; the patient appears careful not to overstate symptoms but may be minimizing rather than exaggerating. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but subtle hesitations imply either discomfort sharing fears or an attempt to maintain resilience. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight vagueness about timing and frequency (\"maybe a few times a day,\" \"I don\u2019t really know what causes it\") could suggest some uncertainty but not significant memory issues. - Family influence: No clear evidence of external influence affecting responses, patient appears primarily driven by personal concern. BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization is most evident, as the patient appears to understate the severity and frequency of symptoms to avoid causing alarm or appearing overly anxious. - Severity: Moderate, because responses are consistent but guarded and cautious, indicating some degree of underreporting. - Areas most affected: Severity of dizziness and irregular heartbeats, which are likely more intense or frequent than reported. The patient also may be overly cautious about alarming the provider. - Reliability: Moderate; their self-report is likely to underestimate severity, so clinical assessment should consider this tendency and corroborate with objective data. CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency and severity of dizziness and arrhythmias, as the patient minimizes how often or intense these episodes are. - Symptoms probably minimized: Dizziness, irregular heartbeats, and chest tightness may be more severe or persistent than conveyed, which could influence prioritization and urgency. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s anxiety about passing out or serious heart issues are genuine but may be more pressing than they admit, warranting cautious assessment. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but the noted increase in episodes suggests a worsening that the patient might understate, emphasizing the importance of objective monitoring.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a history of frequent episodes of light-headedness and dizziness, often triggered by rapid postural changes. The patient reports that these episodes may be more frequent and potentially more severe than initially described, with concerns about fainting. Symptoms include sensations of heart racing or skipping beats, but the patient does not provide detailed information on loss of consciousness, injuries, or other associated symptoms, suggesting possible minimization or withholding of information. The pattern of communication indicates a cautious reporting style, which may underestimate the true severity of episodes. Further targeted inquiry is necessary to clarify the presence of syncope, injuries, associated cardiovascular symptoms, and the overall impact on the patient's health.1. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension Justification: Symptoms of dizziness upon standing and triggers related to rapid postural change strongly suggest orthostatic hypotension. This condition results from impaired autonomic regulation of blood pressure, leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion when changing posture. The reported dizziness and light-headedness, especially with rapid movements, fit this pattern. The sensations of heart racing may be compensatory responses to hypotension or related autonomic disturbance. The absence of detailed syncope or injury does not exclude orthostatic hypotension as a common cause of such episodes.  2. Diagnosis: Vasovagal Syncope Justification: Symptoms triggered by rapid postural changes and the patient's cautious communication may reflect vasovagal responses. Vasovagal syncope involves an exaggerated autonomic reflex causing vasodilation and bradycardia, leading to transient loss of consciousness. The episodes' frequency and potential severity suggest this possibility, especially without clear evidence of structural heart disease. The sensation of heart racing aligns with prodromal tachycardia often seen before vasovagal episodes.  3. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia Justification: The patient's reports of heart racing or skipping beats raise suspicion for arrhythmias such as atrial or ventricular ectopy, which can precipitate dizziness or syncope. Though no loss of consciousness is definitively noted, palpitations combined with dizziness warrant consideration of arrhythmogenic causes. These are critical to identify due to potential risk of sudden cardiac events, especially if episodes are frequent or severe.  4. Diagnosis: Autonomic Dysfunction (including Dysautonomia) Justification: The pattern of postural symptoms and the patient's cautious reporting could reflect underlying autonomic nervous system impairment affecting blood pressure regulation and heart rate control. Dysautonomia encompasses various disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy) that impair cardiovascular autonomic responses, manifesting as dizziness, light-headedness, and palpitations.  5. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Psychogenic Dizziness Justification: While less likely the primary cause, the patient's cautious communication and potential underreporting might suggest psychological influences such as anxiety contributing to subjective dizziness. However, given the physical triggers and sensations of heart irregularity, this diagnosis is lower in probability but still worth consideration.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and mild descriptors (\"kinda light,\" \"not really bad\") which suggest an attempt to downplay symptoms. Their tone indicates a preference for minimizing perceived severity. - Information flow: Responses are organized but somewhat selective; they volunteer basic information but withhold details about impact, triggers, or detailed history unless specifically asked. - Response style: They avoid elaborating on the worst aspects, tending towards minimalism, possibly to reduce concern or avoid appearing overly worried.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient's reluctance to specify frequency, duration, or severity indicates an attempt to withhold true extent of symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Phrases like \"not that bad\" and \"handling it\" show an effort to minimize their condition. - Amplification patterns: Slight exaggerations like \"might fall over\" or \"really dizzy,\" though not extreme, hint at underlying anxiety about health. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but their cautious language and vagueness imply some discomfort in fully disclosing the severity. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence here. - Family influence: No indications; responses seem self-focused.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization, because they understate the severity and impact of symptoms despite confirming episodes are more frequent and concerning. - Severity: Moderate, as they openly describe symptoms but downplay their significance. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity and urgency, possibly impacting the clinical assessment. - Reliability: Moderate; the frequency and descriptions are accurate but the seriousness is likely understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of symptom severity, possible impact on daily life, and underlying risk factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity of episodes and the potential danger of irregular heart rhythms. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's fear of passing out or having a heart attack may be present but not fully acknowledged or articulated. - True timeline: Symptoms are increasing in frequency, but patients may have experienced more severe episodes earlier that they have minimized or not recognized as problematic.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a history of frequent episodes of light-headedness and dizziness, often triggered by rapid postural changes. Although the patient reports that these episodes occur a few times daily, sometimes more, and are associated with sensations of heart racing or skipping beats and brief dizziness, there is no confirmed history of loss of consciousness or falls during these episodes. The patient describes episodes lasting a few seconds and reports a recent increase in frequency and perceived severity. They acknowledge occasional chest tightness but do not report associated symptoms such as chest pain, sweating, vision changes, or injuries, although these could be underreported due to their cautious communication style. The clinical picture suggests possible autonomic or cardiac etiologies; however, the true severity and risk level might be higher than indicated. Further targeted assessment is needed to evaluate for syncope, injury history, and related cardiovascular symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia (e.g., supraventricular tachycardia, PACs/PVCs) Justification: The patient's sensations of heart racing or skipping beats, brief episodes lasting a few seconds, and increased frequency suggest an underlying rhythm disturbance. These symptoms are classic for arrhythmias, especially given their triggers and transient nature. The concern for episodes of palpitations with possible hemodynamic effects makes arrhythmia the most probable explanation.  2. Diagnosis: Vasovagal Syncope Justification: The episodes are triggered by rapid postural changes and involve dizziness, which are typical features of vasovagal episodes. Although no loss of consciousness has been reported, the light-headedness and bradycardic sensations align with a vasovagal response, especially given the positional triggers.  3. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension Justification: The episodes are precipitated by quick postural changes, consistent with orthostatic hypotension. The brief dizziness upon standing, especially with increased frequency, supports this diagnosis, although no explicit orthostatic blood pressure measurements are provided.  4. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attacks Justification: The sensations of heart racing and dizziness could be associated with anxiety, especially if episodes are associated with stress or hypervigilance. However, the positional triggers and symptom description lean more toward autonomic or cardiac causes, making anxiety less likely but still possible.  5. Diagnosis: Neurogenic Syncope (e.g., obstructive or autonomic failure) Justification: Less likely but considered due to the autonomic features and episodes triggered by postural change. Symptoms are brief, and there's no mention of other neurogenic signs, placing this lower in likelihood.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Repeatedly minimizing the severity and frequency, such as describing episodes as \"a few seconds\" or \"not that bad,\" and stating \"I don't always know what causes it,\" suggest intentional or unintentional withholding. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying symptoms with phrases like \"kind of,\" \"a little,\" and \"not super painful,\" demonstrating an effort to reduce perceived seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Despite minimization, the patient exhibits anxiety-influenced language (\"worried I might fall,\" \"really dizzy\"), indicating genuine concern, possibly magnified by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt embarrassment; the patient appears somewhat reserved but open enough. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion\u2014responses are consistent. - Family influence: Mention of family checking in may influence a desire to appear stable, potentially leading to underreporting.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization, driven by anxiety or a wish to avoid alarming the clinician, leading to underreporting of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014significant symptoms may be underdisclosed, which could influence clinical assessment. - Most affected areas: Descriptions of dizziness, episodes' duration, and potential risks are most biased, compromising symptom accuracy. - Reliability: Their self-reporting should be approached with caution; corroborative data (e.g., telemetry or observational info) is necessary for accurate evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing info: The patient probably is not fully revealing the frequency, duration, or severity of episodes, particularly any moments of potential syncope or loss of consciousness. - Minimization: Symptoms related to true severity\u2014like actual episodes of passing out\u2014may be underappreciated. - Amplification: Their expressed fears may be emotionally amplified; actual risk might be higher but responses are tempered. - Timeline: Symptoms appear to be worsening over a week, but the patient\u2019s tendency to minimize suggests their presentation is somewhat conservative; actual progression and potential dangers are likely more serious than reported.",

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is minimization, driven by anxiety or a wish to avoid alarming the clinician, leading to underreporting of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate bias\u2014significant symptoms may be underdisclosed, which could influence clinical assessment. - Most affected areas: Descriptions of dizziness, episodes' duration, and potential risks are most biased, compromising symptom accuracy. - Reliability: Their self-reporting should be approached with caution; corroborative data (e.g., telemetry or observational info) is necessary for accurate evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Missing info: The patient probably is not fully revealing the frequency, duration, or severity of episodes, particularly any moments of potential syncope or loss of consciousness. - Minimization: Symptoms related to true severity\u2014like actual episodes of passing out\u2014may be underappreciated. - Amplification: Their expressed fears may be emotionally amplified; actual risk might be higher but responses are tempered. - Timeline: Symptoms appear to be worsening over a week, but the patient\u2019s tendency to minimize suggests their presentation is somewhat conservative; actual progression and potential dangers are likely more serious than reported.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with frequent episodes of dizziness and light-headedness occurring multiple times daily, often triggered by quick postural changes. The patient reports sensations of heart racing or skipping beats during these episodes but denies experiencing loss of consciousness, falls, or injuries. Occasional chest tightness is noted, though they do not report associated chest pain, sweating, or vision changes. Given the patient's cautious communication style and tendency to minimize, the true frequency and severity of the episodes may be underestimated; underlying arrhythmia or autonomic dysfunction could be more significant than indicated. Further assessment is needed to clarify the presence of syncope, injury risk, and associated cardiovascular symptoms.Benign Cardiac Arrhythmia / Autonomic Dysregulation ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague and minimizing language (\"just feel kinda,\" \"not that bad\") to downplay symptoms. Uses clinical descriptors carefully but avoids emotional detail. - Information flow: Reluctant to volunteer full details, responds minimally unless directly questioned, leading to an organized but guarded information exchange. - Response style: Tends to be concise, answering straightforward questions but sidestepping potential complexities or concerns, possibly to maintain control or avoid stress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Repeated downplaying and refusal to confirm more concerning episodes (like fainting or injury) suggest intentional withholding of severity information. - Minimization behaviors: Describing symptoms as \"not that bad\" or \"just the irregular beats\" minimizes potential danger, possibly to avoid worry or reduce perceived threat. - Amplification patterns: No clear exaggeration of symptoms, but minor overemphasis on tolerating symptoms or self-managing suggests a bias toward normalizing issues. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but guarded responses imply some discomfort discussing severity, potentially to avoid appearing vulnerable. - Confusion/memory issues: No indication of confusion; responses appear consistent. - Family influence: No direct evidence, though referring to \"not wanting to make a fuss\" hints at a desire to avoid concern from family or others.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias is dominant, as the patient underreports the severity of episodes and avoids discussing potential serious complications. - Severity: Moderate\u2014he answers questions but deliberately underplays symptom seriousness. - Areas most affected: The actual severity of episodes, risk of adverse events, and potential for serious outcomes are likely underestimated. - Reliability: Partial; responses are likely skewed toward underestimating danger, so clinical judgment should consider possibility of underreporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about episodes involving loss of consciousness, injuries, or associated symptoms like sweating or vision changes are probably not disclosed fully. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity of arrhythmic episodes, including potential episodes of syncope or dangerous pauses, is likely worse than reported. - Concerns probably amplified: Minor worries may be exaggerated; the patient might experience more hazardous episodes than conveyed. - True timeline: The actual progression might be more rapid or severe, given the underreporting, making the current condition potentially more urgent than patient admits.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The key information remaining includes whether the patient has experienced actual fainting, falls, or injuries during episodes, which would confirm aspects of syncope and assess safety risks. - The patient\u2019s tendency to minimize symptoms and avoid discussing more severe episodes suggests we need to directly and sensitively explore the possibility of loss of consciousness and injuries without causing alarm. - From a diagnostic perspective, confirming or ruling out true syncope or injury is critical for distinguishing between benign episodes and more serious arrhythmic or autonomic causes. - Since the patient is cautious and somewhat guarded, framing questions to normalize the conversation while gently probing these critical points is important. - The goal is to finalize understanding of the episodes\u2019 severity and potential risks, and assess their physical impact to guide management planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and confirmatory, targeting potential episodes of syncope, injury, or severe autonomic symptoms. - Information target: Occurrence of fainting, falls, injuries, associated symptoms during episodes. - Communication approach: Use a non-judgmental, validating tone to encourage honest disclosure, emphasizing that detailed information helps ensure safety. - Expected value: Will clarify if episodes have resulted in harm, important for risk stratification and treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, I want to make sure I fully understand whether any of your episodes have caused you to lose consciousness or fall to the ground, or if you've hurt yourself during these times. Have you ever fainted completely, or passed out and fallen? And during any racing heart sensations, have you noticed any chest pain, vision changes, or excessive sweating? Also, have you had any injuries or bumps from falling during these episodes that you're aware of?\"",
