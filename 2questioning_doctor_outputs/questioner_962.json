    "input": "The patient is a woman presenting with concerns of anxiety, shakiness, and fluctuating blood pressure, symptoms likely related to moderate anxiety. She reports feeling anxious and shaky, with worries about a serious illness, but has not detailed other physical symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, or sleep disturbances, which may be underreported. Corrected assessment suggests her symptoms are consistent with anxiety, although physical manifestations could be more significant than her description indicates. Further examination and data collection are necessary to evaluate physical signs and underlying causes.1. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's primary presentation includes anxiety and shakiness without more specific physical symptoms, fitting the common clinical profile of an anxiety disorder, which is highly prevalent.  2. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (e.g., Hyperthyroidism) Justification: Symptoms of anxiety, shakiness, and blood pressure fluctuations can be manifestations of hyperthyroidism; common endocrine cause that requires consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Hypertensive Fluctuations related to Anxiety Justification: Blood pressure variability may be secondary to anxiety-induced sympathetic activation, making it a plausible explanation, especially in the absence of other signs of endocrine disease.  4. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma Justification: Fluctuating blood pressure and shakiness could result from catecholamine excess; although less common, it\u2019s a critical diagnosis to exclude due to its severity and treatability.  5. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: Sudden episodes of anxiety with physical symptoms like shakiness are typical of panic attacks, which may be recurrent and are common.  6. Diagnosis: Substance-induced Anxiety (e.g., caffeine, stimulants) Justification: Stimulant use can cause anxiety, shakiness, and blood pressure fluctuations; relevant if patient has recent substance use history.  7. Diagnosis: Cardiovascular Causes (e.g., arrhythmias) Justification: Fluctuating blood pressure and shakiness can be symptoms of arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions; though less likely without cardiac symptoms, they should be considered.  8. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumors other than Pheochromocytoma Justification: Rare but possible causes of catecholamine excess presenting with blood pressure variability and anxiety.  9. Diagnosis: Menopause or hormonal fluctuations Justification: If applicable, hormonal changes could contribute to blood pressure and anxiety symptoms, although less directly linked.  10. Diagnosis: Neurovascular Disorders (e.g., transient ischemic attacks) Justification: Less likely but should be considered if neurological symptoms occur, especially with fluctuating blood pressure, to rule out serious cerebrovascular causes.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged but generally descriptive language, connecting her symptoms to fears of serious illness without overly technical jargon. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with primary symptoms and concerns, but her emotional state encourages her to emphasize fears, possibly leading to overstatement. - Response style: She provides straightforward information but intermixes it with anxiety-driven worry, which can color her perception of symptom severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No overt withholding; she appears fully engaged and eager to discuss symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; she actively voices her distress. - Amplification patterns: Her concern about the possibility of a tumor or adrenal problems indicates a tendency to magnify health fears. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of shame; she seems open yet visibly anxious. - Confusion/memory issues: Consistent recall; no clear evidence of confusion regarding symptom timeline. - Family influence: Not apparent in this excerpt.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven health threat amplification, characterized by heightened worry about the severity and implications of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional distress influences her perception significantly but does not distort factual recounting outright. - Areas most affected: Perceived danger of her symptoms and the urgency attributed to her health concerns. - Reliability: Generally reliable in reporting symptoms but with a bias toward emphasizing danger, so clinical interpretation should consider this bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Additional details about sleep disturbances, subtle physical signs, or behaviors not consciously recognized (e.g., subtle tremors, sweating patterns) might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical symptoms like tremors or sweating may be more persistent or severe than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of having a tumor or adrenal condition are likely overestimated, fueled by anxiety and health fears. - True timeline: The reported progression seems plausible but may be perceived as more rapid or severe due to heightened emotional focus, which can distort the actual course of symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration phase, I want to deepen understanding of her experience, particularly how she perceives her symptoms and their impact on her life. Since she's expressed concern about serious illnesses, it's important to gently explore those worries and gather more detail about her physical sensations, emotional context, and any associated behaviors. I should focus on open-ended questions that encourage her to elaborate and provide a fuller picture, especially regarding aspects she hasn't yet described, such as sleep, physical signs, or triggers. Building rapport and trust is key, so my tone should be empathetic and validating. This will help clarify her fears and the characteristics of her symptoms, which are crucial for narrowing the differential diagnosis and understanding her perspective.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise nature, timing, and triggers of her physical symptoms; associated physical signs; emotional states; impact on daily routine; specific fears (e.g., tumors, adrenal issues). - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify physical symptoms (e.g., sweating, palpitations), assess for other signs of medical conditions (hyperthyroidism, endocrine tumors), and understand emotional context. - Patient factors: She appears emotionally expressive and anxious, so questions should be supportive, non-judgmental, and open-ended to avoid heightening distress. - Interview phase goals: Gather detailed, nuanced information about her subjective experience, fears, potential physical signs, and coping strategies, while establishing a comfortable environment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, encouraging elaboration on her physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings. - Information target: Nature, onset, frequency, and impact of symptoms; her worries; her interpretation of physical sensations; behaviors related to her symptoms. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing that invites storytelling, avoiding medical jargon, and validating her experience. - Expected value: Will provide rich, contextual data for assessing the significance of her symptoms, identifying red flags, and understanding her health beliefs.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about what you've noticed when you experience these shakiness and anxiety. For example, are there particular times of day or situations when they tend to happen? How do these sensations feel to you, and how do they affect your daily activities or routines?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Acute Conjunctivitis (likely viral or allergic) Justification: Redness and tearing are classic conjunctivitis symptoms; recent outdoor activity may suggest viral exposure, especially if highly contagious or allergen exposure from outdoor allergens.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal Foreign Body or Corneal Abrasion Justification: Recent playing soccer could cause trauma, leading to abrasion or foreign body, presenting with redness, pain, tearing, and swelling.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Justification: Trauma or increased intraocular pressure from activity can cause blood to break through conjunctival vessels, causing localized redness and swelling.  4. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Presents with redness and mild swelling, typically painless or mildly discomforting, and can be triggered by physical activity or environmental factors.  5. Diagnosis: Preseptal (Periorbital) Cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness localized to eyelid, especially if trauma or abrasion is present, with potential for secondary infection.  6. Diagnosis: Infectious Keratitis Justification: Post-trauma or contaminated environment exposure during outdoor activity raises suspicion of corneal infection, which can cause swelling and redness.  7. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Common, presents with tearing and redness; however, less likely without other allergy symptoms or bilateral involvement.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less common in this context but can present with redness and tearing; usually associated with pain, photophobia, and decreased vision, which are not described here.  9. Diagnosis: Eyelid Trauma or Hematoma Justification: Trauma during sports can cause eyelid swelling and redness due to direct injury or bleeding.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Less likely, but severe swelling with redness, potentially with pain, proptosis, and systemic signs; unlikely given the short duration and lack of systemic symptoms.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, non-specific descriptors like \"kind of,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"mainly during the day,\" which may mask the true extent of her symptoms. She employs emotional language (\"super nervous,\" \"really sweaty\") that underscores distress but can also amplify concern. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming initially but shows hesitations and mild reluctance when detailing specific times, triggers, or severity, indicating possible withholding. Her responses tend to be organized but contain subtle vagueness. - Response style: She provides elaborate descriptions but tends to qualify or downplay symptoms, probably to avoid sounding overly alarmist or embarrassing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her vague responses about symptom intensity, frequency, and triggers suggest she may be not fully disclosing the severity of her experiences. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her symptoms as \"mainly\" during the day and uses \"kind of\" to lessen perceived severity, possibly to appear more normal or less worried. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes how her symptoms impact her daily function (\"hard to focus\") and her distress, which could reflect her genuine level of concern but may also serve to amplify her perceived severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous gestures like face rubbing, finger tapping, and hesitations point toward discomfort discussing her symptoms, possibly feeling embarrassed about their nature. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of factual inconsistency. - Family influence: No apparent influence; responses seem self-contained.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate information withholding combined with symptom minimization, influenced by emotional discomfort and the desire to avoid seeming overly anxious. - Severity: Moderate; her hesitations and vague descriptors could lead to underestimating her condition's seriousness. - Most biased areas: Severity, trigger specifics, and frequency of symptoms. - Reliability: Fair; overall coherence supports trustworthiness, but some underreporting likely occurs.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She is probably not fully revealing the intensity or frequency of her tremors, sweating, and anxiety episodes, possibly due to embarrassment or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may understate how disruptive or severe her symptoms are\u2014her descriptions suggest more persistent or intense episodes than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about tumors and adrenal problems reflect real anxiety but may be fueled by her emotional state rather than accurate symptom assessment. - True timeline: Symptoms are probably progressive, matching her report, but the exact severity and episodes may be worse than her narrative suggests, given her tendency to downplay discomfort.",
    "output": "THINKING: The current gap involves understanding the full scope and experience of her tremors, sweating, and anxiety, particularly focusing on the circumstances, severity, and emotional impact. Since her descriptions are vague and qualified, I should encourage her to elaborate on her subjective experience, especially how these symptoms affect her daily life and her concerns. The priorities include exploring the duration, triggers, emotional context, and her understanding of these symptoms to refine differential considerations. Given her hesitant style, an empathetic, open-ended question should invite detailed sharing without making her uncomfortable or feeling judged.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Use an open-ended question to promote elaboration - Target her personal experience, including emotional and functional effects - Phrase gently to foster psychological safety - Expect to gather descriptive details that clarify symptom severity and impact\nANSWER: \"Could you tell me more about what these episodes of shakiness and feeling really nervous are like for you\u2014what usually happens during them, and how they seem to affect your day or how you\u2019re feeling overall?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with reported episodes of daytime anxiety, trembling hands, sweating, and sensations consistent with increased autonomic arousal. While the patient describes these episodes as sudden and distressing, the true severity, frequency, and associated physical signs may be greater than currently documented. Objective data such as blood pressure measurements and physical exam findings are not available, and further assessment is needed to accurately characterize the autonomic symptoms and their impact.1. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The patient's report of sudden, distressing episodes with trembling, sweating, and autonomic arousal aligns closely with panic attacks. These episodes are often unpredictable and associated with significant anxiety, fitting the pattern of panic disorder. The absence of structural or neurological deficits further supports this, as the symptoms are episodic and driven by autonomic nervous system hyperactivity characteristic of panic attacks.  2. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Justification: Although GAD involves persistent anxiety, it can occasionally manifest with episodic physical symptoms like tremors and sweating. If anxiety is chronic, with episodic exacerbations, this may be considered. However, since episodes are described as sudden and distressing, panic disorder remains more specific, but GAD remains plausible, especially if anxiety is pervasive rather than isolated.  3. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder Justification: If episodes are context-dependent, particularly in social situations, social anxiety could account for heightened autonomic symptoms. Nonetheless, the vignette emphasizes daytime anxiety and physical symptoms without specific social triggers, making this less likely compared to panic disorder.  4. Diagnosis: Substance-induced Anxiety or Stimulant Use Justification: The symptoms could be caused by stimulants or substances that increase sympathetic activity. Without confirming substance use history, it's speculative. Still, this remains in the differential if episodes are linked to recent substance intake.  5. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Justification: Hyperthyroidism can cause increased adrenergic activity leading to tremors, sweating, and anxiety. However, without additional signs such as weight loss, heat intolerance, or tachycardia, and no objective signs, it is less favored but still considered as part of a broader differential, especially if symptoms are persistent rather than episodic.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs a mix of vague and emotionally charged language, such as \"kind of,\" \"just,\" and \"really,\" which serve to soften or intensify her disclosures depending on context. - Information flow: She tends to volunteer key concerns but withhold detailed specifics about symptom frequency or severity, possibly to avoid appearing overly distressed or to protect herself psychologically. - Response style: Her responses are somewhat elaborative but also contain subtle hedging\u2014balancing honesty with self-protection.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She avoids giving concrete details about the frequency and severity of her symptoms, indicating a degree of withholding, perhaps out of embarrassment or fear. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her symptoms (\"just feel like I can't relax\") and uses vague descriptors, which may understate her physical burden. - Amplification patterns: She emphasizes emotional distress (\"really nervous,\" \"thrown off\") more than physical evidence, possibly amplifying her worried state to seek reassurance. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited overt signs but the usage of vague and softened language suggests unspoken discomfort or embarrassment about her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of disorientation but some vagueness in describing symptom triggers and timelines. - Family influence: No signs of external influence; responses seem primarily self-driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Verbal minimization coupled with emotional amplification\u2014she underrepresents the physical severity while overemphasizing her emotional distress. - Severity: Moderate. While she understates some symptoms, her visible anxiety and detailed concern about serious illness suggest genuine distress that could be partially masked. - Areas most affected: Accurate assessment of symptom severity and timeline; her explanations likely underreport physical burden. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her self-report provides valuable emotional insight but may underrepresent the true scope of physical symptoms.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise frequency, intensity, and functional impact of symptoms; she may be withholding some physical or behavioral signs due to embarrassment or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her tremors, sweating, and possibly the degree of blood pressure fluctuation are likely more severe than she admits. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of tumors or adrenal issues seem heightened compared to objective likelihood, driven by emotional distress. - True timeline: Symptom development is likely gradual with increasing severity; her current perception might inflate recent changes, influenced by anxiety.  This analysis suggests that while the patient presents as anxious and somewhat defensive in her disclosures, her underlying physical symptoms may be more pronounced, and her psychological concern about serious illness is high, requiring careful validation and reassurance.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with reported daytime episodes of autonomic symptoms including trembling, sweating, and rapid heartbeat. These episodes are described as sudden and lasting a few minutes, occurring multiple times daily. The patient reports feeling anxious during episodes and perceives a lack of control over symptoms. Due to communication patterns involving hesitations and vague timelines, the severity, duration, and physical aspects of these episodes may be underestimated; physical sensations such as dizziness and shortness of breath could be more intense or prolonged than reported. Further assessment is needed to clarify the frequency, physical characteristics, and impact of these episodes.1. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The episodes are sudden, brief, recurrent, involving trembling, sweating, rapid heartbeat, and anxiety with a perceived loss of control. These features are characteristic of panic attacks, which define panic disorder, especially when episodes occur multiple times daily without consistent physical findings indicating alternative causes.  2. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's report of pervasive anxiety and multiple episodes of physical symptoms could reflect an underlying continuous anxiety state. However, the episodic nature of symptoms favors panic attacks over persistent anxiety, placing this lower on the list but still plausible.  3. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma Justification: Autonomic symptoms like sweating, tachycardia, and episodic hypertension can occur in pheochromocytoma; however, the lack of persistent systemic symptoms or other catecholamine excess signs in the vignette makes this less likely as a primary diagnosis but still considered due to symptom similarity.  4. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Justification: Symptoms of sympathetic overactivity (tremors, tachycardia, sweating) are common, but episodes tend to be more persistent rather than brief and recurrent, so it is a less probable cause of episodic attacks.  5. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia Justification: Palpitations and rapid heartbeat can suggest arrhythmias, but without additional evidence of cardiac issues or syncope, and given the presence of anxiety, this is a less probable primary diagnosis but still worth considering as part of differential for episodic autonomic symptoms.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient often uses vague and qualifying terms (\"kind of,\" \"maybe\") which indicate hesitancy and possible inhibition to fully disclose. She emphasizes emotional distress with phrases like \"really sweaty\" and \"feel off,\" reflecting heightened concern and emotional emphasis rather than clinical precision. - Information flow: She tends to elaborate more when prompted about the impact of symptoms but withholds specifics about the episodic nature and frequency, possibly due to discomfort or uncertainty. Her responses are somewhat organized but interspersed with qualifiers, indicating a mix of openness and defensiveness. - Response style: Generally elaborate when describing her distress but cautious with specific details such as duration, frequency, and physical sensations, likely aiming to avoid sounding overly alarmed or weak.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Avoidance of precise timing and frequency details suggests mild withholding, possibly subconscious, related to uncertainty or embarrassment. - Minimization behaviors: Frequent use of vague language (e.g., \"kind of,\" \"maybe\") and descriptors like \"a little dizzy\" point to downplaying the episodes' severity. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional tone, frequent worries about serious illness, and vivid descriptions of distress may lead her to exaggerate the emotional impact but not necessarily the physical episodes themselves. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and qualifiers imply discomfort, perhaps with vulnerability about health anxiety. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity around durations (\"a few minutes\") and sequences suggests some confusion or difficulty recalling specifics, typical in anxious or stressed individuals. - Family influence: No explicit evidence observed.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate emotional amplification with some response withholding, influenced by health anxiety. - Severity: Moderate; emotional distress influences reporting, but she provides consistent descriptors of her feelings and symptoms. - Areas most affected: Precise episode details (duration, frequency) and how symptoms fluctuate, which are critical for accurate diagnosis. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reporting includes emotional exaggeration and mild withholding, which should be cross-verified with objective data or further questioning.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact numbers on episode frequency and duration, which may be longer or more frequent than reported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Severity and duration of episodes, especially physical sensations like dizziness or breathing changes, may be more intense or prolonged. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about tumors or adrenal issues are heavily emphasized, potentially overestimating actual risk. - True timeline: Symptoms might have a more gradual escalation rather than abrupt episodes, but her emotional focus may distort actual progression, emphasizing current distress over subtle developments.",

She avoids technical language and displays some minimization, perhaps to avoid frightening herself further. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming, volunteering initial symptoms, but becomes reticent when describing specific sensations or triggers, indicating selective sharing. Her responses tend to be organized but include tangential or uncertain remarks, reflecting nervousness. - Response style: She elaborates on her feelings and symptoms but tends to soften or downplay details, showing some minimization to avoid deepening her worry or due to discomfort discussing the episodes.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She expresses uncertainty (\"I guess,\" \"maybe\") about specifics like duration and triggers, indicating some reluctance to fully disclose details, possibly to avoid confronting her fears or because of discomfort. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays sensations (\"just suddenly start feeling all shaky,\" \"maybe a few minutes\") and avoids emphasizing the severity, perhaps to avoid alarm, but still reports serious symptoms, suggesting some degree of downplaying. - Amplification patterns: While she reports episodes lasting \"a few minutes,\" she seems to focus on fears of serious conditions (\"something serious,\" \"tumor or something\"), indicating she is amplifying her concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The nervousness and hesitations suggest mild embarrassment or shame about her anxiety and physical sensations, which she might not fully acknowledge. - Confusion/memory issues: Her descriptions of onset (\"suddenly,\" \"happens when I\u2019m sitting or just at work\") are consistent but limited, possibly due to anxious distraction rather than memory lapses. - Family influence: Not directly evident; responses seem driven by her internal experience rather than family input.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate emotional exaggeration and minimization bias, driven by anxiety about health and difficulty accurately reporting internal sensations. - Severity: Moderate, because she provides inconsistent but generally coherent reports, yet her emotional state influences her response pattern. - Areas most affected: Descriptions of episode onset, duration, and physical sensations are most biased\u2014tendency to emphasize suddenness and severity while minimizing potential triggers or mild sensations. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; her self-reporting is biased by anxiety to either overstate fears or underplay details, so clinical interpretation must consider this.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details of episode frequency, precise sensations, and triggers may be underreported or inconsistently described. She may be avoiding discussing more embarrassing or frightening elements. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may understate the severity or frequency of episodes, possibly minimizing physiological sensations like chest tightness or breathlessness that could indicate more serious autonomic events. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of tumors or adrenal gland issues are likely overemphasized due to her anxiety, possibly exaggerating the threat posed by these episodes. - True timeline: The progression of symptoms is likely more gradual, with episodes possibly becoming more frequent or severe over time, but her anxiety coloring her perception of suddenness and severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need precise details about the physical sensations during episodes, particularly any chest or respiratory symptoms, to differentiate panic attacks from possible cardiac or autonomic conditions. Clarification on triggers is also essential\u2014whether these episodes are truly spontaneous or linked to specific stressors. The pattern of these episodes (frequency, duration, severity) and their impact on functional capacity remain somewhat vague due to potential minimization. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm the core features of panic disorder, such as sudden onset, specific physical symptoms, and psychological triggers, while ruling out cardiac, neurological, or other autonomic causes (e.g., arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism). - Patient factors: Her nervousness, tendency to downplay details, and emotional language suggest a need for gentle, concrete questioning that encourages fuller disclosure without provoking self-criticism. - Interview phase goals: This stage aims to solidify the understanding of her episode characteristics, confirm that symptoms meet the criteria for panic disorder, and assess her comfort and readiness for discussing potential treatment options.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions to pin down specific sensations and triggers without leading or overwhelming. - Information target: Physical sensations during episodes, onset cues, duration, frequency, possible triggers, and impact on life. - Communication approach: Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language, framing questions as collaborative efforts to better understand her experience. - Expected value: Clarification of key diagnostic features, ensuring confidence that her episodes are consistent with panic disorder, or identifying red flags requiring further evaluation.\nANSWER: Based on what you've shared so far, I\u2019d like to understand more about the physical sensations you experience during these episodes. Specifically, can you tell me if you ever feel tightness or pressure in your chest, shortness of breath, or dizziness right at the start of these episodes? Also, are there particular situations or feelings that seem to bring them on, or do they seem to come out of nowhere? This will help us understand whether these episodes are typical of panic attacks or if we need to consider other possibilities.",
