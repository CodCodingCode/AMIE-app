    "input": "The patient is a woman approximately three weeks postpartum who is breastfeeding. She presents with complaints of nipple soreness and cracking, along with a sensation of breast fullness and warmth that has persisted for several days. While she reports feeling mildly feverish, physical signs such as redness, swelling, and tenderness are likely more extensive than described. Systemic symptoms such as higher fever or chills may be present but are not fully disclosed. The onset of symptoms may have occurred earlier or been more severe and progressing faster than communicated. Further assessment of the physical findings and systemic symptoms is necessary to determine the severity of the underlying condition, which appears consistent with a localized or early infectious process that warrants prompt evaluation and treatment.1. Diagnosis: Lactation Mastitis Justification: The combination of breast fullness, warmth, soreness, cracking nipples, and mild fever suggests an infectious inflammatory process, common in breastfeeding women, usually caused by bacterial entry through cracked nipples.  2. Diagnosis: Breast Abscess Justification: Progressive worsening of symptoms, particularly if localized fluctuant mass or persistent systemic signs, suggests a potential localized pus collection; occurs as a complication of mastitis.  3. Diagnosis: Nipple Fungal Infection Justification: Crack and soreness may be due to Candida or other fungal infections, especially in breastfeeding women, often with associated itching and feeling of moisture.  4. Diagnosis: Duct Ectasia Justification: Duct ectasia presents with ductal dilation, possible soreness and nipple discharge, more common in non-pregnant women but can cause localized breast discomfort.  5. Diagnosis: Blocked Milk Duct Justification: Benign cause of breast fullness and localized tenderness due to milk stasis, often without systemic symptoms but can sometimes cause soreness and warmth.  6. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Breast Cancer Justification: Although rare postpartum, presents with rapid onset of breast swelling, warmth, redness; important to consider in differential, but less likely without skin changes or peau d'orange.  7. Diagnosis: Nipple Dermatitis or Contact Dermatitis Justification: Nipple soreness and cracking can be irritant or allergic dermatitis, usually without systemic features or significant warmth.  8. Diagnosis: Phlegmon or Subareolar Abscess Justification: Deep-seated infection involving the subareolar tissue may present with localized swelling, tenderness, and warmth; more common in smokers or women with recurrent infections.  9. Diagnosis: Leistithiasis (galactocele) Justification: Milk retention cyst presenting with a painless breast mass; unlikely with associated warmth and systemic symptoms but included for completeness.  10. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Conditions (non-infectious) Justification: Less specific, but includes conditions like idiopathic granulomatous mastitis; typically more chronic and less correlated with breastfeeding period.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses somewhat cautious language (\"a little crack,\" \"feels really full and hot,\" \"a few days\") that indicates some minimization, but also emotional expressions (\"worried,\" \"don't want to get really sick\") that reveal concern. Overall, his language is modest and seeks reassurance. - Information flow: He is somewhat forthcoming, volunteering extra background about breastfeeding and emotional stress, but with subtle hesitations, hinting at discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose concerns. - Response style: His answers are measured, with some pauses, and include supplemental context, reflecting anxiety and responsibility.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Slight reluctance in describing symptom severity (\"a little crack,\" \"for a few days\") suggests possible underplaying. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the appearance of redness and the duration of symptoms indicates a tendency to minimize the seriousness. - Amplification patterns: The emphasis on feeling \"really full and hot\" and worrying about worsening highlights genuine concern but not exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Modest tone and slight hesitations may indicate some discomfort with discussing bodily symptoms or breastfeeding issues. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; responses appear consistent. - Family influence: Acknowledges limited support, which could increase anxiety, but there's no evidence it skews the accuracy of his descriptions.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias; the patient appears to be underestimating symptom severity and the urgency, perhaps to maintain a sense of control or avoid appearing overly worried. - Severity: Moderate; this bias might lead to delayed recognition of infection severity, but he is still communicating key symptoms. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and progression details; the actual extent of redness, swelling, and fever might be more serious. - Reliability: Moderate confidence; his self-report is generally honest but possibly clouds some details by minimizing severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact timing, extent of redness, any changes in pain intensity, and emotional impact. - Symptoms probably minimized: The tenderness, redness, and fever could be more pronounced; his description suggests a potential underestimation. - Concerns probably amplified: Worry about health, infection, and stopping breastfeeding may be heightened, which he may overperceive or worry excessively about. - True timeline: Infection likely progressed beyond what he reports, possibly starting earlier or worsening more rapidly, given typical infection patterns and his modest descriptions.  Overall, his communication is cautious and slightly minimized, indicating a need for gentle reassurance and detailed assessment to uncover the full extent of his condition.",

    "input": "A breastfeeding woman approximately three weeks postpartum presents with localized symptoms consistent with mastitis, including nipple soreness, cracking, breast fullness, warmth, and redness. She reports feeling mildly febrile and shivery, but her cautious communication suggests these symptoms may be more pronounced. The symptoms began around three days prior, with progressive worsening noted during feeds. Physical examination and objective measures are needed to confirm the severity of inflammation, assess for systemic illness, and identify any complications such as abscess formation, which she may be withholding or underemphasizing.1. Diagnosis: Lactational Mastitis Justification: Typical presentation of localized breast erythema, warmth, tenderness, systemic symptoms (fever, chills), onset within the first few weeks postpartum, and worsening during feeds\u2014classic for mastitis.  2. Diagnosis: Breast Abscess Justification: Worsening symptoms over three days, localized warmth and redness, signs of potential complication of mastitis, and possible fluctuant mass; abscess formation is a common progression if infection persists.  3. Diagnosis: Plugged Duct (Milk Retention/Congestion) Justification: Breast fullness and tenderness, localized symptoms that can precede mastitis; often occurs in early postpartum period and can progress if milk flow is obstructed.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Cellulitis of the Breast Justification: Presents with redness, warmth, swelling, systemic symptoms, and skin infection; can mimic mastitis but often without milk involvement.  5. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Breast Cancer Justification: Although less likely at three weeks postpartum, new-onset redness, swelling, and skin changes may warrant consideration to rule out malignancy, especially if persistent or atypical.  6. Diagnosis: Nipple Fungal or Bacterial Infection (e.g., Candida, bacterial dermatitis) Justification: Nipple soreness and cracking suggest possible superficial infections, especially if symptoms are localized to nipple area, though systemic features are less prominent.  7. Diagnosis: Phlegmon (Diffuse Breast Infection) Justification: Diffuse, inflamed breast tissue without abscess formation; can be an extension of mastitis.  8. Diagnosis: Herpetic Breast Infection (Herpes Zoster) Justification: Although less common, vesicular lesions or burning pain could suggest herpes zoster; typically presents with vesicles, which are not described here.  9. Diagnosis: Inflammatory Carcinoma (Paget\u2019s Disease of the Nipple) Justification: Chronic nipple changes, soreness, possibly with scaling or ulceration; unlikely at only three weeks postpartum but important to consider if symptoms persist.  10. Diagnosis: Congestive Heart Failure (less likely) Justification: Unlikely given localized breast symptoms and absence of signs of systemic heart failure, but included for thoroughness in differential diagnoses involving systemic illness.

    "input": "A approximately three-week postpartum woman presents with symptoms consistent with mastitis, including nipple soreness, cracking, breast fullness, warmth, and redness that began around three days prior. She reports increased pain during breastfeeding and feeling mildly febrile and shivery, though her descriptions suggest she may be underestimating physical severity. She describes a sensation of swelling or a lump in the breast and tenderness, which may indicate more significant inflammation or early abscess formation. Given her anxious and emotionally distressed communication, physical examination is necessary to evaluate the extent of inflammation, presence of abscess or other complications, and systemic signs. Her emotional state may influence symptom reporting, and further assessment is needed to determine appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial mastitis Justification: The patient's recent postpartum status combined with breast soreness, cracking, fullness, warmth, redness, and systemic symptoms such as chills and mild fever strongly suggest infectious mastitis. The onset within three days aligns with typical postpartum lactational infections, especially with increased pain during breastfeeding and palpable swelling. These features are classic for bacterial mastitis, often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and explain her symptoms comprehensively.  2. Diagnosis: Breast abscess Justification: The presence of a lump or swelling, tenderness, and symptoms persisting or worsening over days raises concern for localized collection of pus within the breast tissue. This is a common complication of unresolved or severe mastitis, especially when systemic symptoms are present. Although not confirmed, the recent development and signs of worsening inflammation increase suspicion for abscess formation.  3. Diagnosis: Duct ectasia (less likely) Justification: Duct ectasia involves dilated ducts with possible nipple discharge and is more chronic, usually presenting with nipple changes rather than systemic symptoms. The acute presentation with systemic signs makes this less likely but remains a differential, particularly if symptoms persist.  4. Diagnosis: Inflammatory breast cancer (less likely) Justification: While inflammatory breast carcinoma can cause redness, warmth, and swelling, it is typically characterized by rapid progression, skin dimpling, and unilateral erythema in a non-lactating woman. The postpartum context and recent onset favor an infectious process over malignancy.  5. Diagnosis: Galactocele Justification: A galactocele is a milk retention cyst that presents as a painless lump, usually without systemic symptoms or redness. Since this patient exhibits erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms, a galactocele is less probable but included for completeness, especially if the lump is stable and painless.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient often uses vague, less precise phrases like \"a little bump\" and \"kind of tender,\" which can obscure real severity, coupled with emotional expressions of fear about serious infection. His tendency to include personal concerns (\"did I do something wrong\") serves as emotional context rather than purely clinical data. - Information flow: He is somewhat forthcoming but interweaves clinical descriptions with tangential concerns, such as stress, fatigue, and financial worries, which may distract from or mask the core physical issues. - Response style: Responses tend to be elaborative with storytelling elements that include emotional and social context. There is hesitance at the start, then increased openness, but underlying reluctance to fully disclose emotional distress or severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient may minimize the physical findings, especially when he describes the bump as \"maybe I feel like a little bump\" and \"all kinda tender,\" potentially underrepresenting the severity. His mention of feeling tired and stressed suggests emotional distress he may be hesitant to fully share. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying physical signs (\"a little bump or something\") and attributes of symptoms to \"maybe I did something wrong\" indicate attempts to minimize the problem, possibly to avoid anxiety or reassurance-seeking behavior. - Amplification patterns: His fears of \"really sick\" and \"getting worse\" could be exaggerated due to anxiety, but there's also genuine concern\u2014a blending that amplifies perceived risk. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitance to fully explain emotional states and mentioning stress and feelings of doing \"something wrong\" suggest embarrassment or shame about inability to manage breastfeeding or health concerns. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistency in describing the timeline, but mostly coherent with potential emotional overlay rather than true memory gaps. - Family influence: Not prominently indicated, though his worry about \"maybe I did something wrong\" hints at internalized guilt, possibly influenced by social or family expectations.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mixture of minimization and amplification, primarily minimizing physical findings while amplifying fears\u2014likely driven by anxiety, shame, or social pressure. - Severity: Moderate. The patient accurately describes some symptoms but downplays certain physical signs and overstates fears, affecting assessment reliability. - Areas most affected: The physical symptoms related to swelling, lumps, and redness are most biased, with underreporting of objective findings and overreporting of emotional fears. - Reliability: Moderate. The physical description is somewhat accurate but likely lacks full detail, and emotional concerns are possibly intensified or not fully disclosed.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully articulating the presence of more overt abscesses, significant swelling, or systemic symptoms if present, due to minimization. Additionally, emotional distress might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Examination findings could reveal more severe signs like abscess formation or systemic illness than acknowledged. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of dying or severe infection appear high relative to his actual description, potentially driven by anxiety or misinformation. - True timeline: The physical symptoms seem to be progressing faster and may be more severe than conveyed; emotional distress perhaps lags behind or is underreported, affecting overall assessment accuracy.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development: - Information gaps: The patient describes a \"little bump\" and general tenderness but minimises severity, so I need to clarify whether there's an indurated or fluctuating swelling, and whether the lump is painful or tender when pressed. It's important to distinguish between a simple ductal issue and an abscess. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiate between uncomplicated mastitis and possible abscess formation. Also, rule out signs of more severe infection or malignancy. - Patient factors: The patient communicates with some hesitance and emotional overlay; questions need to be gentle, affirming, and clarify physical findings without causing further distress. - Interview phase goals: To gather specific, objective data about the lump's characteristics, systemic signs, and any triggering factors, to refine differential diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, descriptive questions about physical findings. - Information target: Presence, size, consistency, fluctuation, mobility of the lump, and associated systemic signs. - Communication approach: Use non-judgmental, clarifying language to help the patient elaborate without feeling criticized. - Expected value: Gaining objective details to confirm or exclude findings like abscess or malignancy, guiding subsequent examination or management.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about this bump you feel in your breast\u2014for example, is it hard or soft?

    "input": "A postpartum woman approximately three weeks post-delivery presents with breast symptoms consistent with mastitis, including nipple soreness, cracking, fullness, warmth, redness, and tenderness. She reports these symptoms began about three days ago, with worsening pain during breastfeeding and systemic feelings of feverishness and chills, though systemic symptoms are likely underreported. Physical examination is required to assess for evidence of fluctuant, tender, and possibly pus-filled areas within the breast tissue, as physical signs may be more severe than patient describes. The presentation suggests an inflammatory or infectious process that may have progressed to an abscess; physical findings should be carefully evaluated to determine extent and appropriate treatment, keeping in mind that communication biases may underestimate physical severity.1. Diagnosis: Breast abscess Justification: The patient's worsening localized symptoms (redness, tenderness, warmth, swelling) along with systemic signs like fever suggest progression from simple mastitis to an abscess. Physical examination could reveal fluctuant areas or pus, indicating abscess formation. This is the most urgent diagnosis requiring prompt drainage and antibiotics to prevent further complications.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial mastitis Justification: The initial presentation of breast pain, redness, warmth, and systemic symptoms is typical of lactational mastitis, commonly caused by bacterial infection, notably Staphylococcus aureus. The progression and worsening of symptoms over three days support this diagnosis, which is common postpartum.  3. Diagnosis: Galactocele Justification: A milk retention cyst (galactocele) can cause localized breast fullness, sometimes tender, typically without systemic symptoms like fever. Its presence could mimic mastitis initially, especially if associated with milk stasis. However, systemic signs and redness are less characteristic of galactocele, making it less likely as the primary diagnosis but still in consideration.  4. Diagnosis: Inflammatory breast carcinoma Justification: Although rare in postpartum women, inflammatory breast cancer can present with redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness similar to mastitis. However, the recent postpartum period and the infectious features lean less toward this, and the typical age group and rapid symptom development favor infection.  5. Diagnosis: Fungal or non-bacterial infectious processes (e.g., Candida mastitis) Justification: Fungal infections can cause localized breast symptoms, especially if antibiotics or other predisposing factors are present. Nonetheless, the systemic symptoms and recent childbirth strongly favor bacterial origin, but fungal causes remain a consideration if bacterial treatment fails.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient\u2019s responses are characterized by vague, non-specific descriptions such as \"kind of soft\" and \"not really sure,\" which indicate hesitance or discomfort in discussing precise details. His emotional state is reflected in words like \"worried,\" \"scared,\" and \"stress,\" highlighting anxiety that influences his language. There's a tendency to downplay the symptoms, but he also emphasizes discomfort and worry, showing internal conflict. - Information flow: He is somewhat reluctant initially, volunteering only basic info about swelling and redness and waiting for direct questions before elaborating further. His responses show a pattern of withholding details unless prompted, which could mask the true extent of his concern. - Response style: His replies tend to be brief, tentative, and somewhat scattered, lacking detailed descriptions unless specifically asked. He exhibits signs of hesitation, possibly avoiding revealing full symptoms or severity, and sometimes shifts topics or expresses confusion.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance to describe the lump fully, reluctance to confirm or deny changes, avoiding graphic details about pus or worsening symptoms. These point toward potential withholding, possibly due to shame or uncertainty. - Minimization behaviors: Describing the lump as \"kind of soft,\" \"not really sure,\" and downplaying the significance of symptoms suggest an attempt to minimize the perceived severity, which could hinder accurate assessment. - Amplification patterns: His fears of \"something serious\" and the worry about infection seem amplified relative to his descriptions, reflecting heightened anxiety which could lead to overestimating risks. - Embarrassment/shame signals: reluctance to fully describe the lump or admit confusion hints at discomfort discussing personal health details, possibly to avoid feeling judged or overwhelmed. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity around details like whether the mass moves or changes size indicates some confusion or limited understanding rather than memory loss. - Family influence: External stressors like financial and emotional stress are evident, but no direct influence from family is indicated beyond the context of stress.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main concern here is a tendency toward minimization and anxious exaggeration\u2014downplaying certain observations but amplifying fears. - Severity: Moderate, because while he provides some accurate symptom descriptions, his vague and hesitant responses limit full understanding. - Most affected areas: His descriptions of the lump and the overall severity of his symptoms are biased by minimization and avoidance, which could obscure actual danger signs. - Reliability: Moderate \u2013 his anxiety and hesitance suggest that responses should be taken with caution, and clinical findings should be prioritized.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise characterization of the lump's consistency, exact changes over time, and any additional symptoms such as pus or worsening signs may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might be underreporting the severity of the lump or pain, possibly underestimating the risk of abscess or other complication. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of \"something serious\" and health deterioration seem driven by anxiety rather than objective signs, although caution is warranted. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent but may be slightly worse in reality, with anxiety possibly causing him to perceive symptoms as more urgent than they are.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise characterization of the lump's consistency, exact changes over time, and any additional symptoms such as pus or worsening signs may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: He might be underreporting the severity of the lump or pain, possibly underestimating the risk of abscess or other complication. - Concerns probably amplified: His fears of \"something serious\" and health deterioration seem driven by anxiety rather than objective signs, although caution is warranted. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent but may be slightly worse in reality, with anxiety possibly causing him to perceive symptoms as more urgent than they are.  Overall, his responses reflect a mix of genuine symptoms, emotional distress, and communication biases that require careful interpretation to avoid under- or over-treatment.",

    "input": "The clinical presentation involves a postpartum woman approximately three weeks after delivery with signs consistent with an infectious process in the breast, likely mastitis with possible progression to an abscess. She reports nipple soreness, cracks, and a sensation of breast fullness and warmth beginning three days prior, with symptoms worsening over time. Physical examination is expected to reveal a firm, tender, possibly fluctuant lump within the breast, accompanied by localized redness, warmth, and swelling. Systemic symptoms such as fever and chills are probably more pronounced systemically than she reports, indicating a more severe infection that warrants detailed physical assessment and targeted intervention.Puerperal Mastitis with possible Abscess ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs vague, hedging language like \"kind of,\" \"not really sure,\" which reduces clarity and suggests reluctance to commit to specific descriptions. Emotional expressions (\u201creally worried,\u201d \u201cfeeling feverish\u201d) reveal genuine concern but may also amplify their perception of severity without clear clinical signs. - Information flow: They tend to volunteer limited information initially and elaborate only when prompted, indicating possible hesitation or discomfort. Their responses are scattered with internal doubt, demonstrating some reluctance to fully disclose severity. - Response style: Responses are somewhat elaborated but marked by vagueness and hedging, reflecting internal conflict\u2014concern but cautious communication.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient avoids explicitly confirming whether the lump has changed in hardness or whether pus has been seen. Their tentative language suggests awareness that their descriptions might not fully convey severity. - Minimization behaviors: Describing the lump as \"kinda soft\" and \"not much change\" despite other signs of infection (redness, warmth, tenderness), indicating a tendency to minimize concerning features. - Amplification patterns: Expresses apprehension and fears of worsening (\"it might get worse or turn serious\"). Their detailed focus on symptoms and worry suggests internal amplification of risk\u2014probably heightened by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitance to specify details about the lump and symptoms, and use of vague descriptors, point to possible discomfort discussing symptoms openly. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about whether the lump has changed or gotten bigger; responses reflect some ambiguity rather than factual inaccuracies. - Family influence: Mention of partner's tiredness and stress might influence the patient\u2019s internal emotional state, contributing to protective or anxious responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate minimization bias, as the patient tempers descriptions of physical findings possibly to avoid panic or embarrassment while still expressing genuine concern. - Severity: Moderate; their responses mask potentially significant physical signs but are truthful about their worry, which indicates internal tension. - Areas most affected: Physical signs of infection (lump firmness, redness, pus) are most potentially underreported; emotional concern is evident but may not fully align with physical findings. - Reliability: Moderate; their responses are influenced by internal stress and reluctance, so some clinical signs may be underestimated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true consistency and hardness of the lump, presence of pus, and extent of redness may be understated. They may also be reluctant to admit severity due to embarrassment or fear. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs of severe infection (firm, moving lumps, pus) could be worse than described. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient\u2019s mention of \u201creally worried\u201d and \u201cworry it might get worse\u201d suggests heightened anxiety, potentially overestimating the danger relative to physical findings. - True timeline: Symptoms seem to be worsening over days, but the reluctance to describe changes in detail suggests some uncertainty about the pace or severity of progression.  Overall, nuanced communication reveals internal conflict: genuine concern tempered by minimization and hesitance, which warrants careful clinical reassurance and detailed examination.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I need to confirm whether the physical findings suggest an abscess or more localized cellulitis, especially focusing on hardness, fluctuation, and pus. The patient's hedging and vague descriptions mean I should specifically target the characteristics of the lump, as these are key diagnostic features. - The patient's emotional state, indicated by hesitation and concern, suggests they might be aware of the seriousness but are reluctant to fully disclose symptoms. Ensuring a sensitive, nonjudgmental approach will help elicit more precise information. - Clarifying whether they have noticed a fluctuant or pus-filled area will help differentiate between mastitis and abscess, which impacts management. - I also want to explore if they have systemic symptoms like fever or chills, which they might not have reported clearly but are important for severity assessment. - Overall, I aim to gather detailed, specific info about physical signs that might be minimized, ensuring diagnostic certainty while also addressing their concerns.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Focused, direct questions aimed at physical characteristics (firmness, fluctuation, pus) - Phrased politely and collaboratively to reduce discomfort and encourage honesty - Target questions on recent changes, signs of fluctuation, pus, and systemic symptoms - Designed to differentiate between infection stages and assess urgency\nANSWER: \"You've mentioned feeling the lump and some redness and tenderness. Can you tell me more specifically\u2014do you notice if this lump feels hard or soft when you touch it? Have you noticed if it moves under your skin, or if there's a spot that feels like it has more fluid or pus coming out? Also, since you've been feeling this way, have you seen any areas that seem more fluctuant or maybe even filled with pus? And just to be sure, are you also feeling any fevers, chills, or overall feeling worse?\"",
