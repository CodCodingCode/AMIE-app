De Quervain\u2019s tendinopathy often presents with radial wrist pain and swelling near the radial styloid; although it involves thumb movement, the patient's description favors joint pain. Gout most commonly causes acute monoarthritis with swelling and redness, which are absent here, but cannot be fully excluded without lab tests. Rheumatoid arthritis usually causes symmetric joint involvement with swelling and systemic signs, which are not seen. Ligamentous injury is less likely given the lack of trauma or instability signs.",

Diagnosis: Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint\nJustification: The chronic, localized pain at the base of the thumb, worsened by gripping and turning, with activity-related discomfort and occasional night awakening, aligns with typical osteoarthritis presentation of the thumb CMC joint. Absence of swelling or redness is common in osteoarthritis. The insidious onset over weeks supports this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: De Quervain's tenosynovitis\nJustification: Dependent on activity exacerbation and pain over the radial wrist/thumb region; however, lack of swelling and tenderness limits this diagnosis. Still, repetitive gripping motions could be contributory, making it a plausible differential.\n3. Diagnosis: Ligament sprain of the thumb (e.g., ulnar collateral ligament)\nJustification: Activity related pain could be due to a ligament injury from overuse or strain, especially with difficulty gripping and opening jars. The absence of acute trauma in the history reduces the likelihood but does not exclude it.\n4. Diagnosis: Superficial radial nerve entrapment\nJustification: The radiating arm pain suggests possible nerve involvement, but the localized joint pain and activity worsening favor a joint or soft tissue process over nerve pathology.\n5. Diagnosis: Early inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)\nJustification: No systemic symptoms, no swelling or multiple joints involved, and pain being localized makes this less likely, but it remains a differential especially if symptoms progress.\nSTOP HERE.",

Rheumatoid arthritis would likely involve multiple joints with systemic evidence, which is absent.
