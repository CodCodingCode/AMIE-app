    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Tearing, redness, swelling, onset after physical activity, common in young active individuals, easily triggered by environmental exposure during sports.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or superficial trauma Justification: Recent sports activity suggests potential ocular trauma, leading to redness, swelling, tearing, especially if the injury involved or near the eye surface.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden swelling and redness after physical activity can be due to minor vessel rupture; usually painless but causes visible redness.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Itchy, red, tearing eyes are typical, though less likely given the recent trauma; however, common in young active people with exposure to allergens.  5. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Significant swelling and redness after trauma, could suggest deep infection, but less likely without systemic symptoms like fever or proptosis.  6. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid inflammation causing redness and swelling, common, though symptoms are usually chronic.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Causes redness and tearing but usually associated with pain, photophobia, and other intraocular symptoms; less likely acutely post-sports activity.  8. Diagnosis: Ocular foreign body Justification: Possible after playing soccer; can cause redness, tearing, swelling, particularly with a recent injury.  9. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Local eyelid swelling and redness after trauma, but usually without proptosis or systemic illness signs.  10. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (angle-closure) Justification: Can present with redness and swelling, but typically involves significant pain, vision changes, and is less common in this context.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged, intense descriptors like \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and \"so much worse,\" showing high emotional engagement. Her descriptions are specific about pain location and nature, but her timeline references are somewhat ambiguous, reflecting possible confusion. - Information flow: She is forthcoming in sharing her symptoms without much prompting, indicating openness, but her responses are colored by emotional distress, which may bias her perception. - Response style: She gives detailed, empathetic responses with evident distress, possibly overemphasizing severity but not intentionally withholding information.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Lack of evidence; she appears eager to describe her symptoms fully. - Minimization behaviors: Not prominent; she describes her pain as severe and escalating. - Amplification patterns: She intensifies her descriptions (\"terrible,\" \"worst,\" \"so much worse\") suggesting emotional amplification rather than factual exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signs may include fidgeting or discomfort in discussing sensitive topics; implied by her distressed posture. - Confusion/memory issues: Some timeline confusion, reflecting possible cognitive overload due to distress. - Family influence: No clear signs; responses seem primarily self-reported.

    "input": "The patient, a female presenting with ocular pain and systemic symptoms, reports a worsening course over the past week, with notable escalation in the last two days characterized by eye redness, swelling, tearing, vomiting, and a sensation of fever. Communication biases imply her initial mild symptoms may have been understated, and her current distress may lead to an overassessment of severity. Systemic symptoms such as vomiting and fever should be evaluated further, and a precise timeline of symptom onset needs clarification. Objective findings are consistent with an acute ocular inflammatory process that has rapidly worsened recently, but early mild symptoms may have been present and underappreciated. Additional history and examination are necessary to establish the true timeline and severity of initial symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: Rapid onset of eye redness, swelling, systemic symptoms such as fever and vomiting are classic signs; the escalation over a week with recent worsening strongly suggests this potentially dangerous infection requiring prompt treatment.  2. Diagnosis: Preseptal Cellulitis Justification: Presents with eyelid swelling and redness, less likely to cause systemic symptoms like vomiting, but remains a common differential for ocular swelling.  3. Diagnosis: Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma Justification: Can cause ocular pain, redness, nausea, and vomiting, especially in a susceptible patient; rapid onset with severe eye pain and nausea makes it a concern, though usually no systemic fever.  4. Diagnosis: Herpetic Keratitis (Herpes Simplex Virus) Justification: Can cause ocular pain, redness, tearing; may be associated with systemic symptoms if disseminated. Diagnosis depends on corneal involvement, but important to consider due to potential severe complications.  5. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Anterior or Intermediate) Justification: Causes ocular pain, redness, tearing, and may be associated with systemic symptoms; typically develops more gradually but can worsen rapidly in severe cases.  6. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Presents with severe ocular pain, redness, and potential systemic autoimmune associations; less common, but important differential.  7. Diagnosis: Retrobulbar (Orbital) Tumor or Mass Justification: Usually presents with proptosis or visual changes over a longer period; unlikely to cause acute systemic symptoms but considered for atypical presentations.  8. Diagnosis: Trauma-related Orbital Hemorrhage or Injury Justification: Could cause swelling, pain, redness, but no history of trauma provided; less likely in current scenario.  9. Diagnosis: Meningitis with Orbital Extension Justification: Systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting could suggest meningitis, but ocular findings are typically different, though orbital extension could cause ocular symptoms.  10. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Vasculitis (e.g., Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) Justification: Can cause ocular inflammation and systemic symptoms, but less likely acutely worsening within a week without prior autoimmune history.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and uncertain phrases (\"I think,\" \"not really sure\"), reflecting difficulty recalling specific details; emotional descriptors like \"really sick\" indicate distress but lack precise clinical detail. - Information flow: Her responses are somewhat scattered and hesitant, volunteering information only after prompting, suggesting internal disorganization or discomfort in communicating specifics. - Response style: She tends to elaborate, possibly due to anxiety, but her descriptions are somewhat tangential and inconsistent, indicating difficulty in organizing her thoughts clearly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Indications are subtle but present; the use of uncertain language shows she might be reluctant to provide definitive details or may genuinely be unsure about the timeline. - Minimization behaviors: She does not overtly downplay symptoms but might be minimizing early onset details by expressing uncertainty (\"about a week ago,\" \"not really sure\"). - Amplification patterns: Her emotional language (\"really sick,\" \"all kind of mixed up\") suggests high distress which could amplify her perception of severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None strongly indicated; her tone seems more anxious than shameful. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear evidence with her statements about her timeline being \"all kind of mixed up,\" indicating genuine memory or timeline confusion. - Family influence: Not directly observed, but her emotional state may be influenced by concerns about her health and familial responsibilities.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Chronology confusion, due to her admitted difficulty in reconstructing the timeline. - Severity: Moderate, since her emotional distress and memory uncertainty compromise the precision of her history but her overall symptoms are still articulated sufficiently. - Areas most affected: Timing of symptom onset and progression, risking inaccurate clinical interpretation if relied solely on her account. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional distress and memory issues warrant corroborative questioning and objective data to refine clinical assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact onset dates, the sequence of symptom worsening, or detailed early symptom descriptions. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial mild symptoms or early discomfort may be underreported or forgotten. - Concerns probably amplified: Her distress may cause her to perceive the situation as more urgent or severe than the objective evidence suggests. - True timeline: Likely more gradual than perceived; her confusion suggests she might overestimate the rapidity or intensity of prior symptoms.  **In summary,** her responses reveal moderate confusion about details, emotional distress influencing her perception, and some tendency to elaborate or express uncertainty, which underscores the importance of clarifying questions and corroborating history with objective findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify what additional information is needed to clarify the patient's initial symptoms, progression, and current state.

This stage is about encouraging detailed, open-ended narratives that complement prior information. The goal is to build rapport, validate her experiences, and gently probe areas where her recall is uncertain. Focusing on her subjective experience with open questions will help her feel safe and more willing to share her story fully.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise onset and progression of symptoms, early symptoms, duration, and severity, as well as her perceptions of these, are unclear. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the timeline to differentiate acute vs. subacute processes and symptom evolution; explore the nature of her systemic symptoms for concern about infection or other systemic illnesses. - Patient factors: Her scattered, hesitant communication and emotional distress suggest she might need gentle guidance; her uncertainty requires open-ended questions to avoid leading or overwhelming her. - Interview phase goals: To gain a comprehensive, coherent timeline, understand her perception of illness severity, and collect details that may differentiate between conditions like orbital cellulitis, glaucoma, or other pathologies.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to allow her to describe her experience in her own words, especially regarding onset and progression. - Information target: When symptoms started, how they changed over time, and how she felt during different periods. - Communication approach: Phrase questions empathetically, emphasizing understanding her story without judgment or pressure, in light of her distress and confusion. - Expected value: Clarifies her perceived timeline and symptoms, helps distinguish early versus recent changes, and enhances the accuracy of history-taking for diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"Could you tell me more about when you first started noticing your eye symptoms and how they've changed since then?

    "input": "The patient presents with an acute onset of ocular discomfort and inflammation, characterized by redness, swelling, and tearing, which has progressively worsened over the past week. Symptoms initially appeared mild but increased in severity, with recent escalation in ocular pain and systemic signs including persistent fever and vomiting. The timeline suggests a gradual onset with recent rapid deterioration, though early symptoms may have been underestimated. Systemic symptoms are prominent currently, aligning with an inflammatory or infectious ocular process possibly related to a past sexually transmitted infection; further history and examination are needed to clarify infectious etiology. The patient's distress may influence the report, emphasizing the need for objective assessment and cautious interpretation of subjective severity.1. Diagnosis: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratouveitis Justification: The combination of ocular redness, swelling, tearing, ocular pain, and recent worsening aligns with herpetic keratouveitis, which can produce intense inflammation, sometimes with systemic symptoms if disseminated. The history of progression over a week and systemic signs could indicate herpetic infections, especially if a prior sexual history suggests risk factors. HSV is a common infectious cause of ocular inflammation with potential for rapid deterioration and severe pain.  2. Diagnosis: Bacterial Keratitis or Endophthalmitis Justification: The presence of significant ocular discomfort, redness, swelling, and worsening symptoms raises concern for bacterial infection, particularly if there is corneal involvement or hypopyon, which is common in bacterial keratitis. Recent systemic signs such as fever support an infectious etiology. Endophthalmitis must be considered given systemic signs and rapid worsening, although no specific mention of recent ocular trauma or surgery makes this slightly less likely.  3. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Scleritis causes deep ocular pain, redness, and swelling. It can be associated with systemic autoimmune conditions, and systemic symptoms like fever could accompany severe inflammation. However, the systemic signs and infectious considerations make this slightly less probable than infectious causes.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Anterior Uveitis Justification: Anterior uveitis presents with eye redness, pain, and tearing, which are consistent with initial symptoms. However, the progression and systemic signs suggest that an infectious or more severe inflammatory process is more likely, placing uveitis lower in probability but still relevant.  5. Diagnosis: Gonococcal Conjunctivitis Justification: Gonococcal infection can cause hyperacute conjunctivitis with significant purulent discharge, pain, and systemic symptoms if disseminated. The mention of past STI history raises concern, but the gradual progression over a week and systemic symptoms favor other diagnoses. This remains a possible differential given sexual history.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient shifts from vague, minimization language (\"just some discomfort\") to intense emotional expressions (\"really sick,\" \"so heavy\"), indicating fluctuating emotional impact and possible defensiveness or difficulty with precise reporting. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat organized but contain hedging and uncertainty, with reluctance to specify timelines clearly, reflecting confusion or hesitance. - Response style: Elaborate and emotive, with detailed narration but inconsistent certainty, suggesting an attempt to justify or explain distress amidst uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation and uncertainty about when symptoms began suggest under-informed reporting or concealment of early mild symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Describing early pain as \"not too bad\" and \"just some discomfort,\" likely to downplay initial severity. - Amplification patterns: Exaggeration in current description (\"really sick,\" \"so heavy\") possibly driven by emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight reluctance to discuss past infections, indicating discomfort with sexual health topics. - Confusion/memory issues: Explicit statements of uncertainty and mixed-up timelines demonstrate cognitive fuzziness regarding symptom progression. - Family influence: No explicit evidence, but concern over past infections and current anxiety could reflect external influences or worries.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Timeline/confusion bias, with significant uncertainty about symptom onset and progression. - Severity: Moderate, as clarity is notably affected but patient provides consistent overall themes of distress. - Areas most affected: Accurate reconstruction of early symptom severity and timing, critical for diagnosis. - Reliability: Moderate; current distress is real, but timeline details are compromised by confusion.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise onset and initial severity of symptoms; early mild symptoms may be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Initial discomfort and gradual progression; the patient may understate early signs. - Concerns probably amplified: Current pain, nausea, and fever are emphasized, possibly overstated due to anxiety. - True timeline: Likely started subtly and progressed over days; current confusion obscures exact chronology, but early symptoms were probably more persistent than the patient suggests.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Clinical reasoning: There are still gaps regarding the exact onset, nature, and course of the eye symptoms, as well as associated systemic findings and prior episodes. It\u2019s essential to clarify the timeline more precisely, especially whether symptoms were truly gradual or had a sudden flare. The patient's communication style suggests some uncertainty, so targeted questions are necessary to parse out these details. - Diagnostic priorities: Given concern for infectious processes like herpetic keratouveitis or bacterial keratitis, I need more specifics on the onset, nature of pain, visual changes, and systemic symptoms.

    "input": "The patient presents with a progression of ocular symptoms characterized by redness, discomfort, and swelling that began approximately one to two weeks ago, with initial symptoms likely more noticeable than reported. Over the past several days, ocular discomfort has worsened, and within the last 24 hours, systemic symptoms including persistent fever and vomiting have emerged. The current presentation suggests a likely infectious or inflammatory ocular process with systemic involvement. However, the patient's communication is influenced by emotional distress and recalling difficulties, which may lead to underestimation of early symptoms and overemphasis on present severity. Further objective assessment and detailed history are necessary to determine the precise timeline, etiology, and severity of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Orbital Cellulitis Justification: The combination of ocular redness, swelling, discomfort, and recent progression, coupled with systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting, strongly suggests orbital cellulitis. The subacute timeline (1-2 weeks) and worsening symptoms indicate an infectious process involving the orbit, possibly originating from sinusitis. This diagnosis explains both ocular signs and systemic illness, necessitating urgent intervention.  2. Diagnosis: Preseptal (Periorbital) Cellulitis Justification: Although similar in presentation to orbital cellulitis, preseptal cellulitis typically lacks systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting, and the eye movement and vision are usually spared. Nonetheless, given the worsening systemic signs and progression, this remains a differential, especially if orbital involvement is not fully evident.  3. Diagnosis: Infectious Conjunctivitis with Secondary Inflammation Justification: Conjunctivitis can cause ocular redness and discomfort; however, it rarely causes swelling or systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting, especially in this progression. The systemic features suggest a more invasive infectious process, making conjunctivitis alone less likely but still possible as part of a broader infectious process.  4. Diagnosis: Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (Immunologic/Inflammatory) Justification: This involves painful ophthalmoplegia due to granulomatous inflammation in the cavernous sinus. However, it is less likely given the systemic symptoms and progression over weeks, and no mention of cranial nerve deficits or ophthalmoplegia are noted.  5. Diagnosis: Meningitis with Ocular Manifestation Justification: Systemic symptoms with ocular involvement could suggest meningitis or meningeal irritation affecting the orbit or causing secondary ocular signs. Nonetheless, absence of neurological findings like neck stiffness or altered mental status, and the localized orbital signs, reduce likelihood compared to primary orbital infection.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient exhibits a mix of vague and emotional language\u2014downplaying early symptoms (\"just some discomfort\") while amplifying current distress (\"really bad,\" \"so severe\"). Her responses contain hedging and uncertainty, indicating hesitance and discomfort discussing details. - Information flow: She offers limited initial details and tends to clarify or expand only when prompted, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose or difficulty recalling specifics. Responses are somewhat scattered and inconsistent, especially regarding timelines. - Response style: Her responses are somewhat minimal and hesitantly phrased, with frequent qualifiers (\"maybe,\" \"I guess\"). She shows signs of emotional overwhelm, affecting her ability to provide organized or detailed descriptions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance to specify exact timing, episodes, or progression points indicates she might be withholding or unsure about details, possibly to avoid revealing uncertainty or minimize her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Describing her symptoms with mild terms (\"not too bad,\" \"just discomfort\") despite expressing high distress suggests she may be minimizing the true extent or severity. - Amplification patterns: Use of emotionally charged, exaggerated descriptions (\"so severe I can\u2019t ignore it,\" \"terrible pain\") may reflect her heightened emotional state rather than objective severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her hedging and vague descriptions could hint at internal discomfort about discussing her symptoms fully. - Confusion/memory issues: Evident through inconsistent timelines, uncertain onset, and overlapping symptom descriptions, reflecting possible cognitive or emotional interference. - Family influence: No direct evidence; responses are centered on her perceptions and feelings.

Her emotional distress and response inconsistency suggest some degree of unreliability, but her core concerns are likely genuine.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise chronology of symptom onset, early minor symptoms, and full extent of initial discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early or less severe symptoms may be underreported, as she describes them as minor yet reports severe distress now. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current fear and emotional distress may exaggerate her perception of severity, leading to heightened concern. - True timeline: Likely a gradual onset with symptoms worsening over time, but she hesitates and confuses dates, so actual chronological progression may differ from her report.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's overall presentation with ocular redness, swelling, and systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting suggests an infectious ocular process, highly concerning for orbital cellulitis. To further refine this diagnosis and distinguish it from preseptal cellulitis or other inflammatory causes, I need to explore the details of symptom onset and progression more precisely. Since the patient has difficulty recalling exact timelines and uses vague or emotional language, I should frame my questions carefully, using targeted yet gentle follow-ups to clarify the sequence of symptoms, their severity over time, and associated systemic features.

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise chronology of symptom onset, early minor symptoms, and full extent of initial discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Early or less severe symptoms may be underreported, as she describes them as minor yet reports severe distress now. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current fear and emotional distress may exaggerate her perception of severity, leading to heightened concern. - True timeline: Likely a gradual onset with symptoms worsening over time, but she hesitates and confuses dates, so actual chronological progression may differ from her report.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with ocular redness and discomfort that began approximately 1 to 2 weeks ago, with initial symptoms likely being mild and intermittent. Over the past several days, her ocular symptoms have reportedly worsened, with increasing redness, swelling, and discomfort. Within the last 24 hours, she has experienced systemic symptoms including persistent fever and vomiting, which she reports as recent developments. Objective assessment is needed to confirm early ocular signs such as mild redness, tearing, or irritation that may have been previously unnoticed or underestimated. It is possible that mild early symptoms predated the current presentation, but her emotional distress may have affected her ability to accurately recall or report them. The timeline and severity of symptoms suggest a progressive ocular inflammatory or infectious process with new systemic manifestations. Further clinical evaluation is required to clarify the early ocular signs, confirm the acuity of systemic involvement, and assess for related complications.Orbital cellulitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague, uncertain language (\u201cmaybe about a week ago,\u201d \u201ckind of,\u201d \u201cnot really sure\u201d), suggesting difficulty with precise recall. Her emotional descriptors (\u201cterrible,\u201d \u201cso much worse\u201d) amplify her distress, influencing her perception of severity. - Information flow: She is quite forthcoming yet inconsistent, volunteering extensive descriptive details but with uncertainty, indicating a desire to be understood but difficulty with chronological accuracy. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative and emotionally charged, with a tendency to over-explain her experience, reflecting anxiety and distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No strong evidence; she appears open but uncertain about details. - Minimization behaviors: Downplays initial mild symptoms with phrases like \u201cnot too bad\u201d or \u201cjust some discomfort,\u201d which may obscure earlier, less severe signs. - Amplification patterns: Uses emotionally intense language (\u201cterrible,\u201d \u201creally bad,\u201d \u201cso much worse\u201d) that may exaggerate her current state, driven by anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None apparent. - Confusion/memory issues: Her uncertain timeline (\u201cmaybe about a week or two,\u201d \u201cnot really sure\u201d) indicates memory confusion likely influenced by stress. - Family influence: No evidence present.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Memory/confusion bias, influenced by acute anxiety and emotional distress, impairing precise recounting of symptom timelines. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her responses are somewhat inconsistent, but she provides meaningful symptom descriptions. - Most biased areas: Timeline and initial severity of symptoms, potentially affecting clinical interpretation of disease progression. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her self-report gives valuable insight but must be corroborated with clinical findings due to potential recall and emotional biases.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact timing and early nature of symptoms, possibly underreported initial mild discomfort. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her early symptoms may have been more subtle and less noticeable than she reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Her current level of distress and subjective severity is heightened by anxiety, possibly leading her to overestimate severity. - True timeline: Progressive worsening from mild discomfort, with initial symptoms possibly less severe than described, but stressful recall may distort the actual course.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The precise onset, progression, and initial mild symptoms of the eye issues, as well as the relationship between systemic signs and ocular symptoms are still somewhat uncertain. We need to clarify whether the initial ocular discomfort was truly mild and when systemic symptoms appeared relative to eye symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming features suggestive of orbital cellulitis or other orbital infections, such as the timeline of redness, swelling, pain, and systemic signs, is crucial. We need to rule out alternative causes like conjunctivitis or other inflammatory conditions. - Patient factors: The patient's uncertain recall and emotional distress suggest I should phrase questions in a gentle, clarifying way to help her articulate the timeline without inducing additional anxiety. - Interview phase goals: To confirm the progression of her symptoms, solidify the timeline, and identify any early signs she might have overlooked, so that diagnostic certainty can be achieved and appropriate management planned.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions to explore the timeline and severity of early symptoms, followed by more specific clarification. - Information target: Onset, mild symptoms, and systemic event timing; progression of ocular signs; previous similar episodes. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, empathetic language to help her feel supported in revealing details that she finds difficult to recall precisely. - Expected value: Clarifies the early course of illness, helping determine if her current presentation fits typical orbital cellulitis progression or suggests alternative diagnoses.\nANSWER: \u201cYou mentioned that the eye discomfort and redness started maybe about a week or two ago, but you're not totally sure about the exact timing. Can you tell me more about how it all began? For example, do you remember if the redness and irritation were mild at first and then gradually got worse? Also, when did you notice the systemic symptoms like fever and vomiting\u2014did they happen around the same time as your eye symptoms or a bit later? Sometimes, early signs can be subtle\u2014did you experience anything like a slight eye irritation or discomfort before it became more noticeable? Exploring these details can help us understand exactly how your symptoms developed.\"",
