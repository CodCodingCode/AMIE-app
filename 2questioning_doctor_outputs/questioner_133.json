    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with subjective visual disturbances including a black hole in the iris, double or ghost images, and sensitivity to bright lights, with a reported recent worsening over the past few weeks. While she genuinely perceives these symptoms as severe and worsening, her emotionally charged descriptions suggest that her perception may be amplified by anxiety. Objective evaluation is necessary to confirm the presence and extent of visual deficits, assess ocular health, and differentiate between psychological perception and clinical pathology. Further history about prior episodes, baseline visual function, and impact on her daily life will assist in forming an accurate clinical picture.1. Diagnosis: Anxiety-Related Visual Perception Disturbance Justification: The emotional charge and amplification of symptoms suggest a possible somatic or anxiety-driven perception issue, common in psychological conditions, especially considering the subjective nature of the complaints and recent worsening.  2. Diagnosis: Refractive Error or Astigmatism Justification: Symptoms like ghost images and light sensitivity are typical in refractive errors; common in adults, especially if uncorrected or newly developed.  3. Diagnosis: Dry Eye Disease Justification: Sensitivity to bright lights and subjective visual disturbances are common in dry eyes, especially if associated with ocular surface discomfort.  4. Diagnosis: Glaucoma or Elevated Intraocular Pressure Justification: The mention of a \"black hole\" in the iris could imply a visual field defect; glaucoma is common in adults and can cause visual field loss, though it usually progresses gradually.  5. Diagnosis: Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) with Floaters or Light Flashes Justification: Worsening visual disturbances like ghost images and floaters could suggest PVD, especially in adults over 40.  6. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis or Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Justification: Visual field defects, such as a \"black hole,\" can indicate optic nerve pathology; however, less common without systemic symptoms.  7. Diagnosis: Migraine Aura or Visual Migraines Justification: Transient visual disturbances like ghost images can be migraine-related, especially in women, with possible associated photophobia.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis or Intraocular Inflammation Justification: Bright light sensitivity and visual disturbances may suggest intraocular inflammation, but usually accompanied by ocular pain or redness.  9. Diagnosis: Neural or Visual Pathway Lesion (e.g., Occipital Lobe or Optic Radiations) Justification: Progressive visual deficits could be neurological but are less likely without neurological signs or more specific deficits.  10. Diagnosis: Psychiatric or Functional Visual Disorder Justification: Given the emotional tone and possible amplification of symptoms, a psychogenic component must be considered, especially if objective testing is inconclusive.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs emotionally charged and vivid descriptions (\"huge black hole,\" \"terrible,\" \"really scared\") indicating amplification of her distress. Her language alternates between specific symptoms and vague expressions (\"looks kind of like a keyhole\") that reveal uncertainty or hesitation. Her tone is urgent and anxious, emphasizing her emotional state. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with personal details and her fears, volunteering extensive information about her symptoms and background. Her responses are organized around her fears and symptom descriptions, but she occasionally veers into tangential details (family history), which suggest an emotional need for context and reassurance. - Response style: Her responses are elaborate, detailed, and emotionally expressive, with a tendency to share her worries rather than just facts. She shows signs of anxiety-driven storytelling, possibly to seek empathy or validation.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No strong evidence of withholding; she seems eager to share her fears and symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: There is minimal minimization; she emphasizes the severity and the rapid worsening of her symptoms, suggesting she does not downplay her concerns. - Amplification patterns: Clear evidence of amplification\u2014terms like \"really strange,\" \"huge black hole,\" \"terrible,\" and \"really scared\" suggest her fears may be magnified beyond clinical severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame, but some hesitation or vague language could indicate discomfort in discussing the full extent of her fears. - Confusion/memory issues: No overt signs of confusion; responses are consistent and coherent. - Family influence: Her mention of family history likely influences her anxiety, possibly inflating her perception of risk.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014she perceives her symptoms and risks as more severe due to her anxiety about losing her sight. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her detailed descriptions and high emotional distress suggest a notable amplification that could influence her perception of danger. - Areas most affected: Her symptom severity assessment and her outlook on prognosis are most biased, overemphasizing the danger. - Reliability: Her report on symptom progression appears credible but may be influenced by her heightened emotional state, leading to potential overestimation of severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Less distressing episodes or earlier, milder symptoms might be underreported or overshadowed by her current fears. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any adaptive responses or coping efforts are not discussed and could be underreported; also, her perception of rapid worsening might not match clinical reality. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of going blind and the urgency of her symptoms are likely overemphasized compared to objective clinical assessment. - True timeline: The reported rapid deterioration aligns with her emotional distress, but the actual progression might be more gradual; her focus on recent worsening could reflect heightened anxiety rather than purely clinical change.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has already described her main visual symptoms and expressed significant anxiety and emotional distress about the severity and progression. To help build rapport and better understand her experience, I should explore her understanding of her condition and its impact on her life, while also gently delving into her history and any prior episodes. Given her vivid descriptions, an open-ended question that invites elaboration and clarifies her main concerns would be ideal. This will also help gauge her perception, which is important in differentiating psychological from organic causes, and will make her feel heard and validated.\nANSWER: \"That sounds very distressing. Can you tell me more about what you\u2019ve noticed with your vision over time? For instance, when did you first start experiencing these changes, and how have they affected your daily life or how you\u2019re feeling about your health?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with subjective visual disturbances including a perceived black hole in the iris, double vision, and light sensitivity. She reports that these symptoms began a few weeks ago with a rapid worsening, though her descriptions are emotionally intense and may overrepresent their severity. Objective evaluation is necessary to confirm any anatomical or functional ocular pathology, as her fears of progression and blindness are significant but may not align with her actual clinical condition. Further assessment should include detailed ocular history, comprehensive eye examination, and diagnostic testing to clarify the underlying cause and extent of her visual symptoms.1. Diagnosis: Optic neuritis Justification: Rapid progression of visual symptoms with subjective visual disturbances and possibly double vision suggest optic nerve inflammation, especially in women of reproductive age; common and can cause visual field defects like black spots.  2. Diagnosis: Anterior uveitis (iritis) Justification: Light sensitivity (photophobia) and ocular discomfort are hallmark features; inflammatory origin frequently causes ocular redness, pain, and visual disturbances.  3. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura Justification: Visual disturbances such as black spots and double vision can occur as aura symptoms; onset over weeks and emotional intensity may support this diagnosis, especially if episodic.  4. Diagnosis: Uncorrected refractive error (e.g., astigmatism or keratoconus) Justification: Visual disturbances including perceived black spots and double vision could be related to high refractive errors; however, rapid progression is less characteristic.  5. Diagnosis: Cranial nerve VI (abducens) palsy Justification: Double vision can result from lateral rectus paralysis; rapid onset warrants evaluation of neurological causes.  6. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) Justification: MS commonly presents with optic neuritis and visual disturbances in young women; may cause neurologic symptoms like double vision.  7. Diagnosis: Ocular melanoma or other intraocular tumors Justification: A perceived black hole in the iris could suggest a pigmented mass; however, rapid progression over weeks is less typical.  8. Diagnosis: Acquired retinal or choroidal condition (e.g., choroidal neovascularization) Justification: Visual field defects such as black holes may relate to retinal pathology; unlikely to progress rapidly without known risk factors.  9. Diagnosis: Psychiatric or psychosomatic causes Justification: Emotional intensity and symptoms overrepresenting severity may point toward somatic symptom disorder or anxiety with visual complaints; less likely to cause rapid progression but important to consider.  10. Diagnosis: Intraocular foreign body or trauma-related injury Justification: Sudden visual changes may be related to trauma, especially if history supports external injury; lack of trauma history makes this less probable.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses emotional and somewhat vague language, with phrases like \"really strange\" and \"worse so fast,\" which heighten perceived severity. She avoids specific timelines, preferring general descriptors. - Information flow: Tends to share detailed personal and emotional context, sometimes elaborating beyond symptom specifics. Offers extra background about her family and stressors, which could add context but also diffuse focus from key clinical details. - Response style: Elaborates with emotional content, sometimes tangential, emphasizing fears and stress. Describes her experience vividly but with a tendency to gather emotional weight rather than clinical precision.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Possible hesitance in specifying precise timelines and severity details, which might obscure the true clinical picture. - Minimization behaviors: Downplays the suddenness (\"started a few weeks ago,\" \"just woke up\") and the severity (\"kind of looks,\" \"a little\"), perhaps to lessen perceived alarm. - Amplification patterns: Uses emotionally charged language (\"really scared,\" \"worse so fast,\" \"total different\") indicating heightened distress, which could skew her perception of the urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but reluctance to give exact historical details might suggest discomfort discussing her condition. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity in the timeline and details (\"a few weeks ago,\" \"suddenly\"), possible reflection of anxiety impacting clarity. - Family influence: Her mention of her mother's eye issues and surgeries suggests emotional impact and potential biasing of her perception towards expecting severe outcomes.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, as her language and behavior demonstrate a tendency to perceive and communicate her symptoms as more severe than might be objectively present, driven by fear and anxiety. - Severity: Moderate, because her emotional distress strongly influences her description and understanding, though her physical symptoms are real. - Areas most affected: Her evaluation of symptom severity, urgency, and prognosis. Her reported rapid worsening and fear of blindness are likely exaggerated by her emotional state. - Reliability: Moderate; her account is emotionally charged and contains some vagueness, which suggests caution in accepting her self-reporting as fully objective\u2014clinical assessment should clarify timelines and severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise details of onset, progression, and any prior ocular issues beyond family history; she may omit or forget subtle symptoms due to anxiety. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her attempt to downplay how suddenly symptoms worsened may conceal the severity of her condition. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of blindness and job loss are emotionally intensified and may not fully align with her clinical status. - True timeline: Actual progression may be more gradual and less alarming than perceived; her distress seems to magnify the urgency, so reassurance and objective evaluation are essential.",
    "output": "THINKING: - I recognize that the patient has shared some emotional and vague descriptions of her visual symptoms; she has mentioned a black hole in her iris, double vision, and light sensitivity, with a quick onset and worsening, but details are inconsistent. - To continue exploring, I need to understand her personal experience more deeply, focusing on her own perception of her symptoms, especially without leading her or suggesting particular diagnoses. - Since her language indicates distress and concern, I should phrase a question that encourages her to describe her experience in her own words, especially regarding how she perceives the progression and what it means to her emotionally and practically. - This will help me gauge the severity, her understanding, and her feelings about her condition, as well as gather more data to differentiate among potential causes. - Additionally, given her emotional presentation, it's important to validate her feelings while gently guiding her to elaborate on her experience.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Infectious conjunctivitis Justification: The rapid onset of redness, swelling, and tearing following physical activity suggests infectious conjunctivitis, possibly viral, especially in the context of recent activity which might have introduced pathogens or caused secondary irritation. Symptoms match common conjunctivitis features, and it is the most probable cause of bilateral conjunctival inflammation in this scenario.  2. Diagnosis: Foreign body or corneal abrasion Justification: Playing soccer increases risk for minor trauma or foreign body that can cause conjunctival irritation, redness, swelling, and tearing. The acute onset supports this, and such injuries can easily cause these symptoms without more severe signs like pain or visual changes yet.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Although less likely given recent activity, allergic conjunctivitis can cause redness and tearing, especially if the patient is prone to allergies, but the febrile, post-activity onset makes it less probable. It remains in the differential due to commonality.  4. Diagnosis: Traumatic injury (e.g., subconjunctival hemorrhage or soft tissue injury) Justification: Recent sports activity elevates suspicion for ocular trauma, such as subconjunctival hemorrhage or eyelid swelling, which can produce redness and swelling. The timing aligns, but without specific trauma evidence, it is less definitive.  5. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less likely given the brief timeline and lack of pain or vision changes; uveitis typically involves deeper ocular inflammation with pain and photophobia. Still considered due to initial eye symptoms but ranks lower.

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with visual disturbances described as a large black lesion in the iris and persistent double or ghost images, with symptoms reportedly worsening over several weeks. Although the patient perceives rapid progression and expresses significant concern about potential vision loss, these perceptions are likely influenced by underlying anxiety and catastrophizing tendencies. Objective examination and diagnostic testing are required to determine the actual ocular pathology, which could include iris or intraocular abnormalities, but the severity and urgency should be clarified through thorough assessment. Physical symptoms such as pain, photophobia, or discharge have not been reported and need further inquiry to guide the clinical evaluation.1. Diagnosis: Iris tumor (e.g., pigmented iris melanoma or benign pigmented nevus) Justification: The large black lesion in the iris strongly suggests a pigmented intraocular lesion; iris melanoma is a primary concern due to its pigmentation, growth potential, and vision impact. The progression over weeks aligns with tumor growth, and the persistent visual disturbances (double or ghost images) can be caused by intraocular mass effect or tumor-related distortion of ocular structures. Absence of pain or redness makes inflammatory causes less likely.  2. Diagnosis: Ciliary body or choroidal melanoma extending into the iris Justification: Although less common, a melanoma originating behind the iris can present as a black mass affecting the iris visibility and cause visual disturbances. Its progression and pigmentation are consistent. The worsening symptoms support a neoplastic process rather than benignity.  3. Diagnosis: Iris nevus Justification: A benign pigmented lesion of the iris that can appear as a black lesion; typically stable, but growth or change in size warrants concern. The visual disturbances are less common in isolated nevi but can occur if the lesion causes structural distortion or secondary effects.  4. Diagnosis: Intraocular hemorrhage or darkly pigmented lesion secondary to previous trauma or vascular abnormality Justification: Hemorrhagic or pigmented deposits can appear as black lesions; however, these usually have a sudden onset rather than progressive over weeks. No trauma or vascular symptoms are mentioned, making this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Intraocular cyst or benign pigmented lesion (e.g., pigmentary glaucoma changes) Justification: Less likely to present as a large black lesion; typically not producing the dramatic appearance described, but included for completeness, especially if pigmentation causes visual artifacts like ghost images.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged words like \"worried,\" \"scared,\" and \"freaks me out,\" coupled with vague descriptors like \"kind of\" and \"like,\" which suggest anxiety and uncertainty. Her descriptions often oscillate between specific symptoms and generalized fears. - Information flow: She tends to over-explain personal fears and family history preemptively, possibly seeking reassurance; her responses are somewhat scattered and include tangential info about stress and work, indicating emotional overlay affecting clarity. - Response style: Her replies are elaborate, laden with emotional content, and include tangential details. She shows a tendency to intensify concerns when describing worsening symptoms, which may reflect her heightened anxiety level.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; she generally discloses her main symptoms and fears openly, though she may omit subtle facts like prior mild symptoms or less alarming aspects. - Minimization behaviors: Absent; she emphasizes the seriousness rather than downplays symptoms. - Amplification patterns: Strong; she consistently emphasizes how bad her symptoms feel, the rapid worsening, and fears of blindness, which could be exaggerated due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; she's openly discussing her fears and symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight ambiguity about the timeline (\"a few weeks,\" \"lately,\" \"recently\") indicating some emotional distress impacting clarity but not significant memory errors. - Family influence: Clearly affects her narrative\u2014she references her mother\u2019s condition multiple times, which might intensify her perceptions of severity and likelihood.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be catastrophizing coupled with heightened health anxiety; her focus on worst-case scenarios likely distorts her perception of actual risk. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional distress is significant, and her exaggerated fears could impact her decision-making, though her reporting of symptoms is consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity and progression are most biased, as her emotional fears amplify her worry beyond clinical findings. - Reliability: Moderate to high\u2014she reports the symptoms clearly, but her emotional state biases her interpretation of the urgency and severity, warranting cautious but trusting clinical evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not disclose any prior mild ocular symptoms or aspects that could point to a less severe explanation; also, she might not have considered or communicated any alleviating factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her own subjective distress suggests she perceives her condition as worse than it may be; the actual progression could be slower or less severe. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about losing her vision and rapid deterioration are likely intensified by anxiety, possibly overestimating the immediacy and severity. - True timeline: Based on her report, symptoms have been progressively worsening over a few weeks, which aligns with her claims, though her emotional response inflates perceived threat.  Overall, her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety and worry, leading to potential overestimation of severity. Her honest disclosure is valuable, but clinical assessment must consider her emotional bias to accurately gauge the actual pathology.",
    "output": "THINKING: - The patient's description and emotional responses suggest heightened anxiety, which may influence her perception of symptom severity and progression. - She reports worsening visual disturbances over weeks, with significant worry about vision loss, indicating that understanding the precise features of her symptoms could help differentiate between neoplastic, inflammatory, or vascular causes. - Clarifying the nature of her double or ghost images\u2014specifically their timing relative to other changes, whether they are constant or intermittent\u2014would help determine if these are related to structural ocular changes or other processes. - Understanding any associated symptoms like pain, redness, or systemic signs is essential to rule out inflammatory or infectious causes. - Exploring triggers, factors that improve or worsen her symptoms, and her family history details will refine the differential. - Since her emotional state is prominent, questions should be empathetic and aimed at gently obtaining detailed information without increasing anxiety.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions for symptom characteristics, timeline details, and associated findings. - Information target: Specifics about her double/ghost images, progression pattern, whether symptoms are continuous or fluctuate, associated symptoms, and impact on daily activities. - Communication approach: Use gentle, open-ended prompts to encourage her to describe her experience, then narrow to specific details.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be catastrophizing coupled with heightened health anxiety; her focus on worst-case scenarios likely distorts her perception of actual risk. - Severity: Moderate; her emotional distress is significant, and her exaggerated fears could impact her decision-making, though her reporting of symptoms is consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity and progression are most biased, as her emotional fears amplify her worry beyond clinical findings. - Reliability: Moderate to high\u2014she reports the symptoms clearly, but her emotional state biases her interpretation of the urgency and severity, warranting cautious but trusting clinical evaluation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not disclose any prior mild ocular symptoms or aspects that could point to a less severe explanation; also, she might not have considered or communicated any alleviating factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her own subjective distress suggests she perceives her condition as worse than it may be; the actual progression could be slower or less severe. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about losing her vision and rapid deterioration are likely intensified by anxiety, possibly overestimating the immediacy and severity. - True timeline: Based on her report, symptoms have been progressively worsening over a few weeks, which aligns with her claims, though her emotional response inflates perceived threat.  Overall, her communication is heavily influenced by anxiety and worry, leading to potential overestimation of severity. Her honest disclosure is valuable, but clinical assessment must consider her emotional bias to accurately gauge the actual pathology.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with visual disturbances involving a perceived large black lesion in the iris and persistent ghost or double images. She reports that these symptoms began gradually over several weeks and have recently worsened significantly, leading to concerns about progressive vision loss or blindness. Her descriptions suggest intraocular or iris abnormalities, but her emotional distress and anxieties may have amplified her perception of symptom severity. Objective evaluation, including ophthalmologic examination and imaging, is necessary to determine the underlying cause and assess the extent of ocular impairment. It is important to explore symptoms comprehensively and validate her concerns while clarifying any additional signs or systemic associations.Iris melanoma ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague, emotionally charged language (\"kind of blurry and weird,\" \"pretty bad\") and some specific descriptors (\"huge black hole,\" \"ghost images\"). Her speech reveals anxiety-driven exaggeration, but also attempts to describe her symptoms carefully. - Information flow: She is quite forthcoming about her fears and experiences, often volunteering emotional context, but sometimes softens the severity with mild language, possibly to frame her symptoms as less alarming while still expressing worry. - Response style: She tends to elaborately describe her symptoms and feelings, especially under emotional distress. Her responses are somewhat scattered with intertwined descriptions of visual changes and emotional reactions, indicating a response pattern driven by anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The use of vague terms like \"kind of\" and \"sort of\" may reflect cautious withholding of the true extent of her symptoms or difficulty accepting their severity. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her symptoms' severity occasionally, possibly underestimating how much worse they are, to avoid overwhelming herself or due to emotional denial. - Amplification patterns: Her fears of going blind and statements emphasizing rapid deterioration suggest she overestimates the severity\u2014heightened by anxiety and emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not overt, but hesitance to detail family history or specific times may show underlying discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit evidence, but her narrative sometimes blends emotional state with factual description, indicating emotional overwhelm may impair clarity. - Family influence: Her references to her mother's ocular issues and thyroid problems appear to increase her anxiety and influence her perception, causing her to possibly over-identify with her family history.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias due to heightened anxiety about her health and potential loss of vision, coupled with mild minimization of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate, since her emotional distress markedly influences her perception and reporting, but she provides consistent thematic descriptions. - Areas most affected: Her assessment of symptom severity and her timeline are most biased, with potential overstatement of rapid deterioration and fear. - Reliability: Moderately reliable; her emotional state skews perception but does not seem to lead to outright fabrication or withholding critical diagnostic details.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact current level of visual acuity, pain, or discomfort; precise timeline details and specific ancillary health history (e.g., trauma, systemic symptoms). - Symptoms probably minimized: Actual extent of visual impairment (could be more severe or worse than described). - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of blindness and rapid progression; emotional distress may overstate severity. - True timeline: Likely, deterioration has been gradual with recent acceleration; her perception of rapid change is heightened by anxiety and distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: We need to clarify the current severity of her visual impairment, any associated symptoms like pain or discharge, specifics about the timeline, and her understanding of her condition. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm whether her symptoms meet the criteria for iris melanoma\u2014such as a pigmented iris lesion, growth, or associated intraocular changes\u2014and rule out other ocular pathologies like uveal melanoma, ocular hemorrhage, or inflammatory causes. - Patient factors: Given her anxiety and emotional distress, questions should be gentle, validating her worries while gently guiding toward precise symptom details without causing undue alarm. - Interview phase goals: To obtain definitive symptom characteristics, assess her concern level, confirm the timeline and progression, and prepare for an informed discussion about potential diagnoses and next steps.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions that explore details of her symptoms, their progression, and associated features. - Information target: Diagnostic criteria for iris melanoma, severity, timeline, associated ocular features, and understanding. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic, validating her distress but steering toward factual clarification. - Expected value: Will help confirm or refute the likelihood of melanoma, discriminate from other conditions, and determine disease severity for management planning.\nANSWER: \"You\u2019ve described seeing a large black spot in your iris and persistent ghost images that seem to be worsening. To help me understand better, can you tell me if your vision has become blurry or distorted in particular situations, and whether you've experienced any pain, redness, or sensitivity in your eye? Also, how quickly have these symptoms changed recently \u2014 do they seem to have gotten worse suddenly or gradually over time?\"",
