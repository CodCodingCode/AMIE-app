    "input": "An adult male patient presents with reports of exertional chest tightness and fatigue. The symptom descriptions are brief and suggest possible underreporting of severity. The patient expresses concern and worry but tends to minimize the extent of discomfort, indicating potential hidden severity or emotional distress. The clinical picture may include more significant cardiopulmonary issues, such as angina or arrhythmia, along with unrecognized emotional impact related to health concerns. Further detailed inquiry is needed to clarify symptom characteristics, emotional state, and timeline to accurately assess the underlying condition.1. Diagnosis: Stable Angina Pectoris Justification: Exertional chest tightness and fatigue are classic symptoms; common in middle-aged men with possible underlying coronary artery disease. The tendency to minimize symptoms is typical, and these symptoms are exertional, which raises concern for myocardial ischemia.  2. Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease (Asymptomatic or Unstable) Justification: Most likely underlying coronary pathology causing exertional symptoms; prevalent in adult men, especially with risk factors such as age, smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia.  3. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder (Panic or Generalized Anxiety) Justification: Worry and minimization of symptoms, along with reports of emotional distress, suggest that anxiety could contribute or mimic cardiac symptoms; common disorder with somatic complaints.  4. Diagnosis: Exercise-Induced Arrhythmia (e.g., Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy or other arrhythmias) Justification: Exertional symptoms may stem from arrhythmic events triggered during activity, especially if symptoms persist or worsen with exertion.  5. Diagnosis: Early Heart Failure (e.g., Diastolic Dysfunction) Justification: Fatigue and exertional chest tightness can be manifestations of developing heart failure, especially in middle-aged males, though less likely with isolated chest tightness.  6. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Justification: Exertional fatigue and chest tightness can be signs, especially in the context of unrecognized cardiac or pulmonary issues.  7. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain Justification: Sometimes exertional chest pain can be of musculoskeletal origin, but less likely given the fatigue and concern about severity.  8. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Causes (e.g., GERD) Justification: Can mimic anginal chest tightness; less likely given the exertional context but needs consideration.  9. Diagnosis: Structural Cardiac Abnormalities (e.g., Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy) Justification: Exercise-related symptoms could be due to structural issues impairing cardiac output; less common but relevant in symptomatic adults.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism (Less likely, but critical to exclude) Justification: Usually presents with acute symptoms, but exertional chest discomfort with fatigue could be an atypical presentation, though less probable without dyspnea or sudden onset.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam's language is vague and minimalistic, using words like \"not really pain\" and \"just tired,\" indicating minimization and possibly an effort to downplay severity. His emotional vocabulary suggests underlying anxiety but is not overtly expressed, as he seems hesitant with complex diagnostics or emotional detail. - Information flow: He provides core symptoms but withholds elaboration unless prompted, displaying some reluctance; responses are organized around straightforward questions but lack depth, showing a tendency toward guarded disclosure. - Response style: Responses are mostly direct but concise, perhaps cautious, reflecting discomfort or worry about revealing the full extent of his symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Liam\u2019s minimal elaboration (\"not really pain\") and focus on general tiredness suggest he may be concealing more severe or embarrassing symptoms like significant chest pain or psychological distress. - Minimization behaviors: Understatement of symptoms\u2014calling fatigue \"really tired\" and describing chest tightness as \"kind of\" heavy pressure\u2014may hide their true severity. - Amplification patterns: Evidence of anxiety-driven exaggeration is present in his concern regarding worsening symptoms, but he doesn\u2019t overtly overstate symptoms; rather, he underreports. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Little clear evidence, though his hesitant tone and brief responses may indicate some discomfort about fully expressing fears or the extent of his symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent confusion; his timeline seems consistent, though his vagueness could stem from uncertainty about the significance of symptoms. - Family influence: The influence is evident as he reports his mother prompted the visit, which may make him cautious in sharing negatives or challenging health perceptions.

    "input": "A middle-aged male patient presents with complaints of exertional fatigue and chest tightness, which he reports began approximately two weeks prior and have been gradually worsening. He describes feeling more tired and short of breath during daily activities over this period. His communication is cautious and somewhat vague, suggesting he may be underestimating or withholding the full severity of his symptoms. He does not report or mention other associated symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, or nocturnal discomfort, although these could be present but unarticulated. The clinical picture likely involves more significant exertional cardiopulmonary compromise than indicated, necessitating further comprehensive evaluation to assess the true symptom burden and underlying pathology.1. Diagnosis: Ischemic Heart Disease (Stable Angina) Justification: Exertional chest tightness and fatigue are classic symptoms of myocardial ischemia, especially with gradual onset over two weeks, suggesting chronic exertional angina in a middle-aged patient.  2. Diagnosis: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) Justification: Progressive exertional fatigue and dyspnea are consistent with early heart failure symptoms, particularly in middle-aged men with potential diastolic dysfunction.  3. Diagnosis: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Justification: Could cause exertional symptoms with preserved systolic function; though less common at age middle age without precipitating factors, it remains a possibility.  4. Diagnosis: Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction Justification: Causes ischemic-like symptoms without large vessel disease, consistent with exertional symptoms in middle-aged patients.  5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Justification: Gradual exertional dyspnea and chest tightness may result from increased pulmonary pressures affecting cardiac output during exertion.  6. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity can cause exertional fatigue and dyspnea; symptoms often develop gradually.  7. Diagnosis: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Justification: Although no mention of smoking history or cough, exertional symptoms can be early presentations, especially in middle-aged patients.  8. Diagnosis: Aortic Stenosis Justification: Can cause exertional chest tightness and fatigue, though less likely without a history of syncope or known murmur.  9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: Can present with vague chest tightness and fatigue, but less likely as primary cause given reported gradual progression and lack of associated psychological features.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism (Chronic or Subacute) Justification: Usually presents acutely, but subacute cases can cause exertional dyspnea; less likely given insidious onset over two weeks without risk factors or other symptoms.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Liam uses tentative language (\"maybe,\" \"I guess\") indicating some reluctance to fully disclose details or fear of alarming the provider. His tone appears cautious, possibly aiming to appear less distressed. - Information flow: Responses are succinct and guarded, primarily reactive to direct questions. There is limited elaboration, suggesting a tendency to withhold or minimize information unless specifically prompted. - Response style: He provides brief, somewhat evasive answers, likely influenced by discomfort or fear that full disclosure could lead to more concern or intervention.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of hedging (\"maybe two weeks ago,\" \"I guess\") and brief responses suggest Liam may be holding back details or downplaying certain aspects. - Minimization behaviors: Language minimizes the severity of symptoms, perhaps to avoid alarming himself or the clinician. He does not explicitly state how limiting his activities are but hints at it through cautious responses. - Amplification patterns: Less apparent; he genuinely seems concerned but does not overstate symptoms, indicating relatively accurate perception rather than over-worrying. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Minimal; his straightforward tone and attempt at honesty suggest no significant shame, though some mild hesitation hints at discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about timing (\"maybe two weeks ago\") shows minor ambiguity, but no major memory issues. - Family influence: His reporting that his mother prompted the visit implies parental influence; he may be conforming to expected responses or underestimating symptoms to appear manageable.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate underreporting/minimization bias influenced by anxiety and a desire to avoid causing concern. - Severity: Moderate bias; his cautious language and limited elaboration suggest some underestimation of symptom severity but not complete denial. - Areas most affected: The description of symptom intensity and impact, which are likely understated. - Reliability: Moderate; responses are somewhat guarded, so their accuracy could be improved with trusting rapport and reassurance.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent of fatigue, exertional limitation, and emotional impact; Liam might be holding back how debilitating his symptoms truly are. - Symptoms probably minimized: The severity of his fatigue and breathlessness, which may be worse than he reports. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety levels are evident, but his expressions of worry are genuine; however, he may be more anxious than he admits. - True timeline: Symptoms may have begun earlier or progressed faster; hesitancy suggests the timeline could be less precise and potentially more concerning than reported.",

    "input": "A middle-aged male presents with a two-week history of increasing fatigue and exertional shortness of breath, which he reports have progressively worsened. He describes symptoms primarily during physical activity, with no mention of chest pain at rest, dizziness, fainting, or nocturnal disturbance. Due to guarded and vague communication, the true severity of his exertional limitations and potential associated symptoms may be underestimated; objective assessment should consider that his physical capacity could be more impaired and that additional symptoms such as chest discomfort, fainting episodes, or signs of heart failure may be present but unspoken. Further detailed inquiry and investigation are necessary to clarify the extent of his cardiopulmonary status.1. Diagnosis: Heart failure Justification: The progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue over two weeks strongly suggest cardiac decompensation, possibly due to systolic or diastolic dysfunction, consistent with heart failure. The absence of chest pain does not exclude heart failure, which can present with nonspecific symptoms. The pattern of worsening with exertion aligns with impaired cardiac output during increased demand.  2. Diagnosis: Ischemic heart disease Justification: Given the patient's age and the symptom pattern, underlying coronary artery disease causing myocardial ischemia or early infarction is probable. This could manifest subtly with increasing fatigue and dyspnea. Even without classic angina at rest, ischemia during exertion is common, making this a high-probability diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary embolism Justification: Pulmonary hypertension leads to right-sided strain and exertional dyspnea, especially if progressing. Pulmonary embolism, though more abrupt, can sometimes present with subacute symptoms as clot burden increases or with unresolved embolic events. Both explain exertional shortness of breath without chest pain and can worsen over time.  4. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Anemia causes decreased oxygen delivery, leading to fatigue and exertional dyspnea. It often develops insidiously and could be secondary to chronic disease or nutritional deficiency, fitting within the symptom spectrum, especially if mild to moderate.  5. Diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Justification: COPD or other chronic lung diseases can cause exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Although no specific respiratory symptoms are detailed, such as cough or sputum, it's still relevant given age and presentation. COPD should be considered as a less likely but possible cause, especially if underlying lung disease exists.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Uses vague and hedging language (\u201ckind of tight,\u201d \u201cmaybe two weeks\u201d), indicating hesitance or attempt to minimize discomfort. Emotional expressions (\u201cI\u2019m kind of scared\u201d) reveal anxiety overlay. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat guarded and minimal, with Liam providing just enough info to indicate worsening symptoms but not full detail. His responses are organized but lack depth\u2014likely to avoid revealing too much. - Response style: Tends to be concise and slightly scattered, showing discomfort and anxiety\u2014restless shifting and brief answers.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitation when describing chest tightness and fatigue; appears to shy away from emphasizing severity. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying pain (\u201cnot really pain\u201d), possibly to avoid seeming overdramatic or to appear brave. - Amplification patterns: Repeats concerns about worsening and \u201creally tired,\u201d possibly driven by anxiety\u2014may overstate in emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt expressions; but vague language suggests discomfort discussing symptoms perceived as serious. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; the timeline is consistent. - Family influence: The mention of his mother\u2019s prompting indicates external influence shaping his decision to seek care.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate response bias involving underreporting of specific symptoms (minimization) and overemphasis on distress (anxiety amplification). - Severity: Moderate, as he provides some accurate data but also filters or adjusts descriptions due to emotional state and self-protective tendencies. - Most biased areas: Subjective symptoms like chest tightness and fatigue\u2014likely underreported in severity; anxiety is likely overrepresented. - Reliability: Self-report is somewhat compromised by emotional factors; clinical examination and objective testing are necessary to gauge true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact detail about frequency, duration, and severity of episodes; possibly missing signs of more severe deterioration such as fainting, cyanosis, or syncope. - Symptoms probably minimized: The intensity of fatigue and discomfort; physical features like hypoxia or exertional impairment may be worse than described. - Concerns probably amplified: His anxiety about health, perceiving symptoms as \u201creally bad,\u201d may distort true risk. - True timeline: Symptoms likely worsened over two weeks but may have progressed more rapidly or with additional symptoms he is not fully articulating.  In summary, Liam\u2019s communication exhibits signs of anxiety-driven exaggeration coupled with mild minimization of physical symptoms, affecting the clarity and accuracy of self-report.

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged male presenting with a two-week history of progressively worsening exertional fatigue and shortness of breath, characterized by episodes that can occur suddenly during physical activity such as walking or talking. He reports sensations of tightness and heaviness in the chest, along with dizziness particularly upon standing quickly. While he does not spontaneously mention resting chest pain, nocturnal symptoms, or fainting, his guarded communication pattern suggests these may be underreported. His current symptoms indicate potential underlying cardiopulmonary pathology requiring further detailed inquiry and investigation to assess severity and associated features accurately.1. Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease (Stable Angina) Justification: The exertional chest tightness and heaviness that worsen over two weeks, particularly with exertion like walking or talking, strongly suggest exertional angina due to ischemic heart disease. Dizziness could be secondary to decreased cerebral perfusion during exertion or hypotension. Absence of spontaneous resting chest pain does not exclude ischemia, especially if symptoms are precipitated by activity.  2. Diagnosis: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) Justification: Progressive exertional fatigue and shortness of breath can indicate early heart failure, especially in middle-aged males with risk factors. The sensation of chest tightness and heaviness might reflect increased filling pressures, with episodes during exertion and positional dizziness suggesting additional autonomic components or volume overload.  3. Diagnosis: Aortic stenosis Justification: Chest tightness, heaviness, exertional symptoms, and dyspnea are characteristic of aortic stenosis, which causes increased cardiac afterload. Dizziness upon standing may relate to compromised cardiac output. Although no murmurs are documented yet, this remains a possibility given symptoms and the pattern.  4. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension Justification: Progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue, especially with episodes during walking/talking, can occur due to elevated pulmonary pressures. This condition can cause right heart strain, exertional symptoms, and possibly orthostatic symptoms if right heart failure develops.  5. Diagnosis: Anemia Justification: Fatigue and exertional shortness of breath are classic signs of anemia, which reduces oxygen delivery during activity. While not directly evidenced yet, this remains in the differential, particularly given the gradual symptom worsening and lack of other clear explanations.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use emotive and somewhat vague descriptors (\"really tired,\" \"kind of,\" \"like a heavy pressure\"), leaning towards amplifying distress but with hesitations that suggest some minimization. - Information flow: Responds cautiously, often waiting for prompts, and offers basic descriptions instead of detailed or spontaneous elaboration, indicating a guarded approach. - Response style: Responses are concise with qualifiers, possibly to control the amount of perceived severity conveyed; exhibits clues of nervousness in pacing and breathing.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited spontaneous detail, hedging language, and reluctance to fully elaborate on symptom patterns suggest some withholding or minimization, perhaps due to uncertainty or fear. - Minimization behaviors: Use of vague descriptors (\"kind of,\" \"like\") when describing chest tightness or heaviness indicates self-protection against overstatement. - Amplification patterns: Phrases like \"really tired all the time\" and \"gasping for air\" may be exaggerated to communicate urgency but could also be influenced by anxiety-driven amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous pacing and occasional hesitance imply discomfort in discussing symptoms openly, potentially to avoid seeming overly fragile. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are internally consistent, so no clear evidence of confusion. - Family influence: Mentions of parental encouragement, but responses do not show overt parental influence shaping answers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias\u2014aiming to vividly portray symptoms to alarm the clinician; also some minimization via tentative language. - Severity: Moderate\u2014the patient\u2019s expressions oscillate between genuine distress and possible embellishment, impacting objectivity. - Areas most affected: Degree of symptom severity and urgency; timeline consistency remains, but the emotional overlay influences perception. - Reliability: Self-reports should be interpreted with caution; combining with clinical examination and possibly objective tests is critical for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might be underreporting less alarming aspects, such as symptom variability, or overemphasizing critical episodes to gain reassurance. - Symptoms probably minimized: Enjoyment of daily activities or fluctuation details are absent, possibly understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety appears to heighten perceived severity and immediacy, potentially causing overestimation of danger. - True timeline: Likely correlates with observed progression, but dramatization may inflate perceived severity; straightforward symptom development is probably similar, with emotional distress coloring perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We still need clarity on the specific characteristics of the chest sensations\u2014are they truly anginal, or could they stem from other causes? Details on their exact timing, quality, and triggers would help. Also, understanding whether episodes occur at rest or only with exertion can differentiate ischemic from other causes. - Diagnostic priorities: Distinguishing angina from other causes of exertional chest tightness (like heart failure, valvular disease, or pulmonary hypertension) requires precise symptom characterization. Clarifying associated symptoms like syncope, orthopnea, or swelling is important. - Patient factors: The patient appears hesitant and somewhat guarded, so questions should be phrased carefully to encourage openness without making him feel judged or pressured. - Interview phase goals: Aim to detail the nature of chest sensations, note any associated symptoms, and clarify their relationship to activity, along with any positional changes or relief patterns.

BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited spontaneous detail, hedging language, and reluctance to fully elaborate on symptom patterns suggest some withholding or minimization, perhaps due to uncertainty or fear. - Minimization behaviors: Use of vague descriptors (\"kind of,\" \"like\") when describing chest tightness or heaviness indicates self-protection against overstatement. - Amplification patterns: Phrases like \"really tired all the time\" and \"gasping for air\" may be exaggerated to communicate urgency but could also be influenced by anxiety-driven amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous pacing and occasional hesitance imply discomfort in discussing symptoms openly, potentially to avoid seeming overly fragile. - Confusion/memory issues: Responses are internally consistent, so no clear evidence of confusion. - Family influence: Mentions of parental encouragement, but responses do not show overt parental influence shaping answers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Amplification bias\u2014aiming to vividly portray symptoms to alarm the clinician; also some minimization via tentative language. - Severity: Moderate\u2014the patient\u2019s expressions oscillate between genuine distress and possible embellishment, impacting objectivity. - Areas most affected: Degree of symptom severity and urgency; timeline consistency remains, but the emotional overlay influences perception. - Reliability: Self-reports should be interpreted with caution; combining with clinical examination and possibly objective tests is critical for accurate assessment.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient might be underreporting less alarming aspects, such as symptom variability, or overemphasizing critical episodes to gain reassurance. - Symptoms probably minimized: Enjoyment of daily activities or fluctuation details are absent, possibly understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety appears to heighten perceived severity and immediacy, potentially causing overestimation of danger. - True timeline: Likely correlates with observed progression, but dramatization may inflate perceived severity; straightforward symptom development is probably similar, with emotional distress coloring perception.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Uncomplicated viral conjunctivitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vagueness (\"kind of a tight squeeze,\" \"mostly notice\") and qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"really strong\") which suggest hesitancy and an effort to downplay severity. Emotional descriptors (\"scared,\" \"uncomfortable\") reveal underlying anxiety. - Information flow: Responses tend to be cautious and somewhat restrained, generally waiting for questions before elaborating. The patient does not volunteer extensive detail proactively, indicating a guarded approach. - Response style: The responses are moderate in elaboration\u2014neither minimal nor overly detailed\u2014and mostly straightforward, but contain hedging language that hints at discomfort or uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Use of non-specific descriptors and qualifiers reflects some reluctance to fully disclose the intensity of symptoms, likely due to discomfort or fear. - Minimization behaviors: Emphasizing that sensations are \"not really pain,\" and describing episodes as \"kind of\" or \"mostly\" during activity, points towards downplaying the actual severity. - Amplification patterns: Phrases like \"really strong\" suggest some concern amplification, possibly seeking reassurance or expressing emotional distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: The cautious approach and avoidance of precise symptom description may indicate embarrassment about appearing vulnerable or overly worried. - Confusion/memory issues: No evident confusion; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: Mention of parental prompting indicates some external influence, but responses are primarily patient-driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main communication bias is \"information withholding\" with elements of minimization, driven by discomfort, anxiety, or a desire to control the impression of severity. - Severity: Moderate, because the patient seems to intentionally or subconsciously understate symptoms, which could affect accurate assessment. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity and nature, especially the extent of breathlessness and chest tightness; responses may mask true urgency. - Reliability: The self-reporting is somewhat trustworthy but likely underestimates the real severity, necessitating cautious interpretation and possibly objective measurement or reassurance strategies.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The severity and frequency of symptoms (e.g., how often episodes occur, their exact intensity) and emotional impact are probably underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: The sensations of tightness and dizziness may be more intense, frequent, or disruptive than described. - Concerns probably amplified: The patient's anxiety and emotional distress may exaggerate perceived danger, which could influence responses. - True timeline: Symptom progression may be more rapid or severe than acknowledged, considering their cautious language and tendency to underplay.  This nuanced analysis suggests that although Liam provides consistent core information, he minimizes certain aspects of his symptoms, and emotional factors influence his communication, requiring careful clinical corroboration.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to ensure all diagnostic gaps are addressed. Given the patient's tendency to minimize symptoms and possible emotional distress, I need to confirm the key criteria for angina or other cardiac causes, particularly focusing on the characteristics and triggers of chest tightness and shortness of breath. It\u2019s important to assess the severity and frequency, as well as any associated symptoms like dizziness or sweating, which are critical for risk stratification. The patient's hesitant and guarded communication style suggests I should ask with sensitivity to elicit more honest information. My goal is to validate or refute cardiac etiology, explore any red flags, and gauge their understanding and emotional readiness for discussing diagnosis and management.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact nature, severity, and triggers of chest tightness, frequency of episodes, associated symptoms, and their impact. - Diagnostic priorities: Ruling in or out cardiac ischemia (angina), especially considering exertional symptoms, nature of chest sensations, and any associated signs. - Patient factors: Hesitancy and minimization necessitate gentle, open-ended probing to encourage honest disclosure without increasing anxiety. - Interview phase goals: Confirm diagnostic likelihood, clarify symptom patterns, identify red flags, and prepare for shared decision-making.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying, and confirmatory questions. - Information target: Details about chest tightness (duration, character, timing), severity, associated symptoms, and emotional impact. - Communication approach: Use collaborative language, framing questions to normalize the process and reassure. - Expected value: Clarifies diagnostic certainty, ensures no red flags are missed, and lays groundwork for treatment planning.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've described so far, I want to make sure I understand your chest tightness a bit better. Can you tell me exactly what the sensation feels like when you notice it\u2014does it come on suddenly, or does it build up gradually? And how long does it usually last? Also, do you notice if anything in particular tends to trigger or worsen it, like exertion, movement, or emotional stress? Lastly, are there times when it feels really strong or different from what you've described before?\"",
