    "input": "Patient is a likely adult female presenting with reports of palpitations characterized by rapid heartbeat, fluttering sensations, and dizziness beginning yesterday. She describes her symptoms with emotional intensity, suggesting possible anxiety amplification. Objective signs are not provided, but the symptoms are consistent with episodic arrhythmias. She may be minimizing or omitting associated symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting episodes. Her emotional state likely influences her perception of severity, and more detailed assessment is needed to determine the presence of additional symptoms, triggers, or underlying cardiac risk factors.1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Justification: Presents with rapid, regular palpitations and dizziness; common in young to middle-aged women; episodic with abrupt onset.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: Symptoms of rapid heartbeat, fluttering, dizziness, and emotional intensity can be linked to anxiety; frequent in women with emotional triggers.  3. Diagnosis: Sinus Tachycardia Justification: Elevated heart rate lasting a day could be sinus tachycardia due to stress, dehydration, or other benign causes; common in general population.  4. Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation (paroxysmal) Justification: Can present with sudden palpitations and dizziness; less likely given no mention of irregular rhythm or prior episodes, but still important to consider.  5. Diagnosis: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) with Reflex Tachycardia Justification: Can cause fluttering sensations and dizziness; often triggered by stress or caffeine; relatively common.  6. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Justification: Increases sympathetic activity causing palpitations and dizziness; should be considered in persistent symptoms, but less likely acutely.  7. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy) Justification: Less likely in absence of other findings but must be considered if symptoms persist or worsen; important \"can't miss.\"  8. Diagnosis: Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) Justification: Can precipitate arrhythmias; symptoms may include palpitations and dizziness, but no signs reported.  9. Diagnosis: Other less common arrhythmias (e.g., AV nodal reentrant tachycardia) Justification: Similar to SVT; less common but possible, especially in women.  10. Diagnosis: Subclavian or carotid artery issue causing neurovascular symptoms Justification: Unsupported by symptoms; less likely given presentation, included for completeness of approach.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged and vivid language (\"pounding out of my chest,\" \"fluttering,\" \"dizzy I think I might faint\"), indicating high anxiety and distress. Her descriptions are detailed but may be exaggerated due to her emotional state. - Information flow: She provides a cohesive and organized account, openly sharing her symptoms without hesitation, suggesting a willingness to communicate fully. - Response style: Her responses are focused, detailed, and slightly hurried, consistent with distress and urgency, showing she prioritizes getting help and reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence; she openly describes her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not observed; her language emphasizes severity rather than downplaying. - Amplification patterns: Possible slight exaggeration due to anxiety, e.g., \"I think I might faint,\" which is common with patient distress, but overall her report appears aligned with clinical symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; she appears quite open about her physical sensations. - Confusion/memory issues: No signs of confusion; her timeline is clear (\"started yesterday afternoon, worse today\"). - Family influence: Indications are minimal\u2014she lives alone but mentions her adult children live nearby without noting their influence on her report.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven exaggeration likely influences her perception of symptom severity, leading to amplification bias. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional state inflates the perceived severity somewhat, but her account is consistent with typical arrhythmia symptoms. - Areas most affected: Severity and urgency perception; she is likely to overemphasize the threat level of her condition. - Reliability: Fair but with caution; her emotional distress may exaggerate her subjective experience. Objective assessment needed to clarify the true severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully aware of the underlying cardiac process or risk factors, possibly overestimating danger. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less likely, as she emphasizes symptom severity; but she might underestimate the potential for ventricular involvement or other complications. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear (\"Is this something serious? Should I be worried about a heart attack?\") suggests heightened worry and possible misinterpretation of symptoms as life-threatening. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but her distressed state could cause her to perceive the episodes as worse than they are or to fear recurrence more than statistically justified.  Overall, her communication is direct but heavily tinged with anxiety, leading to potential overestimation of risk and severity, which should be accounted for in clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: In this early exploration phase, I want to gently invite the patient to share more about her experience with these episodes, especially focusing on what she notices about her body and what she thinks might be causing her symptoms. Understanding her perspective on triggers or pattern recognition will help me gauge whether her symptoms are related to cardiac, anxiety, or other causes. Given her vivid descriptions and emotional state, I should be open-ended yet attentive to her narrative to build rapport and gather rich detail without leading her.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise details on what precedes the episodes, if there are any associated activities or emotional states, and any prior similar episodes. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if there are specific triggers, associated symptoms, or patterns indicating arrhythmia or anxiety. - Patient factors: Her expressive, emotionally charged language suggests need for empathetic listening; I should encourage elaboration without dismissing her feelings. - Interview phase goals: Elicit a detailed symptom timeline, explore her own thoughts about the episodes and their impact, and start understanding her concerns and beliefs.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to allow her to describe her experience fully. - Information target: Explore onset, context, associated sensations, and her personal interpretation. - Communication approach: Use a gentle, curious tone, validating her feelings and emphasizing safety. - Expected value: Gain a comprehensive picture of her symptoms and perspective to guide subsequent focused questioning.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about what you noticed when these episodes started and how they have been unfolding since then? Specifically, what was happening right before you felt this way, and what do you think might be causing these sensations?\"",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (likely viral) Justification: Eye redness, tearing, and swelling are hallmark signs; recent activity and lack of systemic illness make viral conjunctivitis common and probable.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Acute onset after physical activity, possible minor trauma from playing soccer; would cause redness, tearing, and discomfort.  3. Diagnosis: subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden swelling and redness, especially after physical exertion or minor trauma, common in sports-related injuries.  4. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can be caused by inflammation of eyelid margins; often recurrent and chronic, but can flare acutely.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye swelling, tearing, and redness can occur in allergic responses; less likely given recent activity but still possible if the patient has allergies.  6. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Superficial ocular inflammation causing redness and swelling; typically not linked to trauma but possible.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Inflammation inside eye could produce redness and tearing; however, less likely without pain or photophobia, making it lower priority initially.  8. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Severe eye redness and swelling, often painful; unlikely given recent sports activity and absence of pain description.  9. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness could indicate infection spreading to orbital tissues; red flags include pain, proptosis, or vision changes, which are unmentioned here.  10. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Trauma during sport could introduce a foreign object, leading to redness, tearing, swelling; often accompanied by pain or sensation of foreign body, which isn't specified but remains relevant.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses specific, emotionally charged descriptions of her symptoms (\u201cpounding,\u201d \u201cfluttering,\u201d \u201creally frightening\u201d) which convey alarm but sometimes lack detail about duration or context. Her use of words like \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d indicates possible minimization or uncertainty. - Information flow: She readily shares her symptoms when asked but may withhold some details about triggers or past episodes unless prompted. Her responses tend to be immediate and emotionally driven, reflecting high distress. - Response style: Her responses are concise but emotionally intense; she emphasizes her fear and urgency, often repeating her distress to ensure her symptoms are understood.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her uncertainty about causes and limited detail about prior episodes suggest possible withholding of contextual information, perhaps to avoid worrying the clinician or due to shock. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her understanding (\u201cI don\u2019t really know exactly what caused it\u201d) and focuses on the worst aspects of her symptoms, possibly to avoid underestimating her condition\u2019s seriousness. - Amplification patterns: Her language reflects heightened concern (\u201creally frightening,\u201d \u201cmight pass out,\u201d \u201cfearful\u201d), likely to amplify perceived severity to secure urgent attention. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame; her anxiety appears genuine and unembarrassed. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight uncertainty about causes indicates modest confusion about triggers but no evidence of memory deficits. - Family influence: None evident; responses are internally consistent and self-focused.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification driven by anxiety, with some tendency to minimize her understanding or causes\u2014likely a coping mechanism. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given her high distress, vivid descriptions, and expressed fears. Her anxiety may be distorting the perceived urgency. - Areas most affected: Her portrayal of symptoms (intensity, emotional impact) is most biased, possibly inflating threat levels. - Reliability: Moderate; her physical sensations are likely real but the emotional overlay may exaggerate perceived severity, so her report should be interpreted with awareness of anxiety influence.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be disclosing all past similar episodes or triggers, and her understanding of rhythm abnormalities may be incomplete. She might minimize or overlook gradual changes leading up to the current crisis. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her report may understate the severity of underlying arrhythmia episodes if she is under emotional control or less distressed during calmer moments. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of life-threatening events appears exaggerated, likely driven by anxiety. - True timeline: The actual progression may have been more insidious than conveyed; her current distress could be amplified, while some earlier symptoms or periods of stability remain unreported.  In summary, her communication demonstrates emotional amplification driven by anxiety, with potential detail omission concerning triggers and history. Her focus on severe aspects might overstate immediate danger, requiring careful clinical assessment beyond her subjective report.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps include specifics about previous episodes, potential triggers, and her understanding of what might be causing her symptoms. Also, details about symptom duration, intensity, and any associated features like pain or vision changes are needed. - Diagnostic priorities involve differentiating among ocular conditions such as conjunctivitis, trauma-related injuries, or inflammation, and understanding if there's any underlying systemic or neurological concern. - Patient factors, such as her emotionally charged language and tendency to emphasize severity, suggest the need for gentle, open-ended questions that validate her distress while encouraging elaboration. - The interview phase is focused on developing rapport and gathering comprehensive, qualitative information about her experience without rushing to conclusions. - An open-ended question that would encourage her to describe her experience more fully, explore her understanding, and reveal details about the progression and context of her symptoms would be ideal.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: The rapid onset of redness, swelling, tearing following physical activity suggests infectious conjunctivitis, particularly bacterial, which commonly presents with purulent discharge and conjunctival injection. The recent playing activity could have facilitated exposure, and symptoms align with bacterial conjunctivitis.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Viral conjunctivitis is common and can also present with redness and tearing, often after exposure to infected individuals. The acute presentation fits, and it's common after social or sports activities. Lack of systemic symptoms makes this somewhat less likely than bacterial but still plausible.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or foreign body Justification: Recent soccer activity raises concern for minor trauma, such as corneal abrasion or a foreign body, leading to conjunctival redness, swelling, and tearing. These injuries often cause localized discomfort, but that detail isn't provided; nonetheless, trauma should be considered.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: While less likely given the context, allergic conjunctivitis can cause redness and tearing, especially if the patient has a history of allergies. However, absence of itchiness or known allergies makes this less probable in this scenario.  5. Diagnosis: Preseptal cellulitis Justification: The swelling and redness could be due to preseptal cellulitis, especially if the swelling is localized and occurred after activity, possibly due to minor trauma or infection spreading to the eyelid tissues. It remains less likely without systemic signs, but it is a consideration due to eyelid swelling.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She tends to use emotionally charged language, emphasizing severity, which may reflect her anxiety more than objective symptom intensity. She is specific about sensations but also uses subjective descriptors that could be exaggerated. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, eager to share, and provides detailed descriptions when prompted, possibly to seek reassurance. Her responses are organized around her feelings and fears. - Response style: Elaborate and emotionally driven, often expressing distress and urgency, sometimes interrupted by her own tremors or nervousness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No significant evidence; she shares comprehensive details, though her emotional expression suggests her focus is heavily on distress. - Minimization behaviors: Not apparent; she communicates her symptoms openly and vividly, likely overstating or amplifying her concern. - Amplification patterns: Clear\u2014she emphasizes how severe and immediate her symptoms feel, possibly responding to her anxiety rather than actual severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; no reluctance to discuss her symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Not observed; her statements are coherent. - Family influence: Indirectly suggested; her heightened concern might be influenced by family worries or her own anxious tendencies.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014her anxiety likely inflates her perception of symptom severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her anxiety significantly influences her report but doesn\u2019t distort facts entirely. - Areas most affected: Severity of symptoms, perceived danger, urgency\u2014she perceives her condition as more dire due to her emotional state. - Reliability: Fair albeit with emotional bias; her detailed report aligns with observable distress, but her appraisal of urgency may be overstated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not fully process or communicate her symptoms' nuances without reassurance; additional subtle symptoms could be overlooked. - Symptoms probably minimized: Not likely here\u2014she is actively emphasizing her distress. - Concerns probably amplified: Her panic and fear about the severity of her condition are probably overrepresented compared to clinical reality. - True timeline: Her timeline appears accurate, but her perception of symptom intensity and threat level is likely exaggerated by her anxiety.  # Short Answer",

    "input": "The patient is a female (age unspecified) presenting with a primary complaint of episodes characterized by a rapid, pounding heartbeat, fluttering sensations in the chest and neck, and associated shortness of breath. She reports these symptoms began yesterday and have worsened throughout the day, with concerns about passing out. Her communication indicates significant emotional distress and anxiety, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity. Objective clinical findings suggest episodes of palpitations and dyspnea, likely benign in origin, possibly related to anxiety or benign arrhythmias. There is no confirmed history of cardiac disease or prior evaluations; further investigation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and assess cardiovascular health.1. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) Justification: The sudden onset of rapid, pounding heartbeat and fluttering sensations, along with episodic nature and absence of preceding structural heart issues, are characteristic of PSVT. The patient's report of worsening symptoms suggests episodes of re-entrant tachycardia, often triggered by stress or anxiety, consistent with the clinical picture.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack Justification: The emotional distress and rapid heartbeat can be symptoms of anxiety. The episodes' sudden onset and concern about passing out may coincide with panic symptoms, especially considering the recent onset and absence of prior cardiac history. Anxiety can also induce sympathetic activation, mimicking arrhythmias.  3. Diagnosis: Sinus Tachycardia Justification: Elevated heart rate with palpitations and shortness of breath may be due to physiologic or stress-related sinus tachycardia. Although less specific, it remains on the differential, especially if episodes are short-lived or related to anxiety/stress.  4. Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation (paroxysmal) Justification: Although more common in older patients or those with structural heart disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can cause episodic palpitations and sensations of fluttering. The sudden onset nature aligns, but the description favors regular episodes like PSVT over irregular AF.  5. Diagnosis: Catecholamine-Induced Arrhythmia Justification: Stress or emotional distress can catalyze catecholamine release, precipitating arrhythmias. While less specific, it remains a consideration given the context of acute onset during emotional distress.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotional and vivid descriptors (\"really frightened,\" \"so scared,\" \"panic\") that indicate a high level of distress. While some descriptions are specific (e.g., \"pounding in my neck\"), her overall language emphasizes her fear and urgency. She occasionally uses vague qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"sort of\") but is generally direct about intensity. - Information flow: Her responses are organized but heavily influenced by her emotional state\u2014they tend to be elaborate, emotional, and sometimes overlapping. She openly shares fears and concerns, indicating a high willingness or perhaps compulsion to seek reassurance. - Response style: She elaborates extensively, with rapid, sometimes interrupted speech, often emphasizing her distress, which may reflect difficulty in managing anxiety or an urgent need for reassurance.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There's limited evidence of withholding; she seems eager to share her fears, but her focus on worst-case scenarios suggests she might withhold less catastrophic explanations\u2014possibly not explicitly but emotionally minimized her own severity. - Minimization behaviors: She appears to overstate the severity, not minimize; however, her frequent expression of doubt (\"I don't know\") may momentarily suggest some uncertainty or avoidance of medical interpretation. - Amplification patterns: Clear evidence\u2014her repeated emphasis on \"really scared,\" \"worst,\" \"pass out,\" and \"serious\" indicates amplification of her concerns, heightening perceived risk beyond clinical suspicion. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs of confusion; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: Not directly evident in her speech; responses are personal but may be influenced by familial concern indirectly.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014she exaggerates her symptoms' severity and danger due to high anxiety levels. - Severity: Moderate to severe; physiological signs support significant distress, and her focus on life-threatening outcomes could distort clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Perception of symptom severity and imminent danger; her emotional state influences her report. - Reliability: Moderate; her emotional amplification suggests her distress might inflate perceived severity. Objective signs should be corroborated clinically.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her baseline coping strategies or less severe episodes possibly unmentioned, as she might downplay occasional mild symptoms in favor of emphasizing worst-case scenarios. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any asymptomatic or less severe episodes; she may be over-reporting due to anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of a heart attack and overall severity; high emotionalization inflates threat perception. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent, but her emotional distress could be exaggerating her sense of escalation; actual clinical worsening may be less dramatic than perceived.",
    "output": "THINKING: Using systematic reasoning, I recognize the patient's vivid descriptions indicate high anxiety and distress, but I need to distinguish whether her symptoms are primarily cardiac (like PSVT or atrial fibrillation) or related to panic/anxiety. The specific sensations she reports\u2014pounding in the neck, sudden episodes, fear of passing out\u2014are key clues. I also want to clarify the pattern, triggers, and associated features to narrow the differential. She appears emotionally overwhelmed, which may influence her reporting, so I should ask questions that are focused yet gentle to avoid increasing her distress. The objective is to gather details about her episodes' characteristics, timing, and any symptoms that would support or oppose feared diagnoses.  QUESTION STRATEGY: A focused question targeting the specific qualities of her episodes\u2014timing, triggers, and physical sensations\u2014can help differentiate arrhythmic causes from anxiety. Asking about associated symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, or syncope will clarify severity. I also want to explore what if anything relieves or worsens her symptoms\u2014this can hint at anxiety vs. cardiac etiology. Since her speech indicates emotional upset, phrasing the question as an open-ended but specific prompt will help her describe her episodes without feeling judged.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned feeling really frightened and experiencing a pounding sensation in your neck and chest during these episodes. Can you tell me more about what happens just before and during these events\u2014do they come on suddenly or gradually? Are you able to identify anything that seems to trigger them, like stress or physical activity?

CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Her baseline coping strategies or less severe episodes possibly unmentioned, as she might downplay occasional mild symptoms in favor of emphasizing worst-case scenarios. - Symptoms probably minimized: Any asymptomatic or less severe episodes; she may be over-reporting due to anxiety. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of a heart attack and overall severity; high emotionalization inflates threat perception. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent, but her emotional distress could be exaggerating her sense of escalation; actual clinical worsening may be less dramatic than perceived.",

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with episodes of rapid, pounding heartbeats accompanied by sensations of fluttering in the chest and neck, as well as shortness of breath and dizziness. Symptoms began yesterday with progressive worsening throughout the day, and she reports feeling scared and concerned about a possible serious cardiac event. Communication patterns suggest a significant emotional component, with her describing symptoms in an emotionally intense way that may overstate their severity. Objective assessment and further testing are necessary to evaluate the underlying cause of these episodes, with awareness that her perception of danger might be heightened by anxiety.Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally intense, vivid language like \"pounding,\" \"super short of breath,\" and \"really scary,\" which heighten perceived severity; minimal technical or clinical terminology is used. - Information flow: They are forthcoming with symptom details, elaborating extensively to seek reassurance; responses are organized around expressing their fears, but sometimes spill over into emotional narration. - Response style: Generally elaborate with emotive focus, sometimes tangentially expressing fears rather than solely reproductive symptoms, indicating a strong emotional need.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None prominently evident; they volunteer detailed descriptions. - Minimization behaviors: Little evidence; instead, symptoms are likely exaggerated due to anxiety-driven amplification. - Amplification patterns: Clear overstatement of symptom severity\u2014\"really bad,\" \"super short of breath,\" \"scary,\" suggesting emotional exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No explicit signs, but underlying distress is evident. - Confusion/memory issues: Response coherence indicates no significant cognitive confusion. - Family influence: No direct evidence; their responses seem internally driven, with a focus on personal fear.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias, driven by acute anxiety about health; they tend to magnify symptoms and fears. - Severity: Moderate to severe; the heightened emotional state influences perception and description of symptoms significantly. - Areas most affected: Severity and danger perception; they overrate symptom seriousness and potential outcomes. - Reliability: Their self-report is emotionally reliable in expressing distress but may overstate threat levels due to bias, cautioning careful interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: They may not disclose less severe or asymptomatic episodes, or coping strategies that might mitigate anxiety. - Symptoms probably minimized: Some minor symptoms like occasional palpitations or brief episodes might be underreported or less emphasized. - Concerns probably amplified: Their fear of serious heart disease or attack appears exaggerated; their emotional state inflates perceived danger. - True timeline: Symptom escalation appears real but likely perceived as more rapid and severe than objectively, influenced by heightened anxiety and emotional bias.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify remaining diagnostic uncertainties about the patient's episodes, focusing on clarifying key features that differentiate cardiac arrhythmias like PSVT from other causes such as panic attacks or benign palpitations. The goal now is to confirm criteria specific to PSVT, such as rapid onset, duration, and associated features, while assessing how the patient perceives and copes with these episodes. Since communication appears emotionally intense, questions should be phrased collaboratively and gently to ensure accurate responses and address any anxiety about serious conditions. The objective is to gather enough definitive information to support diagnostic confidence and prepare for treatment discussion, considering her emotional state and understanding.  QUESTION STRATEGY: Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions on episode characteristics, onset, duration, associated symptoms. Information target: timing, triggers, symptom severity, impact, and perception. Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic, collaborative phrasing to reduce anxiety and encourage honest responses. Expected value: These questions will help confirm if episodes meet the criteria for PSVT (e.g., sudden onset, brief duration, associated racing heart) and differentiate from other causes, ultimately guiding the management plan.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared about these episodes coming on suddenly and feeling very intense, can you tell me exactly how quickly they start\u2014do they come on suddenly in just a few seconds or more gradually? And how long do they usually last\u2014are they brief, like a few seconds or minutes, or do they last longer? During these times, do you notice if your heart really feels like it's pounding or racing suddenly, and do you experience similar sensations in your neck or throat? Also, have you ever noticed that these episodes happen after any specific activities, or happen more often at certain times of the day? Understanding these details will help me very much in figuring out what might be causing these episodes.\"",
