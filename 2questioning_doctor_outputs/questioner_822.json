    "input": "A 68-year-old female reports swelling and soreness in her right leg. She describes mild redness but may be underestimating skin discoloration, warmth, or other signs of thrombosis. Her concern is heightened by anxiety, which may exaggerate perceived severity. Objective clinical signs have not yet been documented, so thorough physical examination focusing on skin color changes, warmth, temperature, and mobility is essential. Additional inquiry into personal or family history of clotting disorders and detailed symptom timeline is needed to accurately assess her condition.1. Diagnosis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Justification: Leg swelling and soreness in an elderly female with potential warmth or discoloration are classic signs of DVT; this is a common and potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt recognition. 2. Diagnosis: Superficial thrombophlebitis Justification: Redness and soreness along a superficial vein can cause localized inflammation; less risk than DVT but still relevant. 3. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Redness, warmth, and swelling suggest soft tissue infection; however, patient reports only mild redness, making this slightly less likely without systemic signs. 4. Diagnosis: Chronic venous insufficiency Justification: Swelling, especially in older females, can be due to venous valvular incompetence leading to edema; typically bilateral, but unilateral cases occur. 5. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Persistent swelling with minimal redness can suggest lymphatic obstruction; less likely as initial diagnosis but important in differential. 6. Diagnosis: Muscular strain or injury Justification: Soreness could be due to muscular causes; less likely if swelling predominates. 7. Diagnosis: Baker's cyst rupture Justification: Can cause swelling and soreness behind the knee, mimicking deep venous pathology; less common without further knee symptoms. 8. Diagnosis: Arterial insufficiency Justification: Usually presents with pain out of proportion, pallor, and pulselessness, but less likely with soreness only. 9. Diagnosis: Tumor or soft tissue neoplasm Justification: Rare but can cause swelling; unlikely as initial presentation without systemic or local growth signs. 10. Diagnosis: Hematoma or bleeding Justification: Typically occurs after trauma; no trauma history provided and less fitting in this context.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses clear but slightly emotionally charged language, emphasizing worry and symptom severity. She describes her symptoms factually but with an underlying tone of concern. - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming, volunteering key details proactively, but may avoid or minimize some background factors like clotting history. - Response style: Responses are direct and concise, with a focus on describing her immediate concern; she maintains cooperation but shows signs of underlying anxiety.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not mention her clotting risk factors unless asked, suggesting mild withholding of detailed personal or family history. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays skin discoloration as \"a little red,\" possibly underestimating clinical significance. - Amplification patterns: Her worry may cause her to focus on the worst possible outcomes, though she presents symptoms in a relatively controlled manner. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None evident; she appears comfortable providing information. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline is logical and consistent. - Family influence: She does not express particular concern over family history, indicating minimal influence in this response.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven symptom amplification, leading to heightened concern about the severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her anxiety influences her perception but does not distort the factual description of her symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her concern about seriousness and potential causes; her focus on worst-case scenarios. - Reliability: Fairly reliable; her symptom descriptions are accurate, though anxiety may influence her interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about her family history of clotting or mobility issues; her activity pattern specifics might be underreported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Skin redness and discoloration might be more pronounced clinically; she describes it mildly. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of a serious clot could be disproportionate, influencing her urgency. - True timeline: Likely corresponds with her report, with her anxiety perhaps making her perceive progression as more alarming than it is objectively.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to guide the next question, aiming to gather broader symptom details that can inform the differential diagnosis. Since the patient's main concern is leg swelling and soreness with some mild redness, I need to explore the timeline, presence of other symptoms like warmth, changes in skin color, and any associated factors. Understanding her perspective on these symptoms and their impact will also help establish rapport. I should pursue open-ended inquiry to allow her to elaborate naturally while subtly addressing potential signs of serious conditions such as DVT.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise timeline of symptom onset and progression; associated symptoms like warmth, skin changes; personal and family risk factors; functional impact. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm or rule out DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, cellulitis, and other causes. - Patient factors: She appears anxious and possibly minimizes some signs; questions should validate her experience respectfully and gently probe further. - Interview phase goals: Encourage detailed description of symptoms, explore associated features, and build trust.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended to allow her to describe her experience in detail. - Information target: How her symptoms developed over time, what she has noticed besides swelling and soreness, and any other relevant changes. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing that acknowledges her concerns and invites elaboration. - Expected value: Will provide insight into symptom chronology and associated features, guiding suspicion toward or away from specific diagnoses.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your leg swelling and soreness have been developing? For example, when did you first notice them, and have you noticed any other changes in your leg or how it feels over the past days or weeks?\"",

    "input": "A 68-year-old female presents with a several-days history of worsening swelling and soreness in the right leg. She describes the symptoms as persistent and severe, with associated warmth, redness, discoloration, and prominent veins around the calf. She reports concern for blood clots but may be experiencing anxiety-related amplification of her symptoms. Physical examination is necessary to objectively evaluate for signs such as skin discoloration, erythema, temperature changes, and extent of swelling. Objective findings could reveal more significant signs than described verbally, and assessment of systemic symptoms and risk factors is indicated to determine urgency and appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: Key symptoms include unilateral leg swelling, warmth, redness, and prominent superficial veins\u2014classic signs of DVT. The patient's age increases her risk, and the severity of symptoms warrants urgent evaluation.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Redness, warmth, swelling, and soreness may also indicate skin infection. The discoloration and skin changes might be signs of cellulitis, especially if there is skin breakdown or tenderness.  3. Diagnosis: Superficial Thrombophlebitis Justification: Prominent superficial veins and soreness could represent inflammation of superficial veins, although less severe than DVT; some overlap exists, and it\u2019s a consideration based on presentation.  4. Diagnosis: Venous Insufficiency or Chronic Venous Disease Justification: Prominent veins and swelling could reflect underlying venous insufficiency, especially in an older woman, though the acute worsening suggests an inflammatory or thrombotic process.  5. Diagnosis: Congestive Heart Failure (Right-sided) Justification: Although less likely with localized symptoms, systemic venous congestion can cause leg swelling but usually involves both legs and associated systemic signs.  6. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Leg swelling with skin changes could be lymphatic in origin, although the erythema and warmth are less typical.  7. Diagnosis: Petechiae or Hemorrhagic Rash Justification: Discoloration could be due to hemorrhage, but less likely given the localized warmth and swelling.  8. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Secondary to Injury or Skin Breakdown Justification: Skin breach or trauma could cause infection, but no such details are provided; thus, less probable.  9. Diagnosis: Allergic or Contact Dermatitis Justification: Redness and soreness might be allergic reaction, but persistence and severity with swelling point more toward vascular pathology.  10. Diagnosis: Venous Malformation or Congenital Varicosities Justification: Prominent veins can be congenital but less likely if symptoms are recent and severe.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged words like \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" \"excruciating,\" which amplify her symptoms and fears. Her descriptions are vivid and detailed, showing emotional involvement. - Information flow: She is forthcoming and provides comprehensive details proactively, though her tone suggests a desire for reassurance. Her responses are organized, aligned with her story of symptom progression. - Response style: Her responses are elaborated and emotionally expressive; she tends to elaborate on her worries rather than giving minimal answers.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding; she shares detailed descriptions and fears, which suggests openness, though emotional distress could mask internal doubts. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; she emphasizes symptoms strongly, indicating exaggeration rather than downplaying. - Amplification patterns: Clearly present; she describes her pain as \"terrible,\" \"worst,\" and \"excruciating,\" emphasizing distress and fear. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight signs when touching or adjusting her clothing, possibly discomfort about her health status, but not definitively shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear indicators; timeline appears consistent, and her recall of symptom onset and progression seems intact. - Family influence: No direct evidence of family influence from her responses; her statements are self-focused.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxious amplification bias\u2014she is emotionally invested, fears the worst, and exaggerates her symptoms possibly due to health anxiety. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her detailed and emotional descriptions suggest significant amplification, which could lead to misjudging her true clinical needs. - Areas most affected: Her perception of severity of pain, redness, and urgency, which are heightened by emotional language. - Reliability: Overall reasonably reliable regarding symptom timeline but likely overestimates severity due to anxiety, so clinical judgment should incorporate this bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not fully communicate her baseline health status or if she has any doubts about her symptoms; she might omit explanations that could downplay her distress or suggest alternative causes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The actual physical findings (e.g., extent of redness, swelling) may be worse than she acknowledges; her focus on emotional distress suggests her physical symptoms could be more severe. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of a blood clot or life-threatening complication are heightened; she seems to catastrophize her condition, which may not fully align with clinical findings. - True timeline: She reports gradual worsening over days, which is consistent, but her emotional reaction increases her perceived urgency.  In summary, the patient exhibits moderate anxious amplification bias, with vivid emotional language and concerns that may overstate her symptoms\u2019 severity, emphasizing her need for reassurance but also requiring careful clinical assessment to avoid over-reliance on her subjective report.",

    "input": "A 68-year-old female presents with a several-day history of right leg swelling and soreness. Physical examination is necessary to determine the extent of swelling, skin discoloration, erythema, and warmth. While she reports severe localized symptoms and expresses concern about a blood clot, these perceptions may be influenced by anxiety, and the actual clinical signs might be less severe than described. Further assessment should include evaluation for systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and past medical history including risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Overall, her presentation suggests possible deep vein thrombosis, but objective findings and systemic information are needed to determine the urgency and appropriate management.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: The presentation of unilateral leg swelling and soreness over several days strongly suggests a DVT. Risk factors for DVT include age, immobility, or recent health changes\u2014though specific risk factors are not provided. The concern expressed by the patient underscores the importance of this diagnosis. The clinical pattern of localized swelling and soreness aligns with DVT, especially if physical exam confirms swelling and warmth with overlying skin changes.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: Cellulitis can cause localized swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness of the skin. It must be considered, especially if skin erythema and tenderness are prominent. However, without reported systemic symptoms such as fever or skin warmth beyond localized involvement, cellulitis ranks slightly lower than DVT, but remains a significant consideration if exam findings support skin infection.  3. Diagnosis: Chronic Venous Insufficiency Justification: This condition can lead to leg swelling and soreness, especially in older adults. Typically, it presents with longer duration and often with skin pigmentation or ulceration, which is not specified here. Since symptoms are described as recent and severe, this is less likely as a primary cause but remains a possible underlying contributor.  4. Diagnosis: Lymphedema Justification: Lymphedema can cause persistent limb swelling and discomfort, especially if lymphatic drainage is compromised. It tends to be more chronic and less acute than DVT, and usually associated with prior lymphatic injury or surgery. Lack of historical context makes this less probable but still worth consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Cellulitis secondary to skin break or other causes Justification: While cellulitis is listed above, it is considered here to focus on possible secondary infections that could arise in the setting of skin compromise. Its likelihood depends on the presence of skin abrasions or breaches, which are not specified in the vignette but remain relevant as a differential.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged vocabulary (\"scared,\" \"worried,\" \"terrible\"), with some vagueness (\"kind of red,\" \"a little discolored\") that may obscure clinical clarity. Her description often emphasizes her emotional state over precise clinical detail. - Information flow: She is forthcoming in sharing her fears and timeline, volunteering detailed information early, but tends to frame symptoms within her emotional context, possibly overemphasizing danger. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, focusing on her fears and concerns, occasionally repetitive, reflecting her anxious state.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No explicit withholding; she appears eager to communicate her worries. - Minimization behaviors: She describes her pain as \"like a terrible cramp,\" potentially downplaying the severity of symptoms. Her narrative minimizes underappreciated risks, possibly avoiding focus on her overall health status. - Amplification patterns: She repeatedly emphasizes worst-case scenarios (\"something really bad,\" \"could be a stroke\"), which indicates concern amplification. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of shame, but hesitance in describing her history (\"I don\u2019t have any history of blood cl...\") suggests some reluctance or incompleteness. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of confusion; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: She does not mention family influence affecting responses; responses appear personally motivated.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety-driven amplification bias, leading her to overestimate the danger of her symptoms. - Severity: Moderate to severe, given her persistent and emotionally intense focus on catastrophic outcomes. - Areas most affected: Her perceptions of risk and danger regarding blood clots and strokes are heavily biased. - Reliability: Moderately unreliable due to emotional amplification; her perception of symptom severity sounds exaggerated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be fully disclosing background health issues or other mild symptoms that could contextualize her presentation. - Symptoms probably minimized: She is likely minimizing the severity of her actual pain and perhaps her overall health risk. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of life-threatening complications are exaggerated and may influence her behavior, such as seeking urgent interventions unnecessarily. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent with DVT, but her focus on danger may distort her perception of how rapidly symptoms escalate and the actual urgency.  Overall, her responses reflect a significant anxiety bias that could lead her to over-interpret symptoms, emphasizing danger while potentially overlooking other important health considerations.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning for question development:  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Precise characteristics of the swelling and soreness (e.g., size, whether the swelling is uniform or localized, skin features like temperature or discoloration), presence of skin changes such as redness or streaks, and systemic symptoms like fever. Also, details about potential risk factors (immobility, recent injuries, previous DVT, or surgeries). - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify features that differentiate DVT from cellulitis or chronic venous issues; explore signs of infection versus vascular blockage; determine if there are any systemic signs that suggest infection or embolic events. - Patient factors: Her emphasis on emotional concern and exaggeration suggests the need for questions that elicit detailed, specific symptom descriptions without triggering further anxiety, while validating her worries. - Interview phase goals: Narrow down the clinical features most characteristic of DVT and other differentials, confirm presence or absence of systemic features, and assess the progression and modifiers, including triggers or alleviating factors.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about specific symptom qualities, associated features, and systemic symptoms; clarifying questions to differentiate DVT from cellulitis. - Information target: Skin features (redness, warmth, discoloration), timing, size of swelling, presence of systemic symptoms (fever, chills), recent activities or injuries. - Communication approach: Phrase questions gently and with reassurance, encouraging her to describe specific signs in detail (e.g., \"Can you tell me if the skin over your leg feels warm, hot, or tender when you touch it?\"), to avoid escalating anxiety. - Expected value: These questions will provide concrete data to support or rule out key features of DVT, cellulitis, or other causes, refining the differential.\nANSWER: \"Could you tell me whether the area on your leg feels warm or hot to the touch, or if the skin has become more red or discolored since this started?

    "input": "A 68-year-old female presents with a several-day history of right leg swelling, redness, warmth, and discoloration, particularly around the calf, with prominent visible veins. She describes the pain as severe and persistent and reports feelings of weakness. She denies current fever, chills, or shortness of breath. Her concern about having a blood clot or vascular blockage appears driven by anxiety, which may have led to an emotional overstatement of symptom severity. Further physical examination and systemic symptom assessment are necessary to determine the presence and extent of deep vein thrombosis or other vascular conditions, while considering her emotional state when interpreting symptom severity.1. Diagnosis: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Justification: The swelling, redness, warmth, and prominent veins in the right leg are classic features of DVT, especially given the recent symptom onset over several days. The symptoms are localized and unilateral, which supports this diagnosis. The absence of systemic fever does not exclude DVT, but the self-admitted anxiety may lead the patient to overstate severity; nonetheless, DVT remains the most concerning and probable due to clinical presentation.  2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis Justification: The redness, warmth, swelling, and discoloration could reflect cellulitis, especially if the skin appears tender or indurated. This is a common infectious cause of similar findings. Although the absence of fever and chills lowers suspicion slightly, cellulitis remains a strong consideration because of skin changes and localized inflammation.  3. Diagnosis: Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) Justification: The prominent visible veins and swelling are features compatible with venous stasis and insufficiency, especially in an elderly woman. However, the acute onset over several days suggests a more active process like DVT or cellulitis, making CVI less probable as the primary cause but still relevant as a potential underlying condition.  4. Diagnosis: Vascular Obstruction (Non-thrombotic) Justification: Other causes of vascular blockage, such as external compression or arteriosclerosis, might contribute, but without evidence of arterial ischemia or other signs, these are less likely. Nonetheless, vascular issues remain differential possibilities in leg swelling.  5. Diagnosis: Emotional or Psychogenic Editing (Anxiety-related Symptom Exaggeration) Justification: The patient's concern about having a blood clot driven by anxiety indicates a possible psychosomatic component; however, this does not explain the physical findings but influences the interpretation of symptom severity. While not a primary diagnosis, this factor affects clinical judgment and urgency.  STOP HERE.Margaret's responses reveal a pattern of amplifying her symptoms, especially her fears about danger and severity, driven by her anxiety. She's very focused on the possible life-threatening nature of her leg issues, which amplifies her perceived risk.

    "input": "A 68-year-old female presents with a several-day history of right leg swelling, redness, warmth, tenderness, and discoloration, particularly around the calf. On physical examination, her leg appears more swollen, red, tender, and warmer than the contralateral side, with visible prominent veins. The patient reports no current fever, chills, or shortness of breath. Though she expresses significant concern about a blood clot and potential complications, her subjective descriptions are consistent with localized signs indicative of a possible deep vein thrombosis. Her emotional distress may amplify her perception of severity, but her physical findings support a diagnosis of a venous thrombotic process. Further assessment of systemic symptoms and risk factors is recommended to determine the extent and urgency of treatment.Deep Vein Thrombosis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged and amplifying descriptors (\"really warm,\" \"definitely more swollen,\" \"worried,\" \"scared\"), which highlight her anxiety. She provides specific details about swelling, color, and warmth, but also describes her feelings with emotional language that elevates perceived severity. - Information flow: She appears forthcoming, voluntarily sharing her symptoms and concerns, with organized responses. Her focus is primarily on her local symptoms and worry, with less elaboration on systemic health, unless prompted. - Response style: She elaborates on her symptoms and feelings, often repeating concerns to express her distress. Her responses are direct but emotionally laden.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence\u2014she openly shares her symptoms and worries. - Minimization behaviors: She attempts to downplay systemic symptoms, stating she has no fever or chills, possibly to reassure herself or dismiss the severity of potential systemic issues. - Amplification patterns: She often emphasizes the warmth, redness, and swelling, alongside her anxiety about blood clots or strokes, magnifying her perceived danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she appears straightforward and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: None; her timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: There is no evidence these responses are influenced by others.  BIAS ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety amplification bias, leading her to overstate her worry about life-threatening complications, even when describing local symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional state inflates her perceived risk but does not distort her factual presentation of local signs. - Areas most affected: Her perception of systemic danger and urgency; her worry may influence her overall assessment and willingness to delay or seek urgent care based on fear. - Reliability: Generally reliable regarding her local symptoms, but her emotional distress may overestimate the severity or urgency of systemic threats.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may underreport subtle systemic signs such as mild fever, shortness of breath, or fatigue, which are important for broader differential diagnosis. Her focus on local symptoms and fear could obscure other relevant information. - Symptoms probably minimized: systemic symptoms like malaise, mild fever, or respiratory symptoms, as she consciously minimizes or does not mention them. - Concerns probably amplified: her fear of severe outcomes like blood clots or strokes, possibly leading her to overestimate the danger and seek urgent intervention unnecessarily. - True timeline: Symptoms appear to be worsening over a couple of days, consistent with her report; her emotional response, however, may make her perceive the timeline as more acute or urgent than it objectively is.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: While she reports no fever or chills, it's crucial to confirm if she has noticed any subtle systemic symptoms, such as mild fatigue, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort, which could suggest complications or alternative diagnoses. - Diagnostic priorities: To confirm or exclude DVT, check for specific features like severity of swelling, discoloration patterns, and tender points. Also, assess for systemic features that may point to other causes or complications, like PE. - Patient factors: Her emotional distress and anxiety may influence her responses, possibly leading to overemphasis on certain symptoms or underreporting systemic signs. It's important to be empathetic while gently exploring these areas. - Interview phase goals: Finalize the diagnostic picture by confirming key criteria for DVT, rule out systemic or alternative causes, and gauge her understanding and concerns to prepare her for treatment planning.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused but open-ended to assess systemic symptoms and clarify her perception. - Information target: Subtle systemic symptoms, details about swelling and discoloration, her understanding of the condition, and current concerns. - Communication approach: Use collaborative, reassuring language to encourage honest sharing, acknowledging her worries but guiding toward completing the assessment. - Expected value: This will help confirm the diagnosis, ensure no overlooked systemic issues, and prepare for shared decision-making regarding treatment options.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, that\u2019s really helpful to understand. Just to make sure I have the full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms besides what's in your leg? For example, have you felt more tired than usual, experienced shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or any other new feelings since your symptoms started? And how has the swelling and redness changed or stayed the same over these days?\"",

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged and amplifying descriptors (\"really warm,\" \"definitely more swollen,\" \"worried,\" \"scared\"), which highlight her anxiety. She provides specific details about swelling, color, and warmth, but also describes her feelings with emotional language that elevates perceived severity. - Information flow: She appears forthcoming, voluntarily sharing her symptoms and concerns, with organized responses. Her focus is primarily on her local symptoms and worry, with less elaboration on systemic health, unless prompted. - Response style: She elaborates on her symptoms and feelings, often repeating concerns to express her distress. Her responses are direct but emotionally laden.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence\u2014she openly shares her symptoms and worries. - Minimization behaviors: She attempts to downplay systemic symptoms, stating she has no fever or chills, possibly to reassure herself or dismiss the severity of potential systemic issues. - Amplification patterns: She often emphasizes the warmth, redness, and swelling, alongside her anxiety about blood clots or strokes, magnifying her perceived danger. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None observed; she appears straightforward and cooperative. - Confusion/memory issues: None; her timeline and symptom descriptions are coherent. - Family influence: There is no evidence these responses are influenced by others.
