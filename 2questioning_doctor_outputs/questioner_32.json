    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Eye redness, tearing, and swelling are characteristic; likely viral or allergic, common in active individuals, often self-limiting.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Recent physical activity increases risk of superficial injury; presents with redness, tearing, discomfort, likely after trauma.  3. Diagnosis: Periorbital ( eyelid) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness localized around eyelid following activity; infection may have originated from minor trauma or skin breach.  4. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness with possible pain; a serious complication of eyelid or sinus infection, more common in children but possible.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Redness and tearing; may be triggered by exposure during sports, usually associated with itching, but needs consideration.  6. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Inflammation of superficial scleral vessels causing redness and swelling; often benign, can be activity-related.  7. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden redness without much pain; caused by minor trauma or strain, presents as localized red patch, less swelling.  8. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness; chronic condition could be exacerbated by activity, although symptoms are usually milder.  9. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the conjunctiva Justification: Exposure during activity can deposit debris leading to redness, tearing, and discomfort; needs to be ruled out with examination.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Less likely; causes eye pain, redness, visual disturbance, often in older individuals, but must be considered if symptoms worsen or include pain.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs somewhat vague and general descriptors like \"feeling pretty awful\" and \"bad cough,\" avoiding detailed or clinical descriptions unless prompted. She briefly uses emotional language but does not elaborate much. - Information flow: She is reluctant to volunteer comprehensive details and tends to keep responses minimal, indicating a tendency to withhold or defer specifics until asked. - Response style: Her responses are brief and somewhat guarded, signaling possible effort to minimize discomfort or avoid sounding overly vulnerable.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Limited spontaneous detail about symptom severity and timeline suggests reticence; she may be downplaying how serious her condition truly is. - Minimization behaviors: Describing her feelings as \"pretty awful\" rather than specifying exact symptoms or impact may mask the true severity or urgency. - Amplification patterns: The repeated emphasis on feeling \"bad\" and \"awful\" could reflect emotional distress but also serve to underline her concern while still avoiding full transparency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, though her guarded tone may hint at discomfort discussing her health extensively. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: Indirectly, her mention of living near children could imply some external pressure to appear less ill, though not explicitly observed here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Moderate symptom minimization and delayed care inclination appear evident, likely motivated by stoicism or pride. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her brief responses and subtle downplaying can impair accurate assessment of her true condition. - Areas most affected: Symptoms severity and timeline are most prone to bias, possibly masking rapid deterioration. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014self-report provides some useful info but warrants cautious interpretation, especially about symptom intensity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed descriptions of symptom progression, exact degree of breathlessness, and how symptoms impact daily function. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true level of respiratory distress and urgency may be more severe; physical signs such as labored breathing or hypoxia might be understated. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about serious illness and pneumonia appears genuine, suggesting actual concern rather than overreaction. - True timeline: Symptoms might have developed more rapidly or intensely than her brief account indicates; her brevity may conceal the severity.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Redness and tearing are hallmark signs; common in young active individuals; often bilateral and related to infections or allergies.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Eye trauma during soccer could cause superficial corneal injury, leading to redness, tearing, and discomfort.  3. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Swelling and redness of eyelid margins are typical; can be precipitated by external factors like playing sports.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness can occur with allergies; exposure to outdoor elements during sport can trigger allergic responses.  5. Diagnosis: Viral keratoconjunctivitis Justification: Rapid onset after activity; viral causes are common and present with tearing and redness.  6. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness anterior to the orbit, often following minor trauma or skin breaches; less urgent than orbital cellulitis.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Although less common without systemic signs, consider if swelling worsens or involves pain with eye movement; surgical history or infection source increases suspicion.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Intraocular inflammation can cause redness and tearing; typically associated with pain and vision changes but less likely given short duration and trauma history.  9. Diagnosis: Trauma / eyelid contusion Justification: Physical activity could cause blunt injury leading to swelling and redness; would need more trauma-specific details.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Less likely without reports of pain, halos, or vision loss; typically presents with severe pain and elevated intraocular pressure, unlikely in this context.

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with ongoing cough, dyspnea on exertion, fever, night sweats, fatigue, and decreased energy levels. While she reports moderate symptoms interfering with daily functioning, communication patterns suggest her actual severity may be greater. She exhibits signs of systemic illness with probable underlying respiratory or infectious pathology, requiring further detailed assessment to determine the extent of respiratory compromise and systemic impact.1. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (pulmonary or disseminated) Justification: The combination of a chronic cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and systemic symptoms strongly suggests active tuberculosis. The systemic illness signs and constitutional symptoms are hallmark features. Tuberculosis frequently causes persistent cough and constitutional symptoms, fitting the overall presentation well.  2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (pulmonary or mediastinal involvement) Justification: The presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, and decreased energy, along with a chronic cough, can also indicate lymphoma, especially if it involves thoracic lymph nodes or lung parenchyma. Lymphomas often produce B symptoms, which align with this patient\u2019s systemic features.  3. Diagnosis: Fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis or other endemic mycoses) Justification: Fungal infections, especially in endemic areas, can cause chronic cough, systemic symptoms, and constitutional signs similar to tuberculosis. These infections can mimic TB but may be distinguished by epidemiologic exposure history and other clinical clues.  4. Diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or interstitial lung disease Justification: While COPD could explain dyspnea and cough, systemic features like fever and night sweats are less characteristic, unless complicated by superimposed infection. Interstitial lung disease may cause exertional dyspnea but less commonly systemic symptoms like night sweats, unless secondary to another process.  5. Diagnosis: Lung malignancy (e.g., bronchogenic carcinoma) Justification: A malignancy could present with cough, systemic symptoms, and decreased energy, especially in older patients or those with risk factors. Though less specific without weight loss or hemoptysis mentioned, it remains a differential, especially if infectious or inflammatory causes are ruled out.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret uses vague and minimization language like \"pretty tired\" and \"not much energy,\" shielding the true extent of her symptoms. She occasionally employs emotional descriptors (\"like I\u2019m just not myself\") but keeps the details minimal, perhaps to avoid alarming herself or others. - Information flow: Her openness is limited; she volunteers information mainly about fatigue and night sweats but less about the severity of her breathing difficulty unless prompted. Her responses are organized but somewhat guarded, and she seems to avoid elaboration until explicitly asked. - Response style: She provides brief, sometimes resigned answers that seem designed to avoid overstatement, with signs of discomfort or fatigue evident in her tone and mannerisms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Fidgeting, sighing, and soft, breathless speech suggest she might be minimizing symptoms or feeling uncomfortable discussing the full extent of her illness. Her reluctance to elaborate unless prompted signals potential withholding. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her fatigue and breathlessness, focusing on feelings of \"not much energy\" rather than severe breathlessness or functional decline, which could be more serious. - Amplification patterns: There\u2019s a lack of overstatement; instead, her language is cautious\u2014indicating she is not exaggerating but possibly understating her condition. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs of shame; however, her hesitation to detail smoking and alcohol habits unless asked indicates possible discomfort disclosing these factors. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence; her timeline aligns with her reported symptoms. - Family influence: Not directly evidenced, but perhaps her tendency to minimize could stem from wanting to appear resilient to family or healthcare providers.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Symptom minimization, as she is likely underreporting the severity of her respiratory symptoms and functional impairment. - Severity: Moderate\u2014she does acknowledge symptoms and expresses concern, but her descriptions are understated relative to her likely clinical severity. - Areas most affected: Shortness of breath and functional impact are most biased\u2014her responses mask the true severity, possibly delaying urgent interventions. - Reliability: Fair to moderate\u2014her self-reporting may underestimate the danger, so clinical suspicion should be high, and objective measures (e.g., oxygen saturation, physical exam) are crucial.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of her respiratory compromise, including the severity of her dyspnea, impact on daily activities, and possible delays in seeking care due to minimization. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her breathlessness and functional impairment are worse than she suggests, as her tone and response pattern imply she isn\u2019t fully revealing the extent. - Concerns probably amplified: She may be over-worried about hospitalization or outcomes, but her reluctance to fully disclose suggests her concerns may be more about appearance or independence. - True timeline: The progression might be more rapid or severe than reported, with her current state possibly reflecting worsening respiratory function that she is hesitant to emphasize.  Overall, her communication demonstrates a tendency toward symptom minimization, which heightens the need for objective assessment of her respiratory status.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need more details about the severity, frequency, and triggers of her cough and dyspnea, as well as the specific impact on her daily activities. Since she minimizes symptoms, clarifying whether she experiences severe breathlessness or limitations is essential. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify whether her respiratory symptoms are primarily infectious (suggesting TB or fungal infection), obstructive/inflammatory (COPD/interstitial lung disease), or neoplastic (lung cancer, lymphoma). Understanding the systemic symptoms' pattern and progression can help differentiate. - Patient factors: Her guarded, minimization tendency indicates the need for gentle, focused questions that encourage honesty without making her feel judged or overwhelmed. She may habitually underreport severity due to discomfort or emotional reasons. - Interview phase goals: To extract detailed, specific symptom characteristics, assess functional impact more objectively, and explore associated systemic symptoms and risk factors, all while maintaining rapport.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions about the severity, frequency, and triggers of symptoms, as well as associated features\u2014especially her dyspnea and cough. Follow-up questions about systemic symptoms and impact on daily routine. - Information target: Severity and limitations caused by respiratory symptoms, any recent weight changes, timing of symptom progression, and associated constitutional symptoms. Also, family history of respiratory disease or malignancy. - Communication approach: Phrase questions with sensitivity, avoiding making her feel scrutinized. For example, \"You've mentioned feeling pretty tired and some night sweats\u2014can I ask how often you feel short of breath or cough during the day? Does it ever get very bad or sudden?\" - Expected value: Clarify the intensity and impact of her respiratory symptoms, which will aid in prioritizing differential diagnoses, especially in distinguishing between infectious, obstructive, or malignant causes.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, I appreciate you sharing how you\u2019ve been feeling. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me if you sometimes find your breathing gets very difficult or sudden\u2014like feeling you can\u2019t catch your breath?

    "input": "The patient is a female presenting with a cough, exertional dyspnea, systemic symptoms including persistent fever, night sweats, and fatigue, which are impacting her daily activities. Communication patterns indicate she may be underreporting the frequency and severity of episodes of breathlessness, especially those occurring at rest or with minimal exertion. She describes her symptoms in a cautious manner, suggesting more frequent or severe respiratory episodes that require further detailed assessment. Her systemic symptoms imply ongoing systemic or infectious pathology, and given her age, thorough evaluation is warranted to determine the extent of respiratory compromise and systemic illness.1. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Pulmonary TB) Justification: The persistent cough, systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue), and weight of systemic illness support active tuberculosis; TB often presents insidiously with constitutional symptoms and respiratory complaints, especially in populations with potential exposure risks. The systemic symptoms, combined with the respiratory features, strongly favor TB as the leading diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (Pulmonary or Mediastinal) Justification: The systemic \"B\" symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) along with respiratory symptoms could indicate lymphoma involving the thoracic lymph nodes or mediastinum. Lymphoma can cause cough and dyspnea due to mediastinal mass effect and systemic symptoms due to cytokine release, fitting her presentation well.  3. Diagnosis: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation Justification: Although less likely given her systemic symptoms, COPD could account for exertional dyspnea and cough, especially if she has underlying risk factors. However, systemic symptoms like fever and night sweats are less characteristic unless there is superimposed infection or complication, making it a lower probability.  4. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Justification: Sarcoidosis can present with respiratory symptoms and systemic features such as fatigue, fever, and night sweats. It often causes bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and lymphadenopathy, aligning with her respiratory and constitutional presentation, but less commonly presents with persistent fever in the absence of other organ involvement.  5. Diagnosis: Pleural Effusion secondary to infection or malignancy Justification: The systemic symptoms and respiratory complaints could also be due to a pleural effusion caused by infection (e.g., TB) or malignancy (e.g., lymphoma), which can cause exertional dyspnea and cough. Given her symptoms, this is plausible but ranks below primary infectious/inflammatory causes due to the systemic symptom profile and direct respiratory difficulty.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: Margaret uses straightforward, somewhat cautious language, avoiding overly emotional words but clearly expressing fatigue and concern. She often frames her symptoms as \"hard to breathe\" and \"kinda\" or \"sometimes,\" signaling some minimization. Her descriptions are organized but deliberately brief, likely to avoid drawing attention to how severe she perceives her condition to be. - Information flow: She is forthcoming with key symptoms when asked directly but is selective in elaborating. She waits for specific prompts to discuss certain issues like her night sweats or alcohol use, indicating a tendency to share only when explicitly questioned. The responses are organized, with her tending to give consistent answers across similar questions. - Response style: Her replies tend to be concise and measured, avoiding elaboration unless prompted. She answers questions directly but with a tendency to understate or soften the perception of her symptoms, such as \"it\u2019s kind of messing up my day-to-day stuff\" instead of emphasizing how debilitating it is.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: While she generally shares substantive information, her brief descriptions of shortness of breath (\"it does kinda stop me from doing what I normally do\") suggest she might understate episodes' severity or frequency, potentially to avoid seeming overly fragile. - Minimization behaviors: She minimizes her breathing difficulty by describing it as \"sometimes I find it hard to breathe pretty suddenly\" without emphasizing its frequency or impact. Her focus on tiredness and sweating, rather than persistent severe dyspnea, may obscure the urgency of her respiratory compromise. - Amplification patterns: There's little evidence of exaggeration; her concerns seem proportional to her perceived illness. Her worries about \"something really serious\" seem consistent with her age and condition but not exaggerated beyond rational concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but occasionally she frames symptoms in a way that suggests a wish not to appear overly worried, possibly as a subtle protective mechanism. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence of current confusion. Her description of timeline (starting three days ago) is consistent. - Family influence: Slightly more detailed responses could be influenced by her concern about health impact, but explicit family influence is not evident in her responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild to moderate minimization bias. She tends to downplay the severity or the frequency of her shortness of breath episodes, likely to avoid sounding too vulnerable. - Severity: Moderate; her responses are mostly honest but may marginally understate the severity of episodic dyspnea that could be critical in an acute setting. - Areas most affected: Breathing symptoms and the immediate impact of dyspnea are most biased\u2014she admits difficulty but tends to minimize how often or how severe these episodes are. - Reliability: Fair; her specific descriptions and willingness to disclose key symptoms support reasonable trust, but clinicians should probe further to uncover possible underreporting of episodic severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency, intensity, and impact of her dyspnea episodes might be greater than reported. She may minimize the danger of episodic severe breathing difficulties during activities or sudden episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The episodic nature and potential severity of her respiratory distress could be under-stated; she reports \"sometimes\" but may experience more frequent or debilitating episodes. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about \"something really serious\" and \"more than just a cold\" are genuine but may be fueling health anxiety, leading her to believe her symptoms are more critical than they perceive in daily life. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but she might be underestimating how rapidly symptoms, especially dyspnea, could worsen or fluctuate, given her vulnerability due to COPD and age.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, clarifying follow-up questions to refine the understanding of her respiratory symptoms\u2014particularly the characteristics, triggers, and impact of her dyspnea\u2014since these details will help distinguish between the diagnoses in her differential. Considering her tendency to minimize symptoms, questions should confirm frequency and severity without leading her to understate. Exploring associated symptoms (like chest pain, hemoptysis, or wheezing) will aid in differentiating conditions like COPD exacerbation from infectious or neoplastic processes. Understanding her history of similar episodes, as well as any medication use or exposures, could also be relevant. Since her systemic symptoms are significant, clarifying their pattern, duration, and any related factors helps prioritize infectious or systemic conditions. Given her communication style, questions should be precise but empathetic, encouraging honest disclosure while validating her experience.  QUESTION STRATEGY: Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended follow-ups to clarify the nature of her dyspnea, systemic symptoms, and triggers, with some confirmatory questions to quantify severity. Information target: Frequency, duration, severity, timing of breathing episodes; associated symptoms; impact on daily functioning; any worsening patterns. Communication approach: Gentle, non-judgmental phrasing that acknowledges her responses and invites elaboration, reducing underreporting risk. Expected value: This will help determine whether her episodes are episodic or persistent, which influences the differential diagnosis toward infections, malignancy, or chronic pulmonary disease, and also assess the urgency or need for further diagnostics.\nANSWER: \"Margaret, earlier you mentioned that sometimes you find it hard to breathe pretty suddenly.

She tends to downplay the severity or the frequency of her shortness of breath episodes, likely to avoid sounding too vulnerable. - Severity: Moderate; her responses are mostly honest but may marginally understate the severity of episodic dyspnea that could be critical in an acute setting. - Areas most affected: Breathing symptoms and the immediate impact of dyspnea are most biased\u2014she admits difficulty but tends to minimize how often or how severe these episodes are. - Reliability: Fair; her specific descriptions and willingness to disclose key symptoms support reasonable trust, but clinicians should probe further to uncover possible underreporting of episodic severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency, intensity, and impact of her dyspnea episodes might be greater than reported. She may minimize the danger of episodic severe breathing difficulties during activities or sudden episodes. - Symptoms probably minimized: The episodic nature and potential severity of her respiratory distress could be under-stated; she reports \"sometimes\" but may experience more frequent or debilitating episodes. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worries about \"something really serious\" and \"more than just a cold\" are genuine but may be fueling health anxiety, leading her to believe her symptoms are more critical than they perceive in daily life. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but she might be underestimating how rapidly symptoms, especially dyspnea, could worsen or fluctuate, given her vulnerability due to COPD and age.",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.Conjunctivitis ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses a mix of vague and emotional language, which can obscure the true severity. Words like \"a few times a day\" and \"kinda\" soften her report, while \"terrible\" and \"excruciating\" reveal emotional distress. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming but tends to minimize or downplay her symptoms unless prompted specifically about frequency and severity of episodes. - Response style: Responses are generally concise and somewhat cautious, prioritizing comfort and avoiding overstatement, which may result in an underestimation of the symptoms\u2019 severity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence includes her hesitant qualifiers (\"probably,\" \"kinda,\" \"not that bad\") and she does not volunteer details beyond prompts, suggesting guarded communication. - Minimization behaviors: She consistently downplays episodes\u2014describing them as brief (\"a minute or so\") and infrequent (\"probably a few times a day\")\u2014which may obscure the true impact. - Amplification patterns: Use of words like \"terrible\" and \u201cexcruciating\u201d indicates distress, but this may be emotionally exaggerated relative to the factual severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but her restrained detail and self-limiting descriptors suggest possible discomfort discussing more intense or distressing symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; her timeline and descriptions are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: No indicators present here.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization, as she appears to intentionally or unintentionally underreport symptom severity and frequency. - Severity: Moderate; her responses tend to understate the true extent, but she does acknowledge key symptoms. - Areas most affected: Breathlessness episodes and chest pain severity are likely understated. - Reliability: Moderate; her descriptions are somewhat cautious and understate the actual impact, so clinical assessment should consider potential under-reporting.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency, duration, and disabling nature of her breathlessness episodes possibly exceed her report; she may also be underreporting the severity of her chest pain. - Symptoms probably minimized: The episodes' impact on daily activities and safety might be more severe than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about hospitalization and serious illness might be heightened by anxiety, yet her primary communication style minimizes physical severity. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent, but the full extent of symptom impact might not be fully revealed, requiring objective assessment.  In summary, her communication pattern suggests moderate minimization bias, which could conceal the true severity of her respiratory compromise and impact, influencing clinical decisions if not carefully probed.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, clarifying questions to confirm the frequency, severity, and triggers of her episodes, given her tendency to underplay symptoms. I need to verify whether her reported episodes are as mild as she suggests or more disabling, as this will influence diagnosis and management. I should also gently assess her understanding and concerns to ensure she feels supported and prepared to discuss potential diagnoses. Finally, I want to explore any practical factors that might impact treatment or her safety, like activity limitations or medication use. Given her minimization, questions must be specific yet empathetic to elicit honest responses.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact frequency, duration, severity of episodes, and impact on her daily life, as well as her understanding of her symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirm whether episodes are consistent with asthma, cardiac causes, or other respiratory conditions. - Patient factors: Her guarded communication style may lead to underreporting; questions should be carefully phrased to build trust and clarity. - Interview phase goals: Clarify the true extent of her symptoms, assess her awareness and concerns about her condition, and prepare for discussing potential diagnoses and next steps.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions about episodes' frequency, duration, severity, and triggers. - Information target: How often episodes occur, how long they last, whether they are worse with activity or rest, and any associated symptoms. - Communication approach: Phrased collaboratively and gently, validating her experience while seeking concrete details. - Expected value: Will help differentiate between mild, possibly benign conditions and more serious respiratory or cardiac issues, guiding diagnosis and safety assessment.\nANSWER: \u201cMargaret, I understand you\u2019ve mentioned these breathlessness episodes happen a few times a day and last about a minute or so. Can you tell me, when these episodes occur\u2014are they happening more during activity, or do they sometimes happen even when you\u2019re just resting or sitting? Also, has the duration or how severe they feel changed over time? For example, do they feel more intense or last longer than before? And beyond the breathlessness, do you notice any other symptoms during these episodes, like chest tightness or wheezing? Hearing more about these details will help me understand better how these episodes are affecting you and what might be causing them.\u201d",
