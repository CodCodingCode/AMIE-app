    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Recent physical activity and symptom onset suggest trauma-related conjunctivitis; common in active patients with recent eye exposure.  2. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: Bilateral redness and tearing are characteristic; often occurs in young, active individuals and can follow minor trauma or exposure.  3. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Redness, swelling, and tearing can also indicate bacterial infection, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden onset of localized redness following physical activity, like playing soccer, suggests ruptured conjunctival vessels.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Bilateral redness and tearing typical, though less likely unless recent allergen exposure; lacks associated itching or history.  6. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma during sports activity can cause corneal scratches, presenting with redness, tearing, and discomfort.  7. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Presents with redness and tearing; although less common acutely post-activity, it should be considered if other signs are present.  8. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Progressive swelling and redness following trauma raise concern, but less likely without systemic signs or fever.  9. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid inflammation causes redness and swelling; less likely acutely but common ocular surface disorder.  10. Diagnosis: Bacterial conjunctivitis Justification: Similar to #3 but ranked lower; less likely without purulent discharge noted, but still possible.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses intense, emotionally charged, and specific language to describe her symptoms, emphasizing severity (\"swelling,\" \"can't breathe,\" \"really scared\"). Her tone conveys genuine distress. - Information flow: She is forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions without withholding information; responses are organized around her urgent feelings. - Response style: She communicates directly and succinctly, focusing on her symptoms and fears without tangential details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None observed; she openly shares her situation. - Minimization behaviors: None; her language underscores a high level of concern and symptom severity. - Amplification patterns: Her fears and descriptions are emotionally amplified, consistent with her distress, but seem proportionate to her reported symptoms. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Absent; she appears comfortable expressing her fears and symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: None; her timeline is coherent. - Family influence: No evidence; responses are personal and self-directed.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are classic signs; common in various infectious (viral or bacterial) causes, especially following outdoor activity.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Sudden onset after physical activity, redness, tearing, and possible discomfort suggest a superficial traumatic injury to the cornea.  3. Diagnosis: Traumatic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye redness and swelling following physical activity (playing soccer) suggest trauma-induced inflammation.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Swelling and redness could be due to blood leakage under conjunctiva, often following minor trauma.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness common; can be precipitated by trauma or irritation.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Intraocular inflammation presents with redness and tearing, but usually has additional symptoms like pain or photophobia.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis (less likely) Justification: Swelling and redness could suggest this severe infection, but typically involves more systemic symptoms and protrusion.  8. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (acute angle-closure) Justification: Causes redness and tearing, but usually associated with pain, visual disturbance, and fixed mid-dilated pupil.  9. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Recent activity could cause a foreign object or debris, leading to irritation, redness, and tearing.  10. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: Causes eye redness and tearing, often with a history of recurrence; less likely without other herpes symptoms but important to consider.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotional and somewhat exaggerated descriptors like \"everything just feels like it's closing in on me,\" and \"really trembling,\" indicating high distress. While some details are specific, her language leans toward amplification rather than clinical precision. - Information flow: She is forthcoming when asked direct questions about her sensations, providing detailed responses promptly, which shows cooperation but also a tendency to emphasize her discomfort. - Response style: Her responses are elaborated and emotionally charged, with a focus on personal sensations and fears, which suggests she process her symptoms through anxiety-driven affect rather than objective symptom reporting.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: There is little evidence of withholding, as she readily shares her physical sensations and emotional state. - Minimization behaviors: Some phrases like \"just\" in \"just can't breathe\" could imply a slight minimization to avoid seeming overly dramatic; however, overall her distress signals are pronounced. - Amplification patterns: She describes sensations in an exaggerated manner, such as \"everything just feels like it's closing in,\" and emphasizes fear of passing out, possibly to underscore urgency. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear signs observed; she appears openly distressed. - Confusion/memory issues: Not evident here; responses are coherent and consistent. - Family influence: No indication of external influence on her responses in this snippet.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias due to anxiety, leading her to exaggerate her symptoms and fears to communicate urgency. - Severity: Moderate. The distress appears genuine and high, but some descriptions may be amplified by her anxious state, potentially overestimating her symptoms. - Areas most affected: Her perception of airway compromise and threat of passing out are most affected, possibly overemphasized. - Reliability: While her reports of sensations are likely accurate, their subjective intensity may be inflated by her anxiety, so some overstatement should be considered.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not be fully reporting her baseline or any previous episodes accurately, possibly minimizing previous manageable reactions or overfocusing on the current crisis. - Symptoms probably minimized: Less severe symptoms, such as mild airway narrowing or initial allergic signs, might be overshadowed by her current emotional state. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of passing out or airway closure seem exaggerated; she may be overestimating the severity based on her panic. - True timeline: The progression seems consistent with a severe allergic reaction exacerbated by anxiety; her emotional state probably magnifies her perceived urgency.

    "vignette_index": 109,
    "input": "The patient is a 35-year-old woman presenting with a suspected allergic reaction characterized by airway symptoms including a sensation of throat tightness and difficulty breathing, which she perceives as severe and urgent. She also exhibits ocular symptoms\u2014itchiness, redness, swelling, and tearing\u2014that are likely more extensive than she reports, given her focus on airway threat. Additional systemic allergic manifestations such as skin hives, swelling, or difficulty swallowing may be present but have not been emphasized, necessitating further assessment. The history suggests concurrent ocular and possibly systemic allergic symptoms, with airway distress as the primary concern. Further detailed inquiry is needed to clarify the full scope and severity of her allergic response.1. Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis Justification: The presence of airway symptoms such as throat tightness and difficulty breathing, combined with ocular symptoms like redness, swelling, and tearing, strongly suggests a severe allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is characterized by rapid-onset airway compromise, multisystem involvement, including ocular manifestations, and possibly skin or other systemic signs. The urgency and severity indicated by her perception reinforce this diagnosis's top rank.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: The ocular symptoms\u2014itchiness, redness, swelling, tearing\u2014are hallmark features of allergic conjunctivitis. While it typically does not cause airway obstruction, it often coexists with other allergic responses. Its high prevalence in allergy reactions justifies its consideration, especially as a less severe, more localized component of the allergic spectrum.  3. Diagnosis: Angioedema Justification: The swelling of the ocular tissues suggests angioedema, which can occur in allergic reactions. If facial or ocular swelling is prominent, angioedema could contribute significantly. It distinguishes itself by its cutaneous swelling, possibly involving the airway in more severe cases, aligning with her respiratory distress.  4. Diagnosis: Seasonal allergic rhinitis Justification: The ocular symptoms and possible allergic etiology point to seasonal allergic rhinitis as a common, less severe allergic disorder. Although less acute, it is part of allergic disease spectrum and might explain ocular symptoms, likely lower in probability given the severity of her airway symptoms.  5. Diagnosis: Viral conjunctivitis Justification: While ocular irritation with redness, swelling, and tearing can be viral, the presence of airway symptoms and perceived severity leans more toward allergic etiology. Nonetheless, viral conjunctivitis remains in the differential, particularly if ocular symptoms predominate with less systemic or airway involvement.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally charged language (\"really scared,\" \"everything just feels like it's closing in,\" \"overwhelmed\") to emphasize her distress. She minimizes her eye symptoms by framing them as secondary (\"just itchy and red\") and states she is \"mainly worried\" about her airway. - Information flow: She is somewhat concise, volunteering essential details but selectively emphasizing the most alarming aspects\u2014her breathing difficulties\u2014while underplaying or briefly mentioning other symptoms. - Response style: She responds directly to questions but tends to prioritize her fears, focusing on threat perception (\"worried I might pass out\"). Her responses are consistent but show a bias toward exaggerating the severity of her airway-related fears, with marginal detail about ocular symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She downplays her eye symptoms, possibly because she perceives them as less critical compared to her breathing issues, which could lead to incomplete assessment of her allergic reaction. - Minimization behaviors: She's minimizing the eye symptoms' importance, indicating a focus on airway distress as the main concern. - Amplification patterns: Her descriptions (\"everything feels like it's closing in,\" \"really scared\") amplify her perceived threat level, especially about her breathing. - Embarrassment/shame signals: None clearly evident. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight hesitation (\"I think\") about the onset of ocular symptoms, but overall coherent. - Family influence: Not apparent from responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional and threat perception bias\u2014she overemphasizes her fear of passing out and suffocation, possibly leading her to underappreciate other systemic symptoms. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her emotional response influences her reporting, but her clarity allows some confidence in key aspects. - Areas most affected: Her ocular symptoms are underreported or minimized, likely because she perceives them as less dangerous. - Reliability: Generally trustworthy regarding her primary fears, but may understate or overlook additional symptoms or signs.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Full extent and significance of her eye symptoms, potential skin or other systemic reactions, or progression of symptoms prior to arrival. - Symptoms probably minimized: Ocular symptoms\u2019 severity\u2014she may perceive them as minor compared to airway issues. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of suffocation and passing out is overemphasized, which might skew her priority perception. - True timeline: The reaction's progression may be more complex; ocular symptoms might have been more significant initially but she now focuses on airway distress.  In summary, her responses reveal a bias toward threat amplification, especially around her respiratory symptoms, coupled with minimization of ocular symptoms, possibly to divert attention toward her primary anxiety about suffocation and life-threatening airway compromise.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify remaining gaps about her ocular symptoms while being sensitive to her focus on airway issues. Key information needed includes the chronology of her ocular and airway symptoms, the severity and progression of ocular findings, and whether she has experienced similar episodes before. Since she emphasizes airway distress, prompting her to describe her eye symptoms in detail will help clarify their significance and assess whether they align with allergic conjunctivitis or other allergic manifestations like angioedema. Additionally, assessing associated systemic features, such as skin reactions or difficulty swallowing, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding. Her communication style appears emotionally charged and somewhat minimization-prone regarding eye symptoms, so questions should gently encourage elaboration without seeming dismissive. Given her concern about worsening airway compromise, framing questions around the timeline and triggers for both ocular and airway symptoms will help narrow the differential.  QUESTIONS STRATEGY: Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions to elaborate on her eye symptoms, with some yes/no or clarifying questions to specify severity and context. Information target: Onset, progression, severity, associated features, and impact of ocular symptoms; relationship between eye and airway symptoms; any previous similar episodes. Communication approach: Gently prompt her to describe her ocular symptoms more fully, emphasizing understanding her entire experience. Expected value: Clarifies whether ocular symptoms are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis, part of a more systemic allergic reaction, or something else, aiding in refining differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your eyes are itchy and red, but you've been mainly worried about your breathing.

    "input": "The patient is a 35-year-old woman presenting with an acute allergic reaction characterized by throat tightness and difficulty breathing, suggestive of a severe allergic response. She reports ocular symptoms including itching and redness, which are likely more extensive than she describes due to minimization. There is potential for additional systemic signs such as skin hives or swelling that have not been fully expressed or recognized by the patient. Her communication pattern indicates a focus on airway threat, possibly overshadowing other systemic manifestations. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the presence and severity of skin and mucosal signs, as well as to determine the overall extent of her allergic response.1. Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis Justification: The presentation with throat tightness and difficulty breathing indicates a severe systemic allergic reaction, which characterizes anaphylaxis. The ocular itching and redness support an allergic etiology. Anaphylaxis explains the airway compromise and potential systemic signs such as hives or swelling, and requires immediate intervention.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: The ocular symptoms of itching and redness are hallmark features of allergic conjunctivitis. Although these represent a less critical component than airway symptoms, they confirm an allergic etiology and are consistent with the systemic allergic response.  3. Diagnosis: Angioedema Justification: Throat tightness and potential swelling are characteristic of angioedema, which often accompanies allergies, especially in severe reactions. It explains localized swelling of mucosal tissues contributing to airway obstruction and supports the allergic process.  4. Diagnosis: Asthma (or Allergic Asthma) Justification: Difficulty breathing suggests bronchospasm or airway narrowing consistent with allergic asthma, which frequently coexists with other allergic conditions. While not explicitly stated, it is a common component of systemic allergic responses and may contribute to respiratory distress.  5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Urticaria Justification: The mention of systemic allergic signs raises suspicion of skin hives or swelling. Urticaria is common in allergic reactions and may be present even if not explicitly described, representing a typical systemic manifestation of allergy.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses highly emotional and urgent language (\u201creally scared,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d \u201cworst,\u201d \u201cpass out\u201d) which amplifies her distress, but when describing her eyes, she downplays importance (\u201cjust itchy and red,\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t really paid much attention\u201d). Her speech is rapid and emotionally charged, reflecting anxiety rather than clinical objectivity. - Information flow: She primarily offers responses centered on her immediate fears and physical sensations, often emphasizing her breathing difficulties. When asked about other symptoms like her eyes or skin, responses tend to be brief, minimizing their significance (\u201cjust itchy and red,\u201d \u201chaven\u2019t paid much attention\u201d), indicating possible emotional suppression or prioritization. Her responses are organized around her fears but sometimes lack detailed, sequential reporting, suggesting cognitive load from distress. - Response style: She tends to answer directly but with emotional emphasis, occasionally deflecting or minimizing details about non-urgent symptoms. Her focus is narrow\u2014centered on airway compromise, with less elaboration on other symptoms unless prompted.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her brief mention of eye symptoms when asked suggests she might be reluctant to describe other symptoms fully, perhaps due to emotional discomfort or perceived irrelevance. She minimizes her ocular discomfort even though she did describe it initially, which might obscure a broader picture of allergic response. - Minimization behaviors: She downplays her eye and skin symptoms (\u201cI haven\u2019t really paid much attention,\u201d \u201cjust itchy and red\u201d), possibly to focus on what she perceives as the most urgent threat. - Amplification patterns: Hyperbolic language regarding her breathing and fear of passing out (\u201creally scared I might pass out\u201d), highlighting her tendency to magnify her danger perception. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs, but the minimization of her eye and skin symptoms could suggest discomfort or embarrassment about less severe or visible symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: Her responses show a consistent focus on fears over factual clarity, but no clear evidence of disorientation or memory lapses. - Family influence: No direct evidence\u2014she reports living alone but is highly responsive to medical prompts and displays self-centered concern rather than social influence.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Catastrophizing (amplification of fears about suffocation and passing out), combined with minimization (downplaying ocular and dermatologic symptoms). Her emotional distress likely inflates perceived danger while dampening acknowledgment of potential less severe symptoms. - Severity: Moderate to severe. The immediate fear of suffocation and passing out dominates her responses, potentially leading her to overlook or underreport comorbid symptoms that could inform broader management. - Areas most affected: The anxiety-driven focus on airway emergency symptoms reduces attention to ocular and skin signs, which may overlook their actual severity or role in the allergic reaction. - Reliability: While her physical sensations are real, her emotional state could distort the full clinical picture, particularly with underreporting or minimizing non-life-threatening symptoms. Her self-reports are thus trustworthy concerning urgent symptoms but less so regarding a comprehensive allergenic profile.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed descriptions of her skin and eye symptoms, which could provide essential clues about her allergic response severity and distribution. Her tendency to dismiss or minimize these suggests possible underreporting. - Symptoms probably minimized: Ocular and dermatologic signs may be more extensive or severe than acknowledged, since she minimizes eye discomfort and skin reactions. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears related to airway compromise are exaggerated, driven by anxiety rather than objective progression based on her narrative, though her core respiratory symptoms are valid. - True timeline: Her reporting aligns with an acute onset that correlates with allergen exposure, but her emotional focus emphasizes the urgency rather than the detailed chronological evolution, potentially skewing clinical assessment assessments toward immediate airway threat at the expense of comprehensive allergy evaluation.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, high-yield questions to clarify the extent and nature of her allergic symptoms beyond airway issues, given her focus on breathing. Clarify whether skin or ocular signs are more widespread or severe than she reports, to assess systemic allergy severity.

Inquire about potential triggers, family history of allergies, or asthma, which could support or refine the differential diagnosis. Given her emotional state, questions should be gentle yet specific to elicit accurate information. The goal is to distinguish between primarily airway vs. systemic allergic manifestations, and to gauge the overall severity and risk factors.

The immediate fear of suffocation and passing out dominates her responses, potentially leading her to overlook or underreport comorbid symptoms that could inform broader management. - Areas most affected: The anxiety-driven focus on airway emergency symptoms reduces attention to ocular and skin signs, which may overlook their actual severity or role in the allergic reaction. - Reliability: While her physical sensations are real, her emotional state could distort the full clinical picture, particularly with underreporting or minimizing non-life-threatening symptoms. Her self-reports are thus trustworthy concerning urgent symptoms but less so regarding a comprehensive allergenic profile.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Detailed descriptions of her skin and eye symptoms, which could provide essential clues about her allergic response severity and distribution. Her tendency to dismiss or minimize these suggests possible underreporting. - Symptoms probably minimized: Ocular and dermatologic signs may be more extensive or severe than acknowledged, since she minimizes eye discomfort and skin reactions. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears related to airway compromise are exaggerated, driven by anxiety rather than objective progression based on her narrative, though her core respiratory symptoms are valid. - True timeline: Her reporting aligns with an acute onset that correlates with allergen exposure, but her emotional focus emphasizes the urgency rather than the detailed chronological evolution, potentially skewing clinical assessment assessments toward immediate airway threat at the expense of comprehensive allergy evaluation.",

    "input": "The patient is a 35-year-old woman presenting with an acute allergic reaction characterized by airway tightness and difficulty breathing, which she perceives as severe. She reports ocular itching and redness, and evidence suggests the presence of facial swelling and urticarial bumps, likely more extensive than she describes. Physical signs probably include widespread urticaria, angioedema, and conjunctival erythema, which may be underreported due to emotional focus on airway concerns. Her symptoms developed rapidly, indicating systemic involvement, but her communication pattern suggests the actual severity of skin and eye signs may be more significant. Further examination is needed to confirm the full extent of dermatologic and ocular findings, and assessment of her allergy history is indicated.Anaphylaxis with conjunctivitis and urticaria ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotional and sometimes minimizing language (\"not that bad before,\" \"really scared\") which reflects an attempt to control her narrative or avoid admitting severity. - Information flow: She tends to focus on her most distressing symptoms (breathing difficulty) and downplay others (eye, skin symptoms). Her responses are somewhat organized but biased towards emphasizing respiratory distress. - Response style: She gives somewhat elaborate explanations about her fear and severity but tends to minimize specific symptoms that she perceives as less immediately threatening.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Downplaying the severity of her eye and skin symptoms, possibly due to embarrassment or anxiety about perceived overreaction. - Minimization behaviors: Describing her eye symptoms as \"not that bad\" when physical exam reveals redness and swelling, indicating she might minimize overall symptom severity. - Amplification patterns: Her expression of intense fear, particularly about suffocation and passing out, suggests emotional amplification that may heighten her perceived danger beyond clinical reality. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Limited; more likely she is trying to appear less anxious or overreacting. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: Her mention of family history of asthma might subtly influence her perception of risk, possibly amplifying her concern.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification bias\u2014heightened fear and distress amplify perceived danger, especially related to airway compromise. - Severity: Moderate\u2014her responses are heavily emotionally charged, impacting objectivity but still contain factual data. - Areas most affected: Her ocular and skin symptoms are likely underreported; her respiratory fears are appropriately highlighted. - Reliability: Moderate\u2014her distress may lead her to overstate fears but also to underreport or minimize certain physical findings intentionally.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details on the full extent of skin and eye involvement; she might underreport swelling or hives. - Symptoms probably minimized: Her ocular and skin findings are more severe than acknowledged, which could influence treatment plans. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of suffocation and passing out appears exaggerated by her emotional state, possibly leading to increased anxiety-driven responses. - True timeline: Her perception of rapid onset aligns with clinical presentation, but her focus on immediate distress might overshadow earlier subtle symptoms or gradual development of other signs.",
    "output": "THINKING: Given her prior responses, the patient has emphasized her breathing difficulty, which she perceives as severe, but she has somewhat minimized her eye and skin symptoms. To confirm or clarify the diagnosis of anaphylaxis or allergic reaction, I need to assess whether her ocular and skin signs meet specific diagnostic criteria\u2014such as extent of swelling, presence of urticaria, or conjunctival involvement. Because her emotional distress and tendency to downplay certain symptoms may obscure the full clinical picture, I should ask focused, yet sensitive questions about these aspects. I want to explore whether her eye and skin findings are more extensive\u2014possible indicators of systemic allergic response\u2014and ensure no red flags (e.g., worsening swelling, difficulty swallowing) are present. Additionally, since her history is relevant, understanding her past allergy experiences or similar reactions will further support diagnostic certainty. Finally, assessing her understanding and concern about her symptoms will help prepare for discussing management options.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, nearly confirmatory questions about skin and eye involvement, with open-ended elements for patient perspective. - Information target: Extent and progression of eye redness/swelling, presence of hives or angioedema, conjunctival status, any associated symptoms. - Communication approach: Gentle, collaborative phrasing to encourage honest reporting without feeling confronted, acknowledging her fears. - Expected value: Clarifying whether the skin and eye signs support the diagnosis of systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, guiding the next steps.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, it sounds like your breathing has been quite distressing, which we definitely need to focus on. I\u2019d like to ask a bit more about your eyes and skin\u2014can you tell me if there has been any swelling around your eyes, or if you've noticed any hives or redness on your skin beyond the eye area? Also, have your eye symptoms\u2014like redness or itchiness\u2014spread or become more severe at all since they started? Understanding how much these parts are involved will help us determine how serious this reaction might be.\"",
