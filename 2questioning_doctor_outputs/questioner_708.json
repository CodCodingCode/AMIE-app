    "input": "An adult female presents with recent onset of episodes characterized by sweating, chills, and headaches. She expresses concern about her health status, with no additional symptoms reported at this time. The clinical presentation may be consistent with mild viral illness or stress-related symptoms, though the severity perceived by the patient could be amplified by emotional distress. Further detailed history, including symptom duration, associated systemic signs, and possible triggers, is necessary to refine the clinical assessment.1. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma Justification: Paroxysmal episodes of sweating, chills, and headaches are classic for catecholamine-secreting tumors; this is a critical diagnosis not to miss due to potential hypertensive crises.  2. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia (possibly insulinoma) Justification: Sweating, chills, and headache can be symptoms of low blood sugar episodes, especially if episodic; important to consider due to risk of neuroglycopenia.  3. Diagnosis: Panic attack / Anxiety disorder Justification: Stress-related episodes presenting with autonomic symptoms like sweating and headache; common and often initially presumed.  4. Diagnosis: Hypertensive crisis / Malignant hypertension Justification: Headaches with sweating and chills can occur with hypertensive episodes; however, absence of documented hypertension makes it less likely but still possible.  5. Diagnosis: Thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) Justification: Excess thyroid hormones can cause episodic sweating, headaches, and feeling of distress; common in women aged 50s.  6. Diagnosis: Menopause-related vasomotor symptoms Justification: Fluctuations in estrogen can cause hot flashes, sweating, and headaches; especially relevant in women around menopause.  7. Diagnosis: Viral illness or viral syndrome Justification: Mild viral or systemic illness may cause sweating and malaise; less likely to present with recurrent episodes without other systemic symptoms.  8. Diagnosis: Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) Justification: Can cause episodic autonomic symptoms including sweating and headaches, though less specific.  9. Diagnosis: Carcinoid syndrome Justification: Episodic flushing, sweating, and headaches may be present; however, other systemic signs are usually notable, making it less likely initially.  10. Diagnosis: Infectious or febrile illness (early or mild) Justification: Chills and headaches could be initial signs, but symptoms are recent episodes rather than ongoing fever, so less supportive.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged, specific descriptions (\"feeling very hot and sweaty,\" \"chills,\" \"headaches\") but does not minimize symptoms. Her focus on worry and distress colors her language, making her responses appear more emotional than clinical. - Information flow: She volunteers her symptoms directly and clearly, indicating openness. However, her emphasis on distress may lead her to over-report severity at the expense of nuanced details. Her responses are organized around her core concerns without tangential details. - Response style: She provides concise, emotionally expressive responses aligned with her anxiety. She does not attempt to downplay her symptoms but may overstate the impact due to worry.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence of withholding information; she appears open about her symptoms. - Minimization behaviors: Not evident; she describes her symptoms as intense and problematic. - Amplification patterns: Her language and focus on distress and worst-case fears suggest her concerns are likely amplified by anxiety.

    "input": "An adult female presents with subjective reports of sensations of heat, sweating, chills, and headaches occurring within the recent past. The patient expresses health concerns and worries about her pregnancy, with emotional distress potentially amplifying her perception of symptom severity. Objective clinical findings have not yet been documented at this point, and vital signs or physical exam findings are necessary for further assessment. The clinical picture is likely to involve mild, nonspecific symptoms related to stress, anxiety, or a mild viral illness. Additional history and objective data are needed to determine the precise etiology and severity of her condition.1. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Stress-Induced Symptoms Justification: Emotional distress and worries about pregnancy can heighten perception of physical symptoms like heat, sweating, and headaches, common in anxiety states.  2. Diagnosis: Viral Illness (e.g., Influenza or other febrile illnesses) Justification: Symptoms such as chills, sweating, headache, and subjective heat may represent a mild viral process, especially if an infectious cause is suspected.  3. Diagnosis: Early pregnancy-related hormonal changes (e.g., fluctuations in estrogen or progesterone) Justification: Hormonal shifts in pregnancy can cause vasomotor symptoms like heat sensations and associated headache.  4. Diagnosis: Perimenopausal Symptoms Justification: Although less common in pregnant women, vasomotor symptoms mimic hot flashes and could be relevant if age-related.  5. Diagnosis: Preeclampsia (early or atypical presentation) Justification: Headache and abnormal sensations can be signs, but typically accompanied by hypertension and proteinuria, which are not yet documented.  6. Diagnosis: Fever of Unknown Origin (Fever) Justification: The sensation of chills and sweating may be due to low-grade fever, although objective fever detection is needed.  7. Diagnosis: Thyroid Dysfunction (e.g., Hyperthyroidism) Justification: Symptoms such as heat intolerance, sweating, headache, and nervousness can suggest hyperthyroidism.  8. Diagnosis: Hormonal Imbalance or Endocrine Disorders (e.g., adrenal issues) Justification: Dysregulation of hormonal axes can produce heat sensations and associated symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Delirium or Psychiatric Disorder (e.g., somatic symptom disorder) Justification: Emotional distress and perceived symptoms could be amplified by psychological factors, though less likely without more evidence.  10. Diagnosis: Meningitis or Central Nervous System Infection Justification: Headache and sensations of chills could be early signs, but absence of other neurological signs makes this less likely at this point.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses specific, emotionally charged language (\u201cvery hot and sweaty,\u201d \u201ckeep having chills,\u201d \u201cheadaches,\u201d \u201cworried\u201d) indicating genuine concern but also increasing her anxiety. She is descriptive about her physical sensations but tends to voice her fears openly, which suggests sincerity but also an emotional overlay that could magnify her perception of severity. Her responses are concise initially but contain emotionally laden phrases that underscore her concern for her health and her baby. - Information flow: She readily volunteers her primary symptoms without prompting, reflecting openness, though her responses are emotionally colored and somewhat reactive. Her responses are organized around her symptoms and worries but lack detailed descriptions of the timeline unless specifically asked, indicating some discomfort discussing her history or fears beyond her current distress. - Response style: She tends to be straightforward about what she feels but communicates with a soft, worried tone, which may limit elaboration. Her style is mostly direct when mentioning symptoms but less descriptive about her medical history or emotional state unless engaged explicitly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: No clear evidence\u2014she provides enough detail about her symptoms and fears. However, her reluctance to discuss past health issues or previous episodes may suggest some hesitance or concern about sharing information she perceives as unimportant or that could reflect poorly on her. - Minimization behaviors: No overt minimization noted; she seems to be emphasizing her symptoms strongly and expressively, which is more consistent with amplification. - Amplification patterns: Evident in her emotionally charged descriptions and focus on worst-case outcomes (\"Will I lose her?\"). Her detailed description of symptoms combined with her worry signifies an amplification bias rooted in anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not explicitly present; her tone indicates openness rather than discomfort, although her worry and vulnerability suggest a possible underlying shame about her health status or fear of judgment. - Confusion/memory issues: No significant signs; her timeline appears consistent and logical. - Family influence: Not evident in this excerpt; responses seem internally driven with no external input apparent.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be **anxiety-driven symptom amplification and catastrophic thinking**. She overemphasizes the severity of her symptoms and focuses heavily on fearful outcomes, likely influenced by her emotional distress. - Severity: Moderate to severe\u2014her emotional distress impacts her report, making it challenging to gauge the exact severity of her physical illness. Her anxiety may cause her to perceive her symptoms as more severe than they are, potentially leading to overestimation of her condition. - Areas most affected: Her description of symptoms and fears about her pregnancy are most biased, likely leading her to overstate the urgency. - Reliability: Her self-reporting is influenced by her high anxiety; clinical interpretation should consider that her perceived severity may be inflated by emotional state.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might not be fully aware of or willing to share past health issues, or details about her actual mental state, which could influence symptom perception. Also, she may downplay or omit mild symptoms that do not seem urgent or that she considers unimportant. - Symptoms probably minimized: Serious underlying causes or earlier subtle symptoms could be unreported if she perceives them as less urgent. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fear of losing her baby and her own health likely exaggerates her perceived risk, driven by her anxious state. - True timeline: Her reported timeline is plausible but could be amplified by her anxiety; actual symptom progression might be less intense or more gradual.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with complaints of ongoing chills, sensation of fever unrelieved by medication, headaches, diffuse muscle aches, chest discomfort, and weakness, with concern regarding her pregnancy. While her subjective report emphasizes severe and persistent symptoms, objective clinical evaluation\u2014such as vital signs and physical exam\u2014is needed to determine whether her signs are consistent with a viral illness or other pathology. Considering her communication pattern suggests emotional amplification bias, the actual physical severity may be mild to moderate. Further assessment will be necessary to evaluate her physical health status and address her emotional concerns.1. Diagnosis: Viral Influenza Justification: The patient reports ongoing chills, sensation of fever, headaches, diffuse muscle aches, and weakness\u2014classic symptoms of influenza. These symptoms are typical of a viral systemic illness, and especially common in the context of an adult female presenting acutely with such symptoms. The persistent nature and systemic features align with influenza, which often causes these constitutional symptoms. It explains her complaints well, especially if her physical exam reveals mild to moderate signs of illness.  2. Diagnosis: Other Viral Respiratory Infection (e.g., COVID-19 or other coronavirus) Justification: Similar to influenza, other viral respiratory infections can cause systemic symptoms such as chills, myalgia, headache, and weakness. Given the current epidemiological context, COVID-19 remains a differential, especially with overlapping features. These can cause persistent systemic symptoms and chest discomfort, and are distinguished by specific testing.  3. Diagnosis: Early Pregnancy-Related Hyperemesis or Systemic Response Justification: While nausea and vomiting are common with pregnancy, systemic symptoms like chills, fever sensations, and muscle aches are less typical for uncomplicated pregnancy. However, if the patient is pregnant, hyperemesis or infection related to pregnancy (e.g., pyelonephritis) could be contributing. The concern for pregnancy indicates need to exclude pregnancy-related complications, but symptoms are less specific for obstetric causes, so this ranks lower.  4. Diagnosis: Bacterial Infection (e.g., Urinary Tract Infection or Pneumonia) Justification: The chest discomfort and systemic symptoms could signify a bacterial pneumonia or urinary tract infection progressing to systemic illness like sepsis. Although her symptoms are non-specific, bacterial causes are possible, especially if physical exam or labs suggest localized infection. These are less probable without more specific findings but remain in consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Non-infectious causes such as autoimmune or other systemic inflammatory conditions Justification: While autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus) can cause systemic symptoms, the acute presentation with predominant chills, fever sensation, and muscle aches aligns less with typically more chronic autoimmune presentations. However, they might be included in a broader differential once infectious causes are ruled out, hence lower in probability but still pertinent.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient employs highly emotive, descriptive language, emphasizing severity (\"so bad,\" \"terrible,\" \"like I\u2019ve been beaten\") and her fears, showcasing intense emotional expression rather than neutral clinical description. - Information flow: She responds openly and elaborately, volunteering detailed symptom descriptions and fears without prompting, indicating a forthcoming communication style. Her responses are organized around emotional impact and physical symptoms. - Response style: She offers elaborate, direct answers, with a focus on her distress and concerns, possibly to seek reassurance or understanding.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: None present; she freely shares her symptoms and fears. - Minimization behaviors: Little evidence; her descriptions are intense and vivid, not downplayed. - Amplification patterns: Clear evidence\u2014she emphasizes how severe and distressing her symptoms are, using exaggerative language to stress her suffering. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slightly evident when discussing her fears for her baby; hesitations or soft speech could imply vulnerability but not overt shame. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear signs; her timeline appears consistent. - Family influence: No direct signs; responses seem internally driven, not externally influenced.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: **Emotional amplification bias** driven by her anxiety, leading her to perceive her symptoms as more severe than they might objectively be. - Severity: **Moderate to severe**, given the intensity of her language and concerns, possibly inflating symptom severity. - Areas most affected: Her perception of physical severity and fears about pregnancy outcomes are most biased, which could influence her self-report accuracy. - Reliability: Overall, her report reliably conveys her emotional state and the presence of symptoms but may overstate their physical severity due to her anxiety-driven amplification.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She might be underreporting adaptive behaviors or reassurance-seeking behaviors; she may also overlook less distressing symptoms. - Symptoms probably minimized: Mild or less concerning symptoms, such as fatigue or minor aches, could be understated amidst her focus on severe pain and discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears of losing her baby or worsening condition are likely heightened by her anxiety, possibly overestimating the danger. - True timeline: Symptom progression might be rapid and distressing for her, but her emotional bias could make her perceive it as more severe or urgent than the physiological reality.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Clinical reasoning: The patient's intense emotional expression may be influencing her perception of symptom severity. To narrow the differential, I need to clarify the specific characteristics of her fevers, chills, and other systemic symptoms, including whether she has any associated respiratory or obstetric symptoms. - Diagnostic priorities: Differentiating between viral illnesses\u2014such as influenza versus COVID-19\u2014is crucial, as symptoms overlap but management differs. Also, assessing for signs of obstetric complications secondary to infection, like pyelonephritis or early pregnancy issues, is important given her pregnancy concerns. - Patient factors: Since she communicates via emotive language and elaboration, questions should be focused but gentle, confirming details without causing distress or seeming dismissive. - Interview phase goals: To obtain precise symptom descriptions (onset, duration, pattern), explore associated symptoms, and identify red flags that might suggest more serious pathology.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused and confirmatory questions to parse symptom details, with open-ended elements to allow her to elaborate if needed. - Information target: The quality, timing, progression, and triggers or alleviating factors of her symptoms, especially fever and chills; associated respiratory or systemic symptoms; obstetric status. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic questions that acknowledge her distress and seek clarity without minimizing her feelings. - Expected value: Clarifies the nature and severity of her systemic symptoms, helps distinguish infectious causes, assesses pregnancy-related risks, and guides potential next steps.\nANSWER: \u201cYou mentioned experiencing persistent chills and a sensation of fever that doesn\u2019t go away with medication\u2014can you tell me more about when these chills started and how they come and go?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Viral Conjunctivitis Justification: The presentation of redness, tearing, and swelling following physical activity is consistent with viral conjunctivitis, common after exposure to viral pathogens or environmental triggers during outdoor activities. The bilateral nature (implied by tearing and swelling) supports this, and onset within 2 days aligns with typical incubation periods. No mention of severe pain or vision loss makes more serious infections less likely.  2. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: The eye swelling and tearing could also be reactive to allergens, perhaps from outdoor exposure or pollen during soccer. Allergic conjunctivitis can develop rapidly and cause redness, swelling, and tearing without pain, aligning with presented symptoms. It is less likely than viral but still probable.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal Abrasion Justification: Physical activity like soccer poses a risk for minor eye trauma causing a corneal abrasion, which can lead to redness, tearing, and swelling. The recent onset after an injury supports this; however, typical symptoms include significant pain and photophobia, which are not described here, making it a plausible but slightly less likely diagnosis.  4. Diagnosis: Bacterial Conjunctivitis Justification: Although less characteristic given the non-specific description, bacterial conjunctivitis can present with redness and tearing. It typically involves mucopurulent discharge\u2014information not provided\u2014so it's lower in probability but still a consideration.  5. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Uveitis can cause redness and swelling but usually presents with pain, photophobia, and vision changes. The lack of these symptoms makes uveitis less likely at this stage, but it remains in the differential due to eye redness and swelling.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged language (\u201creally badly,\u201d \u201cso weak,\u201d \u201cburning inside\u201d) to describe her symptoms, highlighting her distress. She tends to be specific about the intensity and impact but does not include objective descriptors (like exact temperature or vital signs). - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions especially about her feelings of severity and fear, driven by her anxiety. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, with a tendency toward magnification, focusing on how terrible her symptoms feel to her, possibly to elicit urgency from the clinician.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not withhold information but may omit contextual details like recent travel or insect bites, possibly assuming they are irrelevant or too obvious. - Minimization behaviors: Rare; she emphasizes her symptoms instead of downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: Clear, especially in describing how intense and disturbing her symptoms are (\u201cburning inside,\u201d \u201cshaking badly,\u201d \u201cso cold I can\u2019t stop shivering\u201d), indicating her anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No indications; her openness and emotional tone suggest strong concern rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: No explicit evidence; responses appear internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety Amplifier \u2014 her tendency to magnify symptoms out of concern and worry about her health and her unborn baby. - Severity: Moderate, as her descriptions are vivid and emotionally intense, which could distort an objective clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Severity and urgency of her symptoms, especially chest pain, weakness, and chills. - Reliability: Moderate \u2014 her emotional state influences her perception, but her core symptoms are real and significant.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not report subtle signs of recovery or milder symptoms; her focus is on the most severe complaints. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs like actual fever measurements or vital signs are not available, and her subjective exaggeration could overstate her physiological status. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of losing her baby and her own life likely heighten her perception of threat. - True timeline: Likely accurate for symptom onset; emotional overlay enhances perceived severity but does not distort the initial timeline.

    "behavioral_cues": "COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses emotionally charged language (\u201creally badly,\u201d \u201cso weak,\u201d \u201cburning inside\u201d) to describe her symptoms, highlighting her distress. She tends to be specific about the intensity and impact but does not include objective descriptors (like exact temperature or vital signs). - Information flow: She is generally forthcoming, volunteering detailed descriptions especially about her feelings of severity and fear, driven by her anxiety. - Response style: Her responses are elaborative, with a tendency toward magnification, focusing on how terrible her symptoms feel to her, possibly to elicit urgency from the clinician.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: She does not withhold information but may omit contextual details like recent travel or insect bites, possibly assuming they are irrelevant or too obvious. - Minimization behaviors: Rare; she emphasizes her symptoms instead of downplaying them. - Amplification patterns: Clear, especially in describing how intense and disturbing her symptoms are (\u201cburning inside,\u201d \u201cshaking badly,\u201d \u201cso cold I can\u2019t stop shivering\u201d), indicating her anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No indications; her openness and emotional tone suggest strong concern rather than shame. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident; her timeline is consistent. - Family influence: No explicit evidence; responses appear internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Anxiety Amplifier \u2014 her tendency to magnify symptoms out of concern and worry about her health and her unborn baby. - Severity: Moderate, as her descriptions are vivid and emotionally intense, which could distort an objective clinical picture. - Areas most affected: Severity and urgency of her symptoms, especially chest pain, weakness, and chills. - Reliability: Moderate \u2014 her emotional state influences her perception, but her core symptoms are real and significant.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: She may not report subtle signs of recovery or milder symptoms; her focus is on the most severe complaints. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical signs like actual fever measurements or vital signs are not available, and her subjective exaggeration could overstate her physiological status. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of losing her baby and her own life likely heighten her perception of threat. - True timeline: Likely accurate for symptom onset; emotional overlay enhances perceived severity but does not distort the initial timeline.  (Note: Overall, her communication reflects high anxiety leading to symptom amplification which should be considered when evaluating her clinical status.)",

    "input": "The patient is a middle-aged woman presenting with intermittent episodes of chills, sensation of internal heat, headache, muscle aches, and weakness persisting over several days, unrelieved by medication. She reports feeling significantly ill and distressed about her and her baby's health. Physical examination and further history are needed to exclude infectious causes and assess potential exposures, with attention to psychological factors that may influence symptom perception.Viral or Bacterial Systemic Infection ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses emotionally laden descriptions (\"really bad,\" \"so weak I can't even stand up,\" \"frightening\") alongside some vague references (\"burning inside\"), indicating distress but some difficulty quantifying sensations. - Information flow: She responds directly but with emotional emphasis, providing core symptoms but little background unless prompted. - Response style: She provides concise yet emotionally charged responses, emphasizing distress but not elaborating on potential triggers or contextual details.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; seems willing to describe symptoms but does not detail potential exposure risks such as recent insect bites or travel, which are crucial for malaria assessment. - Minimization behaviors: Slight, with statements like \"even when I\u2019ve just taken medicine,\" suggesting she may underplay symptom persistence or severity. - Amplification patterns: Clear, especially with descriptors like \"really bad,\" \"so weak,\" and \"frightening,\" fueling her apparent distress. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Not strongly indicated; language is straightforward. - Confusion/memory issues: None evident. - Family influence: Evidence of concern for her baby's safety influences her emotional expression but no explicit family influence on responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Emotional amplification with minor minimization; her elevated distress levels likely exaggerate her perceived severity but responses are coherent. - Severity: Moderate; her concern and emotional language could lead to overestimation of symptom danger but overall responses are consistent. - Areas most affected: Her perception of weakness, fear for the baby, and severity of symptoms. - Reliability: Moderate; emotional distress might inflate perceived severity, so some responses may reflect anxiety more than objective symptom severity.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Details about recent insect exposure, prior episodes, travel history, or specific symptom triggers are not reported, possibly due to focus on distress. - Symptoms probably minimized: She might be underreporting episodic symptom fluctuations or specific intervals of symptom intensity. - Concerns probably amplified: Her fears about her baby and herself are heightened, possibly overestimating danger. - True timeline: The progression appears consistent without distortion; however, emotional amplification affects her subjective experience.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify remaining gaps that could clarify or confirm a systemic infectious process, considering her distress and symptoms. Since she reports persistent chills, fever sensations, weakness, and distress but lacks specific details on potential exposures or symptom timing, I need to explore these areas delicately but thoroughly. Confirming whether her symptoms align with infectious criteria (e.g., pattern, associated symptoms, exposures) is critical. Also, her emotional state suggests the need for compassionate framing to promote disclosure and reduce anxiety. This question should focus on identifying possible infectious exposures or triggers that could differentiate between types of systemic infections and rule out other causes.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exposure history (e.g., recent travel, insect bites, contact with sick individuals), specific symptom patterns, and progression. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify infectious risks such as malaria, bacterial infections, or other systemic illnesses. - Patient factors: Emotional distress and emotional language might obscure specific details; questions need to be empathetic and open-ended. - Interview phase goals: Confirm or rule out infectious causes by exploring potential exposure, symptom specifics, and timing.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, open-ended questions that allow her to elaborate on exposures and symptom patterns while providing space to express concerns. - Information target: Recent activities, exposures, onset, and progression of symptoms. - Communication approach: Gentle, empathetic phrasing to encourage honesty and reduce fear. - Expected value: Gather critical exposure history to differentiate infectious causes, supporting diagnostic certainty and planning further tests if needed.\nANSWER: \"Thank you for sharing that. I\u2019d like to understand a little more about whether anything in your recent activities might have put you at risk\u2014such as traveling somewhere, being around anyone sick, or any insect bites or other exposures you've noticed? Also, can you tell me more about how these symptoms have been changing day by day or over the past few days\u2014are they the same all the time, or do they come and go in any pattern?\"",
