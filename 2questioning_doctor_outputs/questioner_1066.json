    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are hallmark signs; common in young active individuals, especially with exposure to environmental irritants or infectious agents.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body Justification: Recent soccer activity increases risk of ocular trauma, which can introduce a foreign body causing redness and tearing.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma during sports can cause superficial corneal injury, presenting with redness, tearing, and discomfort.  4. Diagnosis: Eyelid abscess or cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness could represent infection of eyelid tissues, especially if trauma created an entry point for bacteria.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic hyphema Justification: Trauma from sports may cause bleeding into the anterior chamber, leading to ocular redness and swelling; less common but important to consider.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Though less likely without systemic signs, the swelling could reflect deeper infection following trauma, especially if progression occurs.  7. Diagnosis: Intraocular foreign body Justification: With trauma and persistent symptoms, intraocular foreign bodies must be considered; can cause redness and tearing.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less likely without systemic or pain findings, but ocular inflammation can present with conjunctival injection.  9. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: Usually presents with pain, photophobia, and dendritic corneal ulceration, but trauma may predispose to viral reactivation.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Rare given the presentation, but ocular trauma can sometimes precipitate secondary glaucoma; relies on pain, visual changes, not specified here.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses mostly specific terms like \"swollen lumps,\" \"rash,\" \"fevers,\" but tends toward straightforward descriptions without exaggeration, indicating honest but potentially cautious reporting. - Information flow: He's forthcoming in initial symptom description but avoids elaboration about severity or emotional impact unless prompted, showing organized but somewhat guarded communication. - Response style: Responses are concise and direct, with limited elaboration, possibly reflecting a desire to avoid sounding overly alarmed or causing concern.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Minimal; the patient appears willing to share all relevant symptoms without evident reluctance. - Minimization behaviors: Slight underplaying of symptom severity, especially regarding fatigue (\"really tired\" without indicating how debilitating), potentially to appear less vulnerable. - Amplification patterns: None detected. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No signs of discomfort; he seems open about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: No evidence. - Family influence: Not apparent, as responses seem internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Mild minimization bias; he may be underestimating the severity of symptoms or their impact. - Severity: Mild, given overall openness but possible underplaying of discomfort. - Areas most affected: Symptom severity reporting\u2014he only states \"really tired,\" which might underrepresent actual distress. - Reliability: Reasonably reliable, though some nuances about how symptoms affect him might be understated.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true severity of fatigue and discomfort, which could be more debilitating than reported. - Symptoms probably minimized: Extent and impact of fatigue and possibly lymph node discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about the seriousness appears genuine and not exaggerated. - True timeline: The reported timeline seems consistent; however, actual ongoing or worsening symptoms might be underreported if he's trying to avoid sounding too ill.

Since he used straightforward language without much detail, it\u2019s also important to validate his experience while encouraging further sharing.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Extent of symptom severity, associated symptoms (pain, vision changes), emotional impact, and any previous episodes or interventions. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify the nature and character of symptoms, and assess if there are signs pointing toward infections, trauma, or other ocular conditions. - Patient factors: The patient appears concise and cautious, so questions should be non-threatening and open-ended, encouraging elaboration without pressure. - Interview phase goals: Establish rapport, understand subjective experience, and gather contextual details about the symptom timeline and impact.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended - Information target: Symptom characteristics, how symptoms evolved, impact on daily activities, emotional response. - Communication approach: Gentle, validating, inviting the patient to describe his experience in his own words. - Expected value: Will provide richer detail about the patient's perception, help identify any troubling features, and guide further focused inquiries.\nANSWER: \"Tell me more about what you've been experiencing with your eye\u2014what does it feel like, and how has it been affecting you day to day since it started?\"",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a three-week history of fatigue, palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck and axillary regions, skin rash, intermittent fevers, and ocular redness with a foreign-body sensation. While the patient describes these as moderate and bothersome, the communication pattern suggests that the actual physical findings such as lymph node size, tenderness, or systemic symptom severity may be more pronounced than reported. Additional clinical assessment is needed to evaluate lymph node characteristics, identify other systemic features like night sweats or weight loss, and perform relevant laboratory and imaging studies to determine the underlying etiology.1. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Justification: Features such as skin rash, ocular redness, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue are characteristic of SLE, an autoimmune disease that often presents with multisystem involvement including skin, joints, and mucous membranes. The presence of skin rash and ocular symptoms suggests immune-mediated pathology.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV infection) Justification: Fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and possibly sore throat and splenomegaly are typical of EBV-related infectious mononucleosis, common in adults, with these features fitting the timeline.  3. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin) Justification: Persistent lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like fever, and possibly a skin rash could point toward lymphoid malignancy; these are crucial \"red flag\" diagnoses to exclude.  4. Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection Justification: Similar to EBV, CMV can cause febrile illness with lymphadenopathy, rash, and eye symptoms, especially in immunocompromised patients; less common but plausible.  5. Diagnosis: Drug reaction or Drug-Induced Lymphadenopathy Justification: If recent medication exposure is present, drug hypersensitivity reactions can cause lymphadenopathy, rash, and systemic symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis Justification: This granulomatous disease often involves lymphadenopathy, skin rash, and ocular involvement; common in adults.  7. Diagnosis: Secondary Syphilis Justification: Can present with generalized lymphadenopathy, rash, and ocular signs; important to consider in sexually active adults.  8. Diagnosis: Allergic or Immune-Mediated Skin Conditions Justification: While less systemic, allergic dermatitis or other immune skin conditions could explain rash and ocular redness, but less likely to cause prolonged systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Viral Hepatitis or other viral infections Justification: Some hepatitis viruses can cause systemic symptoms including lymphadenopathy and rash, although less characteristic.  10. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Extrapulmonary) Justification: TB can cause persistent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms; skin and ocular involvement are less typical but possible in disseminated disease.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague and hedging language (\"kind of,\" \"a little,\" \"not that bad\") which can obscure true symptom severity. Emotional expressions like \"worried\" and \"not sure\" reveal underlying anxiety but are tempered by cautious phrasing. - Information flow: He provides essential details but includes peripheral information or qualifiers, possibly to gauge the acceptability or to seek reassurance. His responses are organized but sprinkled with tangential stories, indicating a mixture of openness and guardedness. - Response style: Responses are elaborative but often contain hesitations and qualifiers, reflecting a tendency to second-guess or understate conditions.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitations, qualifiers, and slightly downplayed descriptions (e.g., \"not that bad,\" \"a little rash\") suggest mild withholding or minimization. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions of symptoms as \"not that bad\" or \"a little\" might hide the true severity. - Amplification patterns: His worry and concern about possible serious illness are genuine but not exaggerated; more reflective of underlying anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Slight nervous fidgeting and hesitations point to discomfort, but no overt shame about symptoms. - Confusion/memory issues: The consistent timeline suggests no significant memory problems. - Family influence: No overt indication but his cautious tone may be influenced by concerns about health or how others might perceive his symptoms.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Slight minimization, due to hesitance in fully emphasizing severity and non-specific language. - Severity: Mild, because he discloses key symptoms but tends to dilute their potential seriousness. - Areas most affected: The physical symptoms\u2014rashes, lumps, and lymphadenopathy\u2014are most likely understated. - Reliability: Moderate; he seems honest but cautious, so some symptoms may be more severe than he admits.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Potentially more severe systemic symptoms or higher concern related to his risk factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: The physical manifestation (rash, lumps) may be more intense or alarming than expressed. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about severity suggests he is overanalyzing mild symptoms, increasing his anxiety. - True timeline: The progression might be more rapid or intense, but his cautiousness leads to possible underreporting of severity or urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use systematic reasoning to identify what's missing and what needs further exploration. The patient has a complex presentation with potential autoimmune, infectious, or neoplastic causes. Key missing info includes details on the exact nature and severity of the skin rash, the size and tenderness of lymph nodes, presence of other systemic symptoms like night sweats or weight loss, and any recent exposures or medication changes. Gathering more about the timeline, progression, and patient perceptions will help prioritize differential diagnoses. Since the patient shows some minimization and hesitance, questions need to validate his experience while probing deeper into the physical findings and associated systemic features.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Open-ended, to encourage elaboration on physical symptoms, systemic features, and emotional impact. - Information target: Details of rash characteristics, lymph node exam, systemic symptoms, and possible triggers or exposures. - Communication approach: Sensitive, validating, and reassuring to build trust and overcome hesitations. - Expected value: Enhance understanding of symptom severity, identify any alarming features, and deepen rapport for further assessment.\nANSWER: \"Can you tell me more about how your skin rash looks\u2014like its size, color, or how it feels\u2014and if you've noticed any changes in the lymph nodes you mentioned?

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or minor trauma Justification: The acute onset following playing soccer suggests mechanical injury to the cornea; redness, tearing, and swelling are common signs of corneal epithelial compromise, especially after sports activities involving physical contact or risk of blunt trauma.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: The symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling are characteristic of conjunctival inflammation; recent physical activity might facilitate pathogen exposure or contribute to irritation, making conjunctivitis highly probable.  3. Diagnosis: Keratitis (viral or bacterial corneal infection) Justification: Although less common without significant pain or vision change, minor trauma can introduce pathogens causing keratitis; symptoms align with superficial corneal involvement, especially if the trauma facilitated infection.  4. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: While less likely given the brief symptom duration and absence of other signs such as pain or photophobia, uveitis can cause redness and swelling, warranting consideration if other causes are ruled out or symptoms evolve.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Less likely primary cause given recent activity and lack of allergy history; however, swelling and tearing are compatible features, so it remains in differential but lower priority.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses often vague and minimizing language, such as \"not really all over\" and \"a little,\" along with hedging words like \"kind of\" and \"a bit,\" which suggest downplaying symptoms or uncertainty. They occasionally use emotional language indicating concern, but mostly maintain a neutral tone. - Information flow: They seem to share initial details readily but become less forthcoming when probing for more serious systemic symptoms, showing reluctance to fully disclose. Responses are organized but alternated with hedging, indicating some degree of guardedness. - Response style: Mostly elaborative when describing primary symptoms but become more tentative and vague on the progression of systemic signs, showing response pattern shifts based on question complexity.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hesitance or vagueness about night sweats, weight loss, and other systemic symptoms suggest possible withholding of more serious concerns. - Minimization behaviors: Consistent downplaying of symptoms (\"not really all over,\" \"doesn\u2019t itch much,\" \"a little tender\") indicates he may be underestimating symptom severity. - Amplification patterns: No evidence of over-exaggeration; responses tend to be understated. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs but slight nervousness and fidgeting, particularly when mentioning sensitive health topics, suggest some discomfort. - Confusion/memory issues: No apparent inconsistencies in the timeline or details. - Family influence: No evidence that external influence affects responses.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization bias, given the hedging and downplaying, especially on symptoms like systemic systemic signs and severity. - Severity: Moderate, since the patient is not fully denying symptoms but clearly minimizes their significance, which could hinder accurate clinical assessment. - Areas most affected: Systemic symptoms such as night sweats, weight loss, and overall disease severity. Also, vulnerability to underreporting the extent of symptoms. - Reliability: Moderate; while he is honest about his feelings and concerns, he likely underreports the severity, requiring careful follow-up and probing.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: More severe systemic indicators such as night sweats, significant weight loss, or fainting episodes may be underreported. The patient might also be downplaying the extent of the rash or lymphadenopathy severity. - Symptoms probably minimized: Advanced constitutional symptoms and systemic signs that require thorough investigation. - Concerns probably amplified: Moderate anxiety about health but not over-worried; the subtle hedging indicates some degree of defense mechanism, not exaggerated fears. - True timeline: The progression as reported seems consistent but may underestimate symptom severity at earlier stages due to minimization.

    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps include details about systemic and constitutional symptoms like night sweats, weight changes, fever, or fatigue, which could point toward infectious or hematologic conditions. - Diagnostic priorities involve clarifying whether systemic symptoms are present, as their presence or absence can narrow differential diagnoses such as infection, autoimmune disease, or malignancy. - The patient\u2019s cautious, minimizing communication style suggests I should ask questions in a way that gently probes for more detail without seeming accusatory, encouraging honest disclosure. - At this early exploration stage, I aim to gather more precise info about systemic symptoms, their timing and severity, and any associated features that could differentiate between benign and serious causes. - The key is to better understand the full clinical picture, especially regarding systemic signs that might be underreported, to refine the differential diagnosis.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Use focused, open-ended questions combined with follow-ups aimed at systemic and constitutional symptoms. - Target query about night sweats, weight loss, fevers, fatigue, or lymph node changes, encouraging the patient to elaborate on their experience. - Phrase questions softly to reduce defensiveness, given the patient\u2019s hesitant response pattern. - The goal is to generate richer detail on systemic symptomatology that may influence subsequent testing or referral decisions.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that you haven't noticed much about feeling tired or losing weight, but sometimes symptoms can be subtle or not immediately obvious.

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a three-week history of persistent fatigue, enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck and axillae, a non-itchy, red, and blotchy rash on the chest and arms, and intermittent systemic fevers. He reports his fatigue has been uniform and worse in the mornings. He also describes occasional redness and a foreign-body sensation in the eye but minimizes discomfort or visual disturbance. Due to communication hesitancy and anxiety, physical examination and further assessment are necessary to determine if there are more significant findings such as lymph node enlargement or eye involvement. Objective findings may include enlarged, firm lymph nodes and signs of conjunctival or eyelid redness not fully expressed by the patient. Further investigation should include detailed examination of the lymphatic and ocular systems, along with laboratory testing to evaluate for infectious, immune, or hematologic causes.1. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis Justification: The presentation of systemic fatigue, enlarged tender lymph nodes, and a non-itchy, erythematous, blotchy rash is characteristic; sarcoidosis commonly involves granulomatous inflammation affecting skin, lymph nodes, and eyes. Eye involvement with redness and foreign-body sensation aligns with ocular sarcoidosis. The three-week duration with persistent systemic and localized symptoms suggests ongoing granulomatous inflammation typical of sarcoidosis.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis (EBV) Justification: The systemic symptoms including fatigue, fever, and tender lymphadenopathy fit with infectious mononucleosis. The rash, though less typical, can occur especially in the context of a viral exanthem. Ocular symptoms are less typical but possible. The subacute presentation over three weeks is consistent; however, the skin rash and specific lymph node tenderness are more characteristic of sarcoidosis.  3. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma) Justification: The firm, enlarged lymph nodes and systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue raise suspicion for lymphoma. The rash could be a paraneoplastic manifestation or secondary to immune dysregulation. The duration and systemic involvement fit with lymphoma, which often presents with B symptoms and lymphadenopathy.  4. Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Justification: SLE can present with constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, and ocular manifestations. The non-itchy rash may be a malar or discoid rash, and the eye symptoms could reflect conjunctivitis or scleritis. Although SLE often involves other findings like joint pain or serositis, early systemic features can be varied.  5. Diagnosis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Justification: GPA involves granulomatous inflammation affecting the respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. The ocular redness and systemic symptoms could fit, especially with mucocutaneous involvement. However, absence of nasal or pulmonary symptoms makes this less probable than the top differentials but still worth considering.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient favors vague and hedging language (\"kind of\", \"not really\", \"maybe\"), indicating uncertainty and possible reluctance to confirm severity. He occasionally shifts into emotional language expressing worry, which suggests underlying anxiety. - Information flow: He is somewhat organized but tends to scatter his points, adding tangential details (stress, work, family history). He responds honestly but with hesitancy, especially on sensitive topics. - Response style: Responses are somewhat elaborate but tinged with qualifiers, hesitation, or tangential thoughts, reflecting discomfort and uncertainty.  BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The vague descriptions and hedging about the rash and lymph nodes suggest possible intentional or subconscious minimization. - Minimization behaviors: He downplays the extent and impact of symptoms, describing the rash as \"not really all over\" and lumps as \"a little\" uncomfortable, possibly hiding more severe findings. - Amplification patterns: Not prominent; he does express significant worry, but his language doesn't exaggerate symptoms beyond concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitation and qualifiers may indicate discomfort talking about sexual activity and health, especially with sensitive topics. - Confusion/memory issues: No explicit memory issues; some uncertainty about symptom significance hints at mild confusion or anxiety about what is serious. - Family influence: Mentioning his mother's prior experience heightens his focus on symptoms but also may intensify his health anxieties.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization and anxious hesitancy, affecting clarity and detail. - Severity: Moderate; these biases might cause underestimation of symptom severity, risking missed urgent signs. - Areas most affected: The skin rash and lymph node status are most biased topics, with underdescription or uncertainty. - Reliability: Moderate; they provide a generally honest picture but are filtered through worry and uncertainty, which curtails full disclosure.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true extent of rash severity and lymphadenopathy may be underreported; internal discomfort or larger lymph nodes could be more prominent. - Symptoms probably minimized: The size and tenderness of lymph nodes and the rash's significance could be more alarming than described. - Concerns probably amplified: His worry about serious illness, influenced by personal and family history, might lead to overinterpretation of benign findings. - True timeline: The symptom progression seems plausible but may lack detail; minor symptoms could be more severe or recent than he perceives.  In summary, Marcus\u2019s communication reveals moderate emotional distress and an inclination to minimize or hedge symptoms, especially around dermatological and lymphatic findings, influenced by underlying anxiety. This suggests we must probe further to uncover possible hidden severity and ensure accurate assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: Use targeted, clarifying questions to deepen understanding of the eye and skin symptoms, considering the patient's hesitancy and tendency to minimize.

Physical examination and laboratory testing are necessary to assess the true extent of lymphadenopathy, skin involvement, and systemic illness; additional ocular evaluation should be conducted to characterize eye findings more precisely.Infectious mononucleosis <If both checklist items are 'Yes', append 'END' to signify diagnostic conclusion>COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient tends to use vague, softened language (\"kind of,\" \"not really,\" \"a little\"), which indicates an attempt to minimize or downplay symptoms. While generally open, there is a consistent pattern of hedging that obscures full severity. - Information flow: Responses are organized but contain extraneous details and hesitations, which suggest hesitance in fully disclosing or perhaps discomfort discussing sensitive symptoms like sexual risk or systemic illness indicators. - Response style: They tend to elaborate selectively, often providing contextual details (e.g., work stress, ex-boyfriend) instead of straightforward symptom descriptions. There is a tendency toward tangential storytelling that could divert attention from core symptoms.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The reluctance to explicitly state severity of symptoms like fever and weight loss, and phrases indicating uncertainty, suggest underreporting. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying the rash (\"doesn't itch much,\" \"kind of there\") and fatigue (\"kinda overwhelmed\") suggest they may be underestimating or hiding full symptoms. - Amplification patterns: The emotional descriptors (\"really tired all the time\", \"long and heavy\") may reflect heightened anxiety rather than actual clinical severity but could also be exaggeration fueled by concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Fidgeting, nervousness when discussing sexual history and symptoms suggest discomfort, possibly due to stigma. - Confusion/memory issues: No clear evidence of memory problems, responses are coherent but include hedging. - Family influence: Mention of maternal health concerns may influence the patient\u2019s own perception and reporting, possibly adding emotional weight or external bias.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimized reporting bias is most prominent, as the patient softens symptom descriptions and avoids direct statements of severity, likely to avoid worry or stigma. - Severity: Moderate; bias impacts perception of symptoms but hasn't led to outright denial. It could, however, obscure true clinical status. - Areas most affected: Fatigue, rash description, lymphadenopathy details\u2014these are the most subdued in language, potentially underestimating their severity. - Reliability: Moderate; responses contain some truthful information but are likely understated. Clinical assessment should consider possible underreporting due to bias.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The patient may not be fully disclosing systemic symptoms like night sweats, weight loss, or more extensive lymph node involvement, which are critical for staging and diagnosis. - Symptoms probably minimized: Fatigue severity, rash extent, systemic signs, and possibly other opportunistic symptoms. - Concerns probably amplified: Anxiety about health status, which may lead to over-interpretation of minor findings or heightened worry about disease severity. - True timeline: The actual progression could be more insidious, and symptom severity might be greater than reflected. Hesitation and hedging suggest possible underestimation by the patient of the full disease impact.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has reported persistent ocular, skin, and some systemic symptoms, but his descriptions contain hedging and underreporting cues, especially regarding severity, systemic signs like weight loss or night sweats, and the extent of lymphadenopathy. To confirm the most likely diagnosis\u2014likely infectious mononucleosis\u2014we need to verify key criteria: the presence and duration of systemic symptoms, the nature of lymph node involvement, and any real severity indicators. Given his communication style, focused questions are needed to elicit more precise responses without triggering defensiveness. We also want to assess his understanding and emotional readiness, considering his tendency to minimize symptoms. This inquiry will help confirm diagnostic certainty, clarify any remaining doubts, and guide shared decision-making for testing and management.  CLINICAL REASONING: - Information gaps: Exact severity and extent of systemic symptoms, clarity on lymph node tenderness and size, and any unnoticed weight loss or night sweats. - Diagnostic priorities: Confirming constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise), lymphadenopathy details, and systemic involvement typical of infectious mononucleosis. - Patient factors: Hesitation and minimization require sensitive, focused questions that encourage disclosure by normalizing queries. - Interview phase goals: Obtain definitive symptom details, rule out red flags, and assess patient\u2019s understanding and emotional state before discussing management.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, clarifying questions targeting specific symptoms and signs. - Information target: Severity, duration, and impact of systemic symptoms, lymph nodes description, and any overlooked features like fevers or weight change. - Communication approach: Gentle, explanatory phrasing to reduce defensiveness and build trust. - Expected value: These questions will help solidify or refute the presence of key diagnostic features, allowing for diagnostic certainty and appropriate next steps.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've shared so far, I\u2019d like to clarify a few last details to be sure about the picture. Have you noticed any fevers, chills, or night sweats that come and go, even if you didn\u2019t think much about them? Also, regarding your lymph nodes, can you tell me if they\u2019ve felt more tender or enlarged recently, or if they seem to be staying about the same? And about your fatigue\u2014are you feeling more tired than usual, perhaps affecting your daily routines, or has that been fairly consistent? Lastly, has your rash changed in size or appearance, or started to itch more? These details help me understand how your symptoms fit together and guide us on the next steps.\"",
