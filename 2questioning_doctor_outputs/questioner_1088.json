    "input": "An adult patient presents with recent onset of symptoms described as irregular heartbeat and chest pressure beginning approximately one week prior to the visit. The patient reports experiencing episodes that she perceives as bothersome, but her descriptions are vague and hesitant, indicating potential underreporting or exaggeration influenced by anxiety. There is no current report of dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath, or syncope; however, such symptoms may be unrecognized or withheld. The true severity, frequency, and associated symptoms are unclear and require further detailed history-taking and diagnostic evaluation to accurately characterize the clinical situation.1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Justification: Irregular heartbeat episodes suggest possible arrhythmias; SVT is common in adults, presenting with palpitations and chest pressure, often episodic and perceived as bothersome.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic disorder Justification: Vague, hesitant descriptions combined with perceived episodes, and absence of overt red flags, point toward anxiety-related symptoms mimicking cardiac issues.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Justification: Irregular heartbeat episodes are characteristic; onset over a week suggests possible paroxysmal AF, common in adults, especially those with cardiovascular risk factors (though not specified).  4. Diagnosis: Non-cardiac chest pain (gastroesophageal reflux disease or musculoskeletal) Justification: Chest pressure with vague symptoms may be related to GERD or musculoskeletal sources; common causes of chest discomfort in adults.  5. Diagnosis: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or other ectopic beats Justification: Palpitations due to ectopy can cause irregular sensations; often benign but sometimes associated with underlying heart disease.  6. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Justification: Hyperthyroidism can cause palpitations, irregular heartbeat, and chest discomfort; common in adults, particularly women.  7. Diagnosis: Structural heart disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy, valvular disease) Justification: Potential underlying cause for arrhythmias and chest pressure; however, absence of red flag symptoms makes it less likely initially.  8. Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease (unstable angina) Justification: Chest pressure l:ikely important to consider, especially in adults, but less likely without exertional symptoms or other risk factors described.  9. Diagnosis: Medication or substance-induced arrhythmia Justification: Drugs like stimulants or caffeine can cause palpitations and irregular rhythms; no history provided, so less probable.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism Justification: Although serious, absence of dyspnea, chest pain, or risk factors makes PE less likely; nonetheless important to rule out in worse-case scenarios.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and somewhat distancing descriptors (\"kind of started,\" \"not excruciating\"), indicating a tendency to downplay or avoid precise detail. Her emotional language (\"worried,\" \"off lately\") reflects genuine concern but may be influenced by anxiety. - Information flow: Generally forthcoming when asked specific questions but hesitant about timelines and severity, suggesting guardedness or discomfort discussing certain details. - Response style: Responses are mostly direct but contain hesitations and fillers. She tends to emphasize her worry and describe symptoms in lay terms, possibly avoiding technical language or details that feel overwhelming.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Vague timing (\"about a week ago\") and non-specific descriptions of severity indicate some withholding or reluctance to disclose full details. - Minimization behaviors: Descriptions such as \"not excruciating\" and \"kind of\" imply she might be downplaying symptoms, possibly to avoid alarming herself or the doctor. - Amplification patterns: Her explicit fears and frequent mentions of worsening symptoms suggest her anxiety skews her perception, potentially exaggerating the severity of her concern. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous behaviors (fidgeting, nervous gestures) and hesitance in detailing lifestyle factors hint at possible discomfort or shame, especially about behaviors like smoking or alcohol use. - Confusion/memory issues: Slight inconsistencies in timing and symptom progression point to difficulties recalling exact details, possibly due to anxiety or stress. - Family influence: Minimal evident influence; responses appear personally held without external pressure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Minimization and vague reporting, influenced by anxiety, leading to underreporting of symptom severity and timing. - Severity: Moderate, because her hesitations and vagueness could obscure urgency, yet she is openly expressing concern which aids assessment. - Most affected areas: Symptom severity and timeline are biased, critical for accurate clinical judgment. - Reliability: Somewhat trustworthy, but clinical caution advises corroborating with objective findings and possibly probing deeper into timelines and lifestyle factors.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise symptom duration, frequency, and severity; lifestyle details she may feel shameful about. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true intensity of dizziness, chest tightness, and the potential seriousness of arrhythmia episodes. - Concerns probably amplified: Her worry about serious heart problems, driven by anxiety rather than perception of actual severity. - True timeline: Symptoms may have started more acutely or been fluctuating beyond her recollection; her vague timeline might obscure critical onset details.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are hallmark signs; common post-exposure or infectious cause, especially in active young individuals. It\u2019s the most common cause of conjunctival symptoms after activity.  2. Diagnosis: Eyelid contusion or superficial trauma Justification: Recent soccer play increases risk of blunt trauma, which can cause eyelid swelling and redness. Symptoms onset within days supports trauma-related injury.  3. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can result from inflammation of eyelid margins, often associated with tearing, common in active or younger patients.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden onset redness localized to the sclera, often following minor trauma or increased intraocular pressure, compatible with recent activity.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness can result from allergic response; however, less likely given recent trauma/sport activity unless exposure to allergens.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling, redness, tearing could be signs; but less likely without systemic signs like fever or pain beyond the eye, especially after recent activity.  7. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or foreign body Justification: Trauma during sports can cause corneal epithelial injury, leading to redness, tearing, and swelling; requires further ophthalmic assessment.  8. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can occur without eye involvement; need to distinguish from orbital cellulitis, less common in isolated sports injury without systemic signs.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma or acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Typically presents with eye redness and tearing but often with pain, vision changes, and halos\u2014less likely here given the recent sports context and no mention of pain.  10. Diagnosis: Penetrating ocular injury Justification: Traumatic origin suggests possibility; however, no specific signs of trauma or visual compromise described, making it less likely but still critical to exclude.  STOP HERE.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague and hesitant language (\"might have been,\" \"kind of,\" \"not sure\") that reduces the precision of symptom description. They also employ emotionally charged phrases to convey concern, such as \"really scared\" and \"worried,\" highlighting anxiety. - Information flow: They tend to volunteer minimal details unless prompted, often seeking reassurance about their fears. When asked about timing or specifics, responses become uncertain, indicating possible memory issues or uncertainty. - Response style: Responses are somewhat scattered, with struggles to specify timelines or order of events. They show elaboration when describing sensations but lack clarity due to hesitations and vagueness.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The patient withholds specific timing details about symptom onset (\"maybe last week\"), implying a reluctance or difficulty recalling specifics, perhaps to avoid alarming the clinician or due to memory lapses. - Minimization behaviors: They describe symptoms as \"not that bad\" using language like \"a bit off,\" which downplays potential severity. This suggests an intention to minimize the inconvenience or concern, possibly to avoid appearing overly anxious. - Amplification patterns: Their expressions of fear (\"really scared,\" \"think something serious\") and the detailed concern may be amplified by anxiety, possibly overestimating the seriousness. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No clear embarrassment is evident, though their nervousness and hesitation could reflect discomfort discussing their health or personal habits. - Confusion/memory issues: The unclear timeline (\"maybe last week,\" \"could have been...\") points toward possible confusion or reluctance to commit to specific facts. - Family influence: They mention staying in touch with family but do not show active influence or pressure in responses; responses seem primarily individual.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Response inconsistency and mild memory/confusion bias, reflected in uncertain dates and vague descriptions, possibly compounded by anxiety-related cognitive distraction. - Severity: Moderate, because their timeline is inconsistent and they use vagueness, which could affect diagnostic accuracy. - Areas most affected: Symptom timeline and severity reporting are most biased; symptoms like episodes' frequency, onset, and progression are unclear. - Reliability: Their self-reporting is somewhat compromised by anxiety and response vagueness; while their emotional expressions are genuine, factual details may be less precise.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: The true frequency, exact timing, and severity of episodes may be underreported or inaccurately recalled, limiting accurate assessment. - Symptoms probably minimized: Physical symptoms like dizziness or chest pressure might be more severe than expressed, given their tendency to downplay discomfort. - Concerns probably amplified: Fear of serious heart problems possibly heightens concerns beyond objective findings, influenced by anxiety. - True timeline: The progression is likely more continuous or severe; their uncertain recall suggests the symptoms may have started earlier or worsened over time more than they acknowledge.",

    "input": "An adult female patient presents with episodic sensations of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure, which she reports commenced approximately one to two weeks ago. Her account indicates the episodes involve rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, but she is uncertain about the exact timing and frequency, suggesting the possibility of more frequent or persistent episodes than reported. She exhibits emotional distress and hesitancy, which may influence her perception and reporting of symptoms. Objective evaluation is required to clarify the true nature, frequency, and severity of her episodes, and to identify any underlying arrhythmia or cardiac pathology.1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Justification: The episodes involve rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and lightheadedness, aligning with typical SVT presentations. The episodic nature, sudden onset, and duration fit common SVT patterns, especially in young to middle-aged women. Emotional distress could trigger or exacerbate episodes, and the tachycardia explains the palpitations and chest discomfort.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: The patient's emotional distress, hesitance, and uncertain symptom frequency suggest possible anxiety-related symptoms. Physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, dizziness can mimic cardiac arrhythmia but may be functional in origin. Her distress may also heighten perception of symptoms, making anxiety a plausible de facto diagnosis or comorbid condition.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial Arrhythmia (e.g., Atrial Flutter or Atrial Fibrillation) Justification: The presentation of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure can reflect atrial arrhythmias, especially if episodes are irregular and recurrent. While more common in older populations, they can occur in middle-aged women and may cause similar symptoms, necessitating further evaluation.  4. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy or ischemia) Justification: While less likely given short symptom duration and lack of prior history, structural issues could manifest as new-onset palpitations and chest pressure, especially if episodes escalate or are associated with other risk factors not specified here.  5. Diagnosis: Early-stage Ischemic Heart Disease Justification: Although chest pressure and dizziness warrant consideration of ischemia, the one to two-week duration with episodic symptoms in absence of typical risk factors or exertional triggers makes this less likely initially but still a differential, pending diagnostic tests.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She employs vague and hedging phrases like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" and \"a little,\" which dilute clarity and suggest discomfort with concrete details. Emotional descriptors, such as \"really scared,\" highlight distress but may overemphasize the urgency, possibly to garner reassurance. - Information flow: Her responses are somewhat scattered and hesitant, with gaps in precise timing and severity descriptions. She waits for prompts to disclose details and shows uncertainty, which may hinder accurate assessment. - Response style: Her answers are generally brief, sometimes tangential, and marked by inconsistent details, reflecting possible confusion or reluctance to fully disclose.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: The inconsistent timeline (\"last week\" vs. \"maybe two weeks ago\") and hesitance to specify precise symptom onset suggest she might be withholding or uncertain about critical details. - Minimization behaviors: She uses phrases like \"not that bad\" and \"kind of just keeps happening\" to downplay the severity, possibly to avoid alarming herself or others. - Amplification patterns: Her emotional expressions (\"really scared,\" \"worried\") may serve to amplify her distress, which could be a response to anxiety rather than an objective symptom severity. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Nervous gestures, like biting lips and fidgeting, indicate discomfort discussing her symptoms openly. - Confusion/memory issues: The inconsistent timing reflects genuine difficulty in recalling or organizing her symptom history. - Family influence: She mentions staying in contact but shows no overt signs of family impacting her reporting; her responses appear internally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: Timeline/confusion bias, because of inconsistent reporting of symptom onset. - Severity: Moderate \u2014 her memory inconsistency impacts the accuracy of historical data but does not negate all reliability. - Areas most affected: Timing and sequence of symptoms, which are crucial for diagnosis and understanding progression. - Reliability: Moderate; her self-reporting is affected by confusion, so reliance solely on her timeline should be cautious, though her emotional tone indicates genuine concern.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise chronology and frequency of episodes, specific triggers, or pattern details, due to her recall confusion. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be underreporting the severity or frequency, stating \"not that bad\" or \"kinda,\" while her emotional distress suggests more severe concern. - Concerns probably amplified: Her expressed fear and anxiety might cause her to perceive symptoms as worse than they are objectively. - True timeline: Likely earlier or more gradual than perceived; her memory loss and confusion suggest the onset could have been earlier or more insidious than she reports.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The precise onset, frequency, and triggers of her episodes remain unclear, as her vague recall and hesitance hinder understanding of the pattern and severity. - Diagnostic priorities: Clarify if her episodes include features characteristic of SVT (sudden onset, duration), or if anxiety/panic symptoms are predominant, or if there\u2019s an irregular heartbeat suggestive of atrial arrhythmias. - Patient factors: Her uncertain communication style indicates a need for gentle, focused questioning to help her articulate specifics without increasing distress. - Interview phase goals: Specify the timeline, frequency, severity, and circumstances surrounding episodes to differentiate cardiac from functional or anxiety-related causes.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused questions delving into details about each episode\u2019s triggers, duration, and symptoms, complemented by clarifying her perception of severity. - Information target: Exact timing, frequency, symptoms during episodes, triggers, relieving or aggravating factors, and any similar past episodes. - Communication approach: Phrase questions empathically and without pressure, encouraging her to describe her episodes in her own words, possibly breaking down complex symptoms into simpler components. - Expected value: Gaining concrete data on episode patterns helps distinguish SVT from anxiety or other arrhythmias, refining the differential diagnosis.\nANSWER: \"You mentioned that your episodes have been happening for about a week or two, but you\u2019re unsure exactly when they started.

    "input": "An adult female patient reports episodes characterized by rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which she initially states have been occurring for about one to two weeks but may have begun earlier and more frequently. She exhibits emotional distress and hesitance that likely influence her symptom description, potentially leading to underestimation of severity and frequency. Objective findings suggest recurrent episodes consistent with potential arrhythmic events, although precise timing, triggers, and duration remain unclear due to communication barriers. Further diagnostic assessment is recommended to establish the exact nature and significance of these episodes.1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Justification: The episodes of rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath strongly suggest a recurrent arrhythmia. SVT often presents with sudden-onset palpitations and associated symptoms, fitting the clinical pattern, especially considering the recent onset and episodic nature. The distress and rapid heartbeat are characteristic; further diagnostic testing like ECG or Holter monitoring is needed.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Attack / Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's emotional distress and hesitance may contribute to or mimic cardiac symptoms. Anxiety-related episodes can produce similar cardiorespiratory symptoms, especially if episodes are recurrent and have psychological triggers. This remains a significant differential, particularly if arrhythmias are not confirmed by diagnostics, and given her emotional state.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Justification: Given the duration of symptoms (up to two weeks) and the presentation of irregular, rapid palpitations, AFib is possible. However, less likely as initial episodes are more characteristic of paroxysmal SVT, but persistent or recurrent episodes require ruling out AFib with ECG.  4. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., ischemic heart disease) Justification: Chest pressure and dyspnea raise concern for ischemic causes, especially if risk factors are present. While less consistent with the brief, episodic presentation unless episodes are prolonged or associated with exertion, this differential should be considered, especially if initial tests support it.  5. Diagnosis: Electrolyte Imbalance or Other Cardiac Conditions (e.g., Long QT syndrome) Justification: Less likely but possible causes of arrhythmias or symptoms include electrolyte disturbances or inherited arrhythmia syndromes, especially if episodes are triggered or associated with specific circumstances. These are lower probability but remain important considerations pending further workup.COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: She uses vague and uncertain language (\"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" \"all kinda\") which indicates difficulty recalling or reluctance to share precise details. Her emotional state influences her word choices, often using hedging to downplay seriousness. - Information flow: She tends to be somewhat scattered, providing additional, unevaluated details (like her feelings or stress) when not explicitly asked, and exhibits hesitations, reflecting discomfort or confusion. - Response style: Her answers are elaborative but lack specificity, often diluting or obscuring details. She appears to ramble, with responses influenced by emotional distress.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Evidence of uncertainty and vagueness suggests she may be withholding details or unable to recall exactly when symptoms began or their characteristics. - Minimization behaviors: Frequent use of qualifiers like \"not that bad,\" \"just,\" and \"kinda\" indicate she might be underestimating or downplaying symptom severity. - Amplification patterns: Anxiety-driven concern may cause her to over-worry about symptoms, though this is less directly observed; her focus on worst-case fears about her heart may be exaggerated internally. - Embarrassment/shame signals: No overt signs but her hesitance and nervous behaviors imply discomfort discussing symptoms she might perceive as signs of serious illness. - Confusion/memory issues: Clear evidence of timeline confusion\u2014uncertain when symptoms started, inconsistent details across answers\u2014indicate potential cognitive distraction or emotional overwhelm. - Family influence: Mention of staying in touch with family could subtly influence her responses, but no overt evidence of external coaching or pressure.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of minimization and confusion/memory bias, resulting in underreporting or unclear reporting of symptom timeline and severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014these biases impair accurate history collection but do not appear to be deliberate. Her anxiety levels exacerbate the bias. - Areas most affected: Timing, duration, and the true severity of symptoms are most distorted due to vagueness and emotional influence. - Reliability: Her self-report should be interpreted cautiously; the biases suggest her account might underestimate or muddle important details, requiring corroboration.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timing, duration, and intensity of episodes; actual levels of symptom severity; possible triggers not clearly identified due to her vagueness. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be downplaying the severity of her chest pain and dizziness, cautioning that symptoms are \"not that bad\" but possibly masking serious arrhythmias. - Concerns probably amplified: Her health anxiety may cause her to fixate on worst-case scenarios, leading her to worry excessively, which might distort her perception of reality. - True timeline: The actual onset and progression are likely earlier or more severe than she indicates, given her confusion and emotional distress affecting her memory and narrative consistency.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: We need clearer details on the precise timing, duration, and frequency of the episodes, as well as specific triggers or situations associated with their occurrence.

BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias appears to be a combination of minimization and confusion/memory bias, resulting in underreporting or unclear reporting of symptom timeline and severity. - Severity: Moderate\u2014these biases impair accurate history collection but do not appear to be deliberate. Her anxiety levels exacerbate the bias. - Areas most affected: Timing, duration, and the true severity of symptoms are most distorted due to vagueness and emotional influence. - Reliability: Her self-report should be interpreted cautiously; the biases suggest her account might underestimate or muddle important details, requiring corroboration.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Precise timing, duration, and intensity of episodes; actual levels of symptom severity; possible triggers not clearly identified due to her vagueness. - Symptoms probably minimized: She may be downplaying the severity of her chest pain and dizziness, cautioning that symptoms are \"not that bad\" but possibly masking serious arrhythmias. - Concerns probably amplified: Her health anxiety may cause her to fixate on worst-case scenarios, leading her to worry excessively, which might distort her perception of reality. - True timeline: The actual onset and progression are likely earlier or more severe than she indicates, given her confusion and emotional distress affecting her memory and narrative consistency.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with episodes of rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath occurring over the past one to two weeks, with some uncertainty about the onset date. She reports the episodes as sudden, lasting a few minutes, with symptoms such as sweating and sensation of the heart racing or skipping beats, predominantly in the evenings or during stress. Due to communication biases, these symptoms may be underreported in terms of severity or frequency. Objective clinical findings are pending further investigation, but the clinical picture is consistent with potential arrhythmic or autonomic events. Additional detailed symptom assessment is necessary to determine the exact nature, frequency, and triggers of these episodes.Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) ENDCOMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient often uses vague, uncertain language (\"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" \"not really sure\"), which can obscure the precise nature of symptoms. She mixes clinical descriptions with emotional qualifiers, reflecting ambivalence and emotional distress. - Information flow: She is somewhat forthcoming but filters her details with hedging and hesitation, indicating hesitation to fully disclose or accept the severity of her symptoms. Her responses are organized but clouded by emotional buffering. - Response style: She tends to elaborate when discussing her symptoms, but with qualifying words that soften the severity. Her pattern shows an attempt to inform but also an underlying effort to minimize perceived seriousness or to cope with discomfort in revealing the full extent.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Her uncertainty about timing and duration, coupled with vague descriptions, suggests reluctance to offer clean, concrete details. This may be subconscious or to avoid framing her condition as more serious. - Minimization behaviors: Using qualifiers like \"maybe,\" \"kind of,\" and \"not really sure\" demonstrates a tendency to downplay or cloud details, possibly to lessen worry or shame. - Amplification patterns: While mostly cautious, she does describe symptoms with some emotional weight (\"feels like my chest feels different\") that could lean toward exaggeration driven by anxiety but less so in terms of factual overstatement. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Given her mention of alcohol, caffeine, and smoking, combined with reluctance to specify exact times, she may feel uncomfortable discussing certain lifestyle factors affecting her health. - Confusion/memory issues: The inconsistencies about when symptoms started and how long episodes last reflect possible memory lapses or emotional confusion, affecting reliability. - Family influence: She mentions staying in touch with her sister, but there's little direct evidence that others are influencing her responses beyond her personal stress.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias seems to be a combination of emotional amplification (due to anxiety) and confusion/memory bias that affects the accuracy of her history. - Severity: Moderate, as her responses are affected by emotional distress and memory vagueness, affecting data reliability. - Areas most affected: Timing, duration, and frequency of episodes are most biased due to her uncertainty and hesitance\u2014these are critical for accurate diagnosis. - Reliability: Moderate; while she describes her symptoms clearly, the inaccuracies in precise timing and duration require cautious interpretation.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact timing, frequency, and duration of symptoms are probably underestimated or imprecise due to memory confusion and emotional factors. - Symptoms probably minimized: The true severity, including possible arrhythmia episodes or intensity, might be worse than reported, as her vague language could mask concern. - Concerns probably amplified: Her anxiety may lead her to over-worry about worse outcomes, skewing her perception of danger. - True timeline: The progression may be more persistent or episodic over a longer period than she recalls, owing to her vague responses and emotional state reframing her experience.",
    "output": "THINKING: - Information gaps: The key missing details are the specific triggers, exact timing, and duration of episodes, as well as any associated symptoms that could clarify whether this is cardiac or autonomic\u2014most relevant to diagnosing PSVT. The patient's vague and hedging language indicates she might be uncertain or reluctant to provide concrete details, which hampers diagnostic certainty. - Diagnostic priorities: To confirm the likelihood of PSVT, I need to verify the episodes' abrupt onset, characteristic symptoms like rapid heartbeat and chest pressure, and whether they resolve suddenly\u2014Hallmark features. I also want to rule out other causes like panic attacks, assuming her anxiety could be influencing her descriptions. - Patient factors: Her hesitation, emotional buffering, and tendency to minimize suggest emotional distress and possible worry about her health. I should keep questions gentle, collaborative, and clarifying to reduce her discomfort and encourage more precise reporting. - Interview phase goals: To gather definitive details about the episodes' timing, duration, triggers, and associated features, aiming to finalize the probable diagnosis and prepare her for a shared discussion about treatment.  QUESTION STRATEGY: - Type of question needed: Focused, specific questions to elucidate clear criteria for PSVT\u2014sudden onset, regularity, duration, associated symptoms. - Information target: Clarify precise timing, frequency, duration, and triggers of episodes, as well as her perception of the symptoms' severity. - Communication approach: Phrase questions collaboratively, gently emphasizing that understanding these details helps determine her diagnosis and next steps. - Expected value: Will help confirm whether her episodes fit the pattern of paroxysmal SVT or suggest alternative causes, supporting a definitive diagnosis for appropriate management.\nANSWER: \"Based on what you've told me so far, I\u2019d like to ask some more specific questions about these episodes to better understand them. Can you tell me if the episodes come on suddenly, like feeling your heart race or skip a beat abruptly, and last for just a few seconds or minutes? Also, during these times, do you notice any specific triggers, such as being stressed, after caffeine, or when you're lying down? And when you experience these episodes, do they resolve on their own quickly, or do they tend to last longer? Your answers will help me see if these fit the pattern of a condition like PSVT and how best to support you moving forward.\"",
