# We need specific datasets for:

"""
Training the model through SFT
Will need a model that tracks
Training:
- Training a counter deductive model - Easy
- Training a deductive model - Easy
- Training a information gain model - Easy
- Training a chooser model - Hard
- Training a patient model - Easy
- Training a diagnosis model - Easy



Training the model through GRPO
Will need unsupervised data with a classifier model/reward model (probably something big)
Will need unsupervised patient vignettes
- deducitve model
- ign model
- counter deductive model
- diagnosis model
- potentially also a chooser model

question input:
- patient model
