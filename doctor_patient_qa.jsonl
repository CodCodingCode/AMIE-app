We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers?

Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?", "output": "Um, just some lozenges."}

If if I'm, if I stay stationary and sort of lean forward a little bit it will it will start to feel better."}
{"input": "Sort of feels better? OK, and besides, besides like leaning forward, has anything helped reduce that pain at all?", "output": "Yeah, well if I lie flat, uhm it, it's uh, or sorry. No actually, the pain gets worse if I I lie flat or if I'm if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really, the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down."}

No lung cancer history right, in your family?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, uhm so we definitely want to do testing for TB. Will do us a smear today of your sputum and we will, since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact a public health if the tests come back positive, and it seems that, we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?", "output": "Not right now. Guess will wait until some of the results come back and yeah, get started."}

{"input": "OK, and is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?", "output": "Yeah, if I exert myself it does make it a bit worse. It'll bring on the cough more, and shortness of breath."}
{"input": "OK, and how about any positional changes? Like, does lying down help? Does resting help relieve some of that tightness, cough and shortness of breath?", "output": "No, nothing like that has helped."}

Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now."}
{"input": "Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "Yeah, how does that sound?", "output": "That sounds good. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "What brings you in today?", "output": "Yeah, so I've had this cough that started within the last day and uhm, I've also been particularly short of breath as well."}

{"input": "Havey you noticed any blood?", "output": "No, I haven't seen any blood."}
{"input": "And it only started yesterday. What about the difficulties breathing, when did that start?", "output": "Yeah, that started really within the last twelve hours or so."}

I, I had to just sit down."}

{"input": "OK. Uh, and say two days ago, were you feeling perfectly fine?", "output": "I was yeah, I wasn't sick at all."}

{"input": "OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled?", "output": "Uh, it kind of, it bugs me most days, its not so bad, I mean, sometimes I'll get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the, in my mouth, but it depends on what I eat so I really try to stay away from some, some foods."}
{"input": "So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it?", "output": "Yeah, I still get it. It's definitely helped though it was a lot worse before, uh starting it. I've been on been on it now for a few years."}
{"input": "OK, and as for your anxiety, do you ever get panic attacks?", "output": "No, I haven't had any, any panic attacks."}
{"input": "OK, alright. Do you have any allergies?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual?", "output": "Well, yeah, I mean yesterday I, or, yeah, I had a bit more to drink than, uh, usual, more alcohol I mean. So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure."}
{"input": "It could potentially. Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out?", "output": "Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway."}

{"input": "OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "And, uh, do you smoke?", "output": "Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit."}
{"input": "No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there?", "output": "Yeah I have been, have been trying, just too, too darn expensive these days, so, been trying to cut back."}

{"input": "Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor?", "output": "Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though."}
{"input": "Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?", "output": "I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so."}

{"input": "OK alright and have you any had, had any hospitalizations?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, alright, uhm, so sounds like you've had a day of this wet cough with the, this, a bad smelling sort of sputum that's, that's yellowish green in color, and you've also had difficulties breathing for the past twelve hours, uh, so much so that you can't even go out to get mail and your hearts been racing. It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?", "output": "No, I haven't."}

Uh and then we'll also get like your, some of your blood work and chest X-ray just to see if there's any like pneumonia. And lastly we'll just get like a Covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with Covid symptoms. Um and yeah so we'll, so that's what we'll do um and I'll let the emergency department know that you're on your way. I think you'll need to get all those tests there, and then they'll decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics um from there, OK?", "output": "OK, that sounds good.

But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs.

Uhm so, we are going to do a Covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of Covid, so we just want to rule that out first, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm, in the meantime you should isolate for two weeks and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's been going around this time of year. Either way, kind of management plan is the same, so make sure you're hydrated, eat well, sleep well, and if your symptoms become worse, severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms, like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?", "output": "OK. That sounds good. Thank you."}

{"input": "Alright, any muscle aches or body pains?", "output": "Uhm no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "Alright, and how has your energy been over this past week? Have you had fatigue?", "output": "Uh no, I've been, I haven't been tired or like, it's just been like these symptoms that don't seem to go away."}

{"input": "So I understand you're having some chest tightness?", "output": "Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out."}
{"input": "OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?", "output": "I think it's staying the same."}
{"input": "OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?", "output": "No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady."}
{"input": "OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?", "output": "Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk."}
{"input": "OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?", "output": "No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight."}
{"input": "OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?", "output": "Uh, no I can't say that I did."}
{"input": "Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?", "output": "Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess."}
{"input": "OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?", "output": "Kind of just all over."}
{"input": "OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?", "output": "Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said."}
{"input": "OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?", "output": "Exactly."}
{"input": "OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?", "output": "Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing."}

{"input": "OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any chills?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any unexplained weight loss at all?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?", "output": "Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out."}
{"input": "OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?", "output": "Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one."}
{"input": "OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?", "output": "Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one."}
{"input": "OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?", "output": "No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning."}
{"input": "OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?", "output": "Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems."}
{"input": "OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?", "output": "Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home."}
{"input": "OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?", "output": "I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah."}
{"input": "So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?", "output": "Exactly, yeah."}
{"input": "OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?", "output": "Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication."}
{"input": "OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?", "output": "Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol."}
{"input": "Yeah.", "output": "That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril."}
{"input": "Yep.", "output": "And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often."}
{"input": "OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?", "output": "No, no."}
{"input": "OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?", "output": "No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me."}
{"input": "OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?", "output": "No, never."}
{"input": "OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?", "output": "Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that."}
{"input": "OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?", "output": "Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that."}
{"input": "OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?", "output": "Exactly."}
{"input": "OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much.", "output": "Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough."}
{"input": "OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?", "output": "Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart."}
{"input": "No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?", "output": "Sounds great, thank you."}
{"input": "OK, how old are you Rob?", "output": "I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon."}
{"input": "OK, OK, when did this start?", "output": "Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in."}
{"input": "Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?", "output": "Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "I have never had anything like this before."}
{"input": "No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?", "output": "Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like..."}
{"input": "Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead.", "output": "Maybe like you know five or six."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Yeah?", "output": "Yeah, it's like it's like sharp."}

{"input": "No? You're not coughing up any blood?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any swelling in your legs?", "output": "I I don't think so."}
{"input": "No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?", "output": "Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after."}
{"input": "OK, how about when you're laying down?", "output": "I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy..."}
{"input": "OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?", "output": "I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, how about fevers or chills?", "output": "No, not that I've noticed, no."}

{"input": "OK and, do you think anything triggered this?", "output": "I don't know."}
{"input": "No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?", "output": "Right, yeah."}
{"input": "Does it get better with you sitting forward?", "output": "I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much."}
{"input": "OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No? Any rashes?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "OK, OK, good.", "output": "So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to."}
{"input": "OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?", "output": "No, just like a I can't get like a good breath."}
{"input": "OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?", "output": "No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems."}
{"input": "OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?", "output": "No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since."}
{"input": "OK, so you're not on any medications?", "output": "No, just yeah, no that's it. I mean I, you know sometimes take like a Tylenol if I'm not feeling well but..."}
{"input": "And do you smoke?", "output": "I, like I, smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week."}
{"input": "A pack a week, OK? For how long?", "output": "Oh like since college."}
{"input": "OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?", "output": "Uh. No, no and I I smoke, I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I used to smoke a little more but this is this is less but not since I've been having trouble breathing. Is it, yeah."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?", "output": "No no."}
{"input": "No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?", "output": "Oh like, maybe you know, a beer on the weekend."}
{"input": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Like I don't I think I got all the ones when I was like a kid. What else should I have?"}
{"input": "OK, so like the flu vaccine every year?", "output": "Oh, I get that, like my wife, my wife makes me get that."}
{"input": "OK that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?", "output": "Oh like my, uh, my mom and dad have high blood pressure too, so I wasn't surprised when I heard that I did."}
{"input": "OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?", "output": "I am really like nervous 'cause I haven't felt anything like this before. Um, like it's scary, like do you think it's like cancer or something like I don't I don't really know?"}
{"input": "Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?", "output": "Mhm."}
{"input": "Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know? And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?", "output": "Yeah yeah, I just really want to get a good breath so yeah, whatever we can do."}
{"input": "Yeah for sure, and then in the meantime we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are OK and if we need to give you oxygen, we will.", "output": "That'd be great."}
{"input": "Could you start by telling me what brought you in?", "output": "So like I don't really feel sick. I just I lost. I can't. I for the past two days I can't smell anything. I can't taste any of my food. It's super weird I like live with my boyfriend and he was like here take a bite of this onion and I like bit into it and I literally didn't taste anything. Otherwise, like I feel totally fine. I just heard that this happens sometimes like with COVID and. I'm just kind of worried that I have COVID."}
{"input": "OK, for sure I will we will, um definitely look into that today and you are right, it is a symptom that can occur with with covid. But we will want to make sure that it isn't something else, and so I wanted to just ask you a few more questions about how you've been feeling. So you said you haven't felt sick, so have you been experiencing any other symptoms?", "output": "I mean, I may be even a bit tired, but really. Otherwise no.

{"input": "And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer, if you need any antibiotics within the hospital, or you can take them at home. So yeah, we'll do a full physical examination and do all those tests and then go from there.", "output": "Okay, that sounds great. Thank you."}
{"input": "So what brings you in?", "output": "OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now."}
{"input": "OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?", "output": "I was diagnosed when I was eight."}
{"input": "You're 10 now.", "output": "That's right."}

{"input": "OK, and you're using it more than normal, so how often were you normally using it?", "output": "Um I was only using it like I don't know. Maybe once every two weeks or so. Not very often. But now I'm using it like almost everyday like five six times a week."}
{"input": "OK, any are you? Does it usually turned out that you need it like during certain times like say when you're exercising or when it's cold?", "output": "Um I find I use it more, both like when it when it's right after I like, run around after gym during recess. Um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse."}
{"input": "OK, any other triggers that you can think of?", "output": "No, no other triggers."}
{"input": "Normally get more in certain seasons?", "output": "I. I guess no, no big changes there. I find the cold air makes it worse like winter makes it worse or like. Yeah, maybe also the spring spring with like pollen and stuff like that."}
{"input": "OK, so you have allergies too?", "output": "I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed."}
{"input": "OK, I see I see. Yeah, that would make sense. No. OK, uh, so you say you've had more coughing lately, is that right? You said the last two weeks. Or the last week", "output": "Last two weeks."}

{"input": "OK, uh and that's uh. Do you use your bronchodilator every time that you're wheezing?", "output": "When it gets really bad, like when I get so easy that I find it hard to breathe."}
{"input": "OK, so you're getting Wheezy even more times than then you're having to use your bronchodilator.", "output": "Yes, that's right."}
{"input": "OK. Are you having any symptoms at night time?", "output": "Yeah, how they don't happen as much as my daytime symptoms, but I been having it maybe like every other day or like you know, every two days or so."}
{"input": "OK. And when you have these so when you have these episodes, you're copping your wheezy. Do you feel like you're having a hard time breathing?", "output": "Yep, that's right."}

{"input": "We just ask those questions because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure that that's not, you know what's happening right now. We probably will do a covid swab just because of the times that we're living in right now, but I just want to ask you a few more questions before I go talk to the doctor. So do you have besides your asthma, do you have any health problems?", "output": "Oh no, no no."}
{"input": "OK. And you said, besides the bronchodilator, you're not taking any medications.", "output": "No."}
{"input": "And you think you might have allergies in the spring? Do you have allergies to anything else that you know?", "output": "Uh no, not that I know of."}
{"input": "OK, does anyone else in your family have asthma?", "output": "I think my sister has asthma too."}
{"input": "Anyone in your family have any other breathing problems?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Anyone else in the family have any allergies?", "output": "Uh no, I don't think so."}

{"input": "OK. How are you finding that?", "output": "Yeah, it's been OK. It's it's different, but it's been working out OK so far."}
{"input": "Cool not to have to get out of your PJS some days.", "output": "Yes, that's true."}
{"input": "OK, did do you guys have any pets in the home?", "output": "No pets, we have just like well I guess we have goldfish."}
{"input": "Oh, OK. Those are cool pets. Does anyone in the house smoke?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. OK, I think that's all my questions that I had for you today. What do you like to do for fun?", "output": "Oh I'm I like playing games online with my friends and and before covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together."}
{"input": "It sounds really cool. Hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you don't have any, you don't have to use your your medications every time you play sports 'cause that's no fun. And", "output": "No."}
{"input": "You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said and yeah we’ll come back and see you shortly, hopefully maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma.", "output": "Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week."}
{"input": "OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?", "output": "The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago."}
{"input": "10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?", "output": "That just started in the last uh I think 3 days."}
{"input": "OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start?", "output": "Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea."}
{"input": "OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?", "output": "Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house."}
{"input": "OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?", "output": "Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything."}
{"input": "OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?", "output": "Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely."}
{"input": "OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?", "output": "No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough."}
{"input": "OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?", "output": "Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating."}
{"input": "Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?", "output": "Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else."}
{"input": "OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?", "output": "Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath."}
{"input": "Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?", "output": "Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing."}
{"input": "OK. OK and um do you have any wheeziness?", "output": "No, I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, any chest pain?", "output": "Um, maybe from all the coughing, sometimes I feel like there's some pain there, but it's not not anything that's too painful."}
{"input": "OK, um do you feel like your heart's racing at all?", "output": "Uh no, not really."}
{"input": "OK. Um have you noticed any swelling in your limbs?", "output": "No, I didn't notice anything like that."}

{"input": "OK. Dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "Uh no, not really, I I thought maybe with the shortness of breath that would happen, but like so far that hasn't happened to me.."}
{"input": "OK, any fevers or chills?", "output": "Uh no I, maybe like a few chills, like I'm not sure actually, it was hard to tell, but I haven't had any fevers."}

{"input": "OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "Uh no, no, that that's all been fine."}
{"input": "How about um loss of smell or taste?", "output": "No, I haven't had uh, I think my taste and smell are still pretty good. No, no issues there."}

{"input": "OK, do you take any medications for those conditions?", "output": "Yeah, so for diabetes I'm taking this medication called uh like I think metformin and then for the blood pressure, uh I think it's, I forgot the name, I think it's something like um ramipril or something like that."}
{"input": "Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?", "output": "Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes."}
{"input": "OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?", "output": "I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing."}

{"input": "Oh OK, well good job for cutting down and quitting, um.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Yeah, um do you do marijuana at all?", "output": "No, no no no drugs."}
{"input": "Any other recreational drugs? You said no, right?", "output": "Yeah no, no, I don't do any drugs."}
{"input": "OK, um do you drink alcohol?", "output": "Yeah, I probably have maybe um some whiskey maybe a couple times a week."}
{"input": "OK. Um and where do you live right now?", "output": "Uh, so yeah, I just live in the city in London uh in an apartment with my, just wife, my wife."}
{"input": "OK, um is she also sick or is she OK?", "output": "No, she's been completely fine, and I've been kind of isolating myself from her over the last week."}
{"input": "OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?", "output": "Mhmm."}
{"input": "Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?", "output": "Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this virus like mainly I'm worried about covid and you know just how fast that's spreading everywhere."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?", "output": "No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere."}
{"input": "OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?", "output": "Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?", "output": "My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?"}

{"input": "OK, and six months ago, can you think of anything that that changed? Including like, traveling anywhere or changing in in your work or or living environment?", "output": "Uh, not really, uh, I'm like almost 75 years old now, so I just thought it was probably just due to my age."}
{"input": "OK. Uh, have you been have you brought up any blood with the cough?", "output": "No, I've never brought up any blood."}
{"input": "OK, and have you have had any shortness of breath?", "output": "Not that I've noticed, but I do find that I get a little bit more tired with exercise than I used to, but not really any shortness of breath."}
{"input": "OK. Um, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms?", "output": "I don't know if this is just due to old age, but like I've noticed some joint pain as well, like in my hands and feet. I just assumed that was 'cause I'm getting old."}
{"input": "OK um, and has there been anything that's made the cough worse?", "output": "Sometimes when, I'm exercising a lot more but not not too much, it's kind of just always been there, hasn't really changed too much, but it's gotten more frequent over the last couple of months."}
{"input": "OK, and anything that's made the cough better that you've tried?", "output": "No, nothing I've tried like everything. I've tried Tylenol cold, I've tried other home remedies but like like steaming and everything like that but nothing has really helped."}
{"input": "OK, and is the cough worse in the morning, throughout the day or or at night?", "output": "It's pretty much always there. It doesn't really change with any time of the day."}

{"input": "OK. Um and, you mentioned some joint pains as well and then when did that those start?", "output": "I would say over the last year is when I started noticing it a lot more than before."}
{"input": "OK, have you been having joint stiffness or or muscle stiffness early in the morning?", "output": "It does get a little bit more stiff in the morning, but it's kind of just there throughout the day."}
{"input": "OK, have you noticed any red hot or or kind of swollen joints?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, any injuries to any of your limbs or or joints that could explain some of the pains there?", "output": "No, not that I know of, nope."}
{"input": "OK, um, and how has your energy been? Have you been experiencing a lot of fatigue?", "output": "Yeah, I definitely have been more tired. I can't really even go outside for a walk sometimes or I get really tired working in the garden. So it's been tough."}
{"input": "OK, and when did that when did you notice that change and and how were you different before?", "output": "Like before, like before six months ago, I remember I used to be able to go for long walks around the block, then when I was gardening I can go on for hours, but now I'm pretty it's pretty limited to like maybe 15-20 minutes and then I have to go back into the house."}
{"input": "I see OK, so pretty big difference over the last six months to a year for you.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?", "output": "Not really. Not that I know of."}
{"input": "OK, how about, uh, excessive sweating at night?", "output": "Nope."}

{"input": "OK, uh, have you noticed any swollen glands anywhere like in your neck or anything like that you might feel like a lump?", "output": "No, not really."}
{"input": "OK, have you had a sore throat or or runny nose?", "output": "No, I haven't had a cold for more than two or three years I think."}
{"input": "OK, about a loss of smell?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Loss of taste?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Alright, have you been experiencing any chest pains?", "output": "When the coughing gets pretty bad like I get some strain in my chest but nothing other than that."}
{"input": "Alright, and any heart racing?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "Alright, and how about wheezing?", "output": "No, not really."}
{"input": "OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your limbs, like in your hands and your feet or ankles?", "output": "No, not really."}
{"input": "Alright at night, have you had any periods where you woke up extremely short of breath and you had to sit on the edge of the bed with your feet over?", "output": "No, not that I remember."}

{"input": "Alright, do you have any allergies?", "output": "No, not that I know of."}
{"input": "Have you been so you said you've been pretty healthy, but have you been in the hospital for any reason recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. Um and are your immunizations up to date?", "output": "Yeah, I I got a shingles vaccine, the one for pneumonia as well."}
{"input": "OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No I've been at home."}
{"input": "OK um and in the family, have you heard of anything like this happening in the family sort of way, onset of this kind of shortness of breath and cough that you've been experiencing?", "output": "Not really, I I don't really have shortness of breath like it's it's like a dry cough. Sometimes I do find myself breathing more shallow. Yeah, mostly it's just a dry cough that's been going on."}
{"input": "OK, and more of the fatigue.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK. And anybody in the family have like autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or or lupus?", "output": "Uh I don't really, I can't really think of nothing my mom and dad were completely healthy. So I know and I don't have any siblings, so yeah, not nothing that I know of."}

{"input": "I'm sorry to hear that. What did you say you retired, what did you do for work previously? Did you have any exposures to chemicals or asbestos products while while at work?", "output": "Not that I remember, no it was it was a pretty, pretty much like a desk job I would say."}
{"input": "OK um, so no reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that?", "output": "Um, not really, but I I do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos. Does that does that like count at all?"}
{"input": "Like a it could be important, uh, because, uh, well how long, how long did you live there for?", "output": "I would say almost 20 years."}
{"input": "OK, so um, yes, that definitely would be is is important for the history today because, unfortunately, long term exposure to asbestos when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you've been describing along with cough and uh, respiratory symptoms. So it'll be something that we'll be sure to investigate today, OK? But I just had a couple more questions. First, do you smoke cigarettes?", "output": "I quit long time ago, more than like 10 years ago, but I used to smoke like 5 to 10 cigarettes for around 20 years."}

Doesn't seem to be getting any better, and I feel hot like I have a fever. I've been coughing a lot so I am I'm worried I have COVID, so I'm here."}
{"input": "OK. So I'll start with the headaches. When did when did that exactly started?", "output": "Uh the headache started, OK so the coughing started four days ago. The headache started shortly after so I would say later on during that day and then the fever I've had for, fever I think I've had for the past two days. I haven't actually taken my temperature though."}
{"input": "OK um. So, uh, the cough is started four days ago. Has the cough gotten better, worse, or stayed the same?", "output": "The cough has stayed the same."}
{"input": "OK, are you bringing up any phlegm or sputum with the cough?", "output": "Um, it's not really phlegm, but sometimes I cough up, like bits of like. You know little bits that look like blood or something."}

{"input": "Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.", "output": "OK great, thank you."}
{"input": "What can I do for you?", "output": "Hey I I came in here today I I just was feeling just a bit short of breath over the last few days and I've had a so I normally have a cough, but I've just been coughing a lot more over the last week and I don't know if it's if it's something else. I I do have a COPD diagnosis which I was diagnosed with like a couple years ago, but this is this seems to be much worse."}
{"input": "OK, you said you were diagnosed with COPD couple years ago. Was that two years ago? Three years ago?", "output": "It was almost, probably five years ago."}
{"input": "Five years ago, OK, and have you always had this cough since then?", "output": "Yeah I’ve probably had a cough for the last 10 years, I think."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "And you you’ve mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week?", "output": "Yeah, I've been coughing a lot more. Even just walking down the stairs from my bedroom to even the kitchen I just have to take a little bit of a breather, just start coughing."}
{"input": "OK. And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlem?", "output": "No, I'm bringing up like this. It's usually before this week. It was like kind of a clear to yellow. Sorry clear to white material, but this past week it's been more yellow in color."}
{"input": "OK, any blood in there?", "output": "No, I mean notice any blood."}
{"input": "OK and you said you were also short of breath, uhm when did that start?", "output": "So that's just in the last few days. But just to clarify, I do get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use puffers, but the last few days I've just been really short of breath, even even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and, can't really catch my breath."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?", "output": "Uhm no, not really, it's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff."}
{"input": "OK, how about when you're asleep? Does it wake you up and kind of make you gasp for air?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No OK. So no orthopnea or PND.

It's called spiriva."}
{"input": "OK, how often? How? How many times this week have you had to use your ventilin?", "output": "Uhm, Ventilin are probably used. Probably almost like 10 times this past week."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, any chest pain?", "output": "Uhm? Just when I'm having like those coughing fits in with the breathing, I feel some discomfort, but that's it."}

{"input": "OK, we can do that today. Any rashes?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "Fatigue?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, um and besides the COPD do you have any other longstanding medical conditions?", "output": "Uhm. I I have a like high cholesterol."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "And. Just I, I used to take blood pressure medications but I don't right now."}
{"input": "OK. And what kind of blood pressure medications did you use to take, and how come you stopped?", "output": "I was on like a diuretic. Then the doctor said, like my blood pressure was really well under control, so I just stopped taking it."}
{"input": "OK, OK, and the doctor was OK with that.", "output": "Uh no, I just stopped taking it. I didn't really like ask the doctor."}
{"input": "OK, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure and that's something you should keep an eye on as well, just in case ou have complications with your kidneys. Does that sound OK?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK uhm? And are you on any medications other than the puffers?", "output": "Just a Torva Staten."}
{"input": "For your cholesterol OK, and are you up to date with your immunizations?", "output": "Yeah, not even a vaccine."}

{"input": "Just your father OK. How much do you smoke?", "output": "Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even 2 packs at one point in time, but right now it's half the packaging."}
{"input": "OK, alright, well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs like cannabis, heroin, cocaine?", "output": "No, nothing like that, no."}
{"input": "OK. And do you drink alcohol?", "output": "Um just probably maybe like a couple times a month."}
{"input": "Couple times a month OK. And are you currently married?", "output": "Yeah, I currently live with my sorry, wife, in an apartment."}
{"input": "OK, and any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?", "output": "No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment."}
{"input": "OK, OK, good, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?", "output": "No, not not really. Wie’ve been just to ourselves."}
{"input": "OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No, just been on our house."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "Uh, yeah I was just wondering what this can be."}
{"input": "Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG’s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We’ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?", "output": "That sounds good. Thank you."}
{"input": "I was uh, wondering what I could help you with today?", "output": "Yeah hi, um, I have been coughing nonstop for the past three days, and today I have been feeling very short of breath. So I just wanted to get it all checked out."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. And, so you said the cough started uh, three days ago. Were there any triggers to the cough or anything that, uh that changed three days ago?", "output": "No, nothing that I can think of um, I have, like the only thing that I've been doing is going to the grocery stores, uh the bank, and laundromat. Um, and once I ran all these errands, like, I just started having this coughing fit that hasn't stopped."}
{"input": "Okay, uh, has the cough gotten any better, or stayed the same, or gotten worse these past three days?", "output": "Uh, it seems like it's getting worse."}
{"input": "Okay, are you bringing up any uh, sputum or phlegm?", "output": "Um yes, it's yellow."}
{"input": "Okay, is this um, any different from before? Like have you had a cough in the past and, and brought up phlegm, or is this entirely new for you?", "output": "Um no, this has happened to me before, um, like I don't know, like maybe a year or two years back. Uh, and it kind of feels the same, but just a little bit worse."}
{"input": "Okay. Um, and uh, have you seen any blood in the sputum?", "output": "No, no blood."}
{"input": "Okay. Um, and you mentioned you've been short of breath as well. Uh, how has that come on?", "output": "Um, it was, I, I don't know if it's because of all the coughing that I've been doing, but it just started this morning."}
{"input": "Okay, um, and have you been experiencing uh shortness of breath um, on exertion otherwise, like prior to this?", "output": "Um no, no."}
{"input": "Okay. And have you had any shortness of breath after, like if you lie down flat?", "output": "Um, no, not that I've noticed"}
{"input": "All right, and have you had a wheeze?", "output": "A little bit, yeah."}
{"input": "Okay um, uh, and have you had any um, infectious-like symptoms such as like red eyes, runny nose, or, or a sore throat?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}

{"input": "Okay. Um, and in the past um, oh sorry, before that, have you had any nausea or, or vomiting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Okay. Uh, and any confusion or, or changes to um, um memory?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Okay, uh, or loss of taste or sense of smell?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "Okay uh, so the, you've been experiencing this cough that's been getting worse over the last couple of days, as well as bringing up some yellow sputum, um, and been short of breath. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?", "output": "No, that's pretty much it."}
{"input": "Okay. Um, and in the past, have you um, been diagnosed with any medical conditions?", "output": "Um, I have diabetes, I have high blood pressure and I have high cholesterol."}

{"input": "Okay, thank you. And uh, you mentioned you had a similar episode in the past. Um, what, uh, were you diagnosed with COPD before?", "output": "I was, I was diagnosed with COPD about five years back."}
{"input": "Okay, did you have pulmonary function tests for this? The test where you had to breathe into a tube.", "output": "Um yeah, I had that done like five years ago."}
{"input": "Okay, um, alright um, just wanted to see if it was uh like formally diagnosed. Sometimes people uh, um, yeah, it's important to have that, uh, those tests done. Um, and do you have any allergies?", "output": "Um, no none. None, yeah."}
{"input": "Okay. Um, and uh, are your immunizations up to date?", "output": "Yes, I believe so."}
{"input": "Okay, um and have you had any surgeries or, or um, hospitalizations?", "output": "Um, I had my Gallbladder removed when I was in my 50s. Um, and I had a hip fracture three years ago."}
{"input": "Okay, and how is your mobility now?", "output": "Um pretty good. My hips still give me some issues once in awhile, but um, for the most part, it's been okay."}
{"input": "Okay, that's good. It sounds like the rehab went well.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "And uh, right now, can you tell me um, a little bit about your living situation? Like where you're living and who you're living with?", "output": "Um, I live by myself in an apartment on the 1st floor."}

{"input": "Okay, well that's great that uh, that you quit, so congratulations.", "output": "Thank you."}
{"input": "And do you drink alcohol?", "output": "I drink once in a while. Like maybe every other day, I'll have a glass of wine."}
{"input": "Okay, and um, uh anybody, or sorry, have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "You said you went to the stores and stuff like that.", "output": "Yeah, maybe from there, yeah."}
{"input": "Okay, and have you traveled anywhere else, outside of the city?", "output": "Um, not recently, no."}
{"input": "Alright, um, and any exposures to any like dust, chemicals, things like that?", "output": "Um, I live in an old building so maybe. Um, but it hasn't bugged me before."}

{"input": "Okay, well, what did you do before?", "output": "I used to work uh, on the assembly line for Chrysler."}
{"input": "Okay, were there any exposures uh, there that you were aware of, like things that you were breathing in?", "output": "Uh not that I was aware of, but they were always like smoke and fumes and things like that because it was like a factory, so maybe."}
{"input": "Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, and in the family, are there, anybody who, who's had problems with their hearts or lungs?", "output": "Um, my mom had lung cancer when she was 50.

{"input": "For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab.", "output": "Okay, okay for sure."}
{"input": "Umm, how may I help you?", "output": "So yeah I've been having for the last two days, uh, it just started randomly. I had to miss work, Just a headache started at the beginning and then I noticed the same day, so this was two days ago. A headache started and my body just started aching throughout the day and yesterday I just developed, I think it was a fever, I didn't really get a chance to check, like, but I was very chilly yesterday and now I have this cough as well."}
{"input": "OK, so just to confirm, so the, the symptoms at first started with a headache and, and fatigue, and that started two days ago?", "output": "Yeah, like with fatigue, like also just the, my muscles were aching."}

{"input": "OK, have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that, the headache or anything else?", "output": "Uh, no."}
{"input": "OK. And so, and then, last question for the headache piece. Does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset, worst headache of your life sensation?", "output": "Uh, no, it's still like, like I can still cope with it, like, if I wanted to I would have gone into work. But it was the muscle aches that really started bothering me."}
{"input": "OK. And so you had a cough as well, when did this start, and is it a dry or wet cough?", "output": "It's a dry cough and it started yesterday, probably in the morning when I woke up."}
{"input": "OK, and has the cough been getting any better or worse?", "output": "Uhm, since yesterday I would sayit's probably a bit worse now."}

Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days.", "output": "OK, I'll do that. That sounds good."}
{"input": "What can I do for you today?", "output": "Hi, yes, I just brought my son to the ER. We've noticed in the last two days he's been just making these grunting noises and just seems a little bit like just not himself, just more quiet. Not really crying."}

He did sleep, I would say like around like 4 hours last night, but it was really difficult."}
{"input": "And what about feeding? Does he take a formula or is he breastfed?", "output": "So he's, uh, he takes formula and today it like yesterday he was feeding. Today it's been really hard to get him to feed. Maybe he fed for like one or two times, but not much."}
{"input": "It happens when you try to feed him?", "output": "Uhm, Kind of just uh after awhile, just pushes it away, not really, uhm, yeah, uhm not really too excited about feeding."}
{"input": "OK, and what about diapers? How many wet diapers has he had over the past, or yesterday and today?", "output": "Probably around the same like usually has like five to six weight diapers and it's around the same."}
{"input": "OK. OK. Uhm and did you try anything? I know that he's six months old. Did you try feeding him anything new or anything different?", "output": "Uh, no, it's just been the bottle feeds."}
{"input": "Nothing new right? No solid foods yet?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. And uh in terms of his activities, you mentioned that he's not as he's not moving and, as active as he usually is?", "output": "Yeah, today I also thought I felt that it was a bit warm, warmer than usual, but I didn't have a thermometer at home."}
{"input": "OK. Uhm have you noticed, has he been drooling at all?", "output": "Drooling?"}
{"input": "Mhmm.", "output": "No, I haven't noticed that."}
{"input": "OK. What about coughing?", "output": "Uhm, I haven't heard any, any coughing, no."}
{"input": "OK, Sorry, is he is able to sit up on his own?", "output": "Uhm, up against like a sofa or chair, but not really on his own."}
{"input": "Have you ever been has been left alone over the past two days at some point? Do you feel like you might have taken something in his mouth accidentally?", "output": "Uhm no I I tried checking his mouth like I was there with him like all all the time."}
{"input": "No, OK nothing like that? OK, how has his immunizations been so far? Has he as he received them?", "output": "Yeah, he's received all his immunizations, up to date."}
{"input": "Uhm, did he have, it has he was vaccinated anytime recently? Because sometimes you said he's warm and sometimes, sometimes just getting vaccinated can cause a reaction.", "output": "Yeah, no. He was vaccinated like I think more than two or three weeks ago."}
{"input": "OK, alright. And you said no diarrhea or anything like that, right?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "OK. Uhm, OK, well uhm, I, I, OK, so that's all I wanted to do know in terms of his current status, I would obviously want to examine him very carefully and see what's going on. Uhm, how has uh, how is he like just going back, how was your pregnancy?", "output": "Pregnancy was uh, OK, no complications, but he was premature by two weeks, so I think he was born at 35 and four days."}
{"input": "OK, and were there any complications at that time, including complications related to the lung, something like respiratory distress syndrome?", "output": "Yeah, so when he was born there was they needed to do, I forgot what it was, but they told me that initially he wasn't breathing, but then right afterwards after like within 5 minutes, he was fine."}
{"input": "Hmm, uhm, OK, uhm, was he kept in the hospital in the NICU after being born?", "output": "Yeah, just because of that scare, they kept him for three more days, but like he was growing while there were no more episodes of the breathing issue, so they let him go after."}
{"input": "OK. Uhm, has, how has he been since then over the past six months?", "output": "Since then, he's been fine. No, we didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, and during our routine visits he's been growing well, no normal issues."}
{"input": "Any issues because development?", "output": "No, he's been pretty, like he's been meeting his milestones according to like the family doctor."}
{"input": "Has he had any surgeries or any, or no hospitalizations you said, and no, uhm no diagnosis, right? He hasn't been diagnosed with any condition?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "Anything like cystic fibrosis in the family?", "output": "No, not that I know of."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, well we'll examine the child and look at his vitals, listen to his lungs, look, look inside his mouth and that's this sounds serious, so we'll keep you, we'll keep you updated and we'll let you know what needs to be done. He might need, potentially need antibiotics. He might need potentially, to be intubated, but we will have all these discussions after the baby's been seen and we'll draw some labs and go from there.", "output": "OK, sounds good."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Hi. Uh, I've just had this cough for the past week and I was worried I might have Covid so I just wanted to um I just wanted to be checked."}

{"input": "No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid."}
{"input": "Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril.", "output": "Sure."}
{"input": "Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound?", "output": "Sounds great."}

{"input": "OK. You said for a couple days?", "output": "Yes, for two days."}
{"input": "OK, have you ever had anything like this before?", "output": "No, no, nothing like this."}
{"input": "OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?", "output": "The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana."}
{"input": "OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?", "output": "It's been pretty consistent, yeah."}
{"input": "OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?", "output": "Yes."}
{"input": "And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum? Any blood? Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?", "output": "It's dry."}
{"input": "OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?", "output": "The dry cough? Um it's been pretty consistent as well."}

{"input": "OK and then recently have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?", "output": "Um no not that I can remember or yeah, not that I can remember."}
{"input": "OK, have you traveled anywhere?", "output": "Um I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago. I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that I don't see where else I could have gotten this from."}
{"input": "OK, was that hiking somewhere close by?", "output": "Yeah, it was like half an hour from where we are."}
{"input": "OK. Are your immunizations up to date?", "output": "Yes."}
{"input": "OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it? It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. Have you had any chest pain? Thats the other thing . I'm not sure if I asked you .", "output": "No no chest pain."}

{"input": "OK, and how is that going?", "output": "Pretty good, yeah, we're doing things online now."}
{"input": "So you haven't really been out of the house?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next.

{"input": "Um, and um, did he, did he get um, did he see a doctor?", "output": "No, he didn't want to go to the doctor, and it kind of just resolved, like he, it went away on its own."}

Uh, I also feel like, so with a sore throat, I also have some um, pain on the sides, like on my, on my neck. Like I almost feel like some lumps on both sides."}
{"input": "Oh, I see, I see. Okay, okay. Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?", "output": "Um, just some lozenges."}
{"input": "What can I do for you today?", "output": "Hi, uh, so I just came here today uh, I've been having this cough for um, the last two weeks and it just, is not going away. I've also been getting like, just a runny nose for the last couple, I would take the whole week, all of last week."}

{"input": "No blood?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Okay, and the runny nose, what, what's the discharge like?", "output": "Uh it's, it's pretty clear. It might be light, but it's not like green or yellow or anything like that."}
{"input": "Um, and so you've had this cough for two weeks and the runny nose just started last week. Has the cough improved over the past two weeks?", "output": "Uh, it has, like it was much worse last week, uh, but I just can't get like, it's better now, but it's still lasting much longer than I've had a cough before."}

{"input": "Unintentional weight loss?", "output": "No, my weight's been the same."}

{"input": "Okay, okay. Um, and have you um, is there anyone else around in the home? Or just your parents and you?", "output": "Yeah, just my parents and me."}
{"input": "Alright uh, have you um, have you been around someone who might be sick, or have your parents been around someone who could be sick?", "output": "Uh, my mom had the sniffles like last week, but she pretty much got over it."}
{"input": "Um, did she get tested for COVID?", "output": "No, she, she didn't um, but it's not like, it's just more, she just thought it was a cold or something so she didn't really bother."}
{"input": "That's fair, okay. Um, and do you um, so I see that you go to school, um, and you mentioned you, have you traveled anywhere outside the, the province?", "output": "No, not at all. My school is actually in Ontario, so."}
{"input": "Okay, great. Um, and do you currently, or have you ever smoked?", "output": "Um, maybe like uh, a couple times just casually. I've tried it but nothing regular."}
{"input": "And what about marijuana?", "output": "Yeah, same, same thing like I've tried it probably like four or five times so far."}
{"input": "Any recreational drugs?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "Any uh, alcohol?", "output": "Uh, yeah, just not, not much right now, but like when I, when we were at school like we would drink on the weekends."}
{"input": "That's good. Alright, um, so it sounds like you've had a cough for the past two weeks and you uh, have developed a runny nose last week, and your mom was ill the week before. It's possible that you just have a common cold uh, and that symptoms will get better over time. But just in case, we would also like to do a COVID swab, um, to make sure that you, just to rule out COVID. In the meantime, I would request that you isolate, self isolate at home. Stay away from your parents as well. Um, the test results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and public health will give you a call if your results are positive and we'll let you know what to do. Um, we will also do a physical exam here and check your temperature to see if you have a fever at all and um, yeah, does that sound good to you?", "output": "Yeah, and will I need any like antibiotics for my cough?"}
{"input": "Oh. Um, well, we, I guess, you said that you don't have a sore throat at all, right?", "output": "No. It's just that, I just feel like the coughs been just going on, like it would be nice to just get rid of it."}
{"input": "Well um, I'll do a physical exam, look inside your throat, look inside your mouth, sorry, and listen to your chest, and uh, ensure that nothing else is going on, that you don't have anything like, say, strep throat or mono or you don't have uh, pneumonia, uh, bacterial pneumonia, for instance. Oftentimes um, symptoms that you have are caused by viruses and don't need to be treated with antibiotics, uh, but I'll do a physical exam, and maybe have a look at your labs as well, and then decide accordingly.", "output": "Okay, sounds good, thank you."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. It's a good thing that you brought him in. So the cough, is it consistent? Or does it come and go?", "output": "It seems to be a little bit worse at night. He'll have this cough during the day. Sometimes I'll notice when he's playing. He's had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from. He hasn't been too active to be honest. He's been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days, but in regards to consistency, I'd say it's a little bit worse at night."}
{"input": "OK, any other triggers like dust or the cold air? Anything like that?", "output": "I haven't really noticed anything. We've been mainly keeping inside due to covid, right? I think my wife left a window open the other night, and maybe the cough was a little bit better. I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to tell when we sleep."}
{"input": "Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?", "output": "No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest."}
{"input": "OK, good. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's barky? Is it harsh?", "output": "Barky might be a good word to describe it, like he's had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds harsh. It sounds like he's really trying to cough hard there. Very violent sometimes."}
{"input": "OK OK. And has he ever had a cough like this in the past?", "output": "No, never."}
{"input": "OK, and then in terms of the timeline, is it getting worse? His cough?", "output": "I think it has been to be honest. He was a little ill like he had a runny nose a couple of days ago, maybe two days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the first day, about two days ago so. Now it's been more present I suppose,than it was when he just first had it."}
{"input": "OK, and is it a dry cough or does he bring up sputum?", "output": "Sputum like phlegm,no he doesn't bring anything up really, so dry."}
{"input": "OK so no blood as well right?", "output": "No blood."}
{"input": "OK,  does he have any shortness of breath with his cough?", "output": "I feel like when he has the coughing fits, he's winded. He's weak after them. Sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it, but just resting normally, he doesn't seem that out of breath, no."}
{"input": "OK any wheeziness?", "output": "No, not really. He's able to breathe. I can't really hear him breathing that much. Sometimes at night after a bad cough he'll be really winded. And yeah, it does sound like a little different when he's breathing, but just right now he sounds normal."}
{"input": "OK, and any reason for you to think he has chest pain?", "output": "He hasn't any sort of chest pain. He says his throat hurts, but I don't think it's his chest."}
{"input": "Has he had any fevers?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any change in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?", "output": "No, no rashes."}
{"input": "How about weight loss?", "output": "No weight loss, he's a fairly healthy kid."}
{"input": "And his vision and hearing are normal?", "output": "You know, I haven't gotten him formally assessed yet, but seems to be able to read pretty well from a distance. He's not in school yet, but I haven't noticed anything, and he can hear fine. I think he responds when I call."}
{"input": "OK, has he had a stuffy or runny nose?", "output": "Yeah yeah, that's kind of how it first started three days ago. Maybe had a runny nose. OK, yeah."}
{"input": "Does he still have a runny nose?", "output": "Umm, a little bit less now. No, not as much now."}
{"input": "OK. And his taste, any reason to believe there are any changes there?", "output": "Well, we've been kind of spoiling him a bit, just giving him ice cream. His throat hurts a little bit and he seems to still like it, so it's hard to tell."}
{"input": "OK, so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK OK, and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you've noticed?", "output": "No fainting or dizzy spells, but he's really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he doesn't want to stand up, he'll just be sitting down or he wants to be held."}
{"input": "OK, is he more irritable than usual?", "output": "Yeah after he has a bad coughing fit, he wants to be soothed and he'll be crying, but it's just more of because he's worn out, I believe he's tired."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK, and then any confusion or memory loss?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, and then in terms of his bowel movements, have things been normal from that standpoint?", "output": "Oh yeah, process of potty training him, but no, no real changes."}
{"input": "OK, so no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK and he's passing gas?", "output": "OK yeah I'd say so."}
{"input": "Any nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No. We haven't been really feeding him solid meals, it's because he's been sick, we've been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts, but he's able to keep them down. So no, no nausea, no vomiting."}
{"input": "OK, and then how about changes in his appetite?", "output": "Yeah, he's not eating as much but still, we're trying to force food into him to keep his energy up. Most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon, but now not so much."}
{"input": "OK. Alright and any anything else that I missed that he's been experiencing over the past few days?", "output": "No, just the cough."}
{"input": "OK, and then he otherwise healthy? Does he have any longstanding medical conditions?", "output": "No longstanding medical conditions. Yeah, nothing really. We had a little bit of stay in the NICU, just because he was a little bit underweight, but no, nothing really."}
{"input": "OK. And then his mother's pregnancy with him? Any complications at that point?", "output": "Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think."}
{"input": "OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?", "output": "Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected. We thought it was just a regular contraction and that it will just resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the hospital"}
{"input": "OK and then in terms of growth, weight and head circumference, has he been hitting all those milestones for the past 2 1/2 years?", "output": "Yeah, we we bring him to the family doctor every couple of month for his regular checkups and nothing has been brought up to be concerning for his vaccines. He has been doing well."}
{"input": "OK and then how about other milestones like speech, movement, fine movement, all of that, like have those been normal? Is he on par with his peers?", "output": "Yeah, this is our first kid, but compared to his cousins he seems to be doing well. He's speaking, he's got little sentences, now he has good eye contact. He's a good kid."}
{"input": "OK, good good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries aside from when he was born?", "output": "No no."}
{"input": "OK good and is he on any medications?", "output": "No, OK we give him like a flintstone gummy."}
{"input": "OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Any allergies?", "output": "Not that we know of."}
{"input": "Any family history of lung conditions?", "output": "So my grandfather, so his greatgrandfather I suppose passed away from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker though. On my mom's side there's some breast cancer. No,  nothing really that comes to mind for lungs."}
{"input": "And any heart conditions?", "output": "No, not that we know of."}
{"input": "And how about other cancers?", "output": "No, not that I know of."}
{"input": "OK, how about asthma, eczema or allergies in the family?", "output": "You know, I think my sister is allergic to peas, but she was never sick from them like go to the hospital.  I don't think there are any allergies in the family."}
{"input": "OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?", "output": "You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin. And we kind of thought that that's where he got the cold from. Like the runny nose, but it just turned weird, you know."}
{"input": "OK and how's this cousin doing?", "output": "Last time I talked to Charlotte, Hank seems to be doing well so."}
{"input": "Alright, and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Have you any of you traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No, with covid and everything, we have just been keeping to ourselves."}
{"input": "And with who and where does he live?", "output": "He lives with me and his mother in a house"}
{"input": "OK. Any old carpets or mold or concerns for asbestos? Anything like that at home?", "output": "I don't know when this house is built. I don't think there's any asbestos in it and it's all hardwood. So no."}
{"input": "OK, good. Anyone at home smoke?", "output": "No, no."}
{"input": "OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me?", "output": "No, no that's it, no."}
{"input": "OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any questions or concerns, just give us a call. How does that sound?", "output": "A little scary. Sounds good. OK, I'll just keep an eye on him for the next five days."}
{"input": "Give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they're not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him. Of course we will do a physical exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are. Most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely won't need any additional treatments.", "output": "OK, sounds good."}
{"input": "I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.", "output": "Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues."}
{"input": "OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?", "output": "Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment."}
{"input": "OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?", "output": "Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower."}
{"input": "OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?", "output": "If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes."}
{"input": "OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?", "output": "Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave."}
{"input": "OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?", "output": "Yeah, mostly just with the cat."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it."}
{"input": "OK, and have you had a cough?", "output": "Uh, no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?", "output": "Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now."}
{"input": "OK, how many days per week are you using that?", "output": "Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an \"s\", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one."}
{"input": "OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?", "output": "Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said."}
{"input": "OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?", "output": "Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?"}
{"input": "Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?", "output": "When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times."}
{"input": "OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?", "output": "When I was a kid but not really now."}
{"input": "OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?", "output": "Ahh, I don't I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, any urinary problems?", "output": "Uh, like. No, no."}
{"input": "OK. Bowel problems?", "output": "uh no, no. No, that's all good."}
{"input": "OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?", "output": "What's that?"}
{"input": "So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating.", "output": "Oh no."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "Um not that."}
{"input": "OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?", "output": "No, no that's it."}
{"input": "OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?", "output": "Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast."}
{"input": "OK, and any surgeries?", "output": "Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth."}
{"input": "OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?", "output": "Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin."}
{"input": "OK, and any allergies?", "output": "What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats."}
{"input": "OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy eyes or runny nose?", "output": "Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime."}
{"input": "OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?", "output": "I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything."}
{"input": "OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?", "output": "You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK, and um, where do you go to school?", "output": "Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road."}
{"input": "OK and in what grade now?", "output": "And, I'm in Grade 11."}
{"input": "OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?", "output": "I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?", "output": "Uh, what is that?"}
{"input": "So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device.", "output": "Is that like when you breathe in that the tube?"}
{"input": "Yeah, exactly.", "output": "Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back."}
{"input": "OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?", "output": "I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot."}
{"input": "OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?", "output": "Sorry I missed that."}
{"input": "Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?", "output": "Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal."}
{"input": "OK, and are you currently sexually active?", "output": "Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started."}
{"input": "OK, and do you use a condom?", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}
{"input": "Every time or sometimes?", "output": "Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah."}
{"input": "OK, great and um have you had any other partners?", "output": "No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one."}
{"input": "OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "No I haven't."}
{"input": "OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?", "output": "Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now."}
{"input": "OK, and any allergies that run in the family?", "output": "Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies."}
{"input": "OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma.", "output": "Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that."}
{"input": "I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department.", "output": "So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest."}

{"input": "OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.", "output": "OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you."}

{"input": "So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?", "output": "OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something?

{"input": "OK, and how long does it last?", "output": "I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour."}
{"input": "OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?", "output": "Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse."}
{"input": "OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?", "output": "I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths."}
{"input": "OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?", "output": "It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens."}
{"input": "Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?", "output": "I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes."}

{"input": "Does it ever wake you up at night?", "output": "No never."}
{"input": "OK and any nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No, no nausea or vomitting."}

{"input": "OK, um, any recent surgeries?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?", "output": "Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night."}

{"input": "OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right?", "output": "No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe?"}
{"input": "Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?", "output": "Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months."}
{"input": "OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?", "output": "No, I don't recall having any of that done."}
{"input": "OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds good."}

{"input": "OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?", "output": "Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?", "output": "No, I haven't."}
{"input": "OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.", "output": "Sure."}
{"input": "So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?", "output": "I haven't, I haven't, no."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "I don't feel hot though."}
{"input": "OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?", "output": "Yeah that sounds great. Thank you."}
{"input": "OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.", "output": "Thank you."}
{"input": "How may I help you today?", "output": "I'm just bringing my son today because he's been how many episodes where I'm eat hell gets all this coughing fit and become wheezy and become shorter breath and I mean after a period of time it goes away, but it's been happening every so often."}
{"input": "Does he still have these symptoms?", "output": "Like right now he's OK. When the symptoms come on, they last for I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes or or even less. But yeah it happens maybe once or twice a week where and it's been going on for a, a couple of months now. Yeah, he actually had a viral infection like a few months ago and I thought it was just that. It leared up and then he's just had a few more of these episodes, but without those kind of symptoms so."}
{"input": "Hm? So all this started a couple months ago.", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Do you find that there and you mentioned that it happens about one to two times a week? Is there anything specific happening at that time? Any triggers that result in these symptoms?", "output": "Well I will say I think I like exercise. I find yeah like soccer practice. Yeah, after maybe, or even during a game, like when things are really intense. Yeah, I think during soccer I've I've kind of noticed it. And then at night time as well. It kind of randomly, he'll have this cough."}
{"input": "OK. So I guess it's do you feel like it's affected by cold weather as well or no?", "output": "Um, maybe yeah, like if he yeah completely in the winter time. Like I know when he goes outside if he yeah he takes like a deep breath or something like that. He'll talk about having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in the cold weather."}
{"input": "OK, other than the and I guess the cough. Is he coughing up anything, or is it kind of a dry cough?", "output": "It's dry."}
{"input": "OK. Does he have any like chest pain during these episodes.", "output": "No, he hasn't said anything like that."}
{"input": "Alright, any fevers?", "output": "No, he had a little bit of a fever at the that one time a few months ago, but he hasn't. So that's right. I think he had a some sort of illness then, but he hasn't had any fevers."}
{"input": "I see. OK, any headaches?", "output": "No, he hasn't said anything like that."}
{"input": "OK. And how has he had any other symptoms so anything like racing heart or belly pain or muscle aches or any changes in his bowel movements or urinary symptoms?", "output": "Uh no, I haven't heard him, uh, I complain about anything like that. I think I'll everything like that's been normal."}
{"input": "OK. So when he has these episodes, how like how severe are they? So how difficult is it for him to breathe?", "output": "Ah, well, you certainly when it first starts, I mean for the first minute or two. Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK."}
{"input": "OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice. Or does he have difficulties falling asleep at night?", "output": "Yeah, definitely wakes him up a few and every once in awhile at night and he does have to take it a little easier at soccer for sure. So yeah, I am thinking it is affecting him."}
{"input": "OK. And otherwise has he been, has he had any medical conditions that he's been diagnosed with?", "output": "Uh, no, well he had some rashes when he was younger that he would get some some creams for, but that's mostly resolved now."}
{"input": "OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?", "output": "No, he hasn't had anything like that."}
{"input": "OK, uhm. And just going back to his birth and your pregnancy, were there any complications at the time of pregnancy?", "output": "Um, there was a prolonged labor, I think, but he was delivered vaginally and at term"}
{"input": "OK. OK, that's great.", "output": "And he, oh sorry, I was just going to say normal weight as well."}
{"input": "OK good has, was he kept in the in ICU for a couple of days after, was he sent home?", "output": "I think they, like he was kept for not an ICU he was kept for one day I think so just monitor for infection because it was like prolonged labor but he was OK. OK, so yeah we were able to go home."}
{"input": "OK, and I, what was I going to say. Forgot what I was going to say. How yeah, how has this growth and development been? Has he been seeing his doctor regularly? Any concerns there?", "output": "Yeah he's been good with with growth. No concerns for that and his developments been normal as well. He's reached all of his milestones."}
{"input": "OK, and is he going to school?", "output": "Yeah, yeah, he's been going to school. He hasn't really been, he hasn't missed well he's missed one or two days actually, because of the cough, like on nights that he just didn't sleep well, so in the morning he's just well, not not feeling good for school so he has missed a couple of days over the last few months."}
{"input": "Okay. And does he, is there any other any conditions that run in the family? Including things like asthma or eczema, or allergic rhinitis or allergies.", "output": "Yeah, sister does have some bad allergies. Her nose runs all the time and she also has that asthma. His sister uses and a daily inhaler and then also W1."}
{"input": "I see. OK, and uh. How are things at home is he, is he doing well otherwise? Like at school and things like that, any stressors in his life?", "output": "No, he's been doing, uh, he's been doing well at school. He likes math and that that's been going, well."}
{"input": "OK, great. Has he ever tried any puffers?", "output": "No, he hasn't actually."}
{"input": "Has he been on any medications?", "output": "Um, he he has not."}
{"input": "Any allergies that he has?", "output": "Not that I'm aware of, but I I think he might. I mean so like environmental or I don't know, something. He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so."}
{"input": "From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?", "output": "Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?"}
{"input": "Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes.", "output": "Ok."}
{"input": "You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?", "output": "Yeah, I don't notice that any other times."}

{"input": "OK.", "output": "And I kind of ignored it, but the next day they were still there. I started getting fever just in I felt off, you know."}
{"input": "OK. OK, so that you first notice that on Sunday, were you bringing up sputum before that and it just didn't have these spots or did it, did that part just start on Sunday?", "output": "Sputum is kind of like the gunk up and bring it up? Yeah, it was. It's like this yellow custard, it’s got like well spots are red on it on Sunday."}

I used to do like I take the stairs up to my apartment, but I have just happened really trying to exert myself that's been taking it easy so I haven't really noticed being out of breath."}
{"input": "OK, so probably if you were to get up and do a lot of physical activity you would feel worse.", "output": "Yeah, I could, probably I can still take the two stairs up to my apartment, but after that I started to feel pretty crummy."}
{"input": "OK. Is there anything else that you can think of that makes it feel worse?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Has anything helped it to feel better at all?", "output": "Bringing up gunk makes it feel better for a little while."}

{"input": "OK. Have you ever have you ever had anything like this before?", "output": "No never. Actually Doc, you're saying something that makes it feel worse? Taking a deep breath makes it feel pretty bad."}
{"input": "OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?", "output": "It's kind of always there.

{"input": "Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that.", "output": "OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that."}

I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there.", "output": "OK, thank you."}

{"input": "OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?", "output": "Umm, no, just usually like in the springtime."}
{"input": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Yeah I am. Yeah I get the flu shot every year."}
{"input": "OK good. And in terms of family history, do any of your family members have lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "I know mom has high blood pressure, but nobody's had a heart attack or, uh, no lung conditions either."}
{"input": "OK, any cancers that run in the family?", "output": "Umm, none, I can't think of any."}
{"input": "OK, and then do you smoke?", "output": "I just I smoke cannabis every once in awhile."}

{"input": "OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?", "output": "Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?", "output": "Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back."}
{"input": "Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have.", "output": "OK, awesome, thank you."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well."}
{"input": "Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?", "output": "So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me."}
{"input": "OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?", "output": "Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum."}
{"input": "OK, what color is your sputum?", "output": "It's mainly like clear white."}
{"input": "OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?", "output": "No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce."}
{"input": "OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?", "output": "I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well."}
{"input": "OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?", "output": "Oh no, I don't really have any pains."}
{"input": "OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?", "output": "I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "But that was, I think, two years ago."}
{"input": "OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?", "output": "Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital."}
{"input": "OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?", "output": "Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection."}
{"input": "OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?", "output": "I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever."}
{"input": "OK, any weight loss?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes?", "output": "Umm, no."}
{"input": "Any changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "And how about smell or taste?", "output": "Umm, no. I think they're the same."}
{"input": "OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?", "output": "I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad."}
{"input": "OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?", "output": "No, not that I know."}
{"input": "How about calf pain?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "Dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Headaches?", "output": "No headaches."}
{"input": "Memory loss or confusion?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "Changes to urinating?", "output": "No, that's all fine"}
{"input": "OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?", "output": "I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol."}
{"input": "OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?", "output": "Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80."}
{"input": "Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?", "output": "Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed."}
{"input": "OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?", "output": "I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it."}
{"input": "Do you take any puffers for your COPD?", "output": "Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to."}
{"input": "OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?", "output": "Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva."}
{"input": "OK, sure, Yep.", "output": "So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist."}
{"input": "Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Yeah, I think so."}
{"input": "And are you allergic to anything?", "output": "No, not that I know."}
{"input": "Any family history of lung conditions?", "output": "Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK. How about heart conditions?", "output": "Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, any cancers?", "output": "My uncle had skin cancer."}
{"input": "OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?", "output": "No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away."}
{"input": "Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?", "output": "Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years."}
{"input": "OK, how much do you smoke?", "output": "Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years."}
{"input": "Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?", "output": "Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet."}
{"input": "OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?", "output": "Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey."}
{"input": "OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?", "output": "No, no marijuana, no other drugs."}
{"input": "OK, and where do you live right now?", "output": "Right now I live in a small bungalow in London."}
{"input": "OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?", "output": "Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date."}
{"input": "OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?", "output": "No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home."}
{"input": "OK, how about travel to anywhere?", "output": "Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic."}
{"input": "Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before."}
{"input": "Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?", "output": "Thank you."}
{"input": "Would you mind starting with telling me what brought you in?", "output": "Sure I have had this cough for the past five days and it doesn't seem to be getting any better so I'm just here to ask you what it what it possibly could be."}

It will look for, to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present, because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time, it is a risk factor for it, and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this. So we'll wanna make sure to to do, to investigate for a pulmonary embolism.", "output": "OK. Sounds good, thank you so much."}
{"input": "What brings you all in today?", "output": "Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don’t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though."}

{"input": "No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?", "output": "No, no, not that I've noticed."}
{"input": "OK, how about short of breath?", "output": "Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has.

{"input": "OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?", "output": "Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day."}

{"input": "OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?", "output": "No"}
{"input": "OK, any nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, any changes in his urine?", "output": "I haven’t really been looking, but I don't think so."}
{"input": "Any dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No, just like fatigue."}
{"input": "OK, any confusion or memory loss?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?", "output": "Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it."}

{"input": "OK.", "output": "But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything."}
{"input": "OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?", "output": "I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure."}
{"input": "Yeah for", "output": "yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead,"}
{"input": "No go ahead.", "output": "I’m just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit."}
{"input": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, sounds good."}
{"input": "OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.", "output": "OK yeah, that's good to know."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "I've just had a real like a real bad cough. Umm, it's been going on for 4 or 5 days now umm, and I'm just, I'm having some trouble breathing. I'm coughing up like gunky green stuff. Uhm, yeah, it's just really bad. I haven't had anything like this before."}
{"input": "OK, so when did the cough start?", "output": "About four or five days ago."}
{"input": "Four or five days ago. OK, and, uhm OK. So for 5 days, did you do have any shortness of breath with that?", "output": "Yeah, it's uh, I'm just I feel like I can't, can't quite like breathe fully."}
{"input": "OK, uhm you can't quite breathe fully, so like when you take a deep breath in, you can't expand your lungs fully. Is that what you mean?", "output": "Yeah, yeah, I just overall I just feel like yeah, I'm I'm short of breath. I guess that's the best way to put it."}
{"input": "OK, so you're short of breath. And how about wheezing? Do you have any of that?", "output": "I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK. So when did this start again? You said if a couple days ago or a few weeks ago.", "output": "I think it was four days ago."}
{"input": "Four days ago, OK, and did you have like a runny nose or stuffy nose at that point?", "output": "Maybe a little bit. I wasn't really thinking about it too much."}
{"input": "OK, uhm sore throat?", "output": "No, not a sore throat."}
{"input": "Not a sore throat, OK. Uhm, how about changes in your taste or smell?", "output": "No, none of those."}

{"input": "Alright and are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Uh, yeah."}
{"input": "Including like the pneumovax vaccine and the shingrix?", "output": "I had the shingrix the pneumo I think the doctor said we were going to look at that the next time I came in."}
{"input": "OK, sure.", "output": "So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time."}
{"input": "Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?", "output": "Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything."}
{"input": "OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?", "output": "No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside."}
{"input": "OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No, no"}

{"input": "OK. And where do you live and who do you live with right now?", "output": "Uh, just me and my husband. We live outside of town. We live in the country on a little farm."}
{"input": "OK. Any old carpets or dust or mold or asbestos in the, in the home?", "output": "No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything."}
{"input": "OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?", "output": "I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?", "output": "Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on."}
{"input": "Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet.", "output": "OK, OK, that's good to hear."}
{"input": "What brings you in today?", "output": "So I so I have COPD and it's usually like pretty manageable with my puffers and that. But just in the last like 3 days I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. You know, I, I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now, uh, kind of producing more sputum. Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I’ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don’t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe."}

{"input": "Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you.

{"input": "No, any sick contacts recently?", "output": "Um not uh, I don't think so like we um, maybe in the Philippines, we do provide a, so I go on like these mission trips with the Church and um we do sometimes go to the hospital as well."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "Sometimes yeah, we we do see some sick people."}
{"input": "Mhmm, OK.", "output": "But other than that, not since I've been here, no."}
{"input": "Any travel outside the Philippines recently?", "output": "Uhm, so I think. So this year has just been the Philippines, before I used to go to India as well. Um but recently nothing outside of the Philippines."}
{"input": "OK. OK, um those were all the questions that I had for you. Do you have any questions for me?", "output": "Yeah, I I was very worried um uh about the blood. I was just reading some things up and uh, about tuberculosis, so I was really stressed out today."}
{"input": "Yeah so um, that's definitely high on our differential. So, we'll do a couple of things. We'll do a Covid swab on you um just to rule that in or out, you should hear back for, about those results, in 24 to 48 hours. While you're here in the hospital, we're also going to do a chest X-Ray and or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent TB. If those come back positive um we will require you to isolate because this uh, because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. Um so we have a couple of uh, we have like a regimen that we'd put you on. It's called the RIPE medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. Um but we will uh keep you here until we have more answers on um like from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds good. Um yeah I'm really worried, but hopefully it's not TB."}
{"input": "Yeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved. Uh we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment.", "output": "OK, thank you so much."}
{"input": "How may I help you?", "output": "Hi, yes it's nice to meet you. I've been having this cough that's been going on for the last few days and I have had difficulty breathing."}
{"input": "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?", "output": "Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then."}
{"input": "OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?", "output": "Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough."}
{"input": "So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?", "output": "Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess."}
{"input": "OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?", "output": "I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly."}
{"input": "OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?", "output": "It's dry. It's a dry cough."}
{"input": "OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?", "output": "No, I haven't noticed anything like that."}
{"input": "OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better? Did you take anything? Any medications for it?", "output": "I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help."}
{"input": "OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?", "output": "Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well."}
{"input": "OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?", "output": "Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head."}
{"input": "Have you had a headache like this before?", "output": "I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,"}
{"input": "Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?", "output": "Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped."}
{"input": "And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?", "output": "Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days."}
{"input": "OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?", "output": "I haven't checked my temperature, but I felt like I've had a fever or might be getting a fever."}
{"input": "We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?", "output": "Yeah, I guess I felt a bit achy."}
{"input": "Any redness in the eyes? Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?", "output": "Umm, I have, I don't know maybe my nose is a little bit congested, but not really running."}
{"input": "OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?", "output": "No, I haven't noticed that."}
{"input": "What about your sense of taste? Are you able to taste things?", "output": "Yeah, I think so."}
{"input": "Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?", "output": "Umm, no,  I haven't."}
{"input": "OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?", "output": "No, no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "Any chest pain?", "output": "No, I haven't had any."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?", "output": "No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything."}
{"input": "OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?", "output": "Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think."}
{"input": "Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?", "output": "No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time."}
{"input": "Do you have an inhaler?", "output": "I do but I don't use it very often."}
{"input": "I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?", "output": "Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much."}
{"input": "Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?", "output": "Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago."}
{"input": "Any reason for that?", "output": "Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s."}
{"input": "I see OK, and any hospitalizations?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. Do you take any medications? I know you have puffers. Any medications, including over the counter pills?", "output": "Yeah, I'll take like a Zantac or like Tums sometimes for reflux."}
{"input": "And, uh, any allergies to food, medications, or environmental allergies?", "output": "Yeah, I have environmental allergies. I think like usually they come on in the springtime."}
{"input": "In terms of family histories, you did mention that your dad had colon cancer. Any other medical problems that that run in your family?", "output": "Umm, no."}
{"input": "OK. And do you currently smoke?", "output": "No, I don't and have never smoked in the past."}
{"input": "OK, what about marijuana?", "output": "Umm, no."}
{"input": "OK, do you or have you ever had alcohol?", "output": "I will have some wine on the weekends, maybe a glass or two with dinner."}
{"input": "OK, sounds good and have you ever had any street drugs?", "output": "Like a long time ago, maybe when I was in college, once or twice."}
{"input": "Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people? Anyone who's sick recently?", "output": "Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores. And I would imagine I were wearing a mask and of course trying to maintain social distancing as much as possible. But yeah, you never, really know."}
{"input": "What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?", "output": "Umm, no, I had been at home."}
{"input": "Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds great."}
{"input": "Um, what brings you in today?", "output": "Uh yeah, hi, I just came in here today cause uh, lately, for the last couple of months, I've been getting these coughing fits. They don't really seem to be going away and I was a bit concerned."}
{"input": "So you've had this, when did this start?", "output": "Uh, I would say probably during the winter uh it, it kind of started, where I started having um, just coughing fits when I'm walking to school and then also during like gym class I started having these coughing fits and sometimes I also felt like I couldn't breathe."}
{"input": "Um, okay. Okay, what did you, is there anything, so it's basically worse when you're um, doing some sort of an exercise such as walking um, or being in the gym class, and it's also worse in the cold?", "output": "Yeah. Yeah, and then also like, I remember when I was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then I just completely just started having that episode right after I walked past them."}
{"input": "Okay um, alright. Uh um okay, sorry, one moment. Okay um, so is there anything that makes your cough better? What do you do to make it go away?", "output": "Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own."}
{"input": "And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?", "output": "Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't."}

{"input": "Yeah, certainly, uh, so it could possibly be something related to the heart. I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And and sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done.", "output": "Ok, ok well thank you very much."}

{"input": "OK. And was it an emergency C-section?", "output": "Ah no. I think it was like Labor was taking, it was prolonged, I mean so it they ended up deciding to just convert throughout. It wasn't an emergency, but like they could have waited a bit longer they were saying but just kind of what went made the decision."}
{"input": "OK, OK. And is he on any medications?", "output": "Uh, no he's not."}

{"input": "OK, and and those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "No, I I I just wanted to figure out what this was."}
{"input": "OK, yeah, so it sounds or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of Covid. Umm, you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."}
{"input": "So what uh, brings you here today?", "output": "I am here with uh, with my daughter, who has just been having a cough for the past um, two weeks."}

And then um, there's been times when she just turns blue, she's coughing so much. Um, and then it just gets, gets better um, on its own. But yeah, it's a dry cough."}
{"input": "Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?", "output": "Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah."}

{"input": "Oh, I see, okay. Um, any blood in the vomit? Or is she coughing up any blood?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, okay. Um, any, so this started two weeks ago, any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um, cold-like symptoms before then?", "output": "Yeah, yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose. It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse."}
{"input": "Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?", "output": "No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though."}
{"input": "Okay. And the cough is pretty constant, or is it, does it come and go?", "output": "Yeah, she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs, and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue, or just um, get better in a couple, couple minutes. This kind of comes and goes like that."}
{"input": "Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?", "output": "I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age. So I just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter."}
{"input": "Okay. Um, and so, has this happened before at all?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?", "output": "It's usually just what she's eaten."}
{"input": "Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?", "output": "No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really."}

{"input": "And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?", "output": "No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well."}
{"input": "And was she at term or premature?", "output": "She was at term, she was born at term."}
{"input": "Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?", "output": "Uh, vaginal."}
{"input": "And did she have to stay in the NICU at all, at the hospital afterwards?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?", "output": "Uh, no."}
{"input": "Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?", "output": "Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that."}
{"input": "And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?", "output": "Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those."}
{"input": "Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child.", "output": "Okay, I'll think about it."}
{"input": "Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?", "output": "Sure."}
{"input": "What brings you in today?", "output": "Yeah, I've had a sore throat that's been really bugging me the past four days and I've had a cough as well."}

{"input": "Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?", "output": "Uh, no."}
{"input": "OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?", "output": "I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having."}
{"input": "Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.", "output": "OK, yeah, that sounds good."}
{"input": "Alright.", "output": "Thank you."}
{"input": "Would you mind by starting with what brought you in?", "output": "Yeah, so over the last week I've just been feeling some symptoms. It kind of first started with, like a runny nose. That was around like 5 days ago and then it turned into just a lot of congestion, like around my nose and like my throat. And now over the last two days I've been just feeling so much pressure around my nose and around my jaw so I've been getting a lot of pain there as well."}

{"input": "OK, uh, and have you felt that it's difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils, like it's obstructed?", "output": "Yeah, so at night sometimes I have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side. So yeah, I do have some obstruction."}
{"input": "OK, and have you had any changes to your sense of smell?", "output": "Yeah, so just in the last three days when the congestion got really bad I started losing the ability to smell."}

It can kind of go near the front of my teeth as well, so like I would say like mostly around the cheeks, jaws and up to the front of my teeth."}
{"input": "OK, And do you grind your teeth at all at night? or have you had, TMJ issues before?", "output": "No nothing like that. I think it's not so much on and around my teeth, it's more so just to right below my nose, above my teeth and just around my cheeks."}

If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days.

{"input": "OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?", "output": "I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me."}

{"input": "Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?", "output": "yeah"}
{"input": "Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist", "output": "sure."}
{"input": "And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction.", "output": "Sure"}
{"input": "I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.", "output": "Yeah, so I just came in.

{"input": "OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?", "output": "No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed."}
{"input": "OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?", "output": "Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there."}
{"input": "OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?", "output": "Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms."}

{"input": "OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting?", "output": "Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down."}
{"input": "OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?", "output": "No headaches."}
{"input": "Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?", "output": "Um, I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes when I'm coughing a lot, I don't feel like eating, but other than that it's been around the same."}

{"input": "OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?", "output": "I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now."}
{"input": "OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore?", "output": "I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop."}

Things like of that nature?", "output": "Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah."}
{"input": "OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?", "output": "So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building."}

One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about."}
{"input": "Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show", "output": "Sounds good."}
{"input": "OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.", "output": "OK, sounds good.

It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result.

In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any.

{"input": "OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?", "output": "Sounds great."}

{"input": "Last year, okay. And how long did you smoke for?", "output": "I smoked just a couple, like two years."}
{"input": "Okay, yeah. So congratulations, that's a really great thing to do, especially like right now, with the pandemic going on and everything it's, earlier you stop, it's really good.", "output": "Thank you."}

{"input": "Nothing like that, okay. Those are all the questions, um, I have for you. Do you have any questions or concerns?", "output": "Um, yeah, what should I do about this cough?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so this cough, um, it's been going on for the last four days. Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough.", "output": "Okay."}
{"input": "Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions. And if, it can be anything else too, like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have um, like an upper respiratory, viral, or bacterial infection. But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. Um, this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like, uh pneumonia, for example. But right now, yeah, we'll get that testing done and then just, kind of wait and watch.", "output": "Sure, yeah. Thank you."}
{"input": "Yeah, so you're a 26 year old, generally healthy and with, sorry back pain?", "output": "Chest pain."}
{"input": "Chest pain, OK. When did the chest pain start?", "output": "Um so I, I guess I I don't know if I'd really call it pain, it's it's been just very uncomfortable, like it just felt a little odd for like a week and a half. It's kind of."}
{"input": "A week and a half?", "output": "Yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain uh when I take a deep breath."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "But I don't notice it all the time, it's just, it's often when um I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school."}
{"input": "OK, did you have any accidents or injuries around that time?", "output": "Uh no, nothing that I can think of."}
{"input": "OK, did it come on suddenly? Or is it more gradual?", "output": "Yeah, it's uh, no it's it's pretty, it's pretty well, it seems the same each time. It kind of lasts like 20 minutes or so, um and I've tried Tylenol and I've tried Advil um and I've even tried like a like an Alka-Seltzer and it hasn't really helped very much."}
{"input": "OK, so it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day, it only happens at certain times of the day?", "output": "Yeah, it'll come on for like 20 minutes like here and there."}
{"input": "OK, anything that you think triggers it?", "output": "I don't I don't really know. Uh I was kind of worried um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing, I I feel like it might it might be, it could be stress uhm but I'm I'm not really sure, my dad had a heart attack last year, he was pretty young. He's like in his 50s and it it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems."}
{"input": "OK, so these chest pains last for about 20 minutes, it only happens when you take a deep breath in, and after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off, or is it fairly sharp?", "output": "It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more, like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it."}
{"input": "OK, does it get worse with exercise?", "output": "Uh I don't think so. It just kind of, like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately, 'cause I've just had so much uh schoolwork piling up."}
{"input": "So you mainly get it at, so you can get it at rest, I should say.", "output": "Exactly, yeah, like when I'm studying."}
{"input": "OK, any fevers? Sick at all last little while?", "output": "Uh no, no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "No, you've been feeling well otherwise?", "output": "Yeah, I mean, besides just kind of feeling stressed, I uh like I I've been trying to quit smoking and that's been, that's been kind of hard, and school's just very, very busy right now."}
{"input": "When did you stop smoking?", "output": "Um so like I guess I'm trying to quit, I'm smoking less than I used to. I probably smoked 5 cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more."}
{"input": "OK, coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?", "output": "Um it's just that I'm I'm doing my Masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final uh thesis and there's just a lot involved and it's it's just making me very nervous."}
{"input": "OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?", "output": "Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this. I've never felt like so, like there is so little time to do the work that I need to do."}
{"input": "Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before, anytime in your life?", "output": "No, no, not before this."}
{"input": "OK. So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything, and you said you smoke.

So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?", "output": "Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months."}

{"input": "Okay, well congratulations on cutting down. Um, yeah, if you need help cutting that down even more, let us know, we have resources that you may be able to use.", "output": "Yeah, absolutely. Thank you."}
{"input": "Yeah, no problem. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that?", "output": "Yeah since I, oh CBD drops, I, at night I find that helps with uh, sleep and, and the pain in my knees."}
{"input": "Oh okay, are those prescribed drops?", "output": "Um. well I do buy, I get them from uh, like the uh, the OCS store, I think they're called."}
{"input": "Okay yeah. Okay, that's good that you're getting them from, like an official store.", "output": "Yeah they're for, they were, uh, my friend said that they worked for her, and so I just gave them a try and I, I found that they've helped."}

{"input": "Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?", "output": "No, I was just really concerned when I started to see um, the blood coming up more recently, and so I was just hoping to get this figured out."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?", "output": "That sounds like a good plan. Thank you."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Yeah, so I just came in today, I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old, and I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years, but just recently, just during the winter I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back and now, especially over the last few months whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again and recently for the last, I would say a week I've also been having some wheezing as well. So yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything is alright."}
{"input": "OK sure, so just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?", "output": "So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old."}
{"input": "13, OK, and you've been using Puffers since?", "output": "Yeah so from then to like maybe when I was 18 I was using Puffers, and then I continued using them on and off like, just the blue one whenever I needed it. But for the last five years, I haven't even had to use any puffers at all."}
{"input": "OK, OK. So can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you're experiencing right now? OK, so you said some shortness of breath, when did that start?", "output": "So yeah, in the last, I would say two months I've noticed it, similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running, I get short of breath very easily. But at rest I'm fine, I don't have any trouble, but I've noticed it for the last few months."}
{"input": "OK, so it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities?", "output": "Mhm."}
{"input": "OK. And do you feel wheezy as well?", "output": "Yeah, in the last one to two weeks I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Mainly during like, if I'm running or still, with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah, so that's been an issue for the last couple of weeks."}
{"input": "So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheezing eventually resolve?", "output": "Yeah, yeah, so I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own."}
{"input": "OK, how long does it last before it goes away?", "output": "Probably, at least, like I would say 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"input": "OK, OK.", "output": "Until I'm fully kind of recovered."}
{"input": "Ok, Ok. Are You coughing as well?", "output": "Uhm, yeah, when I'm exercising, that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day otherwise, I'm not coughing."}
{"input": "OK. And, when you cough, do you bring up phlegm or is it more like a dry cough?", "output": "It's mostly a dry cough, sometimes I do bring up some clear, whitish material, but usually it's dry."}
{"input": "OK. Alright, and do you feel like your heart's racing?", "output": "No, no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "No, you don't feel like you're breathing a lot more than usual?", "output": "Uh, no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, Do you still have puffers at home?", "output": "I actually, like I haven't used them for a while so no I don't have any puffers."}
{"input": "OK. Any weight loss recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, fevers or chills?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, any rashes or changes in your hair or skin or nails?", "output": "I do, I have just, uh, eczeme, I've had it for most of my life now, so especially during the winter I do get some irritation, especially on my hands. So yeah, some rashes, but that's about it."}
{"input": "OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "No, no changes."}
{"input": "Stuffy nose, runny nose, changes in your taste?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Changes in smell?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Chest pain?", "output": "No chest pain."}
{"input": "Do you find you get short of breath when you're laying down or it wakes you up at night?", "output": "No, just when I'm exercising, especially running."}
{"input": "OK, sure, any dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any headaches?", "output": "No headaches."}
{"input": "Any like, reflux, heartburn?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Nausea, vomiting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Changes to your bowel movements?", "output": "Nope."}
{"input": "OK, so you mentioned you were diagnosed with asthma and eczema in the past, any other longstanding medical conditions that you have?", "output": "Uh, no those those are the only ones."}
{"input": "OK, any allergies?", "output": "I do have, I think like, just seasonal allergies. I don't know if I'm allergic to pollen, but during the spring time I get allergies and then during the winter now I'm getting some of these symptoms that I'm talking about. So yeah, but none to any medications that I know of."}
{"input": "OK, so you're not getting any night time symptoms, and you're only getting day time symptoms with activity, right?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Has this prevented you from going to work or school?", "output": "Oh yeah, so I, just this past week, I usually do my running, like morning workout right before work, and just one of the days after I worked out, I felt just terrible, with this coughing and short of breath so I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own, so for the other days I have been going to work."}
{"input": "OK, OK, good. And, alright, and then any medications that you're on?", "output": "I'm on a, Just one of those steroid creams for my eczema."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Yep."}
{"input": "OK, uhm, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "No heart conditions, but yeah asthma is pretty big in my family, as well as eczema, like my mom has it, my sister has it, so yeah asthma is pretty big."}
{"input": "OK, how about cancers?", "output": "Uhm, no, I don't think anyone in the family has any cancers."}
{"input": "OK, and do you smoke?", "output": "No, I've never smoked. I'm pretty health focused and I can't even take if someone else is smoking, so no."}
{"input": "No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?", "output": "No, I don't drink alcohol, no drugs, yeah, I'm pretty, I like to stay very fit and healthy so nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?", "output": "No, not that I know of. I live by myself in my apartment. I've been working from home. I work as a programmer and so I only go outside for runs and stuff for groceries, so I haven't really seen anyone sick around me."}
{"input": "Yeah, and have you traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No, I've mainly been at home."}
{"input": "OK, good, and where's home?", "output": "Home is in Hamilton Ontario and I've just been working from home."}
{"input": "OK, do you live in a house, apartment, who do you live with?", "output": "I just live in an apartment by myself. I did have a roommate, like uh, that moved out just a couple of months ago. But yeah, right now I'm just by myself."}

{"input": "OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?", "output": "Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back."}
{"input": "Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "So what brings you here today?", "output": "Yeah I have my 2 year old daughter here with me. I don't know what's happening with her, but she seems to be getting really sick.

{"input": "OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?", "output": "I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own."}
{"input": "OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?", "output": "I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick."}
{"input": "OK, any past medical history?", "output": "Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis."}

{"input": "OK, alright, so yeah those are all the questions that I have.", "output": "Do you think this is like an urgent matter?"}
{"input": "Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?", "output": "Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?"}
{"input": "So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER.", "output": "OK. OK yeah, that sounds good."}

{"input": "OK, OK. Um has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications?", "output": "Yeah, we we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down so that was part of the reason why we we didn't come in 'cause he's had sore throats before but the fever bounced back and and the pain seems to have continued so we came in."}

So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well.. Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?", "output": "Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you."}

{"input": "How do you take any medications to help with your symptoms?", "output": "Yeah, some over the counter cold medicines.

{"input": "Uhm, when did the shortness of breath start?", "output": "So, this winter specifically, like we haven't been too active because of Covid this year, we've just been staying in the house all last year, but with the snow, I'd be shovelling snow whenever it fell and before I could be able to like 2 years ago be able to clear the driveway, no problem, but now even after half the driveway I've noticed I'm getting consisntely out of breath, I've got this nasty cough and it's prompted my wife to get me to call in, she's a little bit worried."}

Just couldn't do it."}
{"input": "Uhm, and how did you manage like how, how was that treated at that time and how did you get better?", "output": "Oh, I didn't do any. I just attributed to being, I don't know, out of shape a little bit and I worked as a mechanic when I was younger.

{"input": "Uhm, at rest or?", "output": "Nothing, nothing when I'm not moving."}
{"input": "OK, so the chest pain, when did that start?", "output": "First noticed it this winter on the driveway but it wasn't like I know what they say about a heart attack, supposed to like, the crushing pain in your chest that moves up your neck. Nothing like that. It's like my lungs, my throat. Like you're really, really out of breath, you know?"}
{"input": "OK, so you're attributing it mostly to your shortness of breath then?", "output": "I think so. I really hope this is my heart. I've never had a heart attack."}

{"input": "Rashes?", "output": "You know I got these weird things on my head. I think mainly because of the sun. Like these brown patches, but that wouldn't be a rash, would it?"}
{"input": "I'd have to examine that closer. If you think it's associated with the sun, it could be something like seborrheic keratosis, but I'd have to see what they look like so we can take a look at that later, if that's OK. And so any changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No. Stuffy nose, runny nose?", "output": "Had a bit of a cold couple months ago, but no, nothing recent."}

{"input": "OK. Uhm, did, is he, did they ever find a cause for his heart attack? Is he a healthy person?", "output": "Healthy, he's healthy. I you know I wouldn't call him too healthy of a guy either. He's a hard liver, let's call him that. I have why it happened, I think, obviously it's his diet man. He's like a hog. Steaks, butter, bacon I'm  assuming that's what did him in."}

It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now, but of course we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff. But right now, I'm thinking it could be something called COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder because of your smoking history. Uhm, so we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest x-ray, and I we'll try to go from there. If it is COPD we'll likely put you on a, like a puffer for that. A like a lot a short or long acting beta agonist, that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is. How does that sound?", "output": "Sounds great, doc. Thanks a million."}

You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.", "output": "Okay.

So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test.

So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics.

{"input": "Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?", "output": "That sounds good, thank you."}
{"input": "Can you tell me what brought you in here today?", "output": "Sure, I've been feeling very short of breath for the past, uh, two weeks, but even before that, I started feeling a little bit short of breath and I can't stop coughing and it just feels like it's really hard for me to breathe."}

{"input": "Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?", "output": "Yeah."}

{"input": "Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case.", "output": "OK, that sounds good. Thank you."}

{"input": "OK. And how about your sense of smell?", "output": "Actually, yeah come to think of it, I don't. I don't think I've really been smelling much."}

{"input": "OK, so. When was the last time you used an inhaler, a a week ago, a month ago?", "output": "I probably ran out like two months ago, but I wasn't using it every day. It was like one of those ones for like when you need it and, now, now this week I wish I would have had it."}

You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if you, if you have active TB.", "output": "OK"}
{"input": "So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that OK with you? Any questions or concerns?", "output": "Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?"}
{"input": "Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible.", "output": "OK, great, thank you."}

{"input": "Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "But umm, that's about it.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "What brings you in today?", "output": "Hey, so I just for the last couple days I've just been feeling really short of breath really rundown. Just like super tired and you know, normally really active and I'm just, I'm just having a rough go."}

{"input": "So. You've just been feeling very tired, can you I guess, like tell me a little bit more about your difficulty with breathing. When does it happen?", "output": "I think just like overall, I'm finding it like it's hard to hard to get like super deep breaths it's not like I I can't. I don't get the feeling that I can't breathe. It's just that everything's a little bit more like laborious."}
{"input": "OK. And you said that it started a few days ago. Have you had any other symptoms other than the difficulty breathing and the fatigue?", "output": "I mean. I felt I think I felt really hot yesterday. I don't know the thermometer, but I had my wife put her put her hand on my forehead and she got a I felt pretty warm.

We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet.", "output": "Thats what I was worried about."}
{"input": "Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. We’ll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate as much as possible and your results should come out in 24 to 48 hours and then the public health nurse should tell you what to do if your results are positive.", "output": "OK, OK no, that sounds fair,"}

Did you have anything else that you maybe wanted to add? Or that I maybe forgot to ask about?", "output": "No. I think that those are all the questions I had."}
{"input": "OK, so with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age and the like swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat is likely a group a strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation.", "output": "OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."}

So I’m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?", "output": "I don't think so, no."}
{"input": "Do you know what an X Ray is?", "output": "A little bit, yeah."}
{"input": "Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.", "output": "OK, that sounds good."}
{"input": "Thank you guys for chatting with me.", "output": "Yeah, thank you."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Yeah, so I've been feeling just really down recently in the last week. I started off by having this sore throat which started around 5 days ago and then I also noticed I've been getting some chills over the last few day. And on top of all of that, within the last three to four days I've been getting muscle aches all over my body."}
{"input": "OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?", "output": "So the fever. I think I haven't measured it, but I started having chills like 3 days ago."}
{"input": "Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?", "output": "I would say 3 days ago as well."}
{"input": "Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?", "output": "A little bit with solids with a sore throat but liquids, I'm doing OK right now."}
{"input": "OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?", "output": "No, I think my voice has been the same. It's just when I'm not talking, especially if I'm swallowing my own like spit, it still hurts sometimes, but mainly with solid food."}

{"input": "OK, any fatigue or exhaustion?", "output": "Now that you mention it, I do feel pretty tired over the last few days, I don't know if it's just because of my muscles aching all the time, or I don't know. I have definitely felt very tired."}

{"input": "OK, how about changes to your bowel movements?", "output": "No, I don't think so. I go regularly once a day and I haven't noticed any watery stool or diarrhea."}
{"input": "OK, that's good. Any changes in your appetite?", "output": "Yeah, with a sore throat I tend to like eat softer foods right now. I can't really, I don't really feel like eating."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK. How about nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No, no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain? You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?", "output": "Um, no, I don't think it's specifically my joints. I think more so I would say like around in my thighs. Then I would say just my upper arms hurt a lot. And even, uh, my upper back area hurts a lot as well, so it's kind of just everywhere. But those are some areas that hurt the most."}
{"input": "OK, OK, are you otherwise healthy?", "output": "Um, yeah, I do have a couple of things on my list. I do have high blood pressure. I have diabetes and other than that, I also have like high cholesterol."}

{"input": "OK yeah.", "output": "And then for diabetes I'm taking Metformin. And then for the cholesterol I'm taking this medication called Crestor, yeah. Yeah, but other than that, just like vitamin D and multi vitamins. Those are some of the medications that I'm taking."}
{"input": "Sure yeah, are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Yup."}
{"input": "OK, do you know if you got a vaccine called Shingrix for shingles and Pneumovax for pneumococcal infections?", "output": "Yeah, I actually think I got them just this past season. Uh, with all this COVID going on, I just wanted to make sure I got all those vaccines as well. So yeah, I recently just got them."}
{"input": "OK, good. And and how about any allergies?", "output": "Uh, no, I don't have any allergies."}
{"input": "OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "Uhm, no lung conditions and uhh heart conditions, both my mom and dad suffered from like high blood pressure. My dad also had a heart attack when in his 60s. Now there is some heart conditions that run in the family."}
{"input": "OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?", "output": "Uhm, m son actually got diagnosed with colorectal cancer just a few years ago."}
{"input": "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.", "output": "He's doing OK though. Like it was pretty scary at the time."}
{"input": "How old was he when he was diagnosed?", "output": "I think he was, yeah in his forties, 46."}
{"input": "OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?", "output": "Yeah I had it done. Everything came back normal so yeah, I'm not sure where he got it from."}
{"input": "OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?", "output": "No, no sick contacts that I know of. I've been mainly in my house. I do go outside for groceries and some things like that, but other than that I'm retired. I don't really go out too much."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK, and you said you're retired. Do you live alone? Do you live with anyone?", "output": "No, yeah, I live alone now. And I live in London in an apartment"}
{"input": "OK, any old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos?", "output": "No, nothing like that. It's a pretty safe building."}
{"input": "OK, good, and do you smoke?", "output": "I used to. I used to smoke, probably in my 20s to late 40s, but then I quit."}
{"input": "OK, good, good for you. How much did you smoke before you quit?", "output": "Probably one to two packs a day, I would say."}
{"input": "OK, that's good, that's good that you quit. Do you drink any alcohol?", "output": "Uhm, I just stick to some red wine, maybe a couple times a week."}
{"input": "OK, couple times a week so two to three times?", "output": "Yeah, I would say two to three times and, uh, I probably go through maybe 1 bottle every two weeks."}
{"input": "OK, OK. And then any marijuana?", "output": "No, no, I've never had any marijuana or any recreational drugs, no, nothing else."}
{"input": "OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?", "output": "Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?", "output": "Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?"}
{"input": "Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year.", "output": "OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on."}
{"input": "Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider.", "output": "OK, alright sounds good."}
{"input": "I was wondering if we could start by you telling me what brought you in today?", "output": "So I just came in today because I've been having a sore throat."}
{"input": "OK, could you tell me specifically where you're feeling the pain?", "output": "I would say it's mostly at the back of my throat."}
{"input": "OK, and how long has this been going on for?", "output": "I think it started last night."}
{"input": "OK. And how would you describe the pain? Is sharp, burning, stinging, dull?", "output": "I would describe it as like a burning pain."}
{"input": "OK, and uh, has anything, has the pain been getting any better any worse?", "output": "I think it's getting worse since last night."}
{"input": "OK, and any prior episodes like this where you had similar symptoms?", "output": "Nothing, nothing recently that I can recall, no."}
{"input": "OK, are you feeling the pain radiate anywhere else?", "output": "Uh, I think it's just staying at the back of my throat."}
{"input": "OK, and can you think of anything that triggered the the sore throat that you did just prior to the symptoms coming on?", "output": "Uh, no, not that I can think of. I haven't really changed what I drink or what I eat. Nothing really changed."}
{"input": "OK, and anything that's been making the pain worse?", "output": "Um, I would say when I, uh, especially when I'm eating when I'm swallowing, it hurts a lot, but that's about it."}
{"input": "OK. Anything that makes it better?", "output": "Uh, I I think when I drink like colder liquids or ice cream, it just soothes he pain a little bit."}
{"input": "OK. Any other symptoms that you been experiencing?", "output": "Um, so I I do find that like my mom told me, that I have my voice is kind of rough and like just a little bit hoarse. But other than that, besides the swallowing, um, nothing else really. I'm still able to swallow liquids but it's just the solids that causes some pain."}
{"input": "OK, have you had anything to eat today or when was the last time you had anything to eat?", "output": "I think I did have lunch today. I wasn't able to eat too too much just because of the pain. But yeah, just a couple hours ago I had I did have a lunch."}
{"input": "OK, and have you noticed any changes to your voice yourself?", "output": "Sorry, what was that?"}
{"input": "Have you noticed any changes to your like do you think your voice sounds different too?", "output": "Yeah, I definitely think um, like when I woke up this morning, my voice was definitely more like hoarse and more like raspy, almost. But yeah, I would say my voice has changed."}

{"input": "OK. And any recent changes to your weight?", "output": "No, I I I weigh around 150 and that hasn't really changed at all."}
{"input": "Alright, and uh, have you had any infections recently?", "output": "I think a couple of weeks ago I I did have a I would say like a bit of a runny nose. Maybe a little bit of soreness of my throat, but it just went away by itself."}
{"input": "OK, so you didn't have any treatment for that?", "output": "No, I didn't have any medications or anything. I didn't even go to the doctor then."}
{"input": "OK, and have you noticed any lumps in your in your neck or under your chin?", "output": "Uh no not that I know, I haven't really checked, but I haven't noticed anything like remarkable."}

So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics.", "output": "OK yeah, thank you for all that information.

{"input": "Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?", "output": "Uh no, that sounds great, thank you."}

The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though."}
{"input": "OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?", "output": "That sounds great.

{"input": "OK and then did he hit all his milestones? Up till now?", "output": "Yeah totally"}
{"input": "OK. And does he have any allergies?", "output": "Uhm, no, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing, so far."}
{"input": "Is he up to date with all his immunizations?", "output": "Yep."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "Uh, no, everyone is really healthy."}
{"input": "OK, and um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live?", "output": "He lives with me and my husband, and he has a little sister like just in town here."}
{"input": "OK, and is she healthy?", "output": "Yeah I like she, yeah she's healthy."}
{"input": "OK an any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No OK, um has he been around any sick contacts recently?", "output": "Not not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say. They haven't like contacted us about anything."}
{"input": "OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?", "output": "I don't think so. Like I realized that I can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure."}
{"input": "Mhmm.", "output": "So yeah yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead."}
{"input": "No go ahead.", "output": "So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit."}
{"input": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, sounds good."}
{"input": "OK great.", "output": "Thank you."}
{"input": "Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but right now it sounds like a, it sounds like an infection.", "output": "OK yeah, that's good to know."}
{"input": "So what brings you in?", "output": "Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four?", "output": "Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time."}
{"input": "OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?", "output": "Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material."}
{"input": "White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?", "output": "It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat."}
{"input": "OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?", "output": "I would say it's harsh."}
{"input": "Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?", "output": "Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well."}
{"input": "OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?", "output": "No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly."}
{"input": "OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing?", "output": "Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine."}
{"input": "You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm?", "output": "No, no, I haven't noticed any blood."}
{"input": "OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes?", "output": "Not that I've noticed, no."}
{"input": "OK, any weight loss?", "output": "Um, I don't think so."}
{"input": "OK, fevers?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, exhaustion?", "output": "Um yeah, I would say like for the last few months I am a bit more tired."}
{"input": "Mhmm OK, how about changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "No, I haven't experienced that."}
{"input": "How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose?", "output": "Uh no, not really."}
{"input": "No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste?", "output": "Uh nope."}
{"input": "No, OK. Uh chest pain?", "output": "Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest."}
{"input": "Oh, yeah.", "output": "But it tends to go away with uh just some rest."}
{"input": "Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing?", "output": "Uh no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs?", "output": "I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter."}
{"input": "OK, OK and how long has that been going on?", "output": "Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least."}
{"input": "OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Numbness or tingling?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "No headaches?", "output": "Uh no, no headaches."}
{"input": "Changes to your bowel movements?", "output": "No, I tend to go like once a day. And yeah, it's pretty normal."}
{"input": "OK, uh nausea or vomiting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. And are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding conditions? I know you said you have COPD, anything else?", "output": "I do have high blood pressure."}
{"input": "OK. Do you have something called congestive heart failure?", "output": "Uh no, what's that?"}
{"input": "OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs.", "output": "Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much."}
{"input": "OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications?", "output": "Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril."}
{"input": "OK, so that's for your blood pressure?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead.", "output": "Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer."}
{"input": "Yeah.", "output": "And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva."}
{"input": "OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?", "output": "Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?", "output": "Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective."}
{"input": "OK, yeah. Um OK. And have you had any recent blood work done?", "output": "Uh, no, I haven't been to the doctor for a while."}
{"input": "OK. And do you have any allergies?", "output": "Um I think I have allergies to uh like um amoxicillin, I got like a rash once."}
{"input": "OK. Have you had any, uh, amoxicillin, or like penicillin type antibiotics recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. Um are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Yep."}
{"input": "OK. Um, you're not quite at this age range yet, but uh we do recommend the pneumococcal vaccine when you turn 65. And um did you get the flu vaccine this year?", "output": "Uh yeah I did, with the pandemic going on, I usually don't get it, but I got it this year."}
{"input": "OK, good good. Um any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "Uhm, lung conditions I don't think so. Heart conditions, uh my father did have a heart attack in his 60s, but he's fine. He's he's living right now."}
{"input": "OK OK, any cancers?", "output": "Cancers, I think my uncle from my father's side um had uh bladder cancer."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Um do you smoke?", "output": "I used to smoke. Um I just quit a few years ago."}
{"input": "OK, congrats. Um how much did you used to smoke?", "output": "Uhm, I don't know, probably I went through a like a whole pack every day, I would say for at least 30 years of my life."}
{"input": "OK, OK um so it's good that you stopped. Um do you take any other recreational drugs?", "output": "Uh no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink?", "output": "Uh I drink every like, maybe a beer a day."}
{"input": "OK. Um are you um living with anyone right now?", "output": "Yeah, it's just uh me and my wife."}
{"input": "OK, where do you guys live?", "output": "Uh we just live uh outside of the city in in a condominium."}
{"input": "OK, any uh old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos, anything like that in the condo?", "output": "No, it's pretty well maintained."}
{"input": "OK, good. And have you been in contact with any anyone sick recently?", "output": "No, I've mainly just been trying to stay inside. I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone."}
{"input": "OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province?", "output": "Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?", "output": "Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be."}
{"input": "Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?", "output": "OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test.", "output": "OK, sounds good."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "So I've just I had some sinus problems in the past. I've had some sinus infections and I just feel like I have one right now and I know that like I know that you know, a lot of the time I I've done all the things that I've been told to do in the past like I've been doing, like Saline rinses and just doesn't feel like it's helping very much right now. When I rinse, I'm getting like this greenie gross kind of mucus coming out. And it's just like giving me this like headache. It just feels crappy."}
{"input": "Yeah, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. So this runny nose, OK, do you have a cough at all?", "output": "Uh, no I don't have a cough."}
{"input": "Any shortness of breath?", "output": "Uhm, I don't have a real like shortness of breath, but it does feel congested."}
{"input": "OK, how about wheeziness?", "output": "Uh, no wheeziness."}
{"input": "No wheeziness, OK. And how about, how about like sore throat or loss of taste?", "output": "Uhm, uh so my throat not sore in like the way that you get catch a sore throat but I get a lot of post nasal drip and it makes it like stingy. So it's like it's sore in that way, but it's not like you know if you have like strep throat or something."}
{"input": "OK. How about changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "Weight loss?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Fevers or chills?", "output": "I, I took my temp last night. It was pretty high. It was like 99 point like something, uhm 99 like 7 or something."}
{"input": "Ah, OK.", "output": "So my thermometer said that's high, I don't, I don't really know, but yeah."}
{"input": "OK and how about like, facial pain or pressure or feeling like it's full?", "output": "Oh yeah, I have that. It's like yeah, all on the front part of my face."}
{"input": "OK. And then you mentioned some nasal obstruction, some discharge and you said no loss of smell, right?", "output": "No, I didn't lose any smell. Like sometimes it's kind of hard to smell because it's so plugged up."}
{"input": "Right.", "output": "I still have like I'm able to smell like, especially after I do the rinses. It helps a little bit."}
{"input": "OK, how about like a chest pain?", "output": "Uhm, no, I haven't had any chest pain."}
{"input": "No, OK. Any issues with bowel movements or have those been normal?", "output": "Those have been normal."}
{"input": "OK. Any changes in your urine?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. Any headaches?", "output": "Yeah, like I get that like sinusy headache that you know, it's pretty common for me, like kind of just all in like the front of my face and sometimes it kind of feels like it goes all over."}
{"input": "How about umm, how about like dizziness or fainting?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?", "output": "No, this is pretty well, pretty well the only thing. I had some problems with my knee like I had some problems with the ACL, so like I see like an orthopaedic person for that, but otherwise, otherwise I'm healthy."}
{"input": "OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?", "output": "No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore."}
{"input": "OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?", "output": "Uh, so I had an ACL repair surgery."}
{"input": "Oh right, yeah, OK.", "output": "And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital."}
{"input": "OK, OK. How about immunizations? Are you up to date?", "output": "I think so. I never really didn't get any."}
{"input": "OK. Any allergies?", "output": "Uh, like a little bit to cats but nothing else."}
{"input": "OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?", "output": "No, not that I know of."}
{"input": "OK. How about smoking, do you smoke?", "output": "No, no."}
{"input": "No, OK. Do you drink alcohol?", "output": "I drink a few beers on the weekend."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "You know five or six per weekend."}
{"input": "OK. And then, five or six for weekend. OK and any recreational drugs?", "output": "I will occasionally take like a cannabis, like a capsule like the oil in the capsule."}
{"input": "OK, and what is that for?", "output": "Just like recreational. Also like I mean my knee, my knee pain. Sometimes it helps."}
{"input": "Mhmm, OK.", "output": "But essentially that that might be like once like per month or something."}
{"input": "OK. OK. Alright, and, any sick contacts recently?", "output": "No, no. I've been working from home."}
{"input": "OK. OK, and any travel recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. And where do you live?", "output": "I live here in town with my wife and our teenage son."}
{"input": "OK. Is anyone at home sick?", "output": "No, they're fine."}
{"input": "They're fine. OK, and what about.. Sorry?", "output": "They're both working from home like doing school from home too. So we rarely don't go anywhere like my wife goes to get groceries and that's about it."}
{"input": "OK, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold anything like that at home?", "output": "No, no, it's a pretty new house."}
{"input": "OK, alright, any pets at home?", "output": "We have a dog. It's a labradoodle."}
{"input": "OK, yeah.", "output": "And that's it, yeah."}
{"input": "How long have you had him?", "output": "Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him."}
{"input": "OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?", "output": "I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you."}
{"input": "Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?", "output": "So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do."}
{"input": "OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?", "output": "Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you."}
{"input": "What brings you in?", "output": "Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried."}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure. What started first?", "output": "I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that."}
{"input": "OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?", "output": "Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius."}
{"input": "OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?", "output": "I did it under the armpit."}
{"input": "OK. OK, uhm so you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK is he coughing at all?", "output": "He was yesterday but not really now."}
{"input": "OK and was it a dry cough?", "output": "I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out."}
{"input": "OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, and did he seem wheezy?", "output": "Uh, no."}
{"input": "No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?", "output": "Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting."}
{"input": "OK. Has he had any weight loss?", "output": "No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment."}
{"input": "OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?", "output": "Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired."}
{"input": "OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?", "output": "Uh, no, not that I can tell."}
{"input": "No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?", "output": "Uhm, no, nothing like that."}
{"input": "No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?", "output": "Uh, no, I don't think so."}
{"input": "No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now?", "output": "Probably 5 or 6."}
{"input": "5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?", "output": "No, it's pretty much the same."}
{"input": "OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No. How about his urine?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?", "output": "Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today."}
{"input": "OK, is he crying a lot?", "output": "Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?", "output": "Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns."}
{"input": "OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?", "output": "Yeah, no issues there so far."}
{"input": "OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?", "output": "Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far."}
{"input": "OK. How about allergies? Does he have any?", "output": "Not that I know of."}
{"input": "No, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, and does anyone at home smoke?", "output": "No, no one smokes."}
{"input": "OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?", "output": "Uh, no, not that I know of. Uhm his older sister does go to school though, but I don't know if she might have carried something home."}
{"input": "OK, how old is she?", "output": "She's six years old."}
{"input": "Six, OK. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?", "output": "No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms."}
{"input": "OK. Any travel recently?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK. And who does he live with at home?", "output": "Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother."}
{"input": "OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?", "output": "Uh, no nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?", "output": "No, I think that was all."}
{"input": "OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?", "output": "That sounds good. Thank you."}
{"input": "How may I help you?", "output": "So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day."}
{"input": "OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?", "output": "More so when I'm like exerting myself, if I'm sitting down it's better, but I still have, I would say, like my breathing is not normal right now, like it's, I still have to take deeper breaths. And I do have that chest tightness when I take those deep breaths."}
{"input": "OK, do you have any chest pain?", "output": "No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "So yeah, that's, that's that."}

{"input": "OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?", "output": "Yeah, we were like just moving boxes.

{"input": "Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?", "output": "No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses."}

{"input": "Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "You're welcome, take care.", "output": "You too."}
{"input": "What brings you in today?", "output": "So, just for the past, like 3 days I've been coughing. It's I I don't feel particularly sick. I'm just kind of dry like annoying call that won't go away and then today I took my temp in it It's pretty high. It was like 99 point like 9. I didn't really take it the other days, so I guess so I just thought I'd better come get it checked out because I, I am on like a biologic medication, so, for my Crohn's disease."}
{"input": "OK, yeah. Yeah, thank you for coming in. I think it's good that you are getting this checked out as early as possible. So just to rewind a little bit. When did your dry cough start?", "output": "Uh, like 3 days ago three days ago."}
{"input": "3 days ago, OK. And when did your fever start?", "output": "So I didn't take my temp, but like the other days, but like for sure this morning."}
{"input": "OK um, OK, so the cough is it always a dry cough or do you sometimes bring up sputum or blood?", "output": "Yeah, it's always a dry cough. It's really just annoying."}

{"input": "OK yeah, that makes sense. Umm, alright. Do any changes in your urine?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No changes in urine.. How about dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Any confusion or memory loss?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "OK, that's good to hear. You mentioned you're on biologics for Crohn's disease? Are there any other medications that you're on?", "output": "Um, just like the hydrocortisone, cream on occasion."}
{"input": "Right. OK. Um, OK and. Do you have any allergies?", "output": "Ah, like I have some seasonal allergies, like ah, its ragweed, which is not like right now, is not the time for it. And like cats and dogs."}
{"input": "OK. OK.", "output": "It's just like this environmental, it's not like not like the really dangerous allergies, you know?"}
{"input": "Right, OK. Um, how about immunizations? Are you up to date?", "output": "I think so."}
{"input": "Alright, and in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?", "output": "Oh, like my dad had high blood pressure, but other than that I don't think there is anything that stood out."}

{"input": "No, OK. Those were all the questions that I had today were there was there anything else that you wanted to add? Anything that I missed perhaps?", "output": "I don't think so. I think that's it."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "You know, I hope I hope I just wanted to come in in case it was something bad because I you know I have those other health problems. I just want to make sure. Yeah."}
{"input": "Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well.", "output": "Oh ok."}

And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics.

He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?"}

{"input": "Are you concerned about that?", "output": "Yeah, for sure."}
{"input": "Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?", "output": "OK, great. Thank you."}

{"input": "OK. Uhm, so I I think that was all the questions that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about or or that you wanted to mention?", "output": "Uh, no, that was kind of it. What should I do for him?"}
{"input": "Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night.", "output": "OK."}

Like maybe three days ago, I started to feel like my throat was dry and I was like, oh, maybe I need to drink more water or something and then the next day I started like actually coughing."}
{"input": "OK, is it a dry cough or a wet cough?", "output": "Yeah it's really dry."}

{"input": "OK, OK. Um and you mentioned that your throat was also dry. Do you have a sore throat?", "output": "Maybe a little bit this morning, yeah, like at first it just felt dry like I was thinking like, oh it's like you know I need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels, now it's starting to think, I feel a little bit sore, I think."}

But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now.

{"input": "That's good, that's good. Is there anything else that makes the the pressure and the pain better?", "output": "Um, I have done those like, kind of those steam um, therapies. That sometimes helps."}
{"input": "Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?", "output": "Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it."}
{"input": "Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?", "output": "Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything."}

{"input": "Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do.", "output": "Okay."}
{"input": "Do you have any questions for me?", "output": "Uh no, that's all. Thank you so much."}
{"input": "so I hear you've been having some some nausea vomiting, diarrhea. Can you tell me a little more about that?", "output": "Yeah, so uh, like around three or four days ago I started, uh to get really nauseous and since then I've been vomiting every few hours and really I don't know. Just yesterday started to started to have some diarrhea as well."}
{"input": "OK, so that's three or four days ago for the nausea and vomiting, is that correct?", "output": "Uh yeah yeah the nausea start kind of started three or four days ago and then after that that the vomiting came. So yeah maybe the vomiting was more like 2 days ago it started, and then diarrhea kind of the last day."}
{"input": "OK OK. OK, and before that you were feeling well?", "output": "Yeah, well I was feeling maybe like a little tired for a day or two before, but um, I don't know. Sometimes you just feel like that, so I didn't really think much of it, but."}
{"input": "Sure, OK. And since it started, have, I know these all kind of started at different times but has have your symptoms gotten worse overtime?", "output": "Yeah, they they. They've gotten worse. At first they were kinda really spread it like far enough apart that I would thought it was just going to go away on its own and then it it hasn't so has me concerned."}
{"input": "OK, I'm just going to ask you a few more questions about the vomiting. Have you noticed any blood in your vomit?", "output": "No, it's been kind of yellowish."}
{"input": "OK, and just if you notice like a like a really bright kind of yellow green substance in your vomit.", "output": "Umm not really bright, but I mean maybe more like dark green or yeah nothing bright."}
{"input": "OK And you said now it's it's happening every couple hours for you?", "output": "Um yeah every few every few hours it's been ah. It seems to be what I'm like like after eating, it is just making me making me nauseous."}
{"input": "OK, OK, so have you been able to eat anything? When's the last time you actually had something to eat?", "output": "Yesterday I did, I had some soup and was able to to keep most of it down, but um. But it's been mostly liquid's I've been drinking."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "My appetite really hasn't been there."}
{"input": "OK, uh. In terms of diarrhea, so that started a couple days ago, if you only had diarrhea since then, or have you had like any form stools?", "output": "No, it's it. It was started more like yesterday and it's really only been diarrhea since. So yeah, like twice last night and then like three to three times this morning."}
{"input": "OK. Have you ever had anything like this before?", "output": "No, I haven't been sick like this before."}

{"input": "OK. OK, have you noticed any changes to your sense of smell or taste?", "output": "No, I haven't noticed any changes to those."}
{"input": "OK. Mmmm. And you live, do you live alone or with family?", "output": "I I live with family. I live with my wife and two children."}
{"input": "OK there. How are they feeling right now?", "output": "They were. They've been feeling fine."}
{"input": "OK. OK, um, so just in terms of your general health, are there any conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?", "output": "I have anxiety and back pain. So, uh, I do get ah. Some hydromorphone for for that."}
{"input": "OK", "output": "For the back pain anyway."}
{"input": "OK. Um, and what medications do you take besides the hydromorphone?", "output": "Uh, uh, Escitalopram."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "And that we've been working on trying on decreasing the hydromorphone now over the last year. So it's a work in progress though."}

{"input": "OK, sad to hear that. Do you have any allergies?", "output": "Um yeah, to penicillin. I had a hives when I was a kid."}
{"input": "OK Um, OK um. Let me see, uh, so in terms of your family history. Do you have any family history of your digestive system problems or respiratory problems?", "output": "Um Yeah, no one in my families had any problems with their stomach or I haven't heard of any like colon cancer. I mean my my dad had a heart attack when he was in his late 60s, but that's kind of the only thing that I can think happened in my family in terms of health."}
{"input": "OK. And it sounds so. It sounds like you live at home with your family, do you? What do you do for work?", "output": "Yeah, I I work for a tech company so I was going down to meet a potential buyer for one of our products."}
{"input": "OK. OK, and just in terms of your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?", "output": "Um yeah I will have wine. Maybe one or two glasses on on the weekend."}

{"input": "Um OK. So do you use any other substances, like cannabis?", "output": "Um I will have a joint every once in awhile if I with friends, but that's been it's been awhile. 'cause of the pandemic haven't really been hanging out with anybody."}
{"input": "Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms.", "output": "OK, that sounds good."}
{"input": "So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing.", "output": "OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home."}
{"input": "Perfect. Actually, don't go into the store. Have someone else get it for you, but.", "output": "OK will do. Thank you."}
{"input": "How are you?", "output": "I'm not so good, these last few days I haven't benn able to reallykeep anything down and not feeling so good."}
{"input": "OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days? 3 days?", "output": "Well, I feel like maybe the last five days I just haven't been feeling so good and I haven't really felt like eating. But these last two days I've been really nauseous and I've thrown up a few times."}
{"input": "OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy? Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?", "output": "Yeah, I do feel hot and um, yeah, maybe a bit tired."}
{"input": "Tired? OK. And nausea and vomiting. Are you throwing up or just feeling nauseous?", "output": "Mostly nauseous, but yeah, yesterday I threw up like three or four times and then again today I threw up like two or three times."}
{"input": "OK, are you throwing up any blood?", "output": "No, I didn't see any red. It was mostly like yellow and umm, liquidy beacuse I haven't been eating much solids or like just like food. I've been mostly just having drinks."}

{"input": "OK. And so no diarrhea, no constipation?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, no blood in your stool?", "output": "No blood, I haven't seen any red."}
{"input": "OK, and how about issues swallowing food?", "output": "Oh yeah, no problem swallowing. Just haven't felt hungry."}
{"input": "OK, so you don't have much of an appetite then.", "output": "No, not not really."}
{"input": "OK, alright, so um, any changes in in taste?", "output": "Um, maybe I mean, yeah, I think I might not be really tasting things the same."}
{"input": "OK, how about smell?", "output": "Now that you say it, I might, uh, yeah I think my smell has been impacted as well. I can't really smell anything."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "I thought that was kind of weird, but didn't think anything of it actually until you just asked me."}
{"input": "Yeah for sure. And how about any changes in your vision or hearing?", "output": "No changes to vision or hearing."}
{"input": "OK, any discharge?", "output": "Uh, nothing like that that, but I mean my eyes were a bit, they've been a bit red these last two days."}
{"input": "OK, have they been in any pain?", "output": "Nope, no pain and I've been able to see everything OK. It's just I just noticed they were a little bit more red. I just thought maybe I don't know I was, I've just been tired."}
{"input": "Yeah for sure. Any coughing?", "output": "Uhh, yeah I haven't had a cough but um, I've had a cough for a few years now, so yeah, that's not really a change for me."}

{"input": "OK, and muscle aches to go along with that?", "output": "Yeah, bit in my like kind of upper arms and legs a little bit."}
{"input": "OK, you said you've been feeling groggy. Do you feel dizzy at all?", "output": "Not dizzy, just maybe that I'm like moving in slow motion."}
{"input": "OK yeah, any confusion or memory loss?", "output": "No, I think I've been OK."}
{"input": "OK, any rashes?", "output": "No, I haven't noticed any rashes."}
{"input": "OK, how about headaches?", "output": "Yeah, these last few days I've had a bit of a headache as well.It hasn't been very intense, so, um, I'm not worried about it too much."}
{"input": "Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?", "output": "Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing."}
{"input": "Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?", "output": "No, no, it's pretty similar to headaches that I've had before."}
{"input": "OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?", "output": "Yeah, well I have high blood pressure and also, high cholesterol, so I do take medications for both of those. So yeah, I take a statin and Amlodipine I think."}
{"input": "OK, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?", "output": "Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter."}
{"input": "Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?", "output": "No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats. But I mean now that you asked if I felt more hot than than usual, maybe."}
{"input": "OK, and did you take your temperature?", "output": "Uh, I did and the last time I checked it was a few days ago and at that time I didn't have a fever, but I mean, I'm still feeling hot so I'm not sure."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?", "output": "Um, no. Like the last time I was in the hospital with, it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal."}
{"input": "OK, that's good. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?", "output": "Uh, yeah, actually got the shingles vaccine a few months ago."}
{"input": "OK.", "output": "Probably closer to a year ago now, actually."}
{"input": "Oh great, OK, that's awesome and are you allergic to anything?", "output": "Just peanuts."}
{"input": "Peanuts, OK. Do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions?", "output": "Yeah, my son has asthma. But nobody in my family's had a heart problem, though."}
{"input": "OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?", "output": "Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test."}
{"input": "OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?", "output": "No, just my dad had colon cancer."}
{"input": "OK. And do you smoke at all?", "output": "No, I don't."}
{"input": "OK, how about marijuana?", "output": "Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana."}

But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?", "output": "Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you."}

{"input": "OK, OK. Um, so just kind of going through what it could be that you have right now. I'm thinking a few things and we kind of like to go through and make sure we're not missing anything. So in terms of like vascular stuff it could be something like like CHF or pulmonary embolism and that stands for congestive heart failure, but you're very young. You seem like you're very healthy, so that's probably lower on our differential obviously.", "output": "OK, yeah hopefully."}
{"input": "An infection would be the biggest one right now with the cough with it seems like you have chills and night sweats. Yeah, so would have to do more in terms of taking your temperature, and see if you can do like more work up like a chest X-ray to see what's happening in there. Um autoimmune stuff could be like sarcoidosis but unlikely 'cause it seems like this is an acute issue for you.", "output": "See I never come in besides like because I you know need my insulin. I never even go to the, I didn't even want to come in and just like it wasn't going away."}
{"input": "Yeah yeah. And then other things like COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and like like cancer stuff is super low on the differential right now, so. Yeah, so um. So yeah, so for right now we'll start. We can start by doing some blood work. First I do a physical exam, of course. And then from there we would kind of do some blood work to see if your white blood cell count is high. And then we can do a chest X-ray to see if there is like a consolidation if there's pneumonia, or you know or, or anything viral? Um, do you have any questions?Anything that you wanted to add that I missed?", "output": "I don't think I don't think so, um yeah, I just hope I can get feeling better.

Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well."}

Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much."}
{"input": "OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?", "output": "No, this one, this one's pretty small."}
{"input": "This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?", "output": "I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous."}
{"input": "OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?", "output": "No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash."}
{"input": "OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?", "output": "No, no, I've been fine."}
{"input": "OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?", "output": "Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else."}
{"input": "That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?", "output": "Uh no, I didn't, no."}
{"input": "OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?", "output": "Uh no it was just uh me and my husband."}
{"input": "OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?", "output": "We were uh in Strathroy along the creek."}
{"input": "OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?", "output": "No, no. I've been pretty healthy."}
{"input": "OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?", "output": "Uh just for my cholesterol."}
{"input": "OK, are you taking and medications for that?", "output": "Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one."}
{"input": "OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?", "output": "Uh no."}
{"input": "So no drug allergies?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?", "output": "Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked."}
{"input": "OK. So no headaches?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Nothing like that?", "output": "Nothing like that."}
{"input": "OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?", "output": "No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out."}
{"input": "No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?", "output": "Great, thanks."}
{"input": "So what brings you in the clinic today?", "output": "Hey, uh I just had this cough that's been like really bothering me."}
{"input": "OK, how long have you had that for?", "output": "Uh like in the past few days, it's been really like gross and I've been coughing up this like gunk, but I've had it for, I've honestly had a cough for like three months, it's just like sometimes it's like there, and sometimes it kind of goes away. It feels like it keeps coming back."}
{"input": "OK, have you had any chest pain?", "output": "Um no, like it kinda hurts when I cough now but not not like on its own."}
{"input": "OK, have you noticed any fevers at home? Or fevers at all in the last couple days?", "output": "Uh I've been feeling like hot at night in the past couple days, uh but like I didn't actually take my temp."}
{"input": "OK, have you had any night sweats? You wake up, the sheets are soaked?", "output": "Uh no, not that."}
{"input": "Nothing like that, OK, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss over the last little while?", "output": "Um, no."}
{"input": "So so you go on the scale, you lost a few pounds, but you haven't been trying to basically.", "output": "No, like I, I don't really weigh myself, but I don't think so."}
{"input": "So you haven't been noticing clothes have been fitting loose or anything like that?", "output": "No, no, like I wish but no."}
{"input": "Got it, got it. Now let's talk about what you're bringing up with your cough. What colour is it?", "output": "It's really gross. It's kind of like greenish."}
{"input": "Greenish, OK, and also any red or any blood with it?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK. And doesn't smell at all, smell funky?", "output": "I haven't noticed."}
{"input": "OK, so you've just been bringing this stuff up for the last couple of days, when specifically? Two days ago, three days ago?", "output": "Like maybe maybe three days."}
{"input": "Three days ago, and you said before that you kind of had this dry cough before. Uh when did you first notice that? Three months ago, you said?", "output": "Yeah, I was uh, I I do like um, it like sounds silly but I do like a pole dancing class just for exercise and I was like at my class and I kind of just started to like feel like I was like a little coughy and like I don't think there's anything special, that was just like when I noticed it."}
{"input": "OK, anyone at the class sick at that time?", "output": "I don't think so, like it's a really long time ago, I don't really remember."}
{"input": "Got it, got it. Anyone sick near you or around you in the last couple of weeks?", "output": "No, no, not that I can think of."}
{"input": "OK, and regarding other, any, we already talked about chest pain, uh you've been able to eat food alright?", "output": "Uh yeah, like uh yeah it's like pretty normal."}
{"input": "So no nausea, no vomiting?", "output": "Uh no, none of that."}
{"input": "You don't have a stiff neck at all, do you?", "output": "No, no I don't."}
{"input": "OK, but how about other parts of your body? Any pain? Tenderness anywhere?", "output": "I don't think so, no. Like I'm I'm a little tired now, um like the cough is like maybe for like a month, it's been kind of waking me up a little bit so my my sleep hasn't been great, but I don't think it's like I have like pain. I'm just like tired."}
{"input": "OK so the cough does wake you up at night?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "Does it wake you up every night?", "output": "Yeah, like pretty well, for like the last, not like all three months, but probably the last month."}
{"input": "OK. Alright. I'm just gonna move on, talk a little bit about you and the past. Uh so any issues that you've seen a doctor for before?", "output": "Uh just like eczema."}
{"input": "OK, and do you take anything for that?", "output": "Just like moisturizing creams, um like my family doctor back home said like, a couple times when it was really bad she would give me one like to go get at like shoppers, but right now it's not bad so I just have just like a regular cream."}
{"input": "Got it, ever been hospitalized before?", "output": "Uh, no."}
{"input": "OK, any surgeries?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "OK so aside from the eczema, it sounds like you're pretty healthy eh?", "output": "Yeah."}
{"input": "OK. Do you have any allergies?", "output": "Uh I think maybe um maybe cats because, I I don't have one, but sometimes I've noticed stuff, but I've never like, it's never really been too big of an issue."}
{"input": "OK, so you've never taken any medications or got stung by a bee and had any trouble breathing or even a certain food?", "output": "No."}

{"input": "OK, any trouble recently?", "output": "No no."}
{"input": "No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?", "output": "Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?"}
{"input": "Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?", "output": "That sounds really good. Thank you."}
{"input": "So what brings you in?", "output": "Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned."}
{"input": "Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four?", "output": "Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time."}
{"input": "OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?", "output": "Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material."}
{"input": "White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?", "output": "It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat."}
{"input": "OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?", "output": "I would say it's harsh."}
{"input": "Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?", "output": "Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well."}
{"input": "OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?", "output": "No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly."}
{"input": "OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing?", "output": "Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine."}
{"input": "You're fine now, OK, uh, alright. And sorry, forgot to ask you earlier, do you see any blood in your phlegm?", "output": "No, no, I haven't noticed any blood."}
{"input": "OK, any uh changes to your hair or on your skin, like rashes?", "output": "Not that I've noticed, no."}
{"input": "OK, any weight loss?", "output": "Um, I don't think so."}

{"input": "How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose?", "output": "Uh no, not really."}
{"input": "No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste?", "output": "Uh nope."}
{"input": "No, OK. Uh chest pain?", "output": "Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest."}

{"input": "OK, OK and how long has that been going on?", "output": "Probably, uh, I've had this issue for like a pretty long time um, probably I would say the last year at least."}
{"input": "OK, OK, last year. Um any uh dizziness or fainting spells?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "No, OK, any memory issues, uh confusion?", "output": "No."}
{"input": "Numbness or tingling?", "output": "No, nothing like that."}
{"input": "No headaches?", "output": "Uh no, no headaches."}
{"input": "Changes to your bowel movements?", "output": "No, I tend to go like once a day. And yeah, it's pretty normal."}

{"input": "OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs.", "output": "Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that.

{"input": "Yeah.", "output": "And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva."}
{"input": "OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?", "output": "Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help."}
{"input": "OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?", "output": "Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective."}

Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now.

And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there.", "output": "Great sounds good, thank you."}
{"input": "Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do.", "output": "Alright, sounds good.

{"input": "Yeah, certainly, uhm, how much blood have you coughed up?", "output": "Oh, I don't know. I think it was it was a little bit."}
{"input": "Did it happen each time, or has it only been a couple of times?", "output": "I think maybe, two or three times but then there have also been times when I cough up this, this stuff that I cough up is a little bit pink in color. It's not exactly blood, but it's, it's, you know, pinkish."}
{"input": "OK, and are you producing sputum each time you're coughing up?", "output": "Most of the times, yes."}
{"input": "OK, is this a change from previously? Did you have a dry cough before?", "output": "A bit more of a dry cough before, but I mean, so sometimes it will be a dry cough sometimes, uh, it was more of a wet cough, but it was, it was usually just this white thing coming up.

So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back.

And so we'll order a chest X-ray, some blood gases and do a sputum culture and possibly start antibiotics, but, depending on the severity we may not not need to just yet. And then we'll also use some inhalers as well as inhaled steroid to help with the inflammation in the airways.", "output": "Sure."}

It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just couldn't take deep breaths like I noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow and now it's, especially when I'm coughing, it's like I really have to sit down and catch my breath."}
{"input": "Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?", "output": "Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing."}

Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER.

{"input": "Yeah, so definitely one thing we need to rule out with the shortness of breath is any viral or viral infection like coronavirus so we will get a test done for you today. However, since this seems to be kind of a chronic issue, been going on for a few months and you're having with the shortness of breath, some other symptoms, the rash below knees, or is what we called erythema nodosum and irritation in your eyes and you have a family history of auto immune conditions as well. So sometimes you can get an auto immune disease that affects the lungs, so we need to rule out something like sarcoidosis which can cause fibrosis in your lungs and cause shortness of breath. So just to work that up will get a chest X Ray and also do some inflammatory marker tests like CRP, ESR and some other rheumatological tests as well, and based on what comes back we may have to refer you to a rheumatologist for further management and treatment. Yeah, so let's just do some of those tests 1st, and then we'll go from there. You have any questions?", "output": "No, that sounds great. Thank you so much."}

{"input": "No. OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for her today, so definitely since there is a risk that she might be having another ear infection, we will need to do like a full physical examination. I'll have to look into her ear to see if I see any inflammation or perforation and then based on that we'll discuss some management. She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right? So we may even do some conservative management and get her to take some maybe pain medications and then go from there. Or ear drops.", "output": "OK."}
{"input": "Uh, but yeah, so we'll do the examination and then go from there. She said she has, besides the fever and that your pain she's not really having any other symptoms so? I don't think she needs to get tested for Covid right now, but that's something we can consider as well if she develops other symptoms.", "output": "OK, that sounds great. Thank you."}
