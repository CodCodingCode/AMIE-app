She hasn't had any weird blood pressure or anything like that to tell you about.\\nDOCTOR: Are there any other physical features or symptoms, such as swelling in her neck, recent changes in her height or weight compared to peers, or any other signs of hormonal imbalances?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything like that. She hasn\u2019t said anything about her neck or getting taller or anything different really, but she does seem a bit different from other kids sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Has she experienced any episodes of dizziness, fainting, or dehydration recently, which could suggest an adrenal crisis?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think so? I haven't really fainted or felt really dizzy, but sometimes I feel kind of weird, like light-headed or something, but I didn't think it was a big deal.\\nDOCTOR: Has she recently experienced symptoms like dizziness, fainting, dehydration, or episodes of low blood sugar that might indicate an adrenal crisis?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I felt a little dizzy sometimes, like I was gonna fall or pass out, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s what it was.
