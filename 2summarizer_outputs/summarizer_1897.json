I try to keep going, but I guess I worry a lot about messing things up or people seeing how I move.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have affected your daily life\u2014like school, hobbies, or how you feel emotionally\u2014and how you've been coping with them?\\nPATIENT: Um, it's been really hard, honestly. I get tired a lot more, and writing or doing stuff with my hands feels really slow or off, like I'm not in control. Sometimes I feel frustrated or sad 'cause I can't do the things I used to enjoy, and I worry about school and everything. I guess I just try to keep going, but it's not easy.\\nDOCTOR: Are there any other symptoms you have noticed, such as changes in your speech, swallowing difficulties, eye movements (like Kayser-Fleischer rings or abnormal eye movements), or any behavioral or personality changes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think sometimes I feel like I can't really control my voice, and my eyes feel kind of weird, like they move on their own sometimes. I haven't noticed anything about swallowing, though.\\nDOCTOR: Does the tremor occur at rest, with activity, or both? Are there any signs of abnormal eye movements like nystagmus, or do you notice any changes in coordination, speech, or behavior? Additionally, have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing, changes in personality or mood, or signs of liver problems such as jaundice or abdominal swelling?\\nPATIENT: Um, the tremor happens both when I'm doing stuff and sometimes even when I\u2019m just resting, I think. I haven't really noticed any weird eye movements, but I do feel a bit off with my coordination and sometimes my speech feels strange, like I stumble over words. I haven't seen any big changes in my personality or mood, and I haven't had any problems swallowing that I know of. No idea about my liver stuff, nobody's told me about that.\\nDOCTOR: Does the tremor worsen with stress, fatigue, or at specific times of day? And, have you noticed any other neurological signs such as muscle weakness, changes in sensation, or unusual facial expressions?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes the tremor feels worse when I'm really upset or tired, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s always true. And, I haven\u2019t really noticed anything weird with my muscles or my face, but I sometimes feel like my face looks funny or stiff without meaning to.\\nDOCTOR: Do you notice if your symptoms, like the tremors or stiffness, change or worsen during certain times of the day or in specific situations, such as when you're feeling stressed or tired?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess... sometimes they feel worse when I\u2019m really tired or if I\u2019m kind of worried about stuff. Like, the tremors get stronger or my muscles feel more stiff, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always how it is or if it\u2019s just in my head.\\nDOCTOR: Do your tremors or stiffness tend to worsen during stressful situations, when you're tired, or at certain times of the day?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I think sometimes when I get really stressed or I haven't slept much, it feels worse or heavier, but it kind of happens on its own too, like without a reason.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your eye movements, such as involuntary oscillations or difficulty tracking objects, or any behavioral or personality changes that are new or worsening?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t know... sometimes my eyes feel a bit weird, kinda hard to track stuff, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or not. And I guess I get pretty anxious or upset more easily lately, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal for me.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation confirmed that the tremors are present both at rest and with activity, and that the patient experiences abnormal eye movements, such as the eyes moving on their own or being hard to track objects. The patient reports issues with coordination and speech, with speech sometimes feeling strange or stumbly. The symptoms are influenced by tiredness and stress, sometimes worsening during these times. No new symptoms like swallowing difficulty, significant personality changes, or liver issues were mentioned. These details expand the previous summary, so I will include all confirmed facts to form a comprehensive full vignette.\n\nANSWER: A 15-year-old patient presents with stiffness in the hands and neck; motor symptoms include tremors that occur both at rest and during activity, worsening with tiredness and stress. The patient also reports abnormal eye movements, describing that the eyes sometimes move on their own or are hard to track objects. The patient experiences coordination problems and sometimes feels that their speech is strange or stumbly. There are no reported swallowing difficulties, no significant changes in personality or mood, and no known liver issues. Symptoms tend to worsen when the patient is tired or worried, and sometimes rest provides slight relief. The patient reports feeling scared, frustrated, and sad about these symptoms, and worries about school and daily life."

I just feel like my hands and neck sometimes get super stiff, and I keep trembling, like all the time. It\u2019s been making everything harder, like writing or even walking properly, and I\u2019m kind of scared about it.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms started, how they've changed over time, and if you notice anything that makes them better or worse?\\nPATIENT: Um, it kind of started with my hands feeling stiff sometimes, and then my neck too, but I didn\u2019t really think much of it at first. Lately, it\u2019s gotten worse, and I get these tremors that make it hard to do things like write or even tie my shoes.
