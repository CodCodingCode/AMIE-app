She appears open in sharing her primary symptoms but may be influenced by anxiety. - Bias detected: Amplification bias influences her reporting, likely inflating the severity due to emotional distress and anxiety. - Confidence level: Medium to high; her detailed narrative and emotional language support this, although some exaggeration is probable. - Reasoning: Her use of intense descriptors aligns with heightened emotional states common in anxious patients, which can lead to overestimation of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may not be fully aware of or might underreport other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, urinary issues, or bleeding. - Withheld information: Potential embarrassment or shame about sexual or gynecological history could inhibit full disclosure. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about severe illness or fertility loss may be exaggerated; her emotional state amplifies her worries. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of symptom worsening appears consistent but may seem more rapid or severe to her because of emotional amplification.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports severe pelvic pain and fever with emotional language suggesting high distress, which may lead to overstatement of symptom severity. Her detailed description indicates real symptoms but possibly amplified due to anxiety or emotional factors. It is likely she is concealing or underreporting associated symptoms such as nausea, chills, or vaginal discharge, either due to embarrassment or oversight. The timeline, starting a few days ago and worsening, appears valid but might seem more rapid in her perception. Additional systemic and gynecological symptoms may be present but unreported. Objective findings are not provided, so further probing is necessary to determine the full clinical picture. The summary will reflect the probable severity adjusted for her communication pattern, emphasizing the need for further assessment.\nANSWER: OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Pelvic pain and fever, likely representing an infectious or inflammatory process. Present illness: The patient reports onset of pelvic pain and fever a few days prior, with worsening severity over this period. While she describes her symptoms as \"really bad\" and worsening, these descriptions are influenced by high emotional distress, potentially inflating perceived severity. She reports feeling exhausted and unwell but may underreport or omit associated symptoms. Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms have been explicitly reported; systemic symptoms such as nausea, chills, vomiting, or urinary issues are unconfirmed but may be present given the presentation\u2014these need to be investigated. Timeline: Symptom onset is approximately a few days ago with notable worsening, though her perception may exaggerate the rapidity or intensity of progression.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of pelvic pain and fever, based on patient self-report. - Medium confidence: The severity and extent of symptoms, as these are emotionally influenced and may be exaggerated. - Low confidence: Additional systemic or gynecological symptoms (nausea, discharge, urinary issues), as they are not currently reported. - Missing information: Detailed physical examination findings, vital signs, relevant laboratory data, and further inquiry into associated symptoms and past medical history.",

Her responses are concise, and emotional distress appears to amplify her perception of symptom severity. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias is evident, influencing her perception and description of symptoms, potentially leading to overreporting of severity. - Confidence level: Medium. While her core symptoms are valid and consistent, her perception of severity may be inflated, affecting the accuracy of her description. - Reasoning: The repetitive use of extreme descriptors and her emotional tone suggest amplification. Her restraint on sensitive topics points to withholding information driven by embarrassment or shame.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be downplaying or omitting symptoms like vaginal discharge, urinary issues, nausea, chills, or prior gynecological conditions\u2014all relevant for an accurate diagnosis. - Withheld information: Concerns about judgment or embarrassment regarding her sexual activity, contraceptive use, or past reproductive history. She seems hesitant to fully disclose her sexual background. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about fertility loss or severe complications, driven by anxiety, leading her to perceive her condition as more urgent. - Temporal distortions: She might interpret her symptom onset as more abrupt or intense than it truly is, influenced by emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a moderate to severe pelvic inflammatory process, with systemic signs such as fever and malaise. The actual pain might be less extreme than her descriptions suggest, but the emotional response heightens her distress. She probably has additional symptoms like vaginal discharge, urinary discomfort, or nausea that she hasn't disclosed yet. Her timeline is accurate but perceived as more abrupt due to anxiety. Her concerns about fertility are probably exaggerated, influenced by fear rather than current evidence.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Can you tell me about your sexual activity and contraceptive methods? This helps understand possible sources of infection.\" 2. \"Have you noticed any vaginal discharge, bleeding, or other discomfort besides the pain?\" \u2014 to uncover missed symptoms. 3. \"Are you experiencing any nausea, chills, urinary problems, or unusual vaginal symptoms?\" \u2014 to confirm systemic involvement. 4. \"Have you had any similar issues in the past or any gynecological problems?\" \u2014 to assess history. 5. \"How has this affected your daily activities and emotional well-being?\" \u2014 to gauge overall impact. - Approach strategy: - Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone to reduce shame and encourage openness. - Normalize discussions of sexual health to create trust. - Repeat questions if needed to clarify and reassure. - Priority order: 1. Sexual activity and contraceptive use (core to diagnosis and understanding exposure risk). 2. Associated systemic and local gynecological symptoms (to identify the extent and nature of illness). 3. Emotional impact and psychosocial factors (to address anxiety and support).",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with reported pelvic pain, fever, and fatigue, with emotionally charged language and repetitive emphasis on severity. Such patterns suggest amplification of symptom perception due to emotional distress, which could lead her to overstate pain intensity and urgency. She appears reserved about details related to sexual activity, vaginal discharge, or other systemic symptoms, indicating possible withholding of sensitive information. Consequently, while core symptoms are likely genuine, the severity and certain associated features may be exaggerated. There may also be undiscussed symptoms such as vaginal discharge, urinary discomfort, nausea, or chills that she has not disclosed, either due to embarrassment or anxiety. The timeline of symptom onset is possibly accurate but perceived as more rapid or severe than reality. Objective findings should be corroborated with further inquiry to clarify omitted symptoms and underlying causes.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Pelvic pain and fever, likely indicative of an infectious or inflammatory gynecological condition, with potential for severity overestimated due to emotional amplification.  Present illness: The patient reports onset of pelvic pain and fever approximately a few days prior, with a subjective increase in intensity and worsening of overall malaise. Her description suggests significant discomfort, but her emotional distress may inflate perceived severity. She reports feeling exhausted and unwell, which are subjective symptoms likely real but possibly amplified.  Associated symptoms: No additional systemic or local gynecological symptoms have been explicitly reported; however, she may be experiencing vaginal discharge, urinary symptoms, nausea, or chills that she has not acknowledged or shared.  Timeline: Symptoms began a few days ago, with perceived rapid worsening, though actual progression may be more gradual once emotional bias is accounted for.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of pelvic pain and fever based on patient history. - Medium confidence: Severity and perceived rapidity of progression, subject to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Extent of associated symptoms such as vaginal discharge, urinary issues, nausea, chilling, which are unreported but likely present. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, vital signs, laboratory results, and detailed history of sexual activity, contraceptive use, past gynecological issues, and additional systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is a female presenting with a few days' history of pelvic pain and fever, with reports of worsening severity and malaise. She describes her symptoms as intense but is emotionally distressed, which may lead to overestimation of pain severity and urgency. She appears reserved regarding sexual activity and other potential symptoms such as vaginal discharge, urinary discomfort, nausea, or chills, which remain unconfirmed but are likely present. The timeline is consistent with an acute gynecological inflammatory process, but perception of rapid worsening may be exaggerated by emotional factors. Further detailed history and physical examination are needed to clarify the full clinical picture, including possible sources of infection and additional systemic involvement.",

She describes her symptoms as intense but is emotionally distressed, which may lead to overestimation of pain severity and urgency. She appears reserved regarding sexual activity and other potential symptoms such as vaginal discharge, urinary discomfort, nausea, or chills, which remain unconfirmed but are likely present. The timeline is consistent with an acute gynecological inflammatory process, but perception of rapid worsening may be exaggerated by emotional factors. Further detailed history and physical examination are needed to clarify the full clinical picture, including possible sources of infection and additional systemic involvement.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with high emotional intensity, emphasizing severity (\"really bad,\" \"so exhausted,\" \"worse\") that amplifies perceived clinical threat. Her responses are elaborative and emotionally laden but generally consistent, with slight hesitations around sensitive topics, indicating possible embarrassment. She responds promptly and openly but frames her experience in a distress-focused manner. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias is evident, leading her to emphasize the severity and urgency of her symptoms. Her language suggests she perceives her condition as more severe than might be objectively the case. - Confidence level: Medium. The consistent, emotionally charged language supports amplification bias, but her coherence and responsiveness indicate her reporting is not intentionally deceptive. - Reasoning: The repeated use of words like \"really bad,\" \"terrible,\" and \"much worse\" reflect emotional magnification rather than purely objective assessment. Slight discomfort when discussing sexual symptoms suggests possible withholding of sensitive information or embarrassment, but overall openness reduces the likelihood of significant withholding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting symptoms such as severe pelvic pain during sexual activity, vaginal discharge, or systemic symptoms like chills, which could be associated but unmentioned due to embarrassment or desire to avoid additional concern. - Withheld information: Embarrassment about sexual pain or spotting nerve her to potentially withhold details related to sexual activity, painful intercourse, or bleeding specifics. - Amplified concerns: Her fears regarding serious illness or fertility problems are probably emotionally magnified, causing her to overestimate the threat level. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears aligned with her recollections; however, emotional distress might cause her to perceive the worsening as more rapid or severe than physiological progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: a presentation with pelvic pain, fever, and malaise evolving over a few days, consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process like pelvic inflammatory disease. She is likely experiencing actual pain and some systemic symptoms, but her emotional distress amplifies her perception of severity. Sexual symptoms such as discomfort and spotting may be present but underdisclosed; systemic symptoms like chills or nausea may be present and unreported. The progression is plausible, but perception of rapid worsening and severity is emotionally exaggerated. The real clinical picture should encompass moderate to severe pelvic pain, systemic signs, and potential sexual or reproductive concerns, with the understanding that her emotional state inflates perceived threat and urgency.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about the pain during sex? Is it constant or only with certain movements? Are you experiencing any bleeding or unusual discharge?\" This targets sensitive symptoms that might be withheld. - \"Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, chills, or other systemic symptoms?\" Clarifies the full extent of systemic illness. - \"How is the pain affecting your daily activities? Are you able to do your usual routines?\" Assesses functional impact without emotional bias. - \"Are you feeling anxious or worried about your health or future pregnancy? Would you like to talk more about those concerns?\" Addresses underlying fears and clarifies emotional influences. - Approach strategy: Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone, normalizing concerns to reduce embarrassment, and explicitly invite her to share anything she might feel uncomfortable revealing. Framing questions as routine checks can decrease anxiety and promote honest disclosure. - Priority order: First, clarify physical symptoms with specific targeted questions about sexual activity and systemic signs to uncover hidden symptoms. Next, explore emotional concerns and fears related to fertility and health. Finally, assess impact on daily life to understand functional impairment, which may temper emotional exaggeration by providing contextual balance.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient communicates with high emotional intensity, emphasizing the severity and rapid worsening of symptoms, which suggests a tendency toward emotional amplification bias. She reports pelvic pain, fever, and exhaustion that started a few days prior, but her distress may cause her to perceive the progression as more severe and sudden than it is objectively. Her responses indicate possible underreporting of certain symptoms such as sexual discomfort, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or additional systemic symptoms like chills or nausea, possibly due to embarrassment or discomfort. Her framing suggests that she is likely experiencing clinical features consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease or another infectious gynecological process, but the severity and urgency she perceives may be exaggerated. Situations like sexual pain, bleeding, or systemic symptoms may be underreported. Her emotional state may amplify her perception of severity and urgency, but the core symptoms of pelvic pain, fever, and malaise are reliably present. Further detailed questioning is necessary to clarify additional symptoms that she may be withholding or minimizing, such as details about sexual activity, vaginal discharge, and other systemic complaints.\nANSWER: The patient is a female presenting with a few days' history of pelvic pain and fever, accompanied by fatigue and malaise. She reports that her symptoms have worsened over this period, with notable distress about the severity of her condition. Objective signs include pelvic discomfort and systemic features consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process, such as fever and exhaustion. There is no explicit report of vaginal discharge or systemic symptoms like chills, nausea, or vomiting, though these may be underreported due to discomfort discussing sensitive topics. The perceived rapid worsening may be emotionally magnified; physical symptoms are likely present to a degree that warrants clinical evaluation for conditions like pelvic inflammatory disease.

Objective signs include pelvic discomfort and systemic features consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process, such as fever and exhaustion. There is no explicit report of vaginal discharge or systemic symptoms like chills, nausea, or vomiting, though these may be underreported due to discomfort discussing sensitive topics. The perceived rapid worsening may be emotionally magnified; physical symptoms are likely present to a degree that warrants clinical evaluation for conditions like pelvic inflammatory disease. Additional assessment is needed to determine the presence of sexual pain, abnormal bleeding, or other systemic signs that are possibly minimized or withheld. Communication patterns suggest a need for gentle, specific inquiry into sexual symptoms, systemic complaints, and emotional concerns to fully establish the clinical picture.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient emphasizes emotional distress with hyperbolic language, while responses to direct clinical questions are brief and sometimes tangential. She expresses fear and shame, particularly regarding sexual health, leading to potential minimization or withholding of important details. - Bias detected: Amplification bias due to emotional distress, combined with minimization or withholding driven by shame and embarrassment. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014while her emotional responses are evident and influence her report, her honest distress confirms genuine symptoms; the exact severity and fuller symptomatology are uncertain. - Reasoning: The emphasis on distress and avoidance of specifics suggests emotional amplification is inflating perceived severity, while shame Likely constrains disclosure of relevant sexual and systemic details.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might underreport specific systemic symptoms such as nausea, chills, or urinary symptoms, and details about sexual activity like number of partners, recent trauma, or use of protection, due to shame or fear. - Withheld information: Sensitive sexual history, especially behaviors she finds embarrassing or stigmatizing, possibly recent unprotected intercourse or trauma. - Amplified concerns: Her perceived severity (\"really bad,\" \"worst\") likely overstates her objective clinical severity, driven by passive anxiety rather than physical findings alone. - Temporal distortions: Emotional distress may cause her to perceive her symptoms as worsening more rapidly than they are, or to focus disproportionately on recent escalation.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes: A female with a several-day history of pelvic pain, fever, fatigue, and some bleeding (spotting) between periods, with worsening symptomatology. Systems signs such as fever and malaise suggest an inflammatory or infectious process, like pelvic inflammatory disease. She may be experiencing additional systemic symptoms such as chills, nausea, or urinary discomfort that she is hesitant to disclose due to shame or embarassment. Her emotional distress amplifies her perception of severity, but the core clinical features point toward an urgent gynecologic infection requiring prompt evaluation and treatment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \u201cCan you tell me about your sexual activity\u2014how often, protective measures used, any recent unprotected encounters, or trauma?\u201d (to clarify risk factors); \u201cDo you notice any other symptoms like nausea, chills, pain during urination, or vaginal discharge?\u201d (to uncover overlooked symptoms); \u201cWhen exactly did the spotting start, and is it associated with anything else?\u201d (to clarify timeline); \u201cHow severe is the pain on a scale of 1-10, and what areas does it affect most?\u201d (to quantify pain). - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language emphasizing confidentiality to reduce shame-induced withholding. Normalize discussions of sexual health; validate her distress to foster openness. - Priority order: First, probe sexual history and associated symptoms to assess infection risk; next, clarify systemic signs like nausea or chills; then, explore the timeline and severity of symptoms carefully. Starting with non-threatening questions helps build rapport for more sensitive disclosures.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional distress and possible discomfort discussing sensitive topics, which may lead to underreporting or minimization of certain symptoms such as systemic signs or sexual practices. Her emphasis on worsening symptoms and fear suggests genuine concern, but her brief responses to direct questions about sexual activity, specific systemic symptoms, and detailed timeline indicate she might be withholding or minimizing key details. Consequently, objective symptoms likely include pelvic pain and fever of several days\u2019 duration, accompanied by spotting between periods and pain during sexual activity, which are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious process like pelvic inflammatory disease. The severity of symptoms, especially systemic ones, may be understated by the patient. A thorough inquiry into sexual history, associated urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms, and details about bleeding is essential, as she may feel embarrassed or ashamed, impeding full disclosure.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, adult age likely in reproductive years.  Chief complaint: Several days of worsening pelvic pain with fever, fatigue, and malaise.  Present illness: The patient reports a several-day history of pelvic discomfort, which has intensified over time, accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and feeling hot all over. She reports spotting between menstrual periods beginning around the same time as her pain worsened, and experiences increased pain during sexual activity. Based on communication patterns, systemic symptoms like chills or nausea are possibly understated or omitted. The patient\u2019s emotional distress may amplify perceived severity, but objective findings include pelvic pain, low-grade fever, and abnormal vaginal bleeding; factors suggesting an infectious gynecologic process. Additional systemic or urinary symptoms, or details about recent sexual behavior, are likely underreported due to shame or embarrassment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence and duration of pelvic pain, fever, fatigue, and vaginal spotting. - Medium confidence: Severity of symptoms may be overestimated by the patient emotionally, but physical signs support a significant inflammatory process. - Low confidence: Exact systemic symptoms (chills, nausea, urinary symptoms) are probably underreported or withheld. - Missing information: Precise details about sexual activity, recent trauma, use of protection, associated urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms, and further specifics about systemic symptoms are needed for complete assessment.\nANSWER: The patient is a female presenting with a several-day history of worsening pelvic pain, fever, fatigue, and malaise.

She reports spotting between periods coinciding with the worsening of her pain and experiencing increased pain during sexual activity. While she describes systemic symptoms such as fever and feeling hot all over, the extent and specifics of additional systemic signs like chills or nausea are uncertain due to possible underreporting. Based on her communication patterns, her distress may be amplifying symptom severity, yet objective clinical signs are consistent with an infectious or inflammatory gynecologic condition, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Further detailed inquiry into her sexual history and additional systemic symptoms is necessary to guide appropriate evaluation and management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes severe physical symptoms with emotional distress but exhibits hesitation and ambiguity specifically around sexual and reproductive details, indicating avoidance due to shame or embarrassment. She emphasizes severity but simultaneously downplays certain aspects. Her responses are elaborate when describing physical sensations, yet guarded about sexual history, showing internal conflict. - Bias detected: The primary biases are minimization of symptom severity and withholding of private sexual/reproductive information influenced by shame or fear. - Confidence level: Medium. The physical symptoms appear credible given her distress, but specific private details are likely underreported or omitted. - Reasoning: Her emotional tone amplifies her distress, but her cautious language regarding sexual history suggests concealment. The inconsistency in systemic symptom reporting indicates partial withholding or minimization.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her description of pain as \"not that bad,\" despite the distress, suggests actual pain may be more intense. Systemic symptoms like chills or additional nausea may be understated. - Withheld information: The details about sexual activity\u2014number of partners, recent unprotected sex, pregnancy intent\u2014are likely more intricate and potentially riskier than she admits, due to shame or stigma. She might also be avoiding testing or denial about pregnancy. - Amplified concerns: Her anxiety about fertility or severity may be exaggerated by emotional distress, leading her to overfocus on worst-case scenarios, although her physical symptoms are valid. - Temporal distortions: She may underestimate or forget the onset and duration of symptoms or sexual events, possibly minimizing earlier signs or earlier risky behaviors.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased clinical picture should include a woman experiencing significant pelvic pain, systemic infection signs (fever, malaise), abnormal bleeding\u2014likely indicative of pelvic inflammatory disease or similar infectious process\u2014with systemic symptoms possibly more severe than she reports. Her distress is real but may be compounded by anxiety, and she might have additional risk factors or symptoms not fully disclosed, especially related to sexual activity and pregnancy. Her internal conflict and bias probably lead her to underreport or understate certain details, which should be clarified through gentle, specific questioning.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly when your symptoms started and how they've changed over time?\" (to clarify timeline) - \"Have you had unprotected sex with any partners recently? How many, and when?\" (to assess risk) - \"Are you currently pregnant or have you taken a pregnancy test? Would you like to do one now?\" (to clarify pregnancy status) - \"Have you experienced any additional symptoms like chills, vomiting, or worsening pain?\" (to detect unreported systemic signs) - \"How are you feeling emotionally about your sexual health and pregnancy concerns?\" (to address shame and reduce stigma)  - Approach strategy: Use non-judgmental, empathetic language; reassure confidentiality; normalize discussions around sexual health; ask open-ended but specific questions to minimize shame and encourage full disclosure. - Priority order: First clarify her pregnancy status and recent sexual activity\u2014these are critical for diagnosis\u2014then explore systemic symptoms and emotional impact, to build trust and gather accurate information.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits significant physical symptoms such as pelvic pain and systemic indications of infection (fever, fatigue), but her communication reveals potential underreporting or minimization, especially regarding the severity of her pain and additional systemic symptoms like chills or nausea. She appears hesitant to disclose details about her sexual activity and pregnancy status, likely due to shame or stigma, which impacts the completeness of her history. Despite this, her physical complaints are credible, though possibly more severe than described. Her emotional distress may amplify her perceived symptom severity, so a balanced, objective clinical picture must consider probable underreporting of risks and symptoms. Clarification through specific, non-judgmental questioning is necessary to accurately assess and manage her condition.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Worsening pelvic pain over several days, accompanied by fever and systemic malaise.  Present illness: The patient reports a several-day history of pelvic pain that has intensified. She describes systemic symptoms such as fever, feeling hot, fatigue, nausea, and shivering. She reports spotting between periods beginning around the time her pain worsened and states that pain during sex has increased. She mentions recent unprotected sexual activity with multiple partners but is uncertain about pregnancy status and has not taken a pregnancy test. Her communication suggests her pain may be more severe than her subjective description indicates and that systemic symptoms such as chills and additional nausea are possibly understated. The timeline indicates the onset of fever yesterday, with symptoms progressively worsening.  Associated symptoms: Fever, hot sensations, fatigue, nausea, shivering, and abnormal vaginal bleeding/spotting between periods. The presence of pain during sex is noted. Confidence in the reported symptoms is moderate; systemic symptoms may be underreported or minimized.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Pelvic pain, recent onset, systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue). - Medium confidence: Severity and full extent of symptoms, such as chills and nausea, due to possible underreporting. - Low confidence: Details of sexual activity (number of partners, specifics of recent unprotected sex), pregnancy status. - Missing information: Precise duration and onset of systemic symptoms, detailed sexual and reproductive history, additional systemic symptoms like chills or vomiting.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
