    "output": "THINKING: The patient has reported a lump near the ear, which has been there for a long time. It sometimes hurts and becomes red, and there is clear fluid discharging from a tiny hole in the skin. This information confirms a chronic lesion with recurrent symptoms and a possible draining sinus. Since the previous vignette is empty, I will build the full vignette including this new info.  \nANSWER: The patient reports having a long-standing bump near the ear that sometimes causes pain and redness. There is a small hole in the skin through which clear fluid discharges. The patient does not understand why this is happening. The patient's parents advised them to seek medical care."
