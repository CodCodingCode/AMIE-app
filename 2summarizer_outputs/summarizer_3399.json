My voice is kind of funny, and I sometimes cough when I eat, so I thought maybe I should see someone.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms\u2014like your falls, hand sensations, voice changes, or coughing\u2014have been affecting your daily life and activities?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, I fall a lot now, and my hands feel all weird sometimes, like I can't hold things right... and my voice sounds funny, I guess. The coughing happens sometimes when I eat, and it makes me scared. It\u2019s hard to do things like before.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about when these symptoms first started, how they have changed over time, and what challenges they are causing you in your daily routine?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it started about a year ago, maybe? It\u2019s gotten worse little by little. I fall more often now, and my hands feel really weird, like they don't do what I want them to. Sometimes I feel like I can\u2019t talk right or swallow well, and it\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t really know why.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what specific concerns or worries you have regarding your symptoms, and how they are impacting things that matter most to you?\\nPATIENT: I guess I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to get worse, and I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s wrong. Sometimes I get really tired, and I can\u2019t do things like I used to \u2014 it makes me sad and a little nervous when I fall or can\u2019t keep up. I just wish I knew why it\u2019s happening.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in specific areas of your body? Additionally, do you experience any stiffness, tremors, or coordination difficulties when walking or moving?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think my hands feel strange sometimes, like they don\u2019t move right, and I keep falling when I walk. My voice sounds weird too, and I get tired more easily lately.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any muscle weakness or wasting in specific areas, or changes in muscle tone such as stiffness or spasticity? Also, do you experience facial drooping, double vision, or any other eye movement abnormalities?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think I've noticed my face drooping or double vision, but I do sometimes feel like my hands and feet get really weak, especially if I try to hold things or walk for a bit. My muscles also feel different, kind of like they\u2019re not working the same as before.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any stiffness, increased muscle tone, hyperactive reflexes, or abnormal reflexes such as the Babinski sign?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't really feel any stiffness or stuff like that, and my reflexes\u2014I don't really know if they're hyper or normal, I guess. I haven't noticed anything strange like that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any increased muscle stiffness, hyperactive reflexes, or any abnormal reflex responses like the Babinski sign during your examinations?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think my muscles feel really stiff, but sometimes my legs feel kind of weird, like they don\u2019t want to move right. The doctor touches my knees, but I don\u2019t really know if my reflexes are super active or not. Nobody\u2019s really said if I have that weird sign you\u2019re asking about.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your facial muscles, such as weakness or difficulty smiling, or any new trouble with eye movements like double vision?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think so? I mean, I don\u2019t really notice my face or eyes doing anything weird, but maybe sometimes I feel like my face is kinda heavy or something? It\u2019s hard to tell.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your speech or swallowing difficulties happen more often when you are tired or stressed, and do you experience any episodes where your symptoms suddenly worsen or improve?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, sometimes when I\u2019m really tired or nervous, my voice feels even weaker, and swallowing kind of gets worse. Like, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a big change or just how I feel. And, uh, there are times when it feels like things are worse suddenly, but sometimes it gets better too. I don\u2019t know exactly when it happens, just that it changes.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, such as feeling dizzy or faint when standing, difficulty with urination or bowel movements, or dry mouth?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes I feel kind of dizzy when I try to stand up fast, and my mouth feels dry a lot, like I can't swallow enough water. I haven't really noticed about going to the bathroom, but I do feel a little off sometimes.",
