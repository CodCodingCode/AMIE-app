I haven\u2019t noticed anything like her squeezing or reacting like I would expect, but I don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re supposed to do.\\nDOCTOR: Has she shown any worsening of her leg weakness or bladder symptoms over time, or have they remained relatively stable since you first noticed them?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think she\u2019s been the same for now? Sometimes I worry if it\u2019s getting worse, but she hasn\u2019t really seemed more weak or anything, I guess. It\u2019s hard to tell, honestly.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent worsening in her leg weakness, changes in her bladder or bowel control, or new symptoms like increased fussiness or episodes of stiffness?\\nPATIENT: Uh, she\u2019s been a little more fussy than usual sometimes, and I think her legs seem more floppy lately, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or if she\u2019s just being her usual maybe. Her bladder still seems a bit funny, I guess, with some dribbling, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gotten worse.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation reinforces previous details about the baby\u2019s long-standing back lesion, motor and sensory deficits, and bladder issues, with some concern about potential worsening. No new clinical findings are introduced; the symptoms appear persistent and possibly stable, with variably reported slight progression. The summarized facts include the presence of a lower back bump, difficulty moving legs, bladder dysfunction, altered tone, and reduced responsiveness, with some episodes of increased fussiness and floppiness.\n\nANSWER: The patient is the parent of a baby girl who has had a soft bump on her lower back since birth, with possible hair around it and skin that looks different from nearby. The baby has difficulty moving her legs, which has been present since birth and may have worsened to near complete inability to move them. She experiences bladder issues, including dribbling urine and holding it longer, and her bladder symptoms have remained relatively stable but with some concern about possible slight worsening. The baby feeds with some fussiness and has less smiling than other babies her age. Her movements are soft or less coordinated, with episodes of twitching or stiffness. She appears floppy, with minimal response when her legs or perineal area are touched. Her legs seem more clumsy over time, but it is unclear if her symptoms are worsening or stable."
