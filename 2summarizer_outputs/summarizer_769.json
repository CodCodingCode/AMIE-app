No unusual bleeding or new lumps or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Do you experience any discomfort or pressure during bowel movements, and can you describe your typical stool consistency and frequency?\\nPATIENT: Umm, well, sometimes it kind of feels weird, like there's some pressure or maybe I have a hard time pushing things out, but I\u2019m not really sure. My stools are usually soft but not always completely normal, and I go maybe every couple of days, but it\u2019s all a bit irregular.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any urinary incontinence, urgency, hesitancy, or difficulty starting or stopping urination?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think so? I mean, I haven't really noticed a lot of trouble with peeing, but sometimes I feel like I gotta go more than usual, and it's kinda awkward.\\nDOCTOR: Are there particular activities, positions, or times of day\u2014like after standing or walking long periods\u2014that seem to make your symptoms worse or better?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I think I feel worse when I\u2019ve been standing or walking around for a while. Like, by the end of the day, it\u2019s a bit more uncomfortable, and I notice the bulge more, I guess. Sometimes it feels better if I sit down or rest for a bit.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation confirms and expands on previously noted symptoms, including the progression and triggers such as activity and position, as well as obstetric history. No new significant symptoms like urinary incontinence or gynecological issues are introduced. The full vignette will integrate all these confirmed facts.  \nANSWER: The patient reports feeling a sensation of fullness down there that has been worsening over the past two years, with a sensation of something \"falling out\" particularly at the end of the day or after standing or walking for a long period. She experiences occasional difficulty fully emptying her bowels despite feeling the urge and sometimes has an urgent need to go again. Her symptoms tend to worsen after activities such as prolonged standing or walking and may improve slightly when lying down or sitting. She reports that symptoms fluctuate and come and go. She has not noticed any urinary incontinence, urgency, hesitancy, or difficulty starting or stopping urination. She has a history of three vaginal deliveries, with a tear repaired after the third, and no history of surgeries. Her bowel movements are usually soft but irregular; she goes approximately every two days, sometimes experiencing pressure or difficulty pushing during bowel movements. She has not noticed any abnormal pain, pressure, or lumps related to her ovaries or uterus."
