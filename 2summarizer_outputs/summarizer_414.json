She minimizes specific details, using fillers like \"like,\" \"kinda,\" and \"just,\" which suggest an intentional or unintentional downplaying of severity, while displaying emotional worry.\n- Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias combined with emotional exaggeration bias.\n- Confidence level: Medium-high. The language points toward genuine distress but also suggests that key clinical details are likely underreported.\n- Reasoning: The patient's vague, emotionally charged responses\u2014particularly the use of softening words and the blending of feelings with symptoms\u2014are classic signs of minimizing and emotional amplification. The reluctance to state exact symptom frequency or severity indicates possible withholding due to embarrassment or discomfort.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me exactly how often you experience these feelings or symptoms each day or week?\" (to obtain precise frequency)\n- \"Do you notice any associated issues like pain, bleeding, or difficulty with urination or bowel movements?\" (to uncover potentially unmentioned symptoms)\n- \"On a scale from 1 to 10, how severe is this sensation or discomfort when it occurs?\" (to gauge severity objectively)\n- \"Have these symptoms been getting worse over time, or have they stayed about the same?\" (to clarify progression)\n- Approach strategy: Ask in a gentle, non-judgmental manner, emphasizing support and normalization to reduce embarrassment\u2014\"Many women experience this, and sharing details can help us find the best solution together.\"\n- Priority order: Start with factual, specific questions about frequency and severity to anchor her responses, then proceed to questions about associated symptoms and progression; progressively build trust to encourage disclosure of more sensitive details.",

She focuses on feelings and functional impacts but reserves specifics.\n- Bias detected: Mild minimization and withholding bias are present, affecting the completeness of her report, especially regarding sensitive symptoms.\n- Confidence level: Medium. The coherence in her responses suggests she is truthful within her comfort zone but underreports severity and specific symptoms due to emotional barriers.\n- Reasoning: The consistent pattern of hedging, lack of detail on critical symptoms, and focus on subjective feelings indicate a tendency to downplay or avoid full disclosure, leading to potential underestimation of symptom severity.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n* \"Have you experienced any bleeding from your area, even if it's just a little or not noticeable?\" \u2014 to clarify if bleeding is present but unreported.\n* \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any pain anywhere in your pelvis or lower abdomen?

She denies explicit reports of pelvic pain, bleeding, or bowel changes, but communication patterns suggest these symptoms may be underreported or minimized. Her symptom timeline indicates gradual or possibly progressive worsening, but the true severity and full symptom extent require further detailed inquiry to assess for concealed symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient provides vague, hedged responses, often qualifying her statements with emotional language indicating discomfort and shame. She admits to some symptoms but downplays others, particularly bleeding and severity of leakage.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is patient minimization combined with emotional reluctance\u2014embarrassment and shame are likely causing her to underreport the true extent of her symptoms.\n- Confidence level: Medium to high.\n- Reasoning: Her use of gentle qualifiers, explicit mention of embarrassment, and inconsistent reporting about bleeding and leakage suggest she is not being fully open. These factors point toward a moderate underreporting bias, particularly concerning symptoms that are socially sensitive or emotionally distressing.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me if you have noticed heavier bleeding or larger tissue prolapses that perhaps you haven't mentioned yet?\" (Because she may be reluctant to admit severity).\n- \"Are you experiencing any discomfort or pain that is more intense than you've discussed?\" (To gauge possible underreported pain).\n- \"Have you noticed any bowel symptoms, such as difficulty or changes in stool, that you're hesitant to talk about?\" (To uncover related bowel issues).\n- \"How often do these episodes of leakage happen and how much fluid do you think is passing?\" (To quantify leaks and assess true severity).\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use gentle, non-judgmental, open-ended questions to encourage elaboration.\n- Normalize her feelings about embarrassment to reduce shame and facilitate honesty.\n- Reassure confidentiality and that all symptoms are important, to build trust.\n- Priority order:\n- First, clarify bleeding and prolapse severity, as these are likely underestimated but clinically significant.\n- Then explore pain and bowel symptoms, which she might find more embarrassing.\n- Finally, quantify leakage frequency and volume to obtain precise severity data.",

It\\u2019s been like that for a while now.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me if your urinary leakage happens only when you cough or move, or do you sometimes notice it even when you're not doing anything, like just sitting or relaxing?\",\n  \"PATIENT: I think it mostly happens when I cough or move, but maybe it happens some when I\\u2019m just sitting too, I\\u2019m not really sure.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: When you experience urinary leakage, does it happen only when you cough, laugh, or lift, or do you sometimes leak without any particular activity, even when you're just sitting or relaxing?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I don't always leak when I cough or laugh, sometimes I just do it out of the blue, even when I\\u2019m sitting or relaxing, which I don\\u2019t quite understand.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a 62-year-old woman presenting with several months of pelvic heaviness, pressure, and a sensation of tissue prolapse, which reportedly worsens with physical activity such as lifting and standing. She experiences difficulty completely emptying her bladder and reports occasional urinary leakage primarily triggered by coughing or movement; some leakage may occur at rest, though she is uncertain. She denies significant pelvic pain or bleeding but reports mild discomfort. Her communication patterns suggest she may underreport the severity of her symptoms, and additional assessment is needed to evaluate the extent of prolapse, leakage volume, impact on daily activities, and any associated bowel symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient's responses are cautious, vague, and guarded, with frequent hedging and expressions of embarrassment that suggest she is holding back full disclosure of her symptoms. She minimizes the severity and seems uncomfortable discussing leakage openly.\n- Bias detected: The main bias influencing her reporting is minimization driven by shame and embarrassment, leading to likely underreporting of symptom frequency, volume, and impact. There may also be some withholding due to discomfort, but no evidence of exaggeration or confusion.\n- Confidence level: Medium. Based on her communication patterns, I am reasonably certain her symptoms are more severe than she portrays, but some details may be accurately reported.\n- Reasoning: Her hedging language, expressions of embarrassment, and brief responses indicate she is not providing a complete picture\u2014common when patients feel shame or fear judgment. The tendency to downplay suggests the true clinical severity might be underestimated in her current report.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me exactly how often you experience leakage, including during the day and at night?\" (To quantify symptom frequency)\n- \"Do you notice leakage when you're just sitting or lying down? How often does that happen?\" (To explore spontaneous leakage)\n- \"How much fluid do you typically leak? Is it enough to stain your clothing or need to change pads frequently?\" (To estimate volume)\n- \"Are there times when your prolapse feels worse or causes more discomfort that you're not mentioning?\" (To uncover hidden severity)\n- \"Do you have any bowel symptoms, such as constipation or difficulty controlling your bowels?\" (To assess related issues)\n- \"How does this affect your daily life, social activities, or emotional well-being?\" (To gauge impact)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Ask with sensitivity, emphasizing normalization and understanding (\"Many women experience these symptoms, and we're here to understand everything so we can help you the best way.\")\n- Use open-ended, non-judgmental language to reduce shame and encourage honest sharing.\n- Validate her feelings of embarrassment and reassure confidentiality to foster trust.\n- Priority order:\n1. Quantify leakage frequency and volume to clarify the clinical severity.\n2. Explore spontaneous leakage episodes and associated circumstances.\n3. Discuss how symptoms impact her daily functioning and emotional health.\n4. Investigate associated bowel symptoms or other related concerns.\nThis sequence helps establish a more accurate clinical picture while building rapport and minimizing discomfort.",

Additional assessment is needed to quantify symptom frequency, leakage volume, and the impact on her daily functioning to fully characterize her condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates with hesitance, uncertainty, and understatement. She qualifies her responses frequently, indicating discomfort and attempts to minimize her issues.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is minimization influenced by embarrassment, leading to underreporting of side severity and frequency.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014there's consistent evidence of under-disclosure, but some information is likely accurate.\n- Reasoning: Her cautious language, expressions of embarrassment, and vague responses point to an unwillingness to fully disclose the extent of her symptoms.

Frame questions as collaborative and non-judgmental, emphasizing that many women experience similar issues and that open discussion can lead to better management.\n- Priority order:\nBegin with questions about leak frequency and severity to get concrete data. Then explore spontaneous leaks at rest and emotional impact. This sequence builds rapport, gathers critical information early, and may help her feel more comfortable disclosing detailed symptoms later.",
