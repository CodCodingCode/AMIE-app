I started noticing some painful sores near my vulva about three days ago, and they\\u2019re pretty tender now, especially when I touch them or when I go to the bathroom. I also feel a burning sensation when I pee and during sex, which has never happened before. It\\u2019s been really itchy too, and I just worry because this came out of nowhere after I was kind of sensitive about certain soaps I\\u2019ve used recently. I don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019ve never had anything like this happen before, and I\\u2019m kind of freaked out because I don\\u2019t really understand what\\u2019s going on.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly about feelings and personal background but uses vague, non-specific language when describing physical symptoms, indicating a tendency to understate severity and possibly overstate emotional distress.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias predominantly influences their reporting, with signs of emotional amplification. This leads to underreporting of physical symptom severity and potential overreporting of concern or panic.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014based on consistent cues of minimization and emotional exaggeration, but actual physical severity cannot be precisely gauged from their language alone.\n- Reasoning: The use of qualifiers like \"kind of sore\" and \"little tender\" suggest an intent to downplay physical discomfort, while emotional phrases reflect genuine distress but may be amplified. The overall storytelling style hints at subconscious minimization of physical symptoms coupled with heightened emotional concern, affecting accurate clinical assessment.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me exactly how many sores you see, and how big they are?\" (to clarify physical severity and extent)\n- \"Have you noticed any unusual discharge, swelling, or other symptoms you haven't mentioned?\" (to uncover omitted physical signs)\n- \"Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or feeling tired?\" (to assess systemic involvement often minimized or unreported)\n- \"How has this affected your daily activities or sleep?\" (to gauge impact and validate physical severity)\n- \"Have you had similar issues before or with any other parts of your body?\" (to explore history and pattern)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Ask questions gently and nonjudgmentally, emphasizing understanding rather than judgment to reduce embarrassment.\n- Use visual aids or diagrams if helpful to indicate what you mean by lesion size or location.\n- Reassure confidentiality and normalcy in experiencing these symptoms to reduce shame.\n- Priority order:\n- First, clarify physical findings (size, number, discharge) to obtain objective data unaffected by bias.\n- Next, inquire about associated systemic symptoms to assess severity.\n- Then, discuss personal hygiene, sexual activity, and previous history to gather context.\n- Finally, explore emotional impact separately, validating their distress without overemphasizing it, to build trust and gather comprehensive information.",

Further clinical examination and targeted questioning are necessary to objectively assess the physical findings and systemic involvement.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient provides vague, non-specific descriptions, minimizes the severity of her symptoms, and includes emotional context, which suggests she may underreport physical findings and overemphasize emotional distress. She tends to elaborate but avoids focus on concrete details about lesion number and appearance.\n- Bias detected: Mainly minimization bias, with some elements of amplification of distress and possible withholding of more severe physical symptoms.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014based on consistent vagueness and downplaying language, but some details (e.g., progression, systemic symptoms) remain unclarified.\n- Reasoning: Her language choice (\"just a small bump,\" \"not really count\"), vague recall, and inclusion of unrelated concerns point to intentional or subconscious minimization of severity. Emotional expressions like \"freaked out\" further suggest she's seeking reassurance rather than conveying a clear clinical picture.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n* \"Can you tell me exactly how many lesions you've noticed and their sizes?\" \u2014 to get precise counts and assessment.\n* \"Have you noticed any pus, bleeding, or spreading of the sores?\" \u2014 to evaluate severity and progression.\n* \"Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or feeling unwell?\" \u2014 to identify systemic symptoms.\n* \"How have your symptoms changed since they first appeared?

Further assessment, including physical examination and targeted questioning, is necessary to determine the full extent and severity of physical findings and any systemic involvement.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, softening language, minimizes symptom severity, and provides storytelling rather than direct descriptions. There is evident discomfort or embarrassment about the symptoms, leading to underreporting and deflection. Emotional expressions like \"freaked out\" are present, indicating significant worry despite minimized details.\n- Bias detected: Predominant minimization bias, with potential slight underreporting of lesion severity and associated systemic symptoms. There may also be some avoidance of discussing full extent due to embarrassment.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014based on consistent vagueness, minimizing language, and storytelling behavior observed during the conversation.\n- Reasoning: These patterns suggest the patient is consciously or unconsciously downplaying their symptoms, possibly due to shame or fear, which limits the reliability of their self-reporting.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me exactly how many sores you see now and how big they are?\" (to get concrete details and counteract vagueness)\n- \"Have you noticed any fever, chills, or feeling generally unwell?\" (to assess for systemic symptoms they may not have disclosed)\n- \"How has the pain or discomfort changed since you first noticed it?\" (to better understand progression)\n- \"Are there any other areas on your body where you see similar sores?\" (to check for spread)\n- \"Do you have any concerns or fears about what these sores might be?\" (to open discussion about emotional state and embarrassment)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to foster trust (\"I understand these symptoms can be embarrassing, but it's important we get a full picture to help you effectively.\"). Frame questions in a normalizing way.\n- Encourage the patient to describe each detail concretely, possibly by asking for objective descriptions (size in centimeters, specific locations).\n- Reassure confidentiality and normalcy of concern to reduce shame and promote honesty.\n- Priority order:\n- Start with objective, concrete questions about actual lesion appearance and number, as this provides critical physical data.\n- Follow with systemic symptom inquiry to assess severity.\n- Then address emotional concerns to mitigate shame or embarrassment.\n- Finally, clarify timeline details to understand progression for appropriate management.",

She reports the presence of multiple small sores or bumps, approximately three in number, located near the vaginal opening, with some fluid discharge and swelling. She describes the lesions as tender, increasingly painful, and associated with itching and a burning sensation during urination and sexual activity. The initial presentation was a small, red, swollen blister-like sore, which has progressed over days to include additional tender lesions with fluid. She denies systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or malaise. She expresses concern and emotional distress regarding her condition but demonstrates communication patterns suggestive of minor underreporting of severity; physical examination is necessary to accurately determine the number, size, distribution, and extent of the lesions and to assess for additional signs of infection or systemic involvement. The clinical picture indicates localized vulvar irritation with painful lesions, but further objective assessment is essential to guide diagnosis and management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, hedging language and downplays the size and severity of her sores, but simultaneously exhibits signs of emotional distress and concern. She provides contextual background relating to her sister and hygiene, possibly seeking validation or feeling embarrassed. Her responses are elaborative but scattered, suggesting discomfort with full disclosure. Her descriptions are likely biased toward underreporting physical severity, though her emotional tone indicates genuine concern.\n- Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias affecting physical reporting, with potential overemphasis of emotional distress. She seems to understate the extent and intensity of her lesions, possibly due to embarrassment or a desire not to appear overly distressed.\n- Confidence level: Medium, because her language pattern strongly indicates minimization, but her emotional descriptors are genuine, supporting some degree of actual severity.\n- Reasoning: The hedged, imprecise quantifications and qualifying language point toward underreporting of lesion size, number, and severity. Her emotional expressions and concern for her sister\u2019s similar condition corroborate that her distress is real, but her physical symptoms may be more extensive or severe than she admits.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you try to tell me exactly how many sores you've noticed, even if you're unsure?

I started noticing some painful sores near my vulva about three days ago, and they\\u2019re pretty tender now, especially when I touch them or when I go to the bathroom. I also feel a burning sensation when I pee and during sex, which has never happened before. It\\u2019s been really itchy too, and I just worry because this came out of nowhere after I was kind of sensitive about certain soaps I\\u2019ve used recently. I don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019ve never had anything like this happen before, and I\\u2019m kind of freaked out because I don\\u2019t really understand what\\u2019s going on.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me what the sores look like exactly\\u2014are they in one spot or spread out, how many are there, and how large do they seem to you?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, there's this spot near my opening, and it\\u2019s kinda like a small bump or sore, but now I see some fluid or something coming out, and I swear there's more than one of them, a few, but I didn't really count. They seem to be getting more tender and kinda swollen, and honestly, I\\u2019ve been so stressed with work lately that I forget to do good hygiene sometimes, which might be making it worse.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how the sores looked when they first appeared, and how they have changed or progressed since then?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, at first, it was just a tiny sore, kinda like a little blister or something, near where I usually get irritated from my soaps and stuff, but I guess it looked a bit red and swollen. Now, it\\u2019s more painful and there\\u2019s some fluid I notice, and I feel like the area keeps getting more tender, especially when I sit or move around a lot. My sister had something similar last year, but hers wasn\\u2019t as itchy or painful, I think. It just kinda came on suddenly right after I, uh, was trying to be careful with my hygiene because I read some stuff online about infections, but I still don\\u2019t really understand what\\u2019s happening.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me exactly how many sores or bumps you've noticed, how big they are, and whether they're in one spot or spread out around the area?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, there\\u2019s like, a couple of sores, maybe three, and they\\u2019re kinda small but they hurt a lot, especially when I touch or move. They\\u2019re not exactly right next to each other but kind of around the same area, near where I feel the irritation. I think I\\u2019ve been more itchy lately, and I did start using this new soap I found at the store last week, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s why it got worse, but it all just kinda happened suddenly after I had some discomfort when I was peeing\\u2014like a burning feeling.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me exactly how the sores look\\u2014are they small blisters, ulcers, or something else\\u2014and if they hurt or feel different from other skin rashes or sores you've had before?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, the sores are kind of like small blisters or maybe ulcers, I guess? They hurt pretty bad when I touch them, and there\\u2019s been some kind of fluid or discharge coming from there too.

I don\\u2019t think he has sores or anything, but honestly, I\\u2019ve just been so busy with work and trying to plan my sister\\u2019s wedding, I didn\\u2019t think much about it till the sore showed up. And I don\\u2019t really know if I\\u2019ve been exposed to anyone else, but I do remember hearing stories from my cousin about her friend getting genital sores, so I guess I\\u2019m worried it could be something like that.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with a three-day history of vulvar lesions characterized by multiple tender sores or bumps near the vaginal opening, with some fluid discharge and swelling. She reports initial small, red, blister-like lesions that have progressed to include approximately three or more lesions that are increasingly swollen, painful, and itchy. She describes significant discomfort during urination and sexual activity, with burning sensations, but denies systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. She has a recent history of using a new soap and admits to occasional suboptimal hygiene, which may have contributed to her symptoms. Given her communication pattern, the true number and severity of the lesions are likely greater than reported, and further physical examination and testing are indicated to determine the full extent of her condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates with cautious language, providing elaborated but hedged responses, and minimizes the perceived severity of her lesions. She displays emotional discomfort around discussing intimate symptoms and seems hesitant to fully disclose details.\n- Bias detected: She exhibits minimization bias, downplaying lesion count and severity, partly driven by embarrassment and possibly a desire to avoid worry or judgment.\n- Confidence level: Medium. While her responses suggest underreporting, her distress indicates real discomfort, so her description likely underestimates actual severity rather than inventing or exaggerating symptoms.\n- Reasoning: My analysis combines her hedging language, emotional cues, and tendency to rationalize symptoms with contextual factors, indicating she is holding back full disclosure, especially concerning the lesion extent and potential infectious risk.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Can you tell me exactly how many sores or bumps you see now, even if you're not sure? Sometimes, it helps to do a quick check in the mirror.\" (Rationale: Encourages visual assessment and reduces ambiguity.)\n2. \"Have the sores grown in size or number since they first appeared? Do they look different now than when you first noticed them?\" (Rationale: Clarifies progression and true severity.)\n3. \"Are you noticing any other symptoms like swelling of your lymph nodes, fever, or feeling unwell?\" (Rationale: Detects systemic involvement that she may not voluntarily mention.)\n4. \"Can you tell me more about your recent sexual activity, including any unprotected encounters or possible exposures, even if it was just a while ago?\" (Rationale: Extracts more accurate exposure history beyond the one-month window.)\n5. \"How comfortable are you discussing your symptoms? Is there anything about them that feels embarrassing or hard to say?\" (Rationale: Validates emotional discomfort and encourages openness.)\n- Approach strategy: Use empathetic, normalize her feelings, and reassure her that it's common to feel worried about such symptoms. Frame questions gently to reduce shame and promote full disclosure.\n- Priority order: Begin with visual and progression questions about the sores, then move to systemic symptoms and detailed exposure history, followed by addressing emotional comfort to build trust.",

She avoids close inspection and minimizes her symptoms, possibly out of embarrassment. Her responses are extended but filled with qualifiers, and she references external stories to contextualize her situation, suggesting underlying discomfort and guarding of private information.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is *minimization*, driven by embarrassment, shame, and discomfort with genital symptoms. There is also evidence of *withholding* detailed, objective descriptions, probably to avoid shame or judgment.\n- Confidence level: Medium\n- Reasoning: The patterns of vague language, hedging, and explicit statements of not inspecting closely point strongly to minimization and withholding biases. Her emotional cues and hes'tance support this, making her report likely conservative relative to her true clinical state.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you describe exactly what the sores look like now\u2014are they small, large, painful, or itchy?\" (to obtain clearer visual and sensory detail)\n- \"Have the sores changed in size, number, or appearance since you first noticed them?\" (to clarify progression)\n- \"Have you noticed any other symptoms such as fever, feeling unwell, or enlarged lymph nodes?\" (to detect systemic signs she might not mention)\n- \"Would you feel comfortable examining yourself or having someone else help you look more closely at the sores?\" (to assess willingness and reduce shame)\n- Approach strategy: Asking openly and empathetically, emphasizing confidentiality and normalizing concerns, can reduce shame-driven withholding. Use non-judgmental language to encourage full disclosure.\n- Priority order: Start with descriptive questions about current appearance and sensations to gather concrete info, then address changes over time, followed by systemic symptoms, and finally explore comfort with inspection. This structured approach builds trust and minimizes discomfort, facilitating more accurate clinical assessment.",

She perceives the sores as painful and itchy, with fluid presence, but may be underreporting the severity. No systemic symptoms such as fever or lymphadenopathy are mentioned.

Objective findings include several small lesions located near the vaginal opening, described as blister-like or ulcerative, with some showing fluid discharge and increased tenderness, swelling, and redness. The lesions are concentrated in an area consistent with irritation and are in proximity to one another, with possible line-like or grouped patterning. The patient's report of symptoms may underestimate the true extent of discomfort, number of lesions, and associated systemic symptoms; discomfort upon examination and her communication style suggest her condition may be more severe than conveyed. She reports recent unprotected sexual activity approximately one month ago, with no current visible partner lesions, and recent initiation of a new soap. She perceives the sores as painful and itchy, with fluid presence, but may be underreporting the severity. No systemic symptoms such as fever or lymphadenopathy are mentioned. Further physical examination and laboratory testing are advised to clarify the diagnosis, and exploration of additional symptoms is recommended due to communication barriers. Confidence in lesion description and severity is medium, given communication biases; systemic symptoms are unlikely to be severe but cannot be ruled out without further assessment.

    "input": "CONVERSATION HISTORY:\n[\n  \"DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I\\u2019m 28, and I\\u2019m a woman. I started noticing some painful sores near my vulva about three days ago, and they\\u2019re pretty tender now, especially when I touch them or when I go to the bathroom. I also feel a burning sensation when I pee and during sex, which has never happened before. It\\u2019s been really itchy too, and I just worry because this came out of nowhere after I was kind of sensitive about certain soaps I\\u2019ve used recently. I don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019ve never had anything like this happen before, and I\\u2019m kind of freaked out because I don\\u2019t really understand what\\u2019s going on.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me what the sores look like exactly\\u2014are they in one spot or spread out, how many are there, and how large do they seem to you?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, there's this spot near my opening, and it\\u2019s kinda like a small bump or sore, but now I see some fluid or something coming out, and I swear there's more than one of them, a few, but I didn't really count. They seem to be getting more tender and kinda swollen, and honestly, I\\u2019ve been so stressed with work lately that I forget to do good hygiene sometimes, which might be making it worse.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how the sores looked when they first appeared, and how they have changed or progressed since then?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, at first, it was just a tiny sore, kinda like a little blister or something, near where I usually get irritated from my soaps and stuff, but I guess it looked a bit red and swollen. Now, it\\u2019s more painful and there\\u2019s some fluid I notice, and I feel like the area keeps getting more tender, especially when I sit or move around a lot. My sister had something similar last year, but hers wasn\\u2019t as itchy or painful, I think. It just kinda came on suddenly right after I, uh, was trying to be careful with my hygiene because I read some stuff online about infections, but I still don\\u2019t really understand what\\u2019s happening.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me exactly how many sores or bumps you've noticed, how big they are, and whether they're in one spot or spread out around the area?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, there\\u2019s like, a couple of sores, maybe three, and they\\u2019re kinda small but they hurt a lot, especially when I touch or move. They\\u2019re not exactly right next to each other but kind of around the same area, near where I feel the irritation. I think I\\u2019ve been more itchy lately, and I did start using this new soap I found at the store last week, so I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s why it got worse, but it all just kinda happened suddenly after I had some discomfort when I was peeing\\u2014like a burning feeling.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me exactly how the sores look\\u2014are they small blisters, ulcers, or something else\\u2014and if they hurt or feel different from other skin rashes or sores you've had before?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, the sores are kind of like small blisters or maybe ulcers, I guess? They hurt pretty bad when I touch them, and there\\u2019s been some kind of fluid or discharge coming from there too. It feels different from just a normal rash or irritation, and the burning when I pee is really annoying now, especially since I was trying to finish my work at home yesterday but kept having to go to the bathroom.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you had any recent sexual activity, especially with new or unprotected partners, or any recent exposure to someone with genital sores or blisters?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I\\u2019ve been with my boyfriend, but it\\u2019s been a while since we used a condom \\u2014 probably about a month ago \\u2014 and I haven\\u2019t noticed anything before now. I don\\u2019t think he has sores or anything, but honestly, I\\u2019ve just been so busy with work and trying to plan my sister\\u2019s wedding, I didn\\u2019t think much about it till the sore showed up. And I don\\u2019t really know if I\\u2019ve been exposed to anyone else, but I do remember hearing stories from my cousin about her friend getting genital sores, so I guess I\\u2019m worried it could be something like that.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you describe exactly what the sores or blisters look like\\u2014are they filled with fluid, shallow, deep, or ulcerated\\u2014and how they feel when you touch or move them?\",\n  \"PATIENT: ores sound like they\\u2019re filled with some kind of fluid or maybe not\\u2014it\\u2019s hard to tell, and they kind of feel painful and sore, especially when I touch them. I also keep worrying if it\\u2019s something serious or if it could be something from la\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me if the sores have ever looked like small fluid-filled blisters that then break open, leaving shallow ulcers, and whether they tend to occur in groups or have a line-like pattern on your skin?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I mean, I saw maybe a little fluid or something near the sore, and it kind of broke open, I think? Like, it left a shallow thing, I guess. The thing is, I haven\\u2019t really looked super close, but I do notice there\\u2019s sometimes a few sores that seem close together, and maybe they\\u2019re in a line, but I don\\u2019t really know how to tell. It\\u2019s all kind of confusing and painful.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me if the sores or blisters you have noticed tend to be grouped together in clusters or lines, and whether they feel like small, fluid-filled bumps that eventually break open and turn into ulcers?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I don\\u2019t really know if they\\u2019re in groups or lines, honestly. It\\u2019s all sort of just there\\u2014there are these spots that hurt and sometimes they break open and get all messy, I guess. I never really looked super closely, but it feels like it\\u2019s all just one big uncomfortable mess.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nPatient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with a three-day history of multiple vulvar sores. Objective findings include several small lesions located near the vaginal opening, described as blister-like or ulcerative, with some showing fluid discharge and increased tenderness, swelling, and redness. The lesions are concentrated in an area consistent with irritation and are in proximity to one another, with possible line-like or grouped patterning. The patient's report of symptoms may underestimate the true extent of discomfort, number of lesions, and associated systemic symptoms; discomfort upon examination and her communication style suggest her condition may be more severe than conveyed. She reports recent unprotected sexual activity approximately one month ago, with no current visible partner lesions, and recent initiation of a new soap. She perceives the sores as painful and itchy, with fluid presence, but may be underreporting the severity. No systemic symptoms such as fever or lymphadenopathy are mentioned. Further physical examination and laboratory testing are advised to clarify the diagnosis, and exploration of additional symptoms is recommended due to communication barriers. Confidence in lesion description and severity is medium, given communication biases; systemic symptoms are unlikely to be severe but cannot be ruled out without further assessment. Additional information is needed regarding systemic signs and the patient's comfort with inspection to guide further evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient\u2019s responses are vague, scattered, and hedging, indicating discomfort, shame, or uncertainty when describing her vulvar sores. She avoids detailed observation and tends to minimize or generalize her symptoms, likely due to embarrassment or confusion.\n- Bias detected: Avoidance and minimization bias are strongly influencing her reporting, as she deliberately or unconsciously underrepresents the severity and detail of her condition.\n- Confidence level: Medium \u2014 I am reasonably confident that her communication is biased toward underreporting, but some details she provides are accurate.\n- Reasoning: The combination of vague, non-specific language, reluctance to inspect closely, and her emotional distress suggest she may be hiding the true extent of her symptoms and experience.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Can you tell me exactly how many sores or blisters you've noticed? Are they all similar in size and appearance?\"\n*Rationale: To obtain a clearer count and description, counteracting her vague summaries.*\n2. \"Have you noticed if the sores have changed in size, number, or appearance since they first appeared?\"\n*Rationale: To assess progression, which she is unsure about.*\n3. \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, like fever, chills, swelling of lymph nodes, or feeling unwell?\"\n*Rationale: To evaluate systemic involvement she might be omitting.*\n4. \"Would you feel comfortable inspecting the area more closely or having me examine it?\"\n*Rationale: To assess her willingness and comfort, addressing her embarrassment.*\n- Approach strategy:\nUse empathetic, non-judgmental language, emphasizing understanding rather than judgment. Reassure her that many people find sensitive areas difficult to describe and that honesty helps in providing the best care. Frame questions gently to reduce shame and encourage openness.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, clarify the number and appearance of the sores to get an accurate picture, then inquire about systemic symptoms, followed by her comfort with examination. Starting with concrete, non-judgmental questions minimizes anxiety and facilitates more truthful responses.",
