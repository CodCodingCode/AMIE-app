It\u2019s confusing, and I get embarrassed talking about it.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how you feel about your body and any worries or questions you have about the changes you're experiencing or not experiencing?\\nPATIENT: I dunno, I feel kinda weird about my body. Sometimes I wonder why I don\u2019t look like other girls, and I get pretty anxious thinking about what\u2019s wrong with me or if it\u2019s gonna get better. It\u2019s all confusing, and I\u2019m worried about what people might think too.\\nDOCTOR: Do you notice any issues with your sense of smell, such as your ability to detect odors?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I noticed that I don\u2019t really smell things that well? Like, sometimes I don\u2019t really notice really strong smells, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Has she undergone any imaging studies, such as ultrasound or MRI, to evaluate the presence or absence of ovaries, uterus, or gonadal tissue?\\nPATIENT: Um, no, I haven't had any scans or pictures or anything like that. I'm kind of confused about what they would show, and honestly, I haven't really asked about it yet.\\nDOCTOR: Has she experienced any other neurological symptoms, such as hearing loss, vision changes, or balance difficulties?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know\u2026 I mean, sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or like my head is foggy, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean. Nothing really too specific.\\nDOCTOR: Have you had a chance to discuss your diagnosis with a healthcare provider, and do you feel comfortable with the next steps we\u2019ve talked about, such as additional testing or starting hormone therapy?\\nPATIENT: Um, no, I haven't really talked to anyone about it yet. It\u2019s all kinda lots to think about, and I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m ready for all the testing stuff or the medicines. I just feel a bit weird about everything.\\nDOCTOR: Would you feel comfortable discussing a treatment plan that includes hormone therapy to help develop some secondary sexual characteristics and address your concerns, and would you like us to include genetic counseling to better understand your condition?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t know. I guess I.\u2026 I\u2019m kind of scared to start anything right now, but maybe it would help if it could make things better? And\u2026 I think I want to know more about why this is happening, so maybe the genetic stuff would be good too.\\nDOCTOR: Have you felt ready to discuss the potential options for hormone therapy and other management strategies, and would you like us to go over what these treatments involve so you can make an informed decision together?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019m kind of nervous still, and I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m ready to decide about everything. But I\u2019d like to hear more about what the options are, I guess, so I can understand better.\\nDOCTOR: Would you be open to having further imaging, such as an ultrasound or MRI, to help us better understand the structure of your ovaries, uterus, and gonadal tissue, so we can plan the most appropriate next steps together?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess so. If it helps, I don\u2019t really know what they\u2019ll see or what it all means, but I guess I want to understand better.",
