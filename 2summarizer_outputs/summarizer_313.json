It\\u2019s like my stomach is really tight and hard.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally charged language to emphasize current symptoms (\"hit me hard,\" \"really bloated\") while describing vomiting in a minimized way (\"dry heaves,\" \"nothing\u2019s coming up\") and providing concise responses. The overall tone suggests concern but also an attempt to control the narrative. The focus on recent escalation indicates an urgent presentation, possibly magnified by emotional expression. - Bias detected: The communication involves emotional amplification\u2014exaggerating severity to prompt care\u2014and mild minimization\u2014underplaying the seriousness of vomiting and bowel function. Trustworthiness for current symptoms is reasonable, but the history may be biased by these tendencies. - Confidence level: Medium, because the presentation aligns with known bias patterns but lacks overt withholding or confusion. - Reasoning: The combination of emotionally intense descriptors and brief, clinically focused responses suggests the patient seeks urgent attention while selectively emphasizing certain symptoms over others, potentially underestimating their full severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual severity of vomiting and dehydration might be worse than described; the patient may be experiencing significant fluid loss without acknowledging it fully. - Withheld information: There\u2019s no evidence of embarrassment, but baseline bowel habits and earlier mild symptoms are likely underreported, which are critical for understanding progression. - Amplified concerns: The urgent tone and exaggerated language suggest heightened anxiety or concern about the current episode, which may lead to overestimating overall severity. - Temporal distortions: The focus on recent worsening may omit the gradual development over days or weeks, underestimating chronicity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true picture likely involves a patient with longstanding or intermittent bowel issues presenting with a recent acute exacerbation characterized by severe abdominal pain, significant vomiting suggestive of dehydration, and possible bowel obstruction or severe constipation. Past mild symptoms or gradual worsening may not be fully disclosed. The current presentation is real but possibly more severe and complex than the verbal report indicates.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me about your bowel habits over the past few weeks?\" (to assess baseline), \"Have you noticed any blood, fever, or weakness?\" (to evaluate systemic involvement), \"When did you first notice the bloating or discomfort?\" (to establish a timeline), \"Describe how your vomiting has changed since it started\" (to gauge dehydration risk). These targeted questions aim to uncover hidden or understated issues. - Approach strategy: Ask in a calm, nonjudgmental manner, emphasizing concern for her or his well-being, and normalizing mild symptoms to encourage fuller disclosure. - Priority order: First establish baseline bowel habits and past symptoms, then delve into the recent change, assessing for dehydration signs and systemic symptoms. This approach provides context and helps calibrate the urgency appropriately.  #",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses emotionally charged language and brief responses, which suggests an attempt to emphasize current distress while potentially downplaying or minimizing the severity of some symptoms. While the report indicates severe abdominal pain, inability to pass gas or bowel movements, bloating, and dry vomiting, these descriptions may be exaggerated or lack full detail. It is likely that the symptoms are more severe and complex than verbally expressed, with probable dehydration from persistent vomiting and possible bowel obstruction or severe constipation, especially considering the acuity. Conversely, the patient may be withholding or underreporting milder or baseline symptoms, such as prior bowel habits, systemic symptoms like fever or weakness. The current presentation indicates an urgent gastrointestinal issue, but the true extent of severity may be underappreciated without further probing.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified in the conversation.  Chief complaint: Severe abdominal pain with recent onset, inability to pass gas or stool, bloating, and vomiting.  Present illness: The patient reports that abdominal pain worsened significantly today, with associated inability to evacuate bowel or pass gas. She describes feeling very bloated and nauseous, with dry vomiting episodes. Based on communication biases, the actual severity of symptoms may be greater, and there may be underlying dehydration and possible bowel obstruction or severe constipation. The timeline suggests an recent acute worsening, though prior mild or intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms may not be fully disclosed.  Associated symptoms: No mention of fever, blood in stool or vomit, weakness, or systemic symptoms; confidence in absence of these is moderate but limited by the patient\u2019s brief communication.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient is experiencing significant gastrointestinal symptoms including pain, bloating, inability to have bowel movements or pass gas, and vomiting. - Medium confidence: The severity and underlying causes are likely underestimated due to communication style. - Low confidence: Exact specifics of baseline bowel habits, past symptoms, and systemic signs are unknown and may be underreported. - Missing information: Detailed history of bowel habits, systemic symptoms, duration and progression of symptoms, and physical examination findings are needed.\nANSWER: A patient presents with severe abdominal pain, bloating, and intractable vomiting involving dry heaves. She reports an inability to pass gas or stool, indicating significant bowel dysfunction, possibly due to bowel obstruction or severe constipation. The current symptoms appear acutely worsened, but past gastrointestinal history and baseline bowel habits remain unspecified. The patient\u2019s communication suggests potential underestimation of severity or missing systemic symptoms, necessitating further clinical assessment and investigation.",

The current symptoms appear acutely worsened, but past gastrointestinal history and baseline bowel habits remain unspecified. The patient\u2019s communication suggests potential underestimation of severity or missing systemic symptoms, necessitating further clinical assessment and investigation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses cautious, hesitant language when describing baseline bowel habits, with vague frequency and regularity details. They employ more emotional, intense language when describing current symptoms, emphasizing severity but providing minimal historical context. Responds briefly, indicating discomfort or shame in discussing routine functions. The contrast between vague baseline and intense acute symptoms suggests an unconscious emphasis on current distress while downplaying or withholding chronic issues. - Bias detected: Minimization bias regarding baseline bowel habits, with some amplification of current symptoms. This bias affects the reliability of historical information, emphasizing acute severity over chronic patterns. - Confidence level: Medium. The explicit hedging and vagueness about past habits support this assessment, although current symptom descriptions are clearer. - Reasoning: The patient's hesitant language and vague responses about routine bowel function point toward underreporting, while emotionally charged descriptions of current pain and vomiting suggest an attempt to underscore urgency, possibly influenced by emotional distress or embarrassment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Chronic irregularity or minor ongoing bowel issues that the patient feels embarrassed or reluctant to fully disclose, such as infrequent or inconsistent bowel actions, or mild discomforts. - Withheld information: Any long-standing GI symptoms or prior episodes of irregularity that are deemed minor or embarrassing; details about previous similar episodes or less severe symptoms may be underreported. - Amplified concerns: The severity of the current episode, possibly overemphasized due to distress, to garner urgency or sympathy. The intense language (\"terrible,\" \"keeps vomiting\") may not fully match the objective severity but reflect emotional state. - Temporal distortions: The patient\u2019s baseline may be more irregular or problematic than described, but they minimize this to avoid stigma or shame. There might also be a tendency to focus on current problems rather than providing a complete history.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves a patient with a history of irregular and possibly chronic bowel patterning, which they underreport due to embarrassment. The current acute episode is genuine and severe, characterized by bowel obstruction or severe constipation, with significant distress. Underlying chronic symptoms may include infrequent or inconsistent bowel movements, mild abdominal discomfort, or episodic bloating that the patient minimizes. Their exaggerated description of symptoms reflects genuine distress but should be contextualized within a history of potential ongoing bowel irregularities. The overall picture warrants thorough exploration of past bowel habits, previous episodes, and subtle systemic symptoms to inform comprehensive management.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how your bowel habits have been over the past few months? Do you notice any patterns or changes in how often you go or how your stool feels?\" \"Have you ever experienced similar episodes before, even if mild?\" \"Are there any other minor symptoms like occasional constipation or bloating that bother you but you haven't mentioned?\" These aim to uncover hidden chronic issues. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing understanding rather than judgment, e.g., \"Many people experience changes over time, and I want to understand your normal pattern in case there's something we can help with.\" \"It's common to feel uncomfortable sharing certain details, but even small issues can be important for your health.\" This helps reduce embarrassment and encourages truthful disclosure. - Priority order: Start by exploring the patient's usual bowel pattern over time, as understanding the chronic baseline is essential before addressing urgent symptoms. Follow with questions about previous similar episodes and less obvious symptoms, then proceed to current severity. This sequencing helps build trust and obtain a fuller picture gradually.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication suggests a tendency to underreport or minimize baseline bowel irregularities, likely due to embarrassment or discomfort, while emphasizing the severity of current symptoms. The vivid language used to describe the current episode indicates genuine distress, but may also be influenced by emotional amplification. Therefore, although the current presentation likely reflects a true acute episode of bowel obstruction or severe constipation with associated vomiting and bloating, the underlying chronic bowel pattern and overall severity might be more significant than the patient's description indicates. Additional inquiry is needed regarding past bowel habits, previous episodes, and minor systemic symptoms to accurately characterize the baseline and ongoing issues.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Details unspecified (age, gender not provided). Chief complaint: Acute severe abdominal pain, inability to pass gas or stool, vomiting, bloating. Present illness: An episode characterized by intense abdominal pain, dry heaving vomiting, and abdominal hardening. The patient reports recent onset with significant distress. Baseline bowel habits are reported with hesitation and vagueness, indicating irregularity and possible chronic constipation that is underreported. The current symptoms are likely genuine, but the severity may be somewhat exaggerated due to emotional distress; the baseline bowel function is probably more irregular than acknowledged. Associated symptoms: None explicitly reported aside from vomiting and bloating; possibility of prior mild or irregular bowel habits is suspected but underdisclosed. Systemic symptoms outside GI are not specified. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of current severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloating consistent with bowel obstruction or severe constipation. - Medium confidence: The extent of baseline bowel irregularity is likely underestimated; current symptom severity may be slightly amplified. - Low confidence: Specific details about past GI history, frequency of bowel movements, and systemic symptoms are lacking and subject to patient bias. - Missing information: Past bowel patterns, previous episodes, systemic symptoms, and broader medical history required for comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: A patient presents with an acute episode of severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, inability to pass gas or stool, and dry heaving vomiting, suggestive of bowel obstruction or severe constipation. Although the patient reports irregular bowel habits with some hesitation, their description indicates a probable history of chronic bowel irregularity or mild constipation that may be underreported. The severity of current symptoms appears genuine but may be emotionally amplified, while the baseline bowel function is likely more impaired than conveyed. Further investigation into past bowel patterns, previous similar episodes, and systemic symptoms is necessary to fully characterize the patient's gastrointestinal condition.",

Their responses include emotional words indicating real concern but also potential exaggeration due to anxiety. Their communication exhibits avoidance of precise detail, possibly out of embarrassment.  - Bias detected: The dominant bias is **minimization** of baseline bowel irregularity and severity, likely driven by embarrassment or shame, leading to underreporting of the chronicity and frequency. There is also some emotional amplification of current symptoms, which could overstate their physical severity relative to the patient\u2019s usual state.  - Confidence level: **Medium**. The communication patterns strongly suggest bias, but some responses are truthful; the emotional context adds uncertainty to the exact baseline severity.  - Reasoning: The vagueness and hedging support minimization; emotional descriptors highlight distress but may inflate perceived severity; guarded language signals discomfort in disclosure.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient likely is underreporting the true frequency of their bowel irregularity and the severity of past episodes, such as more frequent constipation or episodes of blockage, because of embarrassment or shame.  - Withheld information: They might be reluctant to disclose systemic or associated symptoms like bloating, abdominal discomfort, or systemic effects, which they consider embarrassing or less relevant. They may also avoid discussing the duration and impact of their chronic constipation.  - Amplified concerns: The current distress (\"horrible,\" \"worse\") may be exaggerated emotionally, possibly to command attention or convey urgency, but physical findings suggest a serious underlying problem.  - Temporal distortions: They focus on recent worsening, possibly ignoring or minimizing long-standing issues, leading to an incomplete picture of chronic bowel habits.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture is that the patient has a longstanding, likely moderate to severe, chronic constipation characterized by irregular, hard, pellet-like stools with episodes of worsened discomfort.

Also, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or increased abdominal pain during these times?\\u201d  CURRENT CLINICAL PICTURE: Vignette: The patient is experiencing an acute episode consistent with bowel obstruction or severe constipation, presenting with significant abdominal distension, pain, inability to pass gas or stool, and vomiting. Their baseline bowel habits are likely characterized by irregular and hard, pellet-like stools occurring approximately once or twice weekly, with possible underreporting of more frequent or severe episodes. Evidence suggests chronic constipation with intermittent exacerbations that may be more severe than initially disclosed. The current symptoms are genuine but may be emotionally amplified, and the patient possibly withholds details about prior systemic or related symptoms. Further detailed history is needed to better understand the extent and severity of their chronic bowel issues.  Leading Diagnoses: 1. Diagnosis: Fecal impaction leading to bowel obstruction Justification: The patient's inability to pass stool or gas, significant distension, and vomiting strongly suggest fecal impaction causing colonic obstruction. Baseline irregular, hard stools support chronic constipation prone to impaction; an acute impaction would explain the sudden worsening of symptoms. 2. Diagnosis: Mechanical large bowel obstruction (e.g., volvulus or obstructing mass) Justification: Severe distension, pain, and obstipation raise concern for a mechanical cause like volvulus or neoplasm. These often present with similar symptoms, especially in patients with longstanding constipation. 3. Diagnosis: Severe functional (colonic) constipation with acute exacerbation Justification: The patient\\u2019s baseline irregular bowel habits suggest chronic idiopathic constipation. An acute crisis may arise from worsening motility or impaction superimposed, causing obstruction-like symptoms. 4. Diagnosis: Colonic stricture (e.g., from prior inflammatory disease or neoplastic processes) Justification: Strictures can cause obstructive symptoms, especially in patients with baseline constipations if they have prior inflammatory or neoplastic history. Less likely without prior history but included due to possible contribution to obstructive pattern. 5. Diagnosis: Neuromuscular disorder affecting colonic motility (e.g., Hirschsprung disease or acquired dysmotility) Justification: Although less common in adults, neuromuscular causes may underlie severe, chronic constipation and predispose to impaction; especially relevant if other causes are excluded. STOP HERE.  COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS: - Language choices: The patient uses vague, hesitant language (\\\"maybe,\\\" \\\"kind of\\\"), indicating discomfort or reluctance to fully detail symptoms or habits. Emotional words like \\\"horrible\\\" suggest genuine distress but may also serve to emphasize urgency. - Information flow: Responses are somewhat guarded; the patient answers straightforward questions but provides minimal elaboration unless prompted, showing a tendency toward selective disclosure. - Response style: Typically minimal and cautious, with some hedging and uncertainty, especially regarding prior habits; this pattern suggests discomfort or embarrassment about discussing bowel symptoms directly.  BEHAVIORAL_INDICATORS: - Information withholding signs: Hedging language and vague descriptions of bowel frequency and stool consistency imply intentional or unintentional withholding of precise information. - Minimization behaviors: Downplaying bowel irregularity by saying \\\"maybe once or twice a week\\\" and describing stool as \\\"kind of hard\\\" indicate attempts to minimize the perceived severity. - Amplification patterns: Words like \\\"horrible,\\\" \\\"worst,\\\" and \\\"worse\\\" showcase genuine concern and distress, which might be exaggerated due to anxiety. - Embarrassment/shame signals: Hesitant language and vague details about bowel habits suggest internal discomfort and possible shame about these topics. - Confusion/memory issues: Use of qualifiers such as \\\"I guess\\\" points toward minor uncertainty but not serious memory impairment. - Family influence: No direct evidence, but internal feelings of shame could be internally influenced rather than externally driven.  BIAS_ASSESSMENT: - Primary bias type: The main bias is **minimization**, particularly about bowel habits and prior episodes, driven by embarrassment or shame. - Severity: Moderate; the responses are cautious and non-specific, indicating some underreporting, but overall truthful intentions. - Areas most affected: Bowel habit details and possibly the historical frequency of episodes are most biased, potentially underestimating the baseline severity. - Reliability: Moderate; while the patient appears honest, the emotional discomfort likely leads to underreporting, requiring clinical corroboration.  CLINICAL_IMPLICATIONS: - Information likely missing: Exact details of bowel regularity, stool characteristics, and prior episode severity, all potentially understated. - Symptoms probably minimized: The frequency and consistency of bowel issues and the full extent of past episodes. - Concerns probably amplified: The emotional distress (e.g., \\\"horrible,\\\" \\\"it\\u2019s gotten worse\\\") may overstate the physical severity relative to the actual condition. - True timeline: The patient\\u2019s sense of worsening aligns with the report, but the underlying history might be more chronic and less severe than portrayed. This analysis suggests that while the patient is providing honest responses, internal embarrassment and an intent to minimize symptoms could mask the full clinical picture, necessitating careful interpretation and possibly more probing questions or objective assessments.\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, yeah, I guess I don\\u2019t really have a regular schedule or anything\\u2014maybe like once or twice a week, and they\\u2019re kinda hard and dry. When I\\u2019m like this, it gets worse, and I can\\u2019t really go at all, no matter what I try.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is experiencing an acute episode consistent with bowel obstruction or severe constipation, presenting with significant abdominal distension, pain, inability to pass gas or stool, and vomiting. Their baseline bowel habits are likely characterized by irregular and hard, pellet-like stools occurring approximately once or twice weekly, with possible underreporting of more frequent or severe episodes. Evidence suggests chronic constipation with intermittent exacerbations that may be more severe than initially disclosed. The current symptoms are genuine but may be emotionally amplified, and the patient possibly withholds details about prior systemic or related symptoms. Further detailed history is needed to better understand the extent and severity of their chronic bowel issues.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient's responses are vague, hesitant, and minimized, using cautious language (\"maybe,\" \"kinda\") to describe bowel habits. They acknowledge distress (\"it gets worse\") but do not detail the frequency or severity fully. - Bias detected: The main bias is **minimization**, influenced by embarrassment and shame about bowel habits. Their language suggests they are trying to downplay the severity and frequency of problems. - Confidence level: **Medium**; while responses indicate genuine distress and some underreporting, the cautious tone means more details could be revealed with further probing. - Reasoning: The use of hedging and minimal detail aligns with known patterns of shame-driven minimization, especially around sensitive topics like bowel habits.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual frequency of bowel movements, severity of stool hardness, episodes of complete bowel absence, and prior episodes of impaction are probably more frequent and severe than reported, as the patient minimizes their baseline irregularity. - Withheld information: The patient might be reluctant to fully disclose prior episodes of obstruction, associated pain, nausea, or prior management failures due to embarrassment. - Amplified concerns: The statement \"it gets worse\" could be an exaggeration driven by anxiety or distress, potentially overstating the current situation\u2019s severity. - Temporal distortions: The baseline constipation may be more chronic and severe than the vague history suggests; current fears might make them perceive the episode as worse than usual, but they might underestimate past severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true picture likely involves chronic, severe constipation with irregular, hard, pellet-like stools occurring more than once or twice weekly, sometimes leading to partial or complete impaction. The patient may have experienced multiple episodes of impaction or obstruction, but underreports due to embarrassment. The current episode represents an exacerbation possibly worse than their usual pattern but possibly less catastrophic than they imply emotionally. Anxiety or shame influences their reporting, dampening the perceived severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how often you typically have a bowel movement, including before this recent episode?\" (to clarify true frequency) - \"Have you ever passed stool that was completely hard or pellet-like? How often does this happen?\" (to assess severity) - \"Have you ever experienced episodes where you couldn\u2019t pass stool or gas at all? How often?\" (to uncover past impactions) - \"Do you have any associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain during these episodes?\" (to evaluate severity) - \"What treatments have you tried before, and how effective were they?\" (to inform management) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, nonjudgmental language; normalize the topic to reduce shame. - Frame questions focusing on convenience (\"Some people have irregular bowel patterns\u2014can you tell me how yours usually are?\") to make disclosures easier. - Emphasize that understanding the full picture helps provide the best care, encouraging honesty. - Priority order: 1. Clarify actual frequency and pattern of bowel movements. 2. Explore past episodes of severe constipation or impaction. 3. Ask about associated symptoms like pain, nausea, and vomiting. 4. Inquire about prior management efforts and their outcomes. This sequence allows building trust, reduces shame, and systematically uncovers hidden severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits communication patterns suggestive of minimization and discomfort discussing bowel habits, likely leading to underestimation of symptom severity and frequency. While they report irregular and hard, pellet-like stools occurring roughly once or twice weekly and difficulty passing stool during episodes, these descriptions probably understate the actual baseline severity and episode frequency. The emotional distress and use of hesitant language indicate that prior episodes of severe constipation, impaction, or even intermittent partial obstruction are more frequent and severe than disclosed. The current presentation with inability to pass stool or gas, vomiting, and abdominal distension strongly suggests bowel obstruction due to impaction, but the patient's report of \u201cworse\u201d symptoms and irregular habits is likely understated. This underreporting may obscure a chronic pattern of severe, persistent constipation with multiple prior episodes of impaction or partial obstruction that the patient minimizes because of embarrassment or shame. Additional probing of bowel frequency, stool consistency, past episodes, and associated symptoms is needed to clarify the true extent of bowel dysfunction. Overall, the clinical picture indicates a likely history of chronic, severe constipation with episodic impactions, compounded by anxiety-driven underreporting of the full symptom severity.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified. Chief complaint: Acute bowel obstruction symptoms, including inability to pass gas or stool, abdominal pain and distension, vomiting. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing episodes of hard, pellet-like stools, occurring approximately once or twice weekly, with irregular bowel patterns. During current episodes, the patient reports complete inability to pass stool or gas, significant distension, and vomiting. Due to communication hesitancy, the baseline severity of constipation and prior episodes are likely more severe than described, with possible multiple episodes of impaction or partial obstruction that are underreported. The current episode appears to be an exacerbation of chronic constipation, with emotional factors potentially amplifying perceived severity. Associated symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension; confidence in these symptoms as reported is high, but their full extent may be underappreciated due to patient minimization. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Current symptoms of inability to pass stool, vomiting, abdominal distension. - Medium confidence: Patient\u2019s description of bowel habits as \u201cirregular\u201d and \u201chard\u201d stools; these are likely more severe than reported. - Low confidence: Exact frequency and severity of prior episodes, true baseline bowel patterns, and total episodes of impaction are uncertain due to communication biases. - Missing information: Detailed history of prior bowel habits, frequency of complete impaction episodes, associated symptoms like pain or nausea during other episodes, and previous management strategies.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult presenting with signs consistent with bowel obstruction, including inability to pass gas or stool, abdominal distension, pain, and vomiting. Their baseline bowel habits are likely characterized by irregular, hard, pellet-like stools occurring more frequently than the reported once or twice weekly, with an underlying pattern of chronic severe constipation and episodic impaction. The current episode appears to be an exacerbation of a longstanding pattern, though the full extent and severity are probably underreported due to emotional discomfort and minimization. Further detailed history and objective assessment are indicated to clarify the true severity of their bowel dysfunction.",
