The symptoms started after he took a pill given by a friend, which looked like a prescription pill, and after drinking alcohol at the festival.\nAssociated Symptoms: confusion, dizziness, sweating all over, difficulty walking straight, blurred vision, slurred speech, facial drooping or asymmetry.\nPertinent Negatives: The patient does not report other symptoms or negatives beyond those described.\nMissing Information: Details on the exact time of onset beyond \"a few hours,\" symptom progression over time, severity or intensity of symptoms, factors that improve or worsen symptoms, prior medical history, previous episodes, medication use beyond the implicated pill and alcohol, social history outside festival attendance, family medical history, presence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight changes, and findings from physical examination are not discussed in this conversation.",
