Also, can you tell me about your occupational history, any recent exposures to toxins or chemicals, and your dietary habits, especially regarding vitamin intake?\\nPATIENT: Umm, no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any autoimmune stuff or thyroid issues before. I don\u2019t remember ever having like, sudden weakness or weird numbness that came and went, and my vision\u2019s always been okay, I think.

    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019ve just been, you know, feeling like my hands and feet are not really working right anymore, and it\u2019s been getting worse over the years. Sometimes I trip or drop things without warning, and I\u2019m really worried about that. It\u2019s pretty frustrating and a little scary.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how these symptoms have been changing over time, and whether you've noticed any other issues like stiffness, numbness, balance problems, or changes in your thinking or mood?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, it\u2019s been kind of a slow thing, I guess. Some days I feel more numb or tingly, and my hands and feet get more unsteady. I don\u2019t really notice changes in my thinking or mood much, but sometimes I feel kind of down or frustrated, especially when I can\u2019t do things like I used to. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, everything\u2019s been a bit weird or harder lately.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how these symptoms affect your daily activities, such as walking, dressing, or other tasks, and whether there are specific situations or times of day when they tend to worsen or improve?\\nPATIENT: Uh, well, walking has become harder, especially when I try to go for a walk or stand for a while. Sometimes I stumble or feel really unsteady, and it gets worse if I\u2019ve been on my feet a lot. Dressing is tricky too, especially buttoning clothes or just using my hands\u2014my fingers feel numb and weak. It seems worse in the evenings, or when I've been active; I don't know exactly why, but it's like everything just gets a bit more sluggish and uncomfortable.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me how your symptoms have affected your daily routine, activities, and your overall well-being, and if you've noticed anything that seems to trigger or improve these issues?\\nPATIENT: Well, um, it\u2019s made everyday things kinda tricky, like even just holding stuff or walking. Sometimes I trip or drop things without meaning to, and I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse\u2014I just notice it\u2019s gotten more noticeable over time. It\u2019s kind of frustrating and makes me feel a little worried I\u2019ll keep getting worse.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your vision, such as blurring, eye pain, double vision, or any episodes of visual loss?\\nPATIENT: Hmm, I guess I haven't really noticed anything clear like double vision or blurred vision, but sometimes I feel a little blurry in the corner of my eye, and I haven't had any pain or anything that sticks out. It's all kind of confusing to tell.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any muscle weakness in specific areas, or difficulty with speech or swallowing? Also, do you experience any problems with your bowel or bladder control, or episodes of dizziness or fainting?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I guess my muscles feel weak especially in my hands and feet, but I haven\u2019t really noticed anything with speaking or swallowing. I do sometimes feel a bit dizzy or like I might faint, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related or just me feeling lightheaded. I haven\u2019t had any control issues with my bathroom, though.\\nDOCTOR: Do you have any past medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases like lupus or thyroid problems?
