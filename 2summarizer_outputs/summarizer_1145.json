I\\u2019m so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient is openly expressive, providing detailed and emotionally charged descriptions, emphasizing severity without reluctance or concealment. - Bias detected: Amplification bias primarily driven by emotional distress and anxiety, leading to an exaggerated perception of symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium to high, given the thoroughness and coherence of his narrative, tempered by emotional amplification. - Reasoning: His detailed, emotive language points toward genuine distress; however, emotional factors may inflate perceived urgency.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Specific systemic features such as fever intensity, weight loss, or other associated systemic signs may be understated or unreported, possibly due to overwhelm or focus on pain and fatigue. - Withheld information: Exposure history or immune compromise factors may be underreported if he\u2019s embarrassed or fearful, especially if related to behaviors or conditions he perceives as shameful. - Amplified concerns: Fear of a serious illness like cancer or leukemia could be exaggerated by his anxiety, making him appear more urgent than the objective clinical evidence suggests. - Temporal distortions: No clear evidence of timeline distortion, but his emphasis on rapid worsening indicates he perceives an urgent and aggressive progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves a patient experiencing severe, rapidly worsening systemic symptoms\u2014persistent joint pain, high fevers or night sweats, profound fatigue\u2014consistent with a serious underlying condition such as leukemia. Emotional distress is heightening his perception of severity, but the core symptoms are legitimate. There may be additional systemic signs or exposure risks unspoken, which should be explored.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any weight loss, persistent fevers, or night sweats?\" / \"Have you been exposed to anyone sick or any recent infections?\" / \"Do you have any other symptoms like swollen lymph nodes, easy bruising, or bleeding?\" (To uncover systemic features and exposure risks) - Approach strategy: Ask with empathy, acknowledging his distress, e.g., \"I can see you're very worried, and your symptoms sound very severe. Let's go through all the details together so we can understand exactly what's happening.\" This reduces anxiety and encourages honest sharing. - Priority order: Start with systemic and exposure questions to gather missing critical information, then validate and clarify symptom details to get an accurate clinical picture and assess urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a detailed but emotionally charged account of worsening joint pain, night sweats, and fatigue. Communication analysis indicates that the patient is expressive and may overemphasize symptom severity due to distress and anxiety, which could inflate perceived urgency. While the core symptoms\u2014joint pain, night sweats, and fatigue\u2014are likely genuine, other systemic signs such as fever intensity, weight loss, or additional systemic features are probably underreported or minimized. There is a possibility of withholding information related to exposures, immune status, or other systemic symptoms. The timeline suggests rapid symptom worsening, which aligns with a serious underlying condition, but the subjective severity should be interpreted cautiously. More detailed probing is necessary to confirm systemic signs, exposure history, and other associated features to obtain an accurate clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified.  Chief complaint: Reported worsening joint pain, night sweats, and fatigue considered severe by the patient, but actual severity may be less extreme.  Present illness: The patient reports that joint pain has been increasing in intensity, described as sharp and constant. Night sweats occur even in cool environments. Fatigue has become profound, impairing daily function. These symptoms have been progressing rapidly over a short period. Systemic features such as fever, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy are not explicitly reported but should be assessed, as they are commonly associated with such presentations. The patient's emotional distress may lead to overreporting of symptom severity, though the symptoms described are consistent with a serious underlying process. There may be additional symptoms or systemic signs not yet disclosed.  Associated symptoms: No other symptoms explicitly reported; potential for unreported systemic features such as fever, lymphadenopathy, bleeding, or infection-related symptoms.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Joint pain, night sweats, fatigue are present and real. - Medium confidence: Severity and urgency may be overestimated by the patient due to emotional distress. - Low confidence: Exact systemic features such as fever severity, weight loss, or additional signs are not confirmed and require further inquiry. - Missing information: Detailed systemic review, exposure history, presence of lymphadenopathy, fever, bleeding, weight changes, and other systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

It\\u2019s messing with my head, and I keep thinking it\\u2019s something really serious.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nPatient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with high emotional intensity, emphasizing severity and impact, with detailed and expressive descriptions. He appears openly willing to share but is influenced by distress. - Bias detected: Amplification bias due to anxiety and emotional distress, leading to exaggerated perception of severity and concern about serious illness. - Confidence level: Medium; the factual reporting appears credible, but emotional amplification significantly skews perceived severity. - Reasoning: The highly charged language and focus on emotional impact point toward amplification bias, with no evidence of minimization or withholding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may be underreporting subtle physical signs such as lymph node swelling, mild systemic symptoms, or minor physical findings that are less emotionally salient. - Withheld information: Less obvious symptoms that may be embarrassing or shameful are unlikely, but he might not be fully aware of or disclose associated warnings like weight loss or bleeding. - Amplified concerns: The fear of \"something serious\" and descriptors like \"wasting away\" suggest he is inflating his worry based on emotional distress, possibly overestimating the danger. - Temporal distortions: The timeline seems straightforward, but emotional distress might make him perceive symptoms as worsening rapidly, possibly overestimating the progression speed.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased view suggests: - The eye symptoms (redness, swelling, tearing) started about 2 days ago following recent activity but are likely mild, perhaps related to trauma or minor irritation. - Systemic symptoms such as sweating, fatigue, and malaise may be mild or transient; they could be partly due to emotional stress. - Physical findings may include minor eye swelling, conjunctival redness, and mild joint discomfort, not necessarily severe or rapidly progressing. - Concerns about the severity are amplified by anxiety; physical findings are probably less dramatic than described. - Overall, he is experiencing mild to moderate ocular irritation and systemic symptoms that are likely not as alarming as his language suggests, but emotional distress heightens his perception of severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any lumps or swelling in your neck or other areas?\" to identify hidden physical signs. \"Have you experienced any bleeding, weight loss, or persistent fevers?\" for systemic signs. \"How are your symptoms today compared to when they first started?\" to assess progression. \"Are there specific worries or fears about what might be causing your symptoms?\" to address anxiety. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic and calm language, validate feelings, and gently guide him to focus on objective signs. Explore fears without judgment, encouraging balanced perception. - Priority order: First, clarify physical findings and check for hidden symptoms; second, explore emotional state and health fears; third, review symptom timeline and severity to gauge accuracy and emotional impact.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's high emotional intensity and focus on severity suggest that he may be overestimating the severity of his symptoms, and his descriptions could be amplified by distress. While he reports intense joint pain, systemic symptoms like sweating and malaise, and fears of serious illness, these may not correspond to the actual physical findings. Objective signs are likely milder; his eye symptoms probably include conjunctival redness and mild swelling, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and sweating may be mild or transient. Communication biases indicate he might be underreporting subtle physical signs or other systemic symptoms like weight loss or lymphadenopathy. His timeline suggests symptoms began approximately 2 days ago following activity, but emotional distress might influence his perception of progression. Additional probing into hidden physical signs and systemic symptoms is necessary. Confirming physical findings and exploring emotional state are priorities for accurate assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: unspecified, likely adult based on presentation and language.  Chief complaint: ocular irritation (redness, swelling, tearing) and systemic discomfort, with exaggerated perceived severity.  Present illness: The patient reports the onset of eye redness, swelling, and tearing approximately 2 days prior, following recent activity. He also reports systemic symptoms including persistent sweating, fatigue, and malaise, which he describes as worsening and significantly impacting daily function. These descriptions are influenced by emotional distress, likely inflating perceived severity. Objective signs are probably mild conjunctival redness, slight eyelid swelling, and minimal joint discomfort; systemic signs such as fever or lymphadenopathy are not explicitly reported but should be assessed. The timeline suggests rapid symptom development, but emotional amplification may create an impression of rapid worsening. Likely symptom severity is moderate; actual physical signs are probably less dramatic than described, though he may be experiencing discomfort that is impactful to him. Minor physical findings might include conjunctivitis signs and mild discomfort, with systemic symptoms possibly being mild or transient.  Associated symptoms: Possible mild joint discomfort, conjunctival irritation, and subjective fatigue; confidence in systemic symptoms is medium due to communication bias; physical findings likely less severe.  CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The onset timeframe (~2 days ago), ocular symptoms (redness, swelling, tearing), and recent activity as a precipitant. - Medium confidence: Systemic symptoms (sweating, fatigue, malaise) and their severity, which may be exaggerated due to distress. - Low confidence: The true severity of systemic signs and physical findings, which are likely subtler than patient reports. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, more detailed systemic assessment (lymph nodes, fever, weight loss), and clarification of symptoms' progression and impact.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult presenting with ocular irritation characterized by redness, swelling, and tearing that began approximately two days prior, likely following recent activity. Physical signs are probably mild, including conjunctival redness and slight eyelid swelling, without evidence of severe ocular or systemic pathology. The patient also reports systemic symptoms such as sweating, fatigue, and malaise, which are likely mild and may be exaggerated due to emotional distress. Physical examination and further assessment are necessary to confirm signs and evaluate for hidden systemic or physical findings. Communication biases suggest that the patient's perception of symptom severity may be inflated, emphasizing the need for objective evaluation.",

Physical signs are probably mild, including conjunctival redness and slight eyelid swelling, without evidence of severe ocular or systemic pathology. The patient also reports systemic symptoms such as sweating, fatigue, and malaise, which are likely mild and may be exaggerated due to emotional distress. Physical examination and further assessment are necessary to confirm signs and evaluate for hidden systemic or physical findings. Communication biases suggest that the patient's perception of symptom severity may be inflated, emphasizing the need for objective evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides minimal, vague descriptions of eye symptoms, using soft descriptors and limiting elaboration, which suggests underreporting. His responses are brief and lack emotional content. - Bias detected: Minimizaton bias is affecting his reporting, likely leading to an underestimation of ocular symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium. While there's clear evidence of minimization, some symptoms are acknowledged, but the true extent remains uncertain. - Reasoning: The cautious language, vague details, and lack of elaboration imply he might be concealing the actual severity of his eye issues, perhaps due to emotional factors or a tendency to downplay symptoms.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More intense dryness, irritation, discomfort, or visual disturbance than he reports, since his descriptions are mild and non-specific. - Withheld information: Possible discomfort, pain, or discharge he avoids mentioning, likely due to embarrassment, fear, or perception that these are not significant. - Amplified concerns: Systemic symptoms\u2014fever, fatigue, malaise\u2014are more prominent in his mind and may overshadow ocular symptoms; he might be overemphasizing systemic issues while neglecting or downplaying ocular discomfort. - Temporal distortions: His recent onset may be inaccurate; ocular symptoms could have begun earlier or progressed insidiously, which he doesn't perceive as significant or relevant.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: - The patient reports recent onset (about two days) of conjunctival redness, slight eyelid swelling, and tearing, possibly more pronounced than described. - Physical signs may include mild conjunctival injection, eyelid edema, and dry conjunctiva, but no severe pain or discharge noted. - Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and fatigue are present or probable, but their true severity may be higher. - The actual ocular discomfort may be more significant, with possible visual fatigue or mild pain not fully disclosed. - Systemically, the patient's malaise suggests underlying illness, possibly infectious or inflammatory, which might be contributing to ocular findings but is underemphasized by the patient.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how your eyes feel\u2014are you experiencing pain, burning, or discharge?\" (to clarify true severity) - \"Have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurriness or difficulty focusing?\" (to detect missed symptoms) - \"Is the dryness or redness worsening, or does anything make it feel worse?\" (to assess progression) - \"Are there other symptoms like light sensitivity or eye discharge?\" (to identify additional signs) - \"How are your systemic symptoms\u2014fever, sweating, fatigue\u2014doing compared to before?\" (to gauge underlying illness severity) - Approach strategy: - Ask questions gently and non-judgmentally, emphasizing that all symptoms are important and safe to share. - Encourage detailed descriptions (\"Tell me more about how your eyes feel\") rather than yes/no answers. - Use open-ended questions to facilitate elaboration. - Priority order: - First, clarify ocular symptoms with detailed questions to uncover hidden severity. - Next, explore systemic symptoms to understand the broader picture. - Finally, assess emotional state and concerns, which might influence reporting habits.",
    "output": "THINKING: Analyzing the patient's communication patterns reveals that he provides vague and minimal descriptions of his ocular symptoms, likely underreporting severity and discomfort. His brief responses and mild descriptors suggest minimization bias, meaning his ocular symptoms might be more significant than he admits. Additionally, his emphasis on systemic symptoms such as sweating, fatigue, and malaise could overshadow or distract from ocular complaints. There is a possibility that he is withholding details about pain, discharge, or visual changes, which he perceives as less important or possibly embarrassing. Consequently, objective findings should consider that ocular irritation could be more severe, with signs like conjunctival injection or eyelid swelling potentially being more prominent than reported. Systemic symptoms may be mild or more intense but are underemphasized in his reporting. Confirmation through physical exam and further inquiry is necessary to delineate true symptom severity.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult presenting with recent-onset ocular symptoms approximately two days prior, including conjunctival redness, eyelid swelling, and tearing, which may be more severe than patient reports suggest. Physical assessment may reveal mild conjunctival injection, slight eyelid edema, and dry conjunctiva, but the patient denies significant pain, discharge, or visual disturbances. Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and fatigue are reported and may be present to a greater extent than acknowledged, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's communication style suggests that ocular discomfort and systemic illness could be underappreciated or underreported, and further detailed examination and questioning are warranted to accurately assess symptom severity and systemic involvement.",

Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and fatigue are reported and may be present to a greater extent than acknowledged, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's communication style suggests that ocular discomfort and systemic illness could be underappreciated or underreported, and further detailed examination and questioning are warranted to accurately assess symptom severity and systemic involvement.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient minimizes ocular symptoms by describing them as \"tired and dry\" with no associated issues, responses are brief and refrain from elaborating unless prompted, while systemic symptoms are described in intense, emotional terms, indicating focus and concern. - Bias detected: Primarily minimization bias affecting ocular symptom reporting, with some potential withholding of minor symptoms, but no clear amplification. - Confidence level: Medium; systemic symptom data are likely reliable, but ocular complaints are underreported. - Reasoning: The limited elaboration on eye symptoms and the focus on systemic concerns suggest the patient perceives eye issues as insignificant relative to serious systemic illness, leading to underreporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild ocular discomfort, slight eyelid swelling, or early conjunctivitis signs that the patient perceives as trivial. - Withheld information: Discharge, crusting, visual disturbances, or minor pain that the patient doesn't deem significant enough to mention unless asked directly. - Amplified concerns: The systemic symptoms are likely emphasized accurately, but overemphasis might be an emotional response rather than clinical severity. - Temporal distortions: The patient may have experienced minor eye symptoms earlier or more prominently, but current reporting suppresses this, possibly due to their perceived insignificance.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would likely describe the ocular issues as more clinically significant than the patient initially presents. The ocular findings (reddness, eyelid swelling, tearing) could indicate conjunctivitis or early inflammatory processes, with possible mild discharge or irritation that the patient trivializes. Systemic symptoms such as fevers, joint pain, and fatigue appear genuine and are probably more severe than initially downplayed. The timeline suggests recent onset, but minor ocular symptoms might have been earlier and subtly more noticeable. The true clinical picture is probably that of a conjunctivitis or periocular inflammation concurrent with systemic infection or inflammatory syndrome, with the patient underreporting minor ocular discomfort.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any new or unusual eye sensations like itching, burning, or light sensitivity?\" or \"Is there any mild discharge or crusting, perhaps in the mornings?\" These questions gently expand on overlooked symptoms. - Approach strategy: Use open-ended questions with empathy, emphasizing that even minor symptoms matter and that the goal is to ensure nothing is missed. - Priority order: Start by confirming absence of discharge or pain to establish trust, then gently inquire about mild visual changes or irritation, and finally, revisit ocular symptoms periodically as systemic concerns might overshadow ongoing issues.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient tends to minimize ocular symptoms, describing them as mild tiredness and dryness with no discharge or visual changes, which may underestimate the severity of conjunctival or ocular surface inflammation. Systemic symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, and fatigue are expressed with emotional intensity and appear to be more prominent, suggesting these are likely accurate or possibly exaggerated due to distress. The communication pattern indicates that minor ocular issues are underreported, and the patient may be withholding or minimizing slight discomforts or early signs like itchiness or mild discharge. Confidence in the systemic symptom report is higher than in the ocular complaints, which are probably more severe than reported.

Systemic symptoms\u2014including fevers, night sweats, and fatigue\u2014are reported as severe and are likely more significant than the ocular complaints suggest. The timeline indicates that ocular symptoms began approximately two days prior but may have been subtly more noticeable earlier on. Overall, clinical suspicion includes conjunctivitis or early periocular inflammation concurrent with systemic inflammatory or infectious processes. Additional questioning is necessary to identify any subtle ocular signs such as mild discharge or light sensitivity, which the patient has not reported but may be present.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses dismissive language and provides brief responses, indicating an inclination to minimize ocular symptoms. They wait for direct prompts rather than spontaneously elaborating, suggesting perceived irrelevance or low concern about eye issues. - Bias detected: Primariliy minimization bias affecting ocular symptom reporting. The patient acknowledges these symptoms but downplays their significance, likely to focus attention on systemic illnesses perceived as more serious. - Confidence level: Medium. While systemic symptoms seem accurately conveyed, ocular details are potentially underreported and need further exploration. - Reasoning: The patient's responses show consistent minimization language and reserved responses to eye-specific questions. Since they focus on systemic distress with strong emotional descriptors, minor ocular signs might be underestimated or omitted, affecting comprehensive assessment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild eye discomfort, light sensitivity, early conjunctival redness, or subtle discharge\u2014symptoms that might seem trivial but are clinically relevant. - Withheld information: Possible early signs of ocular inflammation or mild conjunctivitis that the patient perceives as insignificant or unworthy of mention. - Amplified concerns: Systemic symptoms, which are portrayed as severe, are likely genuine given their tone, but ocular complaints are likely less intense than implied. - Temporal distortions: The patient might have experienced minor ocular changes earlier, which resolved or remained unnoticed, hence underemphasized in current reporting.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased picture suggests that the patient likely has mild conjunctivitis or periocular inflammation, with early signs like mild redness or dryness potentially more noticeable than they acknowledge. Systemic symptoms are genuinely severe and likely represent active systemic inflammatory or infectious processes. The ocular symptoms may have begun subtly days earlier and are more significant than the patient indicates, though currently underreported.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you noticed any light sensitivity, mild eye redness, or a feeling of grit or foreign body in your eyes?\" to detect subtle signs; \"Do you wake up with crusted eyelids or sticky discharge?\" to assess early conjunctivitis; \"Have you experienced any mild eye discomfort or sensitivity to bright light?\" to capture overlooked symptoms. - Approach strategy: Ask these questions gently, emphasizing curiosity rather than skepticism, e.g., \"Many people notice small changes in their eyes that they might not think are important\u2014are there any minor feelings or sensations in your eyes that you've overlooked?\" - Priority order: Start with open-ended questions about general eye sensations, then proceed to specific queries about redness, discharge, and light sensitivity\u2014this encourages the patient to recall and report subtle symptoms that they might dismiss initially.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's responses indicate a pattern of minimization regarding ocular symptoms, with brief and dismissive descriptions such as \"just sometimes dry and tired\" and no mention of eyelid crusting, redness, or light sensitivity despite direct questioning. These communication patterns suggest that ocular symptoms may be more subtle or bothersome than the patient perceives or is willing to report fully. Conversely, the systemic symptoms\u2014including fevers, night sweats, and fatigue\u2014are described with more emotional emphasis, implying these are the primary concern and are more accurately conveyed. Given this, it's likely that minor ocular signs like mild conjunctival injection, slight dryness, or early conjunctivitis are present but underreported. The timeline suggests ocular symptoms began a few days prior, but they might have been noticed earlier in a less significant fashion. The systemic presentation points toward an active inflammatory or infectious process, potentially contributing to or coinciding with subtle ocular inflammation. Further probing with gentle, specific questions could uncover additional ocular signs that are currently minimized or unperceived.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Ocular discomfort, primarily eye tiredness and dryness, likely more pronounced than reported. Present illness: The patient reports recent onset of eye tiredness and dryness, but denies noticeable discharge, crusting, or visual changes. Systemic symptoms\u2014fever, night sweats, and significant fatigue\u2014are prominent and persistent, suggesting an active systemic process. Timeline indicates ocular symptoms began approximately two days ago; however, subtle signs such as mild conjunctival redness or eyelid dryness may have been present earlier but are underappreciated. Likely ocular findings include mild conjunctival injection and eyelid dryness, with possible early conjunctivitis. These ocular symptoms are probably more significant than the patient reports, potentially representing early periocular inflammation. Associated symptoms with moderate confidence include systemic inflammatory signs; ocular signs are suspected to be mild and underdetected.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue) are accurately conveyed. - Medium confidence: Ocular symptoms\u2014eye tiredness and dryness\u2014may be more severe or more noticeable than reported. - Low confidence: Severity and specific ocular signs (redness, discharge, light sensitivity) are likely underreported due to patient minimization. - Missing information: Detailed ocular examination findings, subtle signs of conjunctival or eyelid inflammation, presence of early conjunctivitis, and any mild discharge or light sensitivity require further assessment.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult presenting with systemic symptoms including fever, night sweats, and fatigue that are likely indicative of an active inflammatory or infectious process. Ocular complaints involve recent-onset eye tiredness and dryness, which are probably more significant than reported. Objective signs may include mild conjunctival injection and eyelid dryness, suggestive of early conjunctivitis or periocular inflammation. The patient\u2019s communication pattern suggests underreporting of ocular signs; thus, subtle symptoms such as mild redness, light sensitivity, or discharge may be present but not perceived or mentioned. Further detailed ocular examination is recommended to identify any mild signs of ocular surface inflammation.",
