It just feels like things are getting a bit \"off\" down there.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any episodes of visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision, or past episodes of eye pain or loss of vision?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really had any problems with my eyes, like blurred or double vision or anything like that. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but I didn't think it was anything.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any weakness or increased reflexes in your arms or legs, or any signs of muscle stiffness or spasticity?\\nPATIENT: Umm, yeah, I think so? I mean, my legs do feel like they\u2019re a bit jumpy sometimes, and I\u2019ve noticed I get kind of stiff and maybe more reflexy than before? I don\u2019t really know what spasticity means, but \u2014 yeah, it\u2019s like my legs are not quite right anymore.\\nDOCTOR: Have your symptoms reliably worsened with physical activity or heat, and do you experience any new sensations like weakness or changes in sensation that we haven't discussed yet?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I think sometimes when I do stuff a lot or if it\u2019s kinda hot, it feels worse or I get more tired, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really new or just how I\u2019ve been feeling. I did notice maybe some new tingling or things feeling a bit different below my back, but I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s more than before.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms tend to get worse when you do a lot of activity, when it's hot outside, or at certain times of the day, like evenings?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know. Sometimes it feels worse when I\u2019ve been walking around or if it\u2019s hot outside, but other times it doesn\u2019t seem to change much. It\u2019s kind of all over the place, honestly.",
