But I can't tell if it\u2019s just in my head or really from that.\\nDOCTOR: Does she notice any specific positions or movements that seem to bring on her dizziness, such as lying down, turning over in bed, or tilting her head?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I guess sometimes when I turn my head quickly or just change positions in bed, I feel a little dizzy or unsteady. It\u2019s not all the time, but it happens enough that I notice it.\\nDOCTOR: Are you comfortable with starting some lifestyle modifications and possibly medication to help reduce the frequency of your episodes, and would you like to discuss the specific strategies and treatments that could be most helpful for you?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, I guess I can try some changes, but I\u2019m really not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do exactly. If there\u2019s some medicine or things I can do to help, I\u2019m willing to hear about it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your dizziness episodes are sometimes associated with headache, visual changes, or sensitivity to light and sound, which might support a migraine-related cause?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I do sometimes feel kinda weird in my head, like a strange kind of lightness or fuzziness, but I don\u2019t really get actual headaches or see anything weird, and I haven\u2019t noticed anything different with lights or sounds really. It\u2019s mostly just the dizziness and unsteadiness.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation restated consistent facts from previous entries, including triggers, symptoms, and history. No new clinical details or pertinent negatives have been introduced, and the patient's condition remains the same as previously summarized.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 27-year-old woman experiencing episodes of dizziness and unsteadiness lasting about 15 to 30 minutes, occurring a few times per week for several months. Her symptoms include wobbliness and imbalance, sometimes with nausea, and are triggered by stress, quick head movements, or being in busy visual environments. Between episodes, she feels normal. There is no recent history of head injury, ear infection, or illness before symptoms started. Movements such as turning her head quickly or changing positions in bed can precipitate episodes."
