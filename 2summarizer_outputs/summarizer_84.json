I\\u2019ve just been feeling more tired than usual too, and I was worried enough to come see you today.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, guarded language, providing general concern about swelling and tiredness but avoiding detailed descriptions of pain or progression. Her responses are organized but appear somewhat reserved, likely reflecting discomfort or reluctance to fully disclose severity. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias is present, evidenced by her non-specific descriptors (\"not really sharp,\" \"sometimes\") and cautious tone, suggesting she may be underreporting the true intensity or progression of symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium; while her concerns seem genuine, the vagueness and guarded responses indicate that key details might be understated or omitted. - Reasoning: The combination of non-specific language, hesitation to detail pain severity, and diffuse symptom reporting suggests she is minimizing or hesitating to fully expose the extent of her medical condition.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual pain could be more intense or frequent, and swelling more pronounced or rapidly worsening than she states. - Withheld information: She may be avoiding mention of other symptoms such as jaundice, unexplained weight loss, nausea, or systemic signs that would indicate seriousness. - Amplified concerns: Her worries about her health appear appropriate, but her cautious language means her true concern level may be underrepresented, or she might have unvoiced fears about underlying serious disease. - Temporal distortions: The timeline may be inaccurate or incomplete; worsening could be more rapid, or episodic aggravation may be hidden within vague timeframes, making her presentation appear less urgent than it is.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased picture likely involves a more significant and possibly rapidly progressing abdominal distension, with persistent or worsening pain, possibly indicating an underlying pathology such as liver disease, tumor, or fluid accumulation. Systemic symptoms like significant fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or other domain-specific signs might be present but are either underreported or undisclosed. Her guarded communication suggests the need for thorough, detailed inquiry and objective assessment to uncover the full severity of her condition.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you describe exactly how your pain feels\u2014does it come and go, or is it constant? How severe is it on a scale of 0 to 10?\" \"Has your swelling changed recently? Are you noticing any yellowing of skin or eyes? Have you experienced any nausea or unexplained weight loss?\" This will help clarify the true severity and identify associated symptoms. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions to encourage fuller disclosure, emphasizing that detailed information helps determine the best care, which can reduce her reluctance to share sensitive or distressing details. - Priority order: First, clarify pain characteristics and changes in swelling; second, inquire about systemic symptoms (jaundice, weight change, appetite); third, explore chronology and progression. This prioritization helps build the clinical picture step-by-step, reducing defensiveness and encouraging honesty.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates vague and guarded communication, which suggests she may underreport symptom severity or omit details. Her mention of abdominal swelling and fatigue is likely accurate but may underestimate the extent of swelling, pain, or systemic signs such as jaundice or weight loss. Her reluctance to detail pain intensity, duration, or progression indicates the possibility of more significant or worsening pathology. Therefore, objective facts should reflect clearly reported symptoms, while acknowledging that actual severity could be greater. Additional detailed questioning is necessary to uncover hidden or minimized features, especially systemic or constitutional symptoms. The clinical vignette should present a cautious but objective picture based on available data, emphasizing the potential for more severe issues underrepresented in the initial communication.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Increasing abdominal distension over several months, accompanied by general fatigue.  Present illness: The patient reports a progressive increase in abdominal size, describing it as swollen, and has experienced occasional dull discomfort in the upper right abdomen. She reports feeling more tired than usual. She denies specific details about pain severity, duration, or progression.  Likely symptoms/information: While the patient reports noticeable swelling and fatigue, she may be experiencing more severe or rapidly progressing distension, persistent pain, or systemic symptoms such as jaundice, nausea, or unintentional weight loss that she has not disclosed. Her guarded communication suggests the possibility of underreported severity or additional symptoms withheld.  Timeline: The swelling has reportedly been worsening over months; the accuracy of this timeline may be affected by her cautious reporting.  Associated symptoms: No explicit mention of jaundice, nausea, vomiting, or weight change; such symptoms are possibly present but not communicated.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports abdominal swelling and fatigue. - Medium confidence: The true extent of swelling and pain severity; the presence of systemic symptoms like jaundice or weight loss is uncertain but possible. - Low confidence: The actual progression rate and severity of symptoms; specific pain features. - Missing information: Detailed pain characterization, systemic symptoms (jaundice, nausea, weight loss), recent changes in swelling, and any episodic worsening.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with reports of increasing abdominal distension over several months and ongoing fatigue. She describes her abdomen as swollen and discomfort in the upper right area but provides limited detail on pain intensity, duration, or progression. Given her guarded communication, it is possible her abdominal swelling, pain, and systemic symptoms such as jaundice or weight loss may be more severe or experienced more acutely than indicated. Further detailed inquiry into pain characteristics, systemic signs, and the timeline of symptom progression is necessary to accurately assess the underlying condition.",

She describes her abdomen as swollen and discomfort in the upper right area but provides limited detail on pain intensity, duration, or progression. Given her guarded communication, it is possible her abdominal swelling, pain, and systemic symptoms such as jaundice or weight loss may be more severe or experienced more acutely than indicated. Further detailed inquiry into pain characteristics, systemic signs, and the timeline of symptom progression is necessary to accurately assess the underlying condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Margaret utilizes vague, minimization language and demonstrates hesitancy, likely concealing the true extent of her symptoms and concerns. She avoids detailed disclosures unless prompted carefully. - Bias detected: Minimization and withholding. She downplays the severity of swelling and discomfort, possibly due to embarrassment or fear, while internally worried about serious underlying causes. - Confidence level: Medium. I believe she acknowledges some discomfort but is likely underestimating or concealing the full picture due to emotional or psychological barriers. - Reasoning: Her language choices and response style suggest she is intentionally or unconsciously minimizing her symptoms, stemming from emotional discomfort or concern about being perceived as overly worried or ashamed.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible more intense pain, systemic signs (such as jaundice, weight loss, fever), or rapid changes she is reluctant to describe. - Withheld information: Fears of cancer or severe organ pathology, embarrassment about potential diagnoses, or emotional distress behind her physical symptoms. - Amplified concerns: She is internally worried about \"what it might be,\" which could be more severe than she admits; her concern may be disproportionate to her reported findings. - Temporal distortions: Her timeline might be less linear; symptom progression may have accelerated recently or been more abrupt than indicated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the contemporary presentation likely involves significant abdominal swelling, perhaps associated with underlying pathology such as organomegaly, mass, or fluid accumulation, and systemic features she is not articulating. Her emotional responses suggest underlying anxiety or shame, potentially hindering full disclosure. The physical findings could be more severe or complex than her responses indicate, warranting thorough exploration for systemic symptoms, pain severity, and emotional impact.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: Ask about systemic symptoms such as jaundice, unexplained weight loss, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or worsening fatigue; also inquire about any recent fevers or chills. Frame these sensitively, emphasizing concern for her well-being. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to reassure her about emotional safety\u2014e.g., \"Sometimes it helps to share all concerns, even if they seem frightening. You're not alone in feeling worried.\" To reduce shame or embarrassment. - Priority order: First, explore physical symptoms comprehensively to assess severity and systemic involvement, then gently address emotional concerns to understand her fears and emotional state. This ensures both physical and psychological aspects are sufficiently evaluated.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates hesitant communication, using vague language and minimizing her symptoms, which suggests she may be concealing the true severity or additional symptoms. Her description of progressive abdominal swelling and a dull upper right quadrant ache indicates tangible physical signs, but her emphasis on \"swollen\" and inability to reduce size likely underestimates potential severity, such as significant organ enlargement, fluid accumulation, or mass effect. She also mentions increased fatigue, which may be systemic in nature. Given her guarded reporting, systemic features such as jaundice, weight loss, or more intense pain could be present but not disclosed. The timeline of symptom progression appears more rapid or severe than her verbal account suggests, highlighting the need for thorough physical and systemic assessment to uncover hidden or minimized findings.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female.  Chief complaint: Increase in abdominal size over several months, perceived as persistent swelling that is difficult to reduce.  Present illness: The patient reports gradual abdominal distension over a few months, describing the abdomen as swollen and feeling heavy, with occasional dull ache in the upper right side. She also reports increased fatigue. While these symptoms are directly described, her language indicates potential underreporting of severity, possible systemic signs, or additional symptoms. The progression may be more abrupt or severe than communicated. She does not specify associated symptoms such as jaundice, fever, weight loss, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, but these need to be systematically explored given her communication style.  Associated symptoms: Fatigue likely systemic; other systemic symptoms such as jaundice, weight loss, or systemic illness are not confirmed but should be assessed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: There is objective evidence of abdominal swelling and reported discomfort. - Medium confidence: Fatigue is likely present but subjective; symptom severity may be understated. - Low confidence: The true extent of systemic involvement or additional symptoms is uncertain; patient may be withholding or minimizing certain signs. - Missing information: Details on pain intensity and character, associated systemic symptoms, rapidity of swelling progression, and emotional or psychological factors influencing reporting.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a history of gradually increasing abdominal distension over several months, described as persistent swelling with a sensation of heaviness and occasional dull ache in the upper right abdomen. She reports feeling more fatigued than usual. Objective examination and further evaluation are necessary to assess for underlying causes such as organomegaly, intra-abdominal mass, or fluid accumulation, as her reported symptoms may underestimate the severity of her condition. Systematic inquiry into potential systemic signs, including jaundice, weight loss, fever, and changes in bowel habits, is recommended to identify additional or concealed symptoms requiring investigation.",

Her concise, hesitant responses suggest discomfort discussing deeper fears or distress. - Bias detected: Symptom minimization and emotional guardedness bias her report, leading to an understatement of symptom severity and emotional distress. - Confidence level: Medium, as her responses show consistent patterns of caution and minimization but do not entirely obscure her emotional state or symptom severity. - Reasoning: These patterns point to a tendency to suppress or underreport concerns due to embarrassment, fear, or shame, affecting the reliability of her disclosures.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She is likely experiencing more intense discomfort, additional systemic symptoms (e.g., pain, weight loss, jaundice), or distress she is hesitant to reveal openly. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed about her symptoms or fears, possibly concealing aspects of her emotional impact or severity of underlying illness. - Amplified concerns: Her internal anxiety about \"something dangerous\" might be more severe than expressed, and her worry could be escalating internally despite outward minimization. - Temporal distortions: She appears consistent in timeline but may be experiencing increasing distress that isn't fully expressed, possibly leading to underestimation of urgency.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased picture likely includes significant abdominal swelling possibly due to organ enlargement, fluid accumulation, or intra-abdominal a mass, with associated systemic signs like fatigue. Her emotional distress and anxiety are probably more profound, with some substantial symptoms or fears hidden behind superficial language. Her increasing symptom timeline suggests progressive pathology, warranting thorough investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any yellowing of your skin or eyes, or changes in your stool or urine?\" (to assess for jaundice or liver issues) - \"Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, nausea, or vomiting?\" (to evaluate systemic impact) - \"Do you feel any other types of pain, sharp or persistent?\" (to gauge severity and pain profile) - \"How has your daily life been affected? Are there things you've stopped doing because of your symptoms?\" (to explore emotional and functional impact) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, open-ended questions emphasizing curiosity rather than judgment, allowing her to share fears comfortably. - Normalize concerns, e.g., \"Many people worry when they notice changes like this; can you tell me more about what you\u2019re feeling emotionally?\" - Priority order: - First, clarify physical symptoms thoroughly to identify any serious systemic signs. - Follow with emotional state, gently encouraging her to express worries she might be withholding. - Then, explore how symptoms impact her daily life to assess psychological burden.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication style exhibits minimization and guarded responses, which suggests her subjective reports may understate the true severity or extent of her symptoms. She describes her abdominal swelling as \"just... swollen\" and \"kind of heavy,\" with feelings of worry but without elaboration.

Her communication pattern suggests she may be experiencing and withholding more severe or concerning symptoms, underscoring the importance of detailed, empathetic evaluation to determine the true clinical status.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides vague, guarded responses, uses hedging language, and appears hesitant to fully disclose her symptoms. Her responses suggest underlying anxiety or embarrassment that influences her communication style. - Bias detected: The dominant bias is *minimization and withholding*, with possible underreporting of severity or associated symptoms due to discomfort or fear. - Confidence level: Medium. While her responses indicate guardedness, the consistency and cautious wording suggest true concern that she is hesitant to fully express. - Reasoning: Her vagueness, tendency to avoid specific details, and the use of mild or non-committal language support the interpretation of intentional or subconscious minimization and withholding, aiming to avoid distress or judgment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Potentially more severe swelling, early signs of systemic illness such as jaundice or weight loss, or subtle symptoms like early satiety, fatigue, or mild pain that she finds shameful or frightening to share. - Withheld information: Details about family history, lifestyle factors, or emotional distress related to her body or health concerns that she is uncomfortable revealing openly. - Amplified concerns: She may be over-focusing on the worst-case scenario (e.g., fearing cancer or organ failure) while underreporting actual severity, which amplifies her anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The timeline might be more rapid or prolonged than she perceives or admits, affecting clinical interpretation.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the unbiased picture possibly reveals a gradually enlarging abdominal mass or fluid collection, with associated but underreported symptoms such as mild systemic signs or subtle discomfort. Her guarded responses could hide evidence of more advanced pathology, such as organ enlargement, intra-abdominal fluid, or early malignancy. The true severity may be underestimated, and associated symptoms may be more significant than perceived, necessitating careful investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any changes in your skin color, like yellowing?\" to clarify jaundice. - \"Do you feel full quickly or have you lost weight?\" to assess systemic effects. - \"Are there any other symptoms, like fever, chills, or night sweats?\" to identify systemic illness. - \"Can you tell me more about any recent changes in your energy or appetite?\" to explore fatigue or weight loss. - Approach strategy: - Use a gentle, empathetic tone to reduce shame or anxiety. - Normalize her feelings and reassure her that honesty helps find the best care. - Ask open-ended questions first, then proceed with specific probing as trust develops. - Priority order: 1. Symptoms indicating systemic illness (jaundice, weight loss). 2. Specific characteristics of the swelling (size, growth rate, pain). 3. Emotional impact and fears to address anxiety and build trust.  This structured approach helps minimize communication biases and ensures a more accurate clinical understanding.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with subjective complaints of persistent abdominal swelling and dull upper right quadrant ache over several months, along with increased fatigue. Her communication is guarded, with vague descriptions and reluctance to elaborate, which suggests she may be minimizing the severity or withholding additional symptoms such as systemic signs or specific discomforts. Objective clinical signs are not yet established, but her guarded responses warrant suspicion that her condition could be more advanced or complex than she indicates. There is a possibility of organomegaly, intra-abdominal fluid, or a mass. She may also be underreporting symptoms like jaundice, weight loss, or systemic symptoms, which are important to assess further. The timeline appears gradual, but underlying severity could be underestimated. Additional probing is needed to uncover hidden symptoms or signs of systemic illness, and her communication pattern indicates a need for empathetic, detailed evaluation to obtain a clearer clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, unspecified age.  Chief complaint: Chronic abdominal distension, initially reported as gradually enlarging over several months.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing a persistent, centrally located abdominal swelling that has been increasing in size over several months. She describes the swelling as \"swollen\" and \"heavy,\" with occasional dull ache in the upper right abdomen, and increased fatigue. Based on communication biases, her reports may underestimate symptom severity or severity of underlying pathology. No reports of systemic symptoms such as jaundice, weight loss, nausea, or early satiety; however, these could be underreported or hidden. The swelling is described as stable, present most of the time, not associated with fluctuations.  Associated symptoms: No reported jaundice, nausea, or skin changes; fatigue is noted but may be disproportionate or underdisclosed. Other systemic or GI symptoms, such as weight loss or systemic illness signs, remain unconfirmed and require further assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s primary complaints of abdominal swelling and dull upper right quadrant ache are reliably established. - Medium confidence: Duration of swelling and associated fatigue are likely accurate but may be underreported in severity. - Low confidence: The absence of additional systemic symptoms or specific findings is uncertain due to guarded communication and possible withholding of information. - Missing information: Detailed physical examination, laboratory tests (including liver function, tumor markers), imaging studies (ultrasound, CT scan), and further probing of potential systemic or hidden symptoms are needed to clarify her condition.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a several-month history of persistent, centrally located abdominal swelling that is gradually increasing in size, accompanied by mild upper right quadrant discomfort and fatigue. Her guarded communication may mask more severe underlying pathology such as hepatomegaly, intra-abdominal fluid, or abdominal mass. Further diagnostic evaluation is necessary to determine the etiology, with attention to potential systemic signs that may have been underreported.",

Further diagnostic evaluation is necessary to determine the etiology, with attention to potential systemic signs that may have been underreported.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, hesitant language, providing minimal initial detail with gradual elaboration after prompting. She avoids confirming specific features like firmness or movement, indicating discomfort or uncertainty. Her responses contain hedging phrases (\"kind of,\" \"mostly,\" \"I think\") that suggest caution or reluctance to share detailed information. - Bias detected: Moderate **withholding** bias, with some **minimization** of symptom severity. Her cautious tone and vague descriptions likely lead to incomplete clinical data. - Confidence level: Medium. While her concern appears genuine, the guarded responses mean some key details remain obscured. - Reasoning: Based on her responses showing hesitance, indirect language, and reluctance to confirm specifics without prompting, it\u2019s clear she constrains the information she provides, which may hide more severe or complex features.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Potential pain, tenderness, or skin changes (e.g., jaundice, discoloration, bruising) may be understated; her statement that she hasn't noticed yellow skin or other signs doesn't exclude subtle or episodic changes. - Withheld information: Specific characteristics of the swelling (exact firmness, texture), episodic flare-ups, associated systemic symptoms like nausea, or changes in appetite may be unreported due to discomfort, fear, or uncertainty. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about not understanding the cause or severity may lead her to catastrophize internally, even if she doesn\u2019t express it openly; her emotional concern might be higher than indicated. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears consistent (\"a few months\"), but unreported intermittent episodes might be present, which she perceives as part of a steady progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Given her guarded communication, the objective picture might be more complex: - The swelling could be variable, with possible episodic increases or tenderness that she avoids mentioning. - There might be subclinical skin changes or systemic signs she has not reported, such as mild jaundice or discomfort. - The duration is likely accurate, but episodic features or fluctuations in symptoms could be unrecognized or unreported. - Her level of concern suggests that underlying distress might be more significant, warranting reassurance but also careful investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me exactly what the swelling feels like when you press on it? Does it feel hard, soft, or rubbery?\" (to clarify firmness and texture) * \"Have you noticed any changes in the skin over the swelling, such as yellow coloring, redness, or bruising?\" (to detect subtle signs) * \"Do you experience any pain or tenderness when pressed or during certain activities?\" (to assess pain or discomfort more precisely) * \"Have you noticed if the swelling varies in size or feels different at different times of the day or in different situations?\" (to explore episodic changes) * \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or feeling full quickly?\" (to uncover associated systemic signs) * \"Have you had any episodes of fever or noticed any skin rashes or itching?\" (additional systemic or dermatological clues)  - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language, express understanding of her discomfort, and emphasize the importance of full information for proper care. Reinforce that honesty helps in finding the best diagnosis and treatment. - Priority order: First, clarify the characteristics of the swelling (texture, movement, changes), then explore associated symptoms (pain, skin, systemic signs), followed by temporal patterns, to build a comprehensive, accurate picture while making her feel safe and understood.  # Short Answer",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits guarded communication with vague, hesitant responses, often hedging and avoiding specific details. This suggests possible minimization of symptom severity and withholding of certain symptoms such as tenderness, skin changes, or systemic signs. While she reports persistent, centrally located swelling primarily in the mid-upper abdomen over several months that is usually present and sometimes more noticeable, her responses imply the actual clinical presentation might be more severe or complex. There may be unreported or understated features like firmness, tenderness, episodic fluctuations, or additional systemic symptoms. Her concern about understanding the cause does not necessarily reflect the true severity, given her reserved communication style. Therefore, objective findings may include more pronounced or varied features than reported, with potential underlying pathology such as hepatomegaly, intra-abdominal fluid, or mass effect that requires further evaluation. Key areas needing additional probing include the exact texture, firmness, and mobility of the swelling, as well as systemic and dermatological signs.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Gradually enlarging upper abdominal swelling over several months, with accompanying fatigue.  Present illness: The patient reports a persistent, centrally located abdominal swelling in the upper middle region that has been increasing gradually in size. She describes the swelling as often present, sometimes more noticeable, with a general feeling of heaviness and mild discomfort. She denies associated nausea, vomiting, jaundice, skin discoloration, or bruising. She reports the swelling as firm to touch, though she is uncertain about this. Her communication suggests possible underreporting of associated pain, tenderness, or skin changes, which could indicate more significant underlying pathology. The timeline is approximately several months, but episodic or fluctuant features of the swelling cannot be ruled out due to her guarded responses.  Associated symptoms: Fatigue is reported; no reported systemic signs like fever, skin rashes, or itching, though these may be understated or unrecognized.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Duration and location of the swelling, absence of reported skin or systemic signs. - Medium confidence: Descriptions of swelling firmness, and presence of tenderness or episodic changes, which are susceptible to bias. - Low confidence: The true extent of underlying pathology due to communication reluctance and possible symptom minimization. - Missing information: Precise characteristics of the swelling (firmness, mobility), presence of tenderness or systemic signs, episodic variations, and potential additional symptoms such as pain, skin discoloration, or neurological complaints.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a several-month history of persistent, centrally located abdominal swelling predominantly in the upper middle region of the abdomen. The swelling appears to be gradually enlarging and is usually present, with some fluctuation in its prominence. The patient describes the swelling as firm, although she is uncertain about this detail, and denies associated nausea, vomiting, jaundice, skin discoloration, or bruising. She reports feeling more fatigued than usual. Given the guarded communication pattern, more severe or additional symptoms such as tenderness, episodic changes, or subtle skin signs may be underreported or unnoticed. Further clinical evaluation is necessary to clarify the characteristics of the swelling, identify any associated signs, and determine underlying causes.",
