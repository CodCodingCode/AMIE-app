Well, it sounds like you\\u2019ve been feeling really tired and your tongue\\u2019s sore, and that\\u2019s why you came today. Can you tell me more about how you\\u2019ve been feeling and when these things started?\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides clear and organized descriptions of physical symptoms, with slight nervousness and hesitations that suggest mild emotional withholding. She responds predictably and sincerely but exhibits slight nervous behaviors, especially when discussing emotional aspects. - Bias detected: Mild anxiety-related communication bias impacting emotional openness, leading to slight underreporting of emotional distress or fears. - Confidence level: High for physical symptom accuracy; moderate for emotional disclosures due to nervous cues. - Reasoning: Her detailed physical descriptions and consistent timeline support reliability, but nervous habits and reticence about emotional sharing indicate that her emotional concerns may not be fully expressed.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Emotional distress, fears regarding seriousness or long-term impact, possibly avoiding emotional vulnerability. - Withheld information: Anxiety, frustration, or social/academic difficulties related to her physical health or associated emotional stress. - Amplified concerns: There is no clear evidence she exaggerates symptoms; her worry seems proportionate. - Temporal distortions: Timeline appears consistent; no definitive distortions identified, but emotional timing or impact may be understated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, she likely experiences moderate fatigue and persistent oral discomfort with honest physical reporting. She might be experiencing underlying emotional stress, such as anxiety or worry about health or social effects, that she is hesitant to articulate openly. The progression appears gradual and credible. Her emotional distress is probably more significant than she admits, warranting careful exploration. Her overall state suggests genuine physical symptoms with some emotional suppression due to nervousness, but no overt exaggeration or deception.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about how you're feeling inside\u2014sometimes worrying about your health or other things?\" (to gently explore emotional state); \"Are there things you're worried about that you haven't mentioned?\" (to address potential withholding); \"When you're feeling nervous, what thoughts come to mind?\" (to understand emotional concerns). - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental questioning, normalize anxiety, and create a safe space for emotional sharing. Recognize nervous habits as signs of discomfort rather than deception. - Priority order: Start with questions confirming her physical experience, then proceed to gently explore emotional feelings, emphasizing confidentiality and support to reduce nervousness.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with subjective reports of fatigue and oral soreness, but the communication pattern indicates nervousness and potential emotional withholding. Her detailed descriptions of physical symptoms suggest these are likely real, yet the slight hesitations and reticence about emotional details point to possible underreporting of emotional distress or anxiety. She may be experiencing more significant emotional or psychological stress than she's comfortable expressing openly. There is no indication of symptom exaggeration, but some physical symptoms could be more severe than reported due to under-communication. Additional probing is needed to clarify emotional concerns and the full extent of symptom severity.\nANSWER: Patient demographics: female, age unspecified. Chief complaint: persistent fatigue and oral soreness, as reported by the patient; physical symptoms likely present and ongoing. Present illness: the patient reports experiencing tiredness and a sore tongue, with a gradual onset; her descriptions appear consistent over time. Likely, these symptoms may be more intense or bothersome than she admits, given her nervous demeanor. She may also be experiencing underlying emotional stress, such as anxiety or worry about health, which she is hesitant to fully disclose. Timeline indicates a gradual development of symptoms, with no conflicting information evident from her detailed reporting. Associated symptoms such as emotional distress are suspected but not explicitly acknowledged; further inquiry is warranted to explore emotional or psychological factors. Confidence levels: high for physical symptom presence; medium for emotional or psychological stress possibly being underestimated; low for full severity of symptoms and emotional concerns due to communication bias; missing information includes detailed emotional and mental health background and the impact of symptoms on daily functioning.",

She displays slight emotional concern, evident through nervous gestures and tone, but generally appears open and honest. - Bias detected: Mild emotional amplification bias, as her anxiety may slightly exaggerate her perception of symptom severity and impact. - Confidence level: Medium-high for the physical symptoms' presence and timeline; moderate for her emotional burden and secondary issues, given subtle cues. - Reasoning: Her truthful reporting is evident, but her nervousness and concern could skew her subjective severity assessment slightly upward.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Emotional distress such as anxiety or depression might be underreported, along with secondary symptoms like sleep issues or mood fluctuations. - Withheld information: She might feel embarrassed or unaware to disclose fears about health prognosis or secondary psychological problems. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about illness severity may be artificially heightened due to anxiety, leading her to overestimate her discomfort's impact. - Temporal distortions: No clear timeline distortion detected; her chronology appears consistent.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely is: Emma experiences genuine, gradually worsening fatigue and oral soreness over the past month, impacting her daily functioning significantly. Her physical symptoms are credible and consistent. Emotional factors, such as anxiety, seem to amplify her perceived severity, but no evidence suggests significant concealment or distortion of core symptoms. She may also be experiencing underlying emotional stress that is not fully articulated. Additional assessment of her mental health and emotional state is recommended.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or mood?\" (to assess emotional and psychological well-being) * \"Are there other physical symptoms you've experienced but haven't mentioned?\" (to explore possible omitted complaints) * \"How do your symptoms affect your daily activities overall?\" (to gauge functional impairment) * \"Do you feel anxious or worried about what these symptoms might mean?\" (to understand emotional concerns and health fears) - Approach strategy: * Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language to encourage openness. * Frame questions lightly to reduce anxiety and shame. * Normalize emotional reactions to illness to help her share more freely. - Priority order: 1. Explore emotional well-being and mental health (since anxiety may influence perception). 2. Investigate sleep and mood changes. 3. Confirm the full scope of physical symptoms and functional impact. 4. Clarify her health fears to address underlying anxieties and misconceptions.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's detailed descriptions of fatigue and sore tongue are credible, but her nervous demeanor and concern suggest her perception of severity may be slightly exaggerated. There is no overt evidence of significant symptom minimization or withholding, but underlying emotional stress, such as anxiety, may be underreported. Her communication indicates awareness of her symptoms but potential amplification, so overall physical symptoms are likely genuine and more severe than perceived. Additional focus on mental health and sleep patterns might reveal further contributing factors. The timeline appears consistent, emphasizing a gradual onset over the past month. Overall, clinical findings point to persistent, progressively worsening fatigue and oral soreness, with possible psychological influences affecting her subjective experience.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: persistent fatigue and sore tongue, with severity possibly underestimated by the patient due to emotional distress.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing fatigue and oral soreness over the past month, with a gradual onset and significant impact on daily functioning. She describes feeling tired even after sleep, experiencing shortness of breath, weakness, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms appear consistent with her report, though her nervousness may lead to slight overstatement of discomfort. There is no explicit mention of additional physical symptoms, sleep disturbances, or mood issues, but emotional stress might be present and unreported.  Associated symptoms: No other specific symptoms documented; a thorough assessment for mood, sleep, and additional physical complaints is recommended to identify hidden concerns.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of fatigue and sore tongue over the past month, with a gradual onset and functional impact. - Medium confidence: Severity of symptoms may be slightly amplified due to patient anxiety; emotional or psychological factors are likely but not explicitly reported. - Low confidence: Exact extent of symptom severity and additional symptoms or mental health issues are uncertain, owing to communication biases. - Missing information: Detailed mental health background, sleep patterns, mood status, and comprehensive symptom inventory.\nANSWER: The patient is a female presenting with a one-month history of gradually worsening fatigue and sore tongue. She reports feeling tired even after sleep, experiencing breathlessness, weakness, and concentration difficulties, which significantly impair her daily activities. Her communication suggests potential emotional stress or anxiety may amplify her perception of symptom severity; however, her physical symptoms are credible and consistent with her report.

I feel worried, but I don\\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it either.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a female presenting with a one-month history of gradually worsening fatigue and sore tongue. She reports feeling tired even after sleep, experiencing breathlessness, weakness, and concentration difficulties, which significantly impair her daily activities. Her communication suggests potential emotional stress or anxiety may amplify her perception of symptom severity; however, her physical symptoms are credible and consistent with her report. No additional physical or psychological symptoms are currently documented, but further assessment is recommended to evaluate underlying emotional factors, sleep quality, and possible secondary symptoms affecting health.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, hedged language (\"kind of scared,\" \"don\u2019t want to make a big deal\"), displays guarded responses, and minimizes her emotional distress. Her responses suggest an effort to appear cooperative but mask more intense internal feelings. - Bias detected: Emotional suppression and minimization bias most strongly influence her reporting, with moderate severity impacting her portrayal of emotional distress. - Confidence level: Medium. The physical symptoms seem reliably reported, while emotional symptoms are likely understated. - Reasoning: The consistent use of qualifiers, reluctance to elaborate, and concern about burdening her mother indicate she is intentionally or subconsciously downplaying her worries, possibly due to shame or fear.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her internal anxiety or depression may be more severe; she might be experiencing intrusive worries, pervasive fear, or internal emotional pain she isn't expressing openly. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed about admitting fears of serious illness or emotional vulnerability, especially if cultural or personal factors discourage emotional disclosure. - Amplified concerns: She reports feeling worried and scared but likely experiences these feelings more intensely, perhaps with panic or dread she chooses not to vocalize. - Temporal distortions: Her fears and emotional reactions might have originated earlier than she reports, or developed subtly over time, but her guarded responses obscure this history.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include a woman with evolving physical symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and sore tongue, consistent and credible in presentation but possibly amplified by underlying emotional distress. She likely experiences significant anxiety or internalized fears that are underreported, with her defensive communication style obscuring the full psychological picture. Her emotional distress may be more profound, potentially contributing to or exacerbating her somatic symptoms.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about what worries you the most right now?\" to encourage openness about her fears; \"Have you noticed if these feelings or fears have been there before?\" to explore past emotional states; \"How do you feel about talking about what's happening with your health?\" to gauge her comfort and possible shame. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, normalize emotional reactions, and reassure her that it's safe to share difficult feelings. Employ open-ended questions and reflective listening to reduce defensiveness. - Priority order: First, explore her emotional state broadly to build rapport; then, gently probe into specific fears, ensuring she feels validated. Follow up with questions about her background and emotional history to identify longstanding or recurrent issues influencing her current presentation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient employs vague, guarded language and minimizes emotional distress, which suggests her reported symptoms may be influenced by emotional suppression, shame, or fear of burdening others. Her physical complaints of fatigue, weakness, and sore tongue are likely credible but may be amplified by underlying emotional factors such as anxiety or depression that she is not openly expressing. Her reluctance to elaborate and use of qualifiers suggest she might be experiencing more intense distress or additional symptoms she isn't reporting fully. Therefore, the core physical symptoms are credible, but their severity might be underestimated or their emotional contributors understated. Communication barriers indicate the need for gentle probing into her emotional wellbeing, and more detailed assessment is necessary to uncover potential hidden or exacerbating psychological factors.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue and sore tongue, with underlying emotional distress possibly influencing symptom perception.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue despite adequate sleep, with associated weakness, breathlessness, and difficulty concentrating. She describes feeling \"so tired all the time\" and mentions that these symptoms are impairing her daily activities. She also reports a sore tongue. While these symptoms are consistent and credible, she employs hedging language, suggesting potential emotional or psychological influences on her report. She admits to feeling worried and scared about her health but minimizes this emotional distress, indicating possible underlying anxiety, depression, or emotional suppression. The timeline appears to be at least one month, with symptoms gradually worsening.  Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms are explicitly reported, but underlying emotional distress may be more severe than acknowledged. No physical examination findings are documented.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The physical symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and sore tongue are credible based on patient report. - Medium confidence: The emotional distress and its severity, due to guarded language and minimization, might be understated or more significant. - Low confidence: The precise extent of emotional or psychological suffering, and potential additional symptoms such as anxiety or depression, remains concealed. - Missing information: Detailed mental health history, sleep quality assessment, and exploration of emotional wellbeing are needed to fully understand and address underlying factors.\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with a one-month history of progressively worsening fatigue, weakness, breathlessness, difficulty concentrating, and a sore tongue.

Physical complaints are likely credible but may be intensified by underlying emotional distress such as anxiety or depression that the patient is hesitant to openly disclose. Her communication indicates emotional suppression, with tendencies to minimize or conceal her worries, which could contribute to or exacerbate her symptoms. Further assessment of her emotional state, sleep patterns, and possible psychological factors is recommended to clarify her condition and guide appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with cautious, vague language, hedging her statements and avoiding detailed disclosure unless prompted. She exhibits hesitation and softness in her phrasing, indicating discomfort with fully sharing her symptoms. - Bias detected: The predominant bias is minimization, with some uncertainty bias. She underreports the severity and progression of her symptoms, possibly to reduce her own anxiety or shame. Her language suggests an attempt to appear less vulnerable. - Confidence level: Medium. While her communication indicates minimization and cautiousness, there is enough consistency to believe her emotional distress is real and her symptoms possibly more severe than stated. - Reasoning: Her hedging, qualifiers, and reluctance to elaborate point toward underreporting. Her expressions of worry are genuine but may be exaggerated or used to seek reassurance, not fully reflecting her actual symptom burden.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may have more severe neurological deficits (e.g., worse weakness, coordination issues), significant fatigue, or cognitive impairment that she does not fully disclose, perhaps feeling ashamed or uncertain. - Withheld information: Emotional symptoms like depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal may be present but unspoken, possibly due to embarrassment or fear of judgment. - Amplified concerns: Her statements about \"something really bad\" or \"worried\" may be more about seeking reassurance than actual perceived severity, potentially leading her to overstate her concerns at times, but overall, her description leans toward underreporting physical severity. - Temporal distortions: She likely perceives her symptoms as less severe or longer-standing than they may be; the progression may be more abrupt or worse in reality, but her narrative minimizes this.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the clinical picture likely involves significant, possibly worsening neurological deficits: weakness, fatigue, and cognitive issues that she is downplaying. Emotional distress such as anxiety or depression may be present but underreported. The overall progression could be more rapid or severe than she admits, with physical and emotional symptoms interconnected. Her hesitance suggests some shame or embarrassment about physical or psychological difficulties, which may hinder full disclosure and affect accurate assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you describe exactly how your weakness or fatigue affects your daily activities, like walking, using your hands, or concentrating?\" (to get concrete details and bypass vague language) * \"Are there times during the day when your symptoms are worse or better? How quickly did they develop?\" (to clarify progression) * \"Have you experienced any changes in your mood, sleep, or social habits?\" (to uncover emotional aspects) * \"Are there symptoms or feelings you find difficult to talk about or are embarrassed by?\" (to assess hidden symptoms) - Approach strategy: Gentle, non-judgmental questioning emphasizing confidentiality encourages openness. Validating her concerns helps reduce shame and fosters trust. Framing questions around daily function rather than just symptoms normalizes her experience. - Priority order: First, ask about specific neurological signs and daily impacts to establish severity. Next, explore emotional well-being and sleep patterns. Finally, inquire about any additional symptoms she hesitates to mention. This ensures a comprehensive understanding of both physical and emotional health, while respecting her guarded communication style.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits cautious, vague communication with tendencies to minimize and withhold details, which likely leads to underreporting the severity of her physical and emotional symptoms. Her statements about fatigue, weakness, and sore tongue, while credible, probably underestimate the true extent, as she appears anxious about disclosing full details. Her emotional distress seems genuine but is likely more severe than she admits, potentially influencing her perception and reporting of physical symptoms. Areas of more significant concern, such as neurological deficits or mood disturbances, may be hidden or minimized, requiring targeted probing for accurate assessment. Despite her guarded communication, the consistent presentation of fatigue, weakness, and oral discomfort suggests a potentially serious underlying physical condition that warrants further detailed evaluation.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Fatigue, weakness, sore tongue, and breathlessness, with suspected underreporting of severity. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing persistent fatigue, weakness, and oral soreness over approximately one month. She indicates that her fatigue persists despite sleep and significantly impairs her daily functioning, including concentration and physical activity. She also reports occasional shortness of breath and subjective feelings of weakness, which may be more severe than described. The progression appears gradual but is likely more rapid or severe, given her tendency to minimize symptoms. She expresses concern about potentially serious illness but hesitates to disclose full details or emotional distress. Associated symptoms: No additional specific symptoms are confidently described; emotional distress such as anxiety or depression may be present but is underreported. Signs of neurological deficits, mood changes, or sleep disturbances are suspected but not explicitly conveyed. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: Fatigue, weakness, sore tongue, and breathlessness as alleged. - Medium confidence: Severity and exact nature of neurological and emotional symptoms, likely more intense than reported. - Low confidence: The full extent of physical and emotional symptoms due to guarded communication. - Missing information: Detailed neurological examination findings, emotional and psychological assessment, exact timeline of symptom onset, and functional impact.\nANSWER: A woman presenting with a one-month history of persistent fatigue, weakness, and sore tongue reports that her symptoms have been gradually worsening, leading to difficulty concentrating and reduced physical activity. She experiences breathlessness and feelings of weakness that she perceives as impairing her daily function but tends to minimize the severity. Her communication suggests underlying emotional distress, such as anxiety, which may be underrecognized, and she hesitates to fully disclose the extent of her symptoms.

She experiences breathlessness and feelings of weakness that she perceives as impairing her daily function but tends to minimize the severity. Her communication suggests underlying emotional distress, such as anxiety, which may be underrecognized, and she hesitates to fully disclose the extent of her symptoms. Objective assessment should include a thorough neurological examination, evaluation of nutritional and metabolic status, and screening for mood disorders to clarify her condition and guide management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs hedging language and emotional elaboration, indicating discomfort with vulnerability and a tendency to minimize physical symptoms while emotional distress appears overemphasized. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias influences her reporting, leading her to overstate worries and emotional discomfort, while physical symptoms are likely underreported or minimized. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014communication patterns suggest bias, but some physical symptoms are reliably reported. - Reasoning: Her use of qualifiers, reluctance to confirm motor issues, and emphasis on fatigue and worry support the presence of amplification bias affecting her perceived severity and emotional reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Motor weakness, balance or gait problems, and neurological deficits may be more substantial than admitted, as her responses hint at an underestimation of physical severity. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed about her emotional vulnerability or fears of serious illness, leading her to under-disclose true anxiety levels or depressive symptoms. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of \"something really bad\" and worries about her mind and health may be exaggerated, driven by anxiety and family influence. - Temporal distortions: Her perceived rapid worsening could be influenced by her emotional state, possibly inflating the actual progression timeline of her physical symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the Chain of Thought, her physical symptoms\u2014fatigue, tingling, dizziness\u2014are likely real but could be more severe, with possible gait or balance impairments underpresented due to minimization. Her emotional state appears exaggerated, especially her anxiety, which may amplify her perception of symptom severity. The gradual progression reported seems plausible but may be perceived as more distressing because of emotional amplification. She may harbor unacknowledged motor or neurological deficits obscured by her communication style.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: - \"Can you tell me if you notice any unsteady walking or if you feel off balance when you stand or walk?\" to clarify motor and gait issues. - \"Do you ever feel numbness, weakness, or difficulty moving your arms or legs that maybe you haven't mentioned?\" to uncover hidden neurological signs. - \"How have your mood and emotional feelings been lately? Do you often feel anxious, sad, or overwhelmed?\" to assess mood disorders. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental questioning emphasizing curiosity and reassurance, avoiding leading or alarmist language, to help her feel safe sharing more openly. - Priority order: Start with physical examination questions about motor and gait function to uncover possible underreported deficits, then explore emotional well-being to address underlying anxiety or mood issues.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern suggests a tendency to magnify emotional distress, particularly anxiety, while underreporting or minimizing physical symptoms such as gait or motor issues. Her elaborate concern about her health and nervousness likely lead to an overemphasis on subjective feelings of fatigue, dizziness, and tingling, while actual neurological deficits may be more significant than she admits. Her response indicates potential unawareness or reluctance to disclose the true severity of physical symptoms, which necessitates a cautious approach. Physical symptoms are likely to be more severe than reported, but her emotional distress appears exaggerated, influencing her perception of symptom severity. Additional probing is needed to assess gait, neurological deficits, and mood more objectively.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, unspecified age.  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue, sore tongue, tingling in fingers and toes, intermittent dizziness, and increased emotional anxiety.  Present illness: The patient reports a steadily worsening one-month history of fatigue, sensation of tongue soreness, tingling in extremities, and dizziness. She describes feeling weak and breathless with difficulty concentrating, which she perceives as impairing daily function but tends to minimize in severity. Communication suggests she may underreport motor or gait abnormalities and emotional states, which could be more prominent. Her account indicates potential amplification of anxiety, possibly obscuring or exaggerating physical symptoms, which may be more severe than she acknowledges. The timeline appears consistent but may be influenced by her emotional distress, leading to perceived rapid progression.  Associated symptoms: Tingling in fingers and toes; occasional dizziness; no reported gait instability or weakness, though physical deficits could be more significant upon examination. Emotional anxiety appears prominent, possibly driven by underlying mood disturbances, but details require further assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s reported symptoms of fatigue, tingling, and dizziness are likely present but may be more severe internally. - Medium confidence: Emotional distress, anxiety, and perceived symptom severity are likely amplified by her communication style. - Low confidence: Actual neurological deficits or gait disturbances may be underreported or hidden due to minimization. - Missing information: Objective neurological exam focusing on gait, strength, coordination, and sensory function; comprehensive psychiatric or mood assessment; laboratory and diagnostic evaluations to determine underlying causes.\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with a one-month history of persistent fatigue, tongue soreness, tingling in her fingers and toes, and intermittent dizziness. While she reports these symptoms as gradually worsening and impacting her daily activities, her communication suggests she may underreport motor or gait disturbances and overemphasize her emotional concerns. Physical symptoms are likely more severe than described, with the potential for unrecognized neurological deficits. Emotional distress, particularly anxiety, appears significant but possibly exaggerated. Further objective examination and investigations are needed to accurately assess her neurological and psychological status, and to determine underlying causes.",
