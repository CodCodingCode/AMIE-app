The absence of minimizing or amplification cues supports this conclusion.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any emotional changes, like feeling more anxious or down because of these symptoms?\" (to assess psychological impact); \"Can you tell me if your symptoms have interfered with your daily activities or work?\" (to gauge functional impairment); \"Are there any other symptoms, like chest pain or swelling, that you haven't mentioned?\" (to identify possibly omitted physical issues); \"How has your breathing been during sleep?\" (to evaluate severity and impact).\n- Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental questions that normalise emotional responses, encouraging the patient to share possible hidden distress. Emphasise that discussing emotional effects is part of understanding their overall health.\n- Priority order: Start with questions about emotional well-being and daily functioning to uncover emotional or psychological impacts that might be underreported. Follow with specific physical symptoms or functional details. This structured approach allows building rapport and clarifying any possible hidden concerns progressively.",

Normalize symptoms to reduce embarrassment (\"Many people notice similar things, and it helps to talk about them\"). Maintain patient-centered curiosity, creating a safe environment for full disclosure.\n- Priority order: First, explore unmentioned symptoms (e.g., chest tightness, sleep issues) to gauge severity; then, clarify functional impairment and emotional state; finally, revisit timeline details for better accuracy.

She appears uncomfortable and reluctant to disclose detailed or potentially concerning information about her symptoms, which she seems to minimize. Her language indicates underlying discomfort, possibly embarrassment, which influences her candor.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is **minimization coupled with cautious vagueness**. She appears to understate the severity and extent of her symptoms, possibly to avoid worry, shame, or due to uncertainty about her own experience.\n- Confidence level: **Medium**. Based on her language patterns, I trust that she is experiencing symptoms beyond what she openly describes, but I cannot quantify the severity without further probing.\n- Reasoning: The consistent hedging, minimal responses, and expressions of uncertainty suggest she is holding back details intentionally or due to lack of awareness, which leads me to infer that her true clinical picture is more severe than communicated.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Have you noticed if your breathing sounds change or become more noticeable during certain times of the day or activities?\" (rationale: to get more concrete information about timing and triggers)\n2. \"Can you tell me if you ever experience tightness or pain in your chest, even if you feel embarrassed to mention it?\" (rationale: to explore potentially hidden symptoms)\n3. \"How often do you have coughing, colds, or infections? Are these worse now compared to before?\" (rationale: to assess infectious or inflammatory contributions)\n4. \"Do you sometimes feel very tired or out of breath even when resting? How does that affect your daily life?\" (rationale: to evaluate the severity of exertional limitation)\n5. \"Are there specific activities or situations you avoid because of your breathing or chest sensations?\" (rationale: to reveal avoidance patterns that indicate severity)\n- Approach strategy:\nUse gentle, non-judgmental language to normalize their experiences (\"Many people notice sounds or sensations that they find confusing or worry about.\") and reassure her that honest sharing will help her get better care (\"It's okay to tell me everything\u2014you\u2019re not doing anything wrong.\"). Recognize her discomfort and patience, building a safe space for open dialogue.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, clarify symptom triggers and exact sensations to establish baseline severity.

Do they happen daily or less frequently?\u201d\n- \u201cWhen you notice the sounds or discomfort, how much do they affect your ability to do daily activities?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there any symptoms you haven\u2019t mentioned, like persistent cough, fatigue, or chest tightness?\u201d\n- \u201cHave you noticed if anything makes the sounds or symptoms better or worse, like certain positions or times of day?\u201d\n- \u201cCan you describe your symptoms during rest versus activity in more detail?\u201d\n- Approach strategy: Use gradual, non-judgmental questioning to build trust, normalize uncertainty, and encourage detailed sharing\u2014emphasizing that all symptoms are important, even if they seem minor.\n- Priority order: Start with questions about frequency and impact to quantify severity, then proceed to specific sound descriptions and associated symptoms. This sequence helps uncover information the patient might be hesitant to share outright.",

Can you tell me more about these sounds when you're resting or inactive?\"). Show understanding and avoid implying doubt or blame.\n- Reinforce that it's okay to discuss even minor or confusing symptoms to ensure the best possible understanding.\n- Be patient and allow space for gradual sharing, avoiding pressure to produce definitive answers.\n- Priority order:\n1. Clarify the characteristics, triggers, and timing of the sounds, since these are critical for accurate diagnosis.\n2. Explore any additional symptoms like wheezing, chest pain, or fatigue that might indicate broader issues.\n3. Discuss how symptoms impact her daily life to gauge severity and functional impairment.\n4.
