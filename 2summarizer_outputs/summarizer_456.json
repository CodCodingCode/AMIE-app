I'm mostly anxious and a bit scared, too.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with vague, hedged language, offering detailed but scattered descriptions, and shows hesitance that reflects discomfort. Her emotional expressions are genuine but amplified by anxiety, and she minimizes her symptoms through cautious word choice. - Bias detected: Predominantly minimization bias, potentially combined with amplification of distress, compromising accurate reporting. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014while she clearly experiences distress, her underreporting makes full severity assessments uncertain. - Reasoning: Her vague timeline, hedging language, and emphasis on feeling \"upset\" and \"scared\" suggest she is minimizing the true intensity and frequency of her symptoms, although her emotional state indicates genuine distress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more frequent or severe hallucinations and emotional instability than reported because she wants to appear less overwhelmed. - Withheld information: Possible shame or embarrassment about persistent hallucinations or cognitive issues; worries about being judged or misunderstood. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about \"losing her mind\" and emotional upset are likely real but potentially magnified by anxiety, possibly leading to heightened distress that overshadows her actual symptom severity. - Temporal distortions: Her vague duration (\"a couple of months\") and perception that symptoms are improving might be inaccurate; symptoms could be worsening or fluctuate more than she admits.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves: - More frequent, intense hallucinations and shadows not fully disclosed, with possible additional visual or auditory disturbances. - Significant emotional distress, possibly with features of anxiety or depression, that she minimizes but which impact her daily functioning. - Cognitive symptoms such as disorganized thoughts or memory lapses, perhaps more severe than she suggests. - A possibly worsening symptom trajectory over several months, with limited insight into severity or progression, influenced by anxiety and shame.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how often you hear voices or see shadows each day? Are they loud or clear? Do they happen when you're busy or only when alone?\" \"Have your hallucinations changed in frequency or intensity over time?\" \"Are you experiencing any feelings of emotional numbness, withdrawal, or difficulty concentrating?\" \"Is there anything you find particularly embarrassing or difficult to talk about regarding your symptoms?\" Rationale: These target symptom severity, insight, and possible hidden negative symptoms. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language; normalize her experiences by framing hallucinations as common in certain conditions; reassure confidentiality and support. - Priority order: First, clarify the frequency and impact of hallucinations to gauge severity; then explore emotional state and any negative symptoms; finally, gently probe about shame or embarrassment to facilitate open disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses vague, hedged language and emphasizes emotional distress, suggesting possible minimization or amplification biases. Her reports of hallucinations and shadows have likely been understated, as she appears anxious and cautious in communication, which may lead her to downplay severity. Her statement that symptoms have been present for \"a couple of months\" and that they are \"still there\" implies a persistent issue that may be more severe or frequent than described. The emotional expression of being \"upset\" and \"scared\" indicates significant distress, but she might also be experiencing additional symptoms such as disorganized thoughts or emotional instability that she is reluctant to fully disclose. There is also potential for withholding or concealing feelings of shame or embarrassment about persistent hallucinations or cognitive issues, which she perceives as a sign of declining mental health. Overall, her symptom severity is likely underestimated; hallucinations and emotional distress may be more severe and impact her functioning more than she reports.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown age and gender. Chief complaint: Persistent hallucinations and visual disturbances, specifically hearing voices and seeing shadows, which have been ongoing for approximately two months, despite current medication. Present illness: The patient reports hearing whispers or voices and seeing shadows out of the corner of her eye, with symptoms persisting over at least two months. She describes her thoughts as feeling \"jumbled,\" indicating possible disorganized thinking. She reports emotional distress characterized by anxiety and fear. Based on communication patterns, these symptoms may be more frequent, intense, and disruptive than she communicates. She also reports ongoing distress but minimizes symptom severity, which could mask the need for further treatment adjustments or additional supportive interventions. No explicit mention of other symptoms such as emotional numbness, withdrawal, or concentration difficulties, but these could be present. The timeline suggests a relatively stable experience over months, though actual symptom fluctuation or worsening cannot be ruled out due to communication biases.  Associated symptoms: Emotional distress, anxiety, and fear, with potential unreported or understated cognitive and emotional symptoms.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient experiences hallucinations (voices and visual shadows) persisting over two months and emotional distress. - Medium confidence: The severity and frequency of hallucinations and emotional symptoms are likely underestimated due to communication hesitance. - Low confidence: Exact symptom severity, the full extent of hallucinations, and additional associated symptoms such as emotional withdrawal or cognitive disturbances. - Missing information: Precise frequency, intensity, and impact of hallucinations; current mental status including mood, affect, and cognitive functioning; any additional negative symptoms or social/functional impairment; patient's insight into her condition and potential reasons for symptom minimization.\nANSWER: The patient is experiencing ongoing visual and auditory hallucinations, including seeing shadows and hearing voices, that have persisted for approximately two months despite current medication. She reports feeling emotionally distressed, anxious, and scared, with a sense of disorganized thoughts. Due to her communication style, the true severity, frequency, and impact of her symptoms are likely greater than she describes. Further assessment is necessary to determine the full extent of her hallucinations, emotional state, and any additional cognitive or psychiatric symptoms that may be present but underreported.",

She reports feeling emotionally distressed, anxious, and scared, with a sense of disorganized thoughts. Due to her communication style, the true severity, frequency, and impact of her symptoms are likely greater than she describes. Further assessment is necessary to determine the full extent of her hallucinations, emotional state, and any additional cognitive or psychiatric symptoms that may be present but underreported.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses softening qualifiers and vague language, framing her hallucinations and distress as less severe than they may actually be. She responds elaboratively but cautiously, indicating possible guardedness and emotional discomfort. - Bias detected: The predominant bias is minimization, with evidence of guardedness and possible underreporting of symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium-high. The language and response style strongly suggest underestimation, although she does appear genuinely distressed. - Reasoning: Her frequent use of non-committal phrases, self-protective qualifiers, and efforts to normalize or diminish her symptoms point toward an intentional or subconscious minimization bias.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true frequency and severity of hallucinations and disorganized thoughts are probably worse, as she underplays them to appear more in control. - Withheld information: She may be experiencing emotional numbing, social withdrawal, or depression that she\u2019s hesitant to disclose, possibly out of shame or denial. - Amplified concerns: Her expressed fears and anxieties, while genuine, might be exaggerated in her narrative to seek reassurance; she may be catastrophizing her emotional distress. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms might be persistent or fluctuating, but her perception of improvement might be overly optimistic or selective, underestimating ongoing severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves persistent auditory and visual hallucinations that are more frequent and distressing than reported, accompanied by significant disorganization of thoughts and anxiety. She may also be experiencing emotional blunting or depressive symptoms that she minimizes. Her insight into the true severity appears limited, possibly due to emotional guardedness or shame, requiring careful probing to clarify the scope of her symptoms and their impact on her functioning.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me exactly how many times a day you hear voices or see shadows? Are there times when they are much worse or completely absent?\" to gauge severity; \"Do you ever feel emotionally numb or hopeless?\" to explore potential depression; \"Have you noticed any changes in your social life or daily activities?\" to assess functional impact. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic inquiry, normalizing her experiences (\"Many people hear or see things sometimes; tell me more about how it affects you daily\") to reduce shame and encourage openness. - Priority order: Start by clarifying the frequency and impact of hallucinations to accurately gauge severity; then explore emotional states and functional impairment to understand the full clinical picture, ensuring she feels safe and not judged.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication style suggests a tendency to minimize or underreport the severity and frequency of hallucinations and other symptoms. She uses cautious language, which indicates possible guardedness or emotional discomfort, leading to underestimation of her true symptoms. Despite reporting that hallucinations (voices and shadows) have persisted for approximately two months despite medication, her descriptions\u2014such as \u201calmost every day\u201d or \u201ckind of weird\u201d\u2014may understate the actual impact. The mention of feeling anxious and scared is likely genuine, but other symptoms like disorganized thoughts and emotional symptoms may be more severe or persistent than described. There may also be additional hidden symptoms, such as emotional blunting or social withdrawal, that she is hesitant to disclose or recognize. More detailed probing is needed to accurately ascertain the frequency, severity, and functional impact of her hallucinations and associated symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified in conversation.  Chief complaint: Persistent auditory and visual hallucinations, reported to be ongoing for approximately two months despite current medication.  Present illness: The patient reports hearing voices, described as whispers and other sounds, most days, with some variability in severity. She also perceives shadows moving out of her peripheral vision, especially when tired or focused. She describes feelings of anxiety and confusion during these episodes. Disorganized thoughts are present based on her description of \u201cjumbled\u201d thinking. She is distressed and fearful but may be underestimating the full extent of her symptom severity. Timeline indicates symptoms started roughly two months ago and have persisted despite treatment, though she may be minimizing their frequency or intensity.  Associated symptoms: Anxiety, fear, disorganized thoughts, possibly emotional distress. Additional symptoms such as emotional blunting, social withdrawal, or depressive symptoms are likely but unreported and should be further explored.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Hallucinations are ongoing and present for at least two months, with current distress. - Medium confidence: The severity and frequency of hallucinations are likely underestimated; symptoms may be more frequent and impactful. - Low confidence: Precise degree of social or functional impairment, and presence of other psychiatric symptoms like depression, remain unclear. - Missing information: Exact frequency and impact of hallucinations, current emotional state, social functioning, and possible additional symptoms such as mood disorder features or cognitive deficits.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses cautious, hedging language with qualifiers and often trails off, indicating internal conflict about revealing the true extent of her hallucinations and distress. She provides elaborate but somewhat vague descriptions, aiming to communicate her experience while minimizing its impact. - Bias detected: Minimization bias, driven by anxiety, embarrassment, or stigma. The evidence includes qualifiers like \u201ckind of,\u201d \u201ca little,\u201d \u201cnot that bad,\u201d and evasive timeline descriptions. - Confidence level: Medium; patterns of hedging and hesitation strongly suggest underreporting, though she does acknowledge some distress, so she is somewhat forthcoming. - Reasoning: These linguistic cues and hedging patterns reflect an unconscious or conscious effort to downplay severity, which aligns with minimization bias commonly seen in patients with internalized stigma or fear of judgment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The full frequency, intensity, and impact of the hallucinations are probably more severe; she may experience persistent or more persecutory hallucinations that she is hesitant to fully disclose. - Withheld information: Feelings of losing control or fear of psychotic deterioration, comorbid symptoms such as depression or paranoia, or social withdrawal might be understated due to embarrassment or shame. - Amplified concerns: Her internal fears about worsening symptoms may be more intense than expressed, but she attempts to appear manageable. - Temporal distortions: She describes symptoms as \u201ca couple of months\u201d or \u201ca little while,\u201d which might understate ongoing or worsening severity, especially if symptoms have been escalating gradually.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves more persistent and severe hallucinations than explicitly reported, with significant emotional distress and potential impairment in functioning. The timeline may be more progressive, with symptoms possibly intensifying or becoming more intrusive. She may be experiencing additional internal distress and possibly other associated symptoms (such as anxiety, depression, or social withdrawal) that she\u2019s hesitant to fully disclose, driven by stigma or shame. Her internal state is probably more compromised than her cautious language suggests, necessitating careful probing.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \u201cCan you tell me exactly how many times a day you hear voices? Do they ever tell you to do things? Are you worried they might influence your actions? Do you ever feel paranoid or suspicious of others? Have your feelings of anxiety or loss of control increased recently?\u201d - Approach strategy: Frame questions gently, emphasizing understanding and support. Use open-ended and nonjudgmental language, e.g., \u201cMany people experience distressing thoughts or perceptions, and that\u2019s okay; I\u2019d like to understand exactly what you\u2019re experiencing so I can best support you.\u201d - Priority order: Start by clarifying the frequency and severity of hallucinations to gauge impact, then explore their emotional and functional effects, followed by any other associated symptoms or concerns. This sequence helps build trust and gathers comprehensive information in a supportive manner.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s cautious and hedging language, dismissive qualifiers, and ambiguity suggest a tendency to minimize or underreport the severity and frequency of her hallucinations and distress. She describes experiencing auditory hallucinations (whispers, louder voices) nearly daily and visual phenomena (shadows, shapes), but her wording indicates she might not be fully disclosing the extent or emotional impact. Her description of persistent symptoms over \"a couple of months\" likely underestimates their true duration and severity, as these experiences may be more entrenched. She admits to feelings of anxiety and confusion, but these could be more intense or impairing than she reports. There is a possibility that additional symptoms such as paranoia, delusional thoughts, or social withdrawal are present but not fully disclosed due to stigma or embarrassment. Based on communication cues, her internal distress and symptom burden are probably greater than indicated, highlighting the need for thorough probing.\nANSWER: Patient is a [age, gender unspecified] presenting with ongoing perceptual disturbances. She reports experiencing auditory hallucinations characterized by whispers and louder voices, occurring nearly daily, and visual phenomena such as shadows or shapes moving out of her visual periphery, especially when tired or focused. She reports feeling anxious and confused, with a sense of disorganized thoughts. While describing these symptoms as persistent for several months, her language suggests they may be more frequent, intense, or longer-standing than explicitly acknowledged. Additional symptoms such as paranoia, delusional beliefs, or social withdrawal are suspected but not fully detailed, given her communication pattern. Her emotional distress appears significant, and her functional impact may be underestimated based on her limited disclosures.

I'm mostly anxious and a bit scared, too.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: \\\"Can you tell me more about what your hallucinations are like\\u2014how often do they happen, and what goes through your mind when you see or hear things that aren\\u2019t really there?\\\"\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I hear voices sometimes, like whispers or things no one else seems to notice. It\\u2019s most days\\u2014like, almost every day\\u2014and I guess it\\u2019s kind of weird, but I also see shadows moving out of the corner of my eye, especially when I\\u2019m tired or really focusing on something else. When they happen, I just get kind of anxious or confused. I mean, I try not to think about it, but it\\u2019s hard to ignore when it feels so real, even if I know I shouldn\\u2019t believe it.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: \\\"Could you tell me more about how these hallucinations feel for you personally\\u2014what they\\u2019re like and how they have been affecting you day to day?\\\"\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, the voices are like whispers or sometimes louder, kind of like someone\\u2019s talking but I can\\u2019t tell what they\\u2019re saying. It\\u2019s weird because I hear them even if I\\u2019m just sitting alone. And the shadows\\u2014sometimes I see shapes moving out of the corner of my eye, like quick flashes or flickers, but I turn and they\\u2019re gone. It\\u2019s really confusing, and I feel like my thoughts are all jumbled up, like I can\\u2019t get them organized, and that makes me scared I\\u2019m losing my mind or something.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: \\\"You've shared that these hallucinations happen quite frequently and are quite distressing. Can you tell me more about whether anything in particular seems to trigger them\\u2014like specific situations, feelings, or times of day\\u2014and how you have been feeling emotionally when they occur? Also, have you noticed if your mood or thoughts change around these times?\\\"\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, I notice that sometimes when I\\u2019m really stressed out, or if I\\u2019ve had a long day, I start hearing voices more often, especially after I get home from work when I just wanna relax, but then my mind feels like it\\u2019s racing or something. And I think maybe when I\\u2019m feeling kind of anxious or nervous, the shadows and weird thoughts come up more, like my mood kinda changes, but I\\u2019m not really sure if it\\u2019s just because I\\u2019m worried or if it\\u2019s because of the hallucinations.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: \\u201cYou mentioned that your hallucinations happen quite often and can feel really distressing. Can you tell me more about the specific times when they tend to occur\\u2014are there particular situations, feelings, or moments in your day when they happen more? Also, how long do these hallucinations usually last\\u2014are they brief or do they persist for a while? When you experience them, what\\u2019s going through your mind? For example, do you feel scared, confused, or paranoid during these episodes? Understanding more about the timing and your emotional reactions can help us get a clearer picture of how these symptoms are affecting you overall.\\u201d\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, well, I don\\u2019t think I can say exactly when they happen most, but it\\u2019s usually when I\\u2019m alone after work or if I\\u2019ve had a really stressful day at the bookstore because sometimes I get overwhelmed with the busy crowd and trying to keep up. The voices and shadows kind of come and go, but they feel pretty real in the moment, and I get scared or confused\\u2014like I wonder if I\\u2019m losing my mind or if something\\u2019s actually outside of me. And honestly, I try not to think about it too much because it makes me feel worse, and I just want it to stop.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a person who reports experiencing persistent auditory hallucinations, such as whispers and louder voices, occurring nearly daily, along with visual phenomena, including shadows or shapes seen out of the corner of her eye. She describes these symptoms as distressing but tends to understate their frequency, severity, and disruptive impact, possibly due to emotional discomfort or stigma. She also reports feelings of anxiety and confusion, with symptoms that appear to be exacerbated by stress or fatigue. While her disclosures suggest ongoing perceptual disturbances of moderate to severe intensity, the actual severity may be greater, and important associated features such as paranoia, delusional thinking, or social withdrawal are not fully articulated but are suspected to be present. Further comprehensive assessment is required to elucidate the full scope, content, and impact of her symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient\u2019s language is cautious, hedging her statements with vague qualifiers, and focusing on emotional distress rather than severity or frequency. She elaborates on her experiences but avoids definitive statements about how bad her symptoms are. - Bias detected: Minimalization and hedging bias, leading to potential underestimation of symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium, since she acknowledges distress but seems to downplay the intensity and frequency. - Reasoning: Her use of uncertain language, combined with emotional descriptors, suggests a tendency to minimize or avoid fully disclosing the impact. This could be driven by shame, fear, or difficulty accepting her symptoms.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual severity and frequency of hallucinations are probably higher, and their impact more disruptive, than she admits. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed about paranoid beliefs, more severe hallucinations, or social withdrawal, so she avoids discussing these openly. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about losing her mind could be exaggerated by anxiety, but her genuine distress suggests actual risk. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms may have begun earlier, persisted longer, and worsened over time, but her vague recall conceals this.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely indicates that she experiences persistent, possibly daily, auditory and visual hallucinations that are more severe and distressing than her words suggest. Her symptoms probably include paranoid or suspicious thoughts, mild to moderate functional impairment, and a history that extends further back than she reports. Her emotional responses\u2014fear and confusion\u2014are genuine, although the severity of her perceptual disturbances is probably underestimated. Her hesitance and minimization may serve as a defense against stigma or shame, preventing full disclosure of her condition.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me exactly how often you hear voices or see shadows\u2014that is, daily, weekly, or less often?\" * \"When you experience these hallucinations, what are you most afraid might happen?\" * \"Do you have paranoid thoughts about others or feel suspicious of people around you?\" * \"Have you noticed any changes in your social activities, like withdrawing or avoiding others?\" * \"Have you ever had thoughts that you or others might be in danger or that someone is plotting against you?\" * \"Did these symptoms start earlier in your life, or have they been worsening over time?\" - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language, normalize hallucinations as part of mental health conditions, and express curiosity rather than judgment. This encourages openness. - Priority order: First, clarify the frequency and severity of hallucinations to gauge morbidity; next, explore paranoia or delusional beliefs which may be underlying; finally, assess impact on daily functioning and social relationships to inform treatment planning.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication exhibits caution and hedging, suggesting possible minimization of symptom severity and impact. She describes experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations frequently, usually daily, but may understate how disruptive or intense these symptoms actually are. Her emotional descriptors indicate genuine distress, but her vague statements about timing and severity imply she might be avoiding full disclosure due to stigma or fear. She emphasizes stress-related triggers, such as fatigue and busy environments, which could suggest some environmental exacerbation, but the core symptoms likely persist beyond these contexts. There might also be underlying paranoia or delusional thinking not overtly articulated, given her fears of losing her mind and her distress level. The actual severity and functional impairment are possibly underestimated, and more comprehensive probing is needed to clarify the presence of paranoid beliefs and social withdrawal. Overall, her perceptual disturbances are probably more persistent and impactful than she admits.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Persistent auditory and visual hallucinations despite ongoing treatment.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing auditory hallucinations\u2014such as whispers and louder voices\u2014most days, along with visual phenomena like shadows or moving shapes seen out of the corner of her eye. She describes these experiences as distressing but tends to minimize their frequency and severity. She reports that hallucinations are often triggered or worsened by stress, fatigue, and crowded environments, such as after work. Accompanying symptoms include feelings of anxiety, confusion, and fear, with her thoughts described as \"jumbled\" and difficult to organize. She reports feeling scared and worried about her mental state, possibly exaggerating her distress, but the core symptoms likely involve moderate to severe hallucinations with associated emotional impact. She does not explicitly report paranoid or delusional beliefs but indicates a fear of losing her mind and intense distress during episodes. The timing suggests these symptoms have been ongoing for several months, her exact pattern may be more frequent or intense than acknowledged.  Associated symptoms: Feelings of anxiety, confusion, stress-related exacerbation of hallucinations, emotional distress during episodes, possible early signs of paranoia or social withdrawal, though not explicitly reported; confidence levels vary.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient experiences frequent auditory and visual hallucinations and emotional distress associated with these symptoms. - Medium confidence: The exact severity, impact on daily functioning, and presence of paranoid thoughts or delusional beliefs are likely underestimated due to communication bias. - Low confidence: Precise frequency, duration, and full scope of associated symptoms (e.g., paranoia, social withdrawal) require further assessment. - Missing information: Details about the onset age, progression over time, specific content of hallucinations, presence of paranoia or delusional thinking, and impact on social and occupational functioning.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with ongoing auditory and visual hallucinations occurring most days, including hearing whispers and louder voices, and perceiving shadows or moving shapes, primarily triggered or intensified by stress and fatigue. Despite reporting distress, she tends to minimize the severity and frequency of these symptoms. She experiences associated emotional symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, and fear and describes her thoughts as disorganized during episodes. She denies explicitly endorsing paranoid or delusional beliefs but indicates concerns about losing her mental stability. The symptoms have persisted over recent months, with possible underreporting of their true impact, necessitating further detailed assessment to determine full severity and functional impairment.",
