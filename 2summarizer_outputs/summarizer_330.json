I\\u2019ve got this tightness in my chest, and it\\u2019s been coming and going for a little while now. It\\u2019s like a heavy pressure in my chest, and it\\u2019s spreading up to my jaw and down my back. I\\u2019ve been sweating a lot and feeling nauseous, and it\\u2019s just been getting worse. I couldn\\u2019t shake it off, and I started feeling really dizzy, so I thought I better get checked.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly with detailed, emotionally charged descriptions. They emphasize severity and worry, indicating high anxiety levels but do not show signs of withholding or minimization. - Bias detected: Anxiety amplification bias, as the patient exaggerates the severity and danger of their symptoms due to fear of a heart attack. - Confidence level: medium-high; detailed descriptions support reliability but caution is warranted about overestimation caused by anxiety. - Reasoning: The focus on worsening symptoms, vivid descriptions, and expressed fears suggest emotional amplification. No clear minimization or withholding behaviors are evident, but the subjective perception is likely heightened.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible underreporting of episodic frequency or duration; maybe unnoticed or dismissed mild symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath or fatigue). - Withheld information: May be hesitant to disclose lifestyle risks or previous heart issues; perhaps unaware of or reluctant to share all relevant medical history. - Amplified concerns: Overestimation of danger through vivid language and fear, possibly making symptoms seem more severe or urgent than they are. - Temporal distortions: The patient perceives symptoms as worsening and ongoing, but episodes may be intermittent and less intense or persistent, leading to a subjective sense of escalation.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased picture likely involves episodic chest discomfort with associated anxiety. The physical symptoms are plausible but may be exaggerated by the patient's emotional state. Actual physical severity might be moderate, with potential for underlying cardiac or other somatic issues, but the perceived urgency is heightened by anxiety. Some associated symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or previous episodes might be underreported or unrecognized, and the timeline may reflect heightened concern rather than progression.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how many times you've experienced these symptoms before?\" \"How long do they usually last?\" \"Have you noticed any patterns or triggers?\" \"Do you have any risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking?\" \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like shortness of breath or tiredness?\" Rationale: To gather objective, quantifiable data to clarify the episodic nature and evaluate clinical risk. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, validating language to build trust, normalize distress but gently guide away from catastrophizing. Ask open-ended questions gradually narrowing to targeted details to avoid alarming the patient further. - Priority order: First, clarify the frequency and duration of episodes to assess actual risk; next, explore medical history and risk factors; then, inquire about additional symptoms or lifestyle behaviors that influence overall assessment, ensuring patient feels heard and not judged.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's detailed, emotionally charged description suggests high anxiety which may amplify the perceived severity and frequency of symptoms. While they report episodic chest tightness with spreading to the jaw and back, along with sweating, nausea, and dizziness, the intensity and progression may be exaggerated by their anxiety. There is a possibility that some symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or the true frequency/duration of episodes, are underreported or not fully recognized. Communication patterns imply potential bias toward overestimating danger, but objective clinical facts\u2014such as the episodic nature of chest discomfort\u2014are still identifiable. More precise information about symptom duration, triggers, and medical risk factors is necessary for a complete assessment. The confidence level on symptom severity is moderate, influenced by emotional amplification, while concrete details are limited and require further probing.\nANSWER: A middle-aged patient presenting with episodic chest discomfort characterized by tightness and pressure spreading to the jaw and back, accompanied by sweating, nausea, and dizziness. The symptoms are reported as worsening and severe, but their subjective nature may be amplified by anxiety. The episodes appear intermittent, lasting variable durations, with no specified frequency. Additional symptoms such as shortness of breath or fatigue are not explicitly reported but remain relevant. The patient's communication indicates high anxiety levels that may influence symptom perception, underscoring the need for further objective data collection and risk assessment.",

The symptoms are reported as worsening and severe, but their subjective nature may be amplified by anxiety. The episodes appear intermittent, lasting variable durations, with no specified frequency. Additional symptoms such as shortness of breath or fatigue are not explicitly reported but remain relevant. The patient's communication indicates high anxiety levels that may influence symptom perception, underscoring the need for further objective data collection and risk assessment.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses detailed, emotionally charged language emphasizing severity, with a focus on distress and worsening symptoms, likely driven by high anxiety levels. - Bias detected: Amplification bias influencing perception of severity and threat. - Confidence level: Medium; the patient appears reliable in describing what they experience but may overestimate actual danger due to emotional upset. - Reasoning: The extensive emotional language and emphasis on worsening conditions point toward anxiety-related amplification rather than deliberate exaggeration.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Symptoms such as exertional fatigue, shortness of breath, or atypical chest sensations may be understated or omitted possibly because of emotional overwhelm or focus on more prominent descriptors. - Withheld information: No clear evidence of embarrassment, but possible omission of lifestyle risk factors or prior cardiac history that patients often avoid discussing. - Amplified concerns: The patient may be overestimating the threat level\u2014believing they are experiencing a severe, potentially life-threatening episode\u2014due to anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears consistent but emotionally exaggerated; they perceive symptoms as worsening rapidly, although actual progression may be more stable.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette probably indicates episodic chest tightness and pressure, spreading that has causes of concern but not necessarily as severe as described. The episodes are likely of moderate intensity, with some spreading to jaw and back, accompanied by sweating, nausea, and dizziness, escalating emotionally. The patient's anxiety amplifies their perception of severity, but physical symptoms are consistent with possible non-life-threatening causes\u2014such as angina or other cardiac issues\u2014requiring further assessment, including risk stratification and possibly stress testing.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you describe what you feel right before the episode starts? How long do the episodes usually last? Do you experience similar discomfort with exertion or at rest? Do you notice any associated symptoms like exertional shortness of breath or fatigue? What, if anything, relieves or worsens these episodes?\" (to clarify actual pattern and triggers) - Approach strategy: Ask gently and empathetically, validate feelings, and normalize concerns to reduce anxiety, which may help the patient elaborate more objectively. - Priority order: First, clarify the nature and duration of episodes and associated symptoms to assess actual physical risk; then probe risk factors and functional impact; finally, address anxiety's role in symptom perception to develop a plan for management.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's detailed, emotionally charged descriptions suggest a high level of anxiety that likely amplifies their perception of symptom severity. While they report chest tightness, spreading to the jaw and back, along with sweating, nausea, and dizziness, these experiences are consistent with episodic chest discomfort of likely moderate severity. The subjective focus on worsening symptoms and detailed descriptors may overstate the actual physical intensity and threat level. Additional symptoms such as exertional shortness of breath, fatigue, or precise timing of episodes are not explicitly confirmed, indicating potential underreporting or minimization. To form an accurate clinical picture, further objective assessment including symptom pattern, duration, and associated factors is necessary, while recognizing the influence of anxiety on symptom perception.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged adult of unspecified gender. Chief complaint: Episodic chest discomfort characterized by tightness and pressure, with spreading to the jaw and back, subjective worsening. Present illness: The patient reports episodes of chest tightness described as squeezing or band-like, occurring intermittently and persisting longer than initially, with associated sweating, nausea, and dizziness. The episodes are perceived as worsening over time. Due to communication patterns, the severity may be exaggerated by anxiety, but objective assessment is needed to determine true physical risk. Associated symptoms: Sweating, nausea, dizziness; other symptoms such as exertional shortness of breath or fatigue are unconfirmed but should be evaluated. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s description of episodic chest tightness and associated autonomic symptoms. - Medium confidence: The perceived worsening and severity, influenced by anxiety, may be overstated. - Low confidence: Exact duration, frequency, and additional symptoms may be underreported or emotionally exaggerated. - Missing information: Precise episode duration, triggers, relief factors, exertional symptoms, past cardiac history, risk factors, and objective findings.\nANSWER: A middle-aged adult presenting with episodic chest discomfort characterized by tightness and pressure, with reports of spreading to the jaw and back, associated with sweating, nausea, and dizziness.

The episodes appear to be intermittent and have reportedly worsened over time, though their severity may be influenced by underlying anxiety. Objective assessment is necessary to evaluate for potential cardiac or other serious causes, including symptom pattern, duration, associated exertional symptoms, and risk factors. Further diagnostic testing and risk stratification are indicated to determine appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally intense, sometimes exaggerated language to describe chest symptoms, while responses about historical context or triggers are vague or hesitant. They readily amplify the perceived severity but may downplay or omit details that could reduce concern. - Bias detected: Amplification bias influenced by anxiety, with elements of minimization regarding background history. - Confidence level: Medium; the emotional tone strongly suggests bias but cannot fully confirm with current info. - Reasoning: The significant emotional charge and exaggerated descriptors, coupled with vague history, point to anxiety-driven over-reporting and possible under-reporting of risk factors.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may have had less severe or more chronic mild symptoms that they've learned to ignore or minimize. - Withheld information: They might be hesitant to disclose past health conditions, lifestyle risks, or prior minor episodes, possibly out of shame or fear of judgment. - Amplified concerns: They are likely overestimating the threat level, influenced by anxiety, leading to an exaggerated sense of urgency and severity. - Temporal distortions: The \"out of nowhere\" onsets and recent worsening may overshadow a longer, more insidious symptomatic course that would be relevant for diagnosis.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the unbiased clinical picture is likely: The patient has episodic chest discomfort that has a gradual or insidious onset rather than sudden, with mild to moderate symptoms that may have been present over a longer period but are perceived as recent and severe due to anxiety. The episodes could be related to underlying cardiac risk factors or other medical causes, possibly worsened by emotional distress. The physical symptoms such as sweating and nausea suggest possible ischemic or other serious pathology, but the current presentation is heavily influenced by anxiety, which amplifies perceived severity and diminishes recall of background risks.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced chest discomfort before this recent episode? If so, how often, and how severe were those episodes?\" to clarify history; \"Do you have any prior heart issues or risk factors like high blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, or family history?\" to identify underlying risks; \"Are you under a lot of stress or feeling anxious recently?\" to understand psychological impact; \"Have you ever had similar symptoms that resolved on their own?\" to assess chronicity. - Approach strategy: Use a calm, non-judgmental tone, emphasizing that understanding your full history helps provide the best care and that many people have mild or long-standing symptoms they haven't yet discussed. - Priority order: First, explore past episodes and risk factors to develop a comprehensive background; second, inquire about psychological factors and stress levels to assess anxiety influence; third, clarify current symptom details, including duration, triggers, and relief measures.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description of chest tightness, pressure, and spreading to the jaw and back, along with sweating, nausea, and dizziness, suggests a serious underlying cardiac or medical condition. However, the emotional intensity and exaggerated language indicate potential amplification bias, likely influenced by anxiety, which may lead the patient to overstate the severity of symptoms. Conversely, the vague and hesitant responses regarding triggers and background history suggest that some relevant symptoms or risk factors might be minimized or withheld, whether due to anxiety, shame, or lack of awareness. The timeline of episodic symptoms \"out of nowhere\" and worsening over time may be an overgeneralization, and the patient might have experienced milder or chronic symptoms previously that were underreported. The current presentation warrants objective evaluation for cardiac ischemia and related conditions, but interpretation must consider the influence of psychological factors on patient reporting.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged adult (approximate age range), gender unspecified.  Chief complaint: Episodic chest discomfort characterized by tightness and pressure, with associated spreading to the jaw and back, and concurrent sweating, nausea, and dizziness. The patient perceives symptoms as increasing in severity.  Present illness: The patient reports that the chest tightness is like a squeezing band, initially episodic but now persistent, worsened by movement and deep breathing. Symptoms are described as coming on randomly without clear precipitating factors. Associated symptoms include sweating, nausea, and dizziness. The patient states these episodes have been worsening over a period, though exact duration and prior frequency are unclear, potentially underreporting milder or past episodes.  Associated symptoms: Sweating, nausea, dizziness. The patient does not specify past similar episodes or prior heart history. The emotional tone suggests high concern, but the history lacks detailed information about prior symptoms, risk factors, or triggers.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports chest tightness, pressure, associated spread to jaw and back, and symptoms of sweating, nausea, and dizziness. - Medium confidence: The severity and exact duration of symptoms may be overestimated due to emotional exaggeration; triggers and background history are vague. - Low confidence: Details about past episodes, risk factors, or medical history are likely incomplete or minimized. - Missing information: Past cardiac history, risk factors (smoking, hypertension, cholesterol, family history), detailed symptom chronology, and psychological stress levels.\nANSWER: A middle-aged patient presents with episodic chest discomfort described as tightness and pressure, which has become persistent and worsened over time. The symptoms include spreading to the jaw and back, with associated sweating, nausea, and dizziness.

The patient perceives these episodes as severe and increasing in intensity, but their emotional tone suggests possible amplification influenced by anxiety. The history lacks specific details about prior similar episodes, underlying risk factors, or triggers, indicating potential underreporting or minimization. Further objective assessment, including diagnostic testing and risk stratification, is necessary to evaluate for cardiac or serious medical causes, taking into account the possible influence of psychological factors on symptom reporting.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses intense, emotionally charged language and qualifiers, indicating significant anxiety influence. Responses are reactive and somewhat vague, with hesitation, suggesting discomfort with certain topics or uncertainty. They tend to amplify the severity of symptoms, possibly overreacting due to distress. - Bias detected: Amplification bias driven by anxiety, leading to exaggerated perception of symptom severity and danger. - Confidence level: Medium-high, because emotional language and response style strongly suggest bias, but physical symptoms are chronologically consistent with true episodes. - Reasoning: The combination of vivid descriptions, hesitations, qualifiers, and focus on danger points to emotional amplification. The vagueness and reactive pattern hint at possible withholding or minimization of relevant lifestyle or past history details.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may underreport triggers such as physical activity or stressors, possibly to avoid seeming irresponsible or because they are unaware of their effect. - Withheld information: Lifestyle factors like smoking, diet, or exercise habits might be concealed, which are relevant to risk assessment. - Amplified concerns: The worry about death and heart attack likely inflates the perceived danger beyond what clinical evaluation might reveal. - Temporal distortions: They may overgeneralize or misrecall the duration or severity of episodes and the context, influenced by anxiety or panic.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the patient likely experiences true episodic cardiac or panic-related symptoms with potential physical components\u2014e.g., chest tightness, sweating, nausea\u2014that are more severe than they can articulate clearly. Anxiety amplifies concerns and influences self-reporting, leading to overestimation of danger. Underlying risk factors (such as hypertension or diabetes) are present but may be understated. The true episodes might occur more frequently or be triggered by mild physical or emotional stressors. A comprehensive assessment including physical exams, cardiac workup, and psychosocial evaluation is necessary, recognizing the influence of emotional distress on symptom perception.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: Ask about smoking, alcohol, drug use, exercise habits, and stress levels to uncover lifestyle risk factors. Clarify past similar episodes, any prior medical evaluations, and the exact timing and triggers of each episode. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language to help the patient feel safe sharing sensitive information. Frame questions around their concerns (\"Are there things you might be avoiding mentioning because you feel worried or embarrassed?\") to reduce defensiveness. - Priority order: First explore lifestyle and past medical history to establish objective context, then delve into detailed episode descriptions to clarify triggers and frequency, and finally address emotional factors that might be intensifying or misrepresenting their symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication is markedly influenced by anxiety, leading to exaggerated descriptions of symptom severity and possible overreporting of danger. While the patient describes episodes of chest tightness, spreading pain, sweating, nausea, and dizziness, these reports are emotionally charged, suggesting amplification bias. The hesitation and qualifiers indicate possible discomfort or shame about disclosing behaviors or past issues, which could result in withholding relevant risk factors or triggers. Objective facts include the presence of episodic chest discomfort of variable duration, with some associated autonomic features, and known risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. However, the true frequency, specific triggers, and prior episodes are likely under- or overestimated due to psychological influences. Potential symptoms or triggers such as physical activity, stress, or other risk behaviors might be minimized or withheld. The severity of symptoms might be overrepresented, and emotional distress could be amplifying perceived danger. More detailed lifestyle and medical history are needed, and further evaluation should include objective testing and psychosocial assessment to accurately delineate cardiac versus anxiety-related causes.\nANSWER: The patient, middle-aged with a history of hypertension and diabetes, reports episodic chest tightness described as heavy pressure, which has become persistent over time and extends to the jaw and back. Associated symptoms include sweating, nausea, and dizziness during episodes. The patient perceives the episodes as severe and worsening, with reports emphasizing intensity possibly influenced by anxiety.

Due to emotional factors, the presentation may be biased toward overestimating danger, necessitating objective assessment for cardiac or other serious pathology. Further evaluation should include detailed lifestyle, medical history, and diagnostic testing to clarify etiology, accounting for psychological influences on symptom perception.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally charged, vivid language emphasizing symptoms as severe and life-threatening, with some qualifiers suggesting an attempt to downplay activity during episodes but overall intense concern. Hesitations and emphasis on fears point to anxiety-driven amplification. - Bias detected: Amplification bias affecting symptom severity and danger perception, with possible minor minimization of activities involved during episodes. - Confidence level: Medium to high, as the content shows clear signs of exaggeration driven by anxiety but appears grounded in genuine discomfort. - Reasoning: The patient\u2019s language, fears, and expressive tone indicate an over-estimation of threat severity, although his detailed descriptions suggest real sensations; the emotional charge strongly hints at anxiety influencing perception.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: He may be underreporting episodes of fainting, palpitations, or shortness of breath that he perceives as less severe but are clinically relevant. - Withheld information: Possible reluctance to acknowledge past mild episodes, or feelings of shame about prior health issues, or fears exposing vulnerability; also, potential embarrassment about initial awakening fears. - Amplified concerns: The patient is probably exaggerating the danger and intensity of symptoms to ensure prompt attention\u2014his fear of \"something deadly\" indicates an over-worrying concern. - Temporal distortions: Anxiety could be making episodes seem longer, more frequent, or more distressing than they are, or blending different episodes into a single distressing event.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the Chain of Thought, the unbiased view suggests the patient experiences episodic chest discomfort characterized by heaviness, burning, and sometimes radiation\u2014consistent with anxiety or cardiac issues. These episodes are triggered by activity or eating, last several minutes, and are accompanied by fears of severe cardiac events. While genuine physical symptoms likely exist, the subjective severity and danger perception are probably amplified by anxiety. There may also be unreported or underappreciated associated symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, or fainting. The overall clinical picture warrants cautious investigation balancing genuine medical risk with psychological influences on symptom reporting.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any palpitations, dizziness, or fainting during these episodes?\" (to uncover additional symptoms) - \"How often do these episodes occur, and how long do they typically last?\" (to clarify frequency and duration) - \"Have you ever lost consciousness or felt like you might faint?\" (to assess severity) - \"Are there particular thoughts or worries that come up when you're experiencing these symptoms?\" (to evaluate anxiety impact) - \"Have these episodes ever improved with rest or medication?\" (to gauge response to interventions) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, reassuring questions focusing on safety; acknowledge fears empathetically to reduce anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Normalize symptoms to reduce shame or embarrassment, encouraging openness. - Priority order: - Start with factual symptom questions (palpitations, fainting) to gather objective data. - Proceed to triggers and frequency to understand pattern. - Follow with psychological assessment to address anxiety\u2019s role. This systematic probing helps disentangle physiological symptoms from anxiety-related amplification, ensuring comprehensive understanding.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s vivid and emotionally charged description indicates an intent to highlight the severity of his symptoms, likely influenced by anxiety about serious cardiac issues. Such emotional expression suggests that the subjective report may overstate the danger or intensity, leading to potential exaggeration of symptom severity and associated fears. There is a possibility that the patient is minimizing or not fully reporting additional symptoms, such as palpitations, fainting, or physical activity details, that are relevant for diagnosis. His concern about a heart attack, despite no prior similar episode, further emphasizes anxiety\u2019s role in perception. Objective findings are not available from the interaction, so physical exam and diagnostics are necessary to verify symptom origin. The episodic chest tightness described as heavy, squeezing, with radiation to the jaw and back, is consistent with anginal or anxiety-related phenomena, but the emotional context mandates cautious interpretation. Communication patterns suggest the need for systematic probing to uncover unreported symptoms and evaluate psychological influences.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged male with a history of hypertension and diabetes.  Chief complaint: Episodic chest tightness described as a heavy, squeezing sensation, with radiation to the jaw and back, heightening concern for serious cardiac pathology.  Present illness: The patient reports episodes of chest discomfort characterized by a sensation of tightness, heaviness, and burning, which come on suddenly and have been occurring more frequently. The episodes last several minutes and are triggered by activity and eating, with some worsening when resting or breathing deep. The patient describes fear during episodes of passing out or experiencing a life-threatening event. He reports associated sweating, nausea, dizziness, and concerns about a heart attack, although prior similar episodes have not been reported. Communication suggests the possibility of emotional amplification, and actual physical symptom severity may be underestimated or unreported, such as palpitations or fainting episodes.  Associated symptoms: Sweating, nausea, dizziness, fear of passing out. Confidence in the accuracy of these symptoms is moderate; additional symptoms like palpitations or fainting are not explicitly reported but could be present.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The nature, location, and radiation of chest symptoms; associated symptoms as described by the patient. - Medium confidence: The actual severity of symptoms, as emotional factors may amplify perception; the precise frequency, duration, and triggers. - Low confidence: The true extent of unreported symptoms (palpitations, fainting), and the physical examination findings pending diagnostics. - Missing information: Objective vital signs, physical exam findings, ECG, cardiac enzyme levels, and further history on symptom onset, pattern, and response to rest or medications.\nANSWER: The patient, a middle-aged male with a history of hypertension and diabetes, reports episodic chest discomfort characterized by heavy, squeezing sensations that radiate to the jaw and back. These episodes are sudden in onset, last several minutes, and are triggered by activity and eating, with worsening symptoms observed during rest or deep breathing. He expresses significant fear of a cardiac event, such as a heart attack, and reports accompanying sweating, nausea, and dizziness. Communication patterns suggest his perception of severity may be amplified by anxiety, while he might underreport additional symptoms like palpitations or episodes of fainting. Objective assessment and diagnostic testing are necessary to determine whether his symptoms are cardiac in origin or related to anxiety, considering the potential for emotional factors to influence symptom perception.",
