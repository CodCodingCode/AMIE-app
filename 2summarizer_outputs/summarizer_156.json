The consistency of avoidance across this exchange supports this interpretation, though more data would strengthen certainty.\n- Reasoning: The patient\u2019s lack of elaboration, explicit refusal, and guarded tone reflect conscious or unconscious efforts to hide sensitive details, indicating significant bias affecting their self-reporting.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Would you feel comfortable sharing more about what makes this topic difficult to discuss?\" (to explore underlying shame or anxiety)\n- \"Can you tell me about any thoughts or feelings that occur related to this behavior?\" (to uncover internal experiences)\n- \"Are there specific situations or times when these behaviors happen more often?\" (to gather contextual details)\n- \"Have you ever felt distressed or conflicted about these feelings or actions?\" (to assess internal distress)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone, emphasizing confidentiality and support, to create a safe space.\n- Normalize their feelings (\"Many people find discussing certain topics hard\") to reduce shame.\n- Gently encourage elaboration without pressuring\u2014validating any disclosures to build trust.\n- Priority order:\n- Start with questions about emotional experiences related to the behaviors to address shame.\n- Proceed to contextual questions about frequency, situations, and triggers to fill in behavioral details.\n- Focus on building rapport before probing sensitive specifics to minimize further avoidance.",
