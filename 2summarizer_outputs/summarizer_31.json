I haven\u2019t noticed losing weight or feeling super tired, at least not that I know of.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent redness, warmth, or tenderness around the swelling, or any new symptoms like fever, weakness, or fatigue?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really noticed it being more red or warm than before, and I don't think I have a fever or anything like that. But sometimes it does feel a bit tender, especially if I touch it or move around a lot. I'm not sure if that counts or not.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me the exact location of the swelling (e.g., upper arm, thigh, calf), and whether it feels firm, soft, rubbery, or cystic? Additionally, do you notice any internal movement of the swelling when you press on it?\\nPATIENT: It\u2019s kind of in the lower part, like, more towards the middle of the area I told you about. It feels pretty firm, maybe a little swollen, but I can't really tell if it\u2019s soft or not. When I press on it, I don\u2019t think I feel anything moving inside, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s supposed to happen.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in the skin over the swelling, such as redness, warmth, or any break in the skin? Additionally, have you experienced any recent fever, chills, or night sweats?\\nPATIENT: No, uh, I don't think so. The skin doesn't look red or warm or anything like that. I haven't had a fever or chills or night sweats, but I guess I just feel kinda tired and uncomfortable sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if the swelling has been growing more quickly recently or if it has become more painful or tender over time?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I guess it\u2019s been kind of the same for a little while, but lately, it feels a tiny bit more uncomfortable, I think. I haven\u2019t really noticed it getting bigger quickly or anything, but I just feel kind of weird about it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, weakness, or reduced sensation in the affected limb since the swelling appeared?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really noticed anything like that. Just the swelling and some discomfort, but no numbness or tingling that I can tell.\\nDOCTOR: Has the swelling remained consistent in position, or does it seem to shift or move slightly when you change your position or press on it?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it kind of stays in the same spot most of the time, but sometimes when I press or if I move around, it feels like maybe it shifts a little, sort of, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s actually moving or just in my head.",
