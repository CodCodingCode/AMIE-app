Also, does she know her genetic or family history, and has she ever undergone genetic testing or imaging studies like pelvic ultrasound?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I have a webbed neck or anything like that, and I guess I\u2019m not really sure about my family history. I haven\u2019t had any genetic tests or pelvic ultrasounds before, so I don\u2019t really know if I have extra features or not. I just know I never got my period and I\u2019ve always been a bit confused about all of this.\\nDOCTOR: Has she undergone any hormonal testing, such as measuring serum FSH, LH, estradiol, or other relevant hormones? If so, what were the results?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I think they took some blood and checked my hormones or something. I didn\u2019t really understand all of it, but I remember the numbers were kinda weird or something, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Has she had any hormonal blood tests performed specifically measuring serum FSH, LH, estradiol, or inhibin B levels? If so, what were the exact values?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I haven't really gotten all those blood tests done yet. I\u2019m not totally sure what the numbers would've been, honestly.\\nDOCTOR: Have the results of her hormonal tests, specifically her serum FSH, LH, and estradiol levels, been shared with you, and if so, what did they show?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think they showed some stuff was kind of high, especially the male hormones, but I didn't really get what all of it meant. I just know they did some tests and said things were different than normal.\\nDOCTOR: Has she undergone or would she be willing to have additional hormonal testing, such as serum testosterone, DHEA-S, or an ovarian/adrenal ultrasound, to better understand the source of her elevated androgens?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess so... I don't really understand all those tests, but if it helps find out why I feel the way I do or what's going on, I guess I can try.\\nDOCTOR: Would you be willing to undergo a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the presence or absence of internal reproductive structures, and can we review your detailed hormonal test results together to interpret her estrogen and androgen levels more precisely?\\nPATIENT: I guess\u2026 if it helps, I don't really understand all of that stuff, but I suppose if it can help figure things out, I don't mind trying the ultrasound. And yeah, I think looking at the test results together is probably okay, I just want to know what's going on.",
