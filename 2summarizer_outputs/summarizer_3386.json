If so, could you tell me how this affects your daily activities and whether these eye movement issues seem to improve or worsen over time?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, sometimes it's hard for me to look up or down, like my eyes just don't want to move the way I want them to. It makes it hard to read stuff or look at things above me, and it feels worse sometimes if I try to look up quickly. It's kind of annoying, and I think it gets worse when I\u2019m tired or anxious.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation adds details confirming that the patient experiences occasional abnormal eye movements (jerking or not moving properly) when attempting to look in directions, particularly up or down, which can make reading and looking at things difficult. The patient reports that these eye movement issues worsen when tired or anxious. The patient does not report limb stiffness, tremors, or changes in blood pressure or heart rate. The unsteadiness and falls have been worsening over the past couple of years, and symptoms are exacerbated by multitasking, fatigue, or anxiety. The symptoms include feeling unsteady, wobbly, and sometimes dizzy or visually strange, leading to falls more often now, even inside the house.  \nANSWER: The patient has worsening unsteadiness and falls over the past couple of years, feeling unsteady and wobbly especially when multitasking or tired. Symptoms improve when sitting still. They experience occasional abnormal eye movements, such as jerking or difficulty moving eyes correctly when looking up or down, which worsens when tired or anxious. They sometimes feel dizzy or visually odd, and their speech can sound strange or hard to control. They fall more often now, including inside the house, especially when focusing or tired. They are unsure of the cause of these symptoms and seeking medical help."
