    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: I don\u2019t know exactly why we\u2019re here, but she\u2019s been very sleepy and isn\u2019t eating well the last couple of days. She\u2019s been throwing up and just seems really weak and hard to wake sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me when these symptoms started, how they have changed over the last few days, and if you've noticed any other symptoms like fever, rash, joint pain, or recent illnesses?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, it all kinda started around two days ago, I think. She was acting a bit more tired than usual and just not herself. Yesterday she seemed a little worse, and she was fussy when she didn\u2019t want to eat. I haven't noticed any fever or rashes or anything like that, and she hasn't been sick with anything recent, I don't think.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how she's been acting at home, any changes you've noticed in her behavior or movements, and whether she has had any recent falls, injuries, or exposure to anyone sick?\\nPATIENT: Well, she\u2019s been kind of more sleepy than usual, and when she\u2019s awake, she\u2019s been fussy and hard to settle. Sometimes she seems stiff or like she\u2019s not moving normally, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s recent or if it\u2019s always been like that. She hasn\u2019t fallen or hurt herself that I know of, and she hasn\u2019t been around anyone sick that I\u2019m aware of\u2014at least, no one that I\u2019ve noticed.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how she has been acting at home\u2014any recent changes in her behavior, movements, or routines\u2014and if there have been any incidents or exposures that you\u2019re concerned about?\\nPATIENT: She\u2019s been kind of sleepy and more fussy than usual, and she doesn\u2019t seem to want to eat much. Sometimes she feels like she\u2019s really upset or uncomfortable, and she seems to get worse if she\u2019s not feeding. We haven\u2019t noticed anything obvious she\u2019s been around or done that\u2019s different, but she\u2019s just been more quiet and not herself.\\nDOCTOR: Has she had any recent vaccinations, or been exposed to anyone with infections or illnesses, or traveled recently?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think she had her shots not long ago, but I can't really remember exactly when or if she was around anyone sick lately. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.\\nDOCTOR: Has she had any recent illnesses, such as colds, ear infections, or other symptoms in the household, or been in contact with anyone sick in the past week?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s been sick really, but I\u2019m not sure. We did just stay home mostly, and no one\u2019s had a cold or anything, I think. It\u2019s all been a little confusing for me.\\nDOCTOR: Has she been exposed to anyone with recent infections, or has she had any other illnesses in the household, such as cold, cough, or diarrhea, in the past week?\\nPATIENT: Umm, no, I don't think so. We haven't seen anyone sick at home or anything like that. She's just been, uh, more tired than usual and not eating well, but we haven't noticed any cough or fever or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Has she had any recent infections in the household, such as colds, ear infections, or gastrointestinal illnesses, or been exposed to anyone sick in the past week?\\nPATIENT: Um, we didn't notice anything really obvious. No one seemed sick or had a fever or anything like that, I think. But the baby has been a little more fussy than usual, maybe.\\nDOCTOR: Could you tell me if she has shown any signs of neck stiffness, extreme sensitivity to light, or headache that might suggest meningeal irritation?\\nPATIENT: No, she hasn't been showing anything like that. She just kind of seems really tired and a bit fussy, but I haven't seen her stiff or bothered by lights or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Has she shown any signs of neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, or a severe headache that might suggest meningeal irritation?\\nPATIENT: No, she doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered by lights or anything like that. She mostly looks tired and a little more fussy than usual, but I haven\u2019t seen her stiff or trying to turn her head away or anything like that.",
