The patient's chief complaint is directly conveyed as their reason for visiting, so the model notes exactly that. Demographic data is limited to age and gender\u2014specifically, a woman, with no age provided\u2014so only those facts are included. For the history of present illness, the model should detail the onset (around two weeks ago, with episodes starting suddenly), the nature of the episodes (lasting less than a minute, triggered by head movement or lying down, sometimes with nausea), their progression (more frequent over time), and current status (still occurring, worsening or not specified). Symptoms explicitly reported are dizziness and nausea. The patient explicitly denies hearing loss or unusual hearing phenomena. Missing information includes the precise frequency per day or week, the severity, impact on activities, a detailed description of episodes, past medical history, medications, recent activities, and other systemic symptoms\u2014all of which were not addressed explicitly in this conversation. The summary should organize these facts systematically, stay faithful to the patient\u2019s words, and clearly identify gaps without inferring any additional information.\nANSWER: The patient reports feeling dizzy sometimes when turning the head or lying down, lasting a short period. The patient is a woman; age was not specified. The dizziness episodes began approximately two weeks ago, with sudden onset, lasting less than a minute; they are triggered by turning the head quickly, lying down, or rolling over in bed. The episodes have become more frequent over time. Currently, the patient experiences dizziness a few times per day, particularly when turning the head or getting into bed, with a sensation of room spinning and sometimes nausea during episodes. The patient reports no hearing loss or hearing phenomena. Missing information includes the exact current frequency of episodes per day or week, their severity, impact on daily activities, detailed description of episodes, past medical history, medications, recent activities, or other systemic symptoms.",

It kind of comes on suddenly and then goes away pretty fast, like in less than a minute. It mostly happens when I turn my head quickly or when I lie down or roll over in bed. Sometimes I feel kind of nauseous during those spells, but I don't hear anything strange or feel hearing loss. It\\u2019s been happening more frequently lately, I think. I don\\u2019t really know if it\\u2019s gotten worse or better, but it\\u2019s definitely bothering me. I'm worried because I don't know what\\u2019s causing it or if I should be more concerned.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me how often these dizziness episodes are happening now and whether they have become more or less frequent recently?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, um, I think they happen a little more often now. At first, it was just kind of when I turned my head quickly, but lately, it feels like it's happening a bit more, and sometimes I get dizzy even just lying down or rolling over in bed. But I'm not sure if that's a big difference or not.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you describe how many times you experience these dizziness episodes each day or week, and how they affect your activities?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, um, I think I sometimes get dizzy... maybe like a few times a day? It\\u2019s kind of hard to say exactly, but definitely when I turn my head or get into bed. It\\u2019s pretty quick, just a moment, but I feel like the room\\u2019s spinning a little. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous too during these spells, but it doesn\\u2019t last long. I haven\\u2019t counted how many times exactly, but it\\u2019s been happening more often over the last couple of weeks.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you noticed if your dizziness improves or worsens when you sit or lie down and if your blood pressure readings are different at those times?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, um, yes, I do notice that when I turn my head or lie down, I feel that spinning sensation and sometimes I feel a little sick. I haven't really checked if my blood pressure changes, but I guess it might be different sometimes when I\\u2019m lying down or sitting. I haven\\u2019t measured it myself, though.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you describe how these dizziness episodes affect your daily activities\\u2014do they cause you to lose balance, fall, or feel unsteady even after the episode ends?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, um, I guess it sort of makes me feel unsteady sometimes, especially when I turn my head quickly or lie down. I haven't actually fallen or anything, but I do worry I might. It\\u2019s like, I feel off balance for a little while after, but it doesn't last long.
