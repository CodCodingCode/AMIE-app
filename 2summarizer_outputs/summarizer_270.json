I guess, getting worse over the last few months. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m looking through a fog, especially in my right eye, and sometimes I see a dark spot right in the center of my vision. My color vision doesn\\u2019t seem as sharp either. I don\\u2019t really have any pain or anything, just these changes. It worries me because my family has a history of optic nerve problems, and I have a mitochondrial disorder that runs in my family. I came in because I\\u2019m pretty anxious about what\\u2019s happening and I want to know if it\\u2019s permanent or if I might go blind.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes her visual impairments with emotional language, emphasizing worry and fear, yet provides specific symptom descriptions. She minimizes minor discomforts and focuses heavily on her emotional state, which influences her perception of severity. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias is prominent, driven by her anxiety about potential blindness and genetic risks. - Confidence level: Medium. Her subjective report is coherent but affected by internal emotional bias, which could distort true clinical severity. - Reasoning: Her detailed symptom description coupled with emotional expressions suggests her perception of risk is exaggerated by anxiety. The underreporting of minor symptoms and focus on emotional concerns indicates her narrative may be skewed.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild visual fluctuations or early signs may be dismissed or not perceived as significant by her, given her focus on major fears. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose emotional distress or additional subtle symptoms she considers unimportant or embarrassing. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of blindness and rapid progression likely overstate the actual clinical threat; emotional overlay inflates perceived severity. - Temporal distortions: Her perception of a gradual decline may be accurate, but emotional distress could intensify the perceived urgency, potentially leading to misjudgment of progression rate.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely indicates that: - She has experienced a gradual decline in visual function over several months, consistent with her report, though the severity could be more than perceived. - Minor visual disturbances and early ocular symptoms may be underreported due to her minimization. - Her emotional state inflates her perceived risk, possibly leading to an exaggerated focus on potential blindness. - The actual clinical picture warrants thorough examination to explore subtle changes and emotional impact.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any other visual changes, such as peripheral disturbances or intermittent blurriness?\" to uncover overlooked symptoms. - \"How often do you experience visual fog or dark spots\u2014are they constant or intermittent?\" to assess symptom variability. - \"Do you feel anxious or distressed about your vision constantly, or only at certain times?\" to evaluate emotional impact. - \"Have you noticed any other eye discomforts or headaches?\" to explore other related symptoms. - Approach strategy: - Frame questions with empathy and reassurance, emphasizing that minor symptoms are common and important to assess. - Use open-ended questions to allow her to disclose subtle issues she might be minimizing. - Gently challenge her minimizations by confirming details and clarifying inconsistencies. - Priority order: 1. Clarify the presence of additional visual symptoms\u2014less emotional bias. 2. Explore her emotional state and impact on perception\u2014understand anxiety's role. 3. Confirm timeline details and progression to gauge true symptom evolution\u2014reduce bias influence. 4. Assess for any other ocular or neurological symptoms\u2014ensure comprehensive evaluation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports worsening vision over several months, describing fogging and a dark central spot with decreased color vision, but emphasizes emotional distress and concern about potential blindness. Her communication patterns indicate that emotional amplification bias may inflate her perception of symptom severity, and she may minimize minor or intermittent issues. She also has a family history of ocular and mitochondrial disorders, which increases her anxiety and may contribute to an overestimation of risk. It is probable that her visual disturbances are more subtle or variable than she perceives, and she may be withholding or underreporting mild or less distressing symptoms. Her focus on catastrophic outcomes suggests her subjective history is influenced by emotional factors, and objective findings require thorough clinical examination to delineate true severity from perceived impairment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 42-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Perceived progressive visual decline, mainly described as fogging and a central dark spot, with associated decreased color vision.  Present illness: The patient reports over several months a gradual decline in visual clarity and perception of a dark central scotoma, with no associated ocular pain. Based on her communication analysis, the actual severity may be less than perceived, with minor visual disturbances possibly underreported. She expresses significant anxiety about the risk of vision loss, likely amplifying her perception of symptoms. An objective examination is necessary to assess for subtle visual changes, optic nerve status, and other ocular or neurological signs. Her timeline suggests gradual progression, though emotional distress may inflate perceived urgency.  Associated symptoms: No other ocular discomforts, headaches, or neurological deficits reported; however, there may be unreported or minimized minor visual fluctuations.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Patient\u2019s age, gender, and reported symptom chronology. - Medium confidence: Severity and extent of visual symptoms due to emotional bias. - Low confidence: Complete accuracy of symptom severity, potential overlooked minor symptoms. - Missing information: Objective visual acuity, detailed ocular examination findings, and assessment of other neurological signs to clarify true clinical status.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient articulates concern with detailed imagery but uses vague, hedged language about onset and severity, indicating emotional distress and memory uncertainty. She fluctuates between expressing anxiety and minimizing the impact, suggesting emotional amplification combined with possible denial or underreporting. - Bias detected: Confusion about timeline (chronology bias), emotional magnification, and mild minimization are influencing her reporting. - Confidence level: Medium; her emotional distress and vagueness lower certainty about her self-report accuracy, but her expressive language and concern are genuine. - Reasoning: The mixture of vagueness, hedging, and emotional qualifiers points to biases affecting her history. Her concern likely reflects real anxiety, but the factual details are clouded by memory and emotion.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be underreporting the severity of functional impairment\u2014what she calls \"these changes\" could be more limiting or progressively worsening, affecting daily activities. - Withheld information: She could be hesitant to disclose associated symptoms like visual fluctuation or additional neurological signs; emotional distress might also prevent her from fully expressing fears or other symptoms. - Amplified concerns: Her high anxiety may overstate the immediacy or severity of her risk of blindness or irreversible damage. - Temporal distortions: The vague timeframe and fuzzy recall imply the actual onset and progression could either be more insidious or more episodic, but her memory isn\u2019t precise enough to clarify this.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the likely true clinical scenario involves a progressive visual disturbance developing over several months, possibly related to her mitochondrial disorder and family history, which might be more disabling than her verbal report suggests. Her emotional overlay may be heightening her perceived threat and complicating history accuracy. The actual progression could be more gradual, with episodic worsening, and other symptoms (like visual fatigue, light sensitivity, or fluctuating vision) might be present but unarticulated. Her fears are justified but may be exaggerated; her functional impairment needs objective confirmation, and emotional support may help clarify her needs.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * Can you describe exactly how your vision changes day-to-day? Are there times it improves or worsens? (to clarify fluctuation vs. steady decline) * Have you noticed any other visual symptoms, such as light sensitivity, double vision, or eye pain? (to uncover overlooked signs) * How does this affect your daily activities\u2014driving, reading, work? (to evaluate functional impact) * Are you experiencing other neurological symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or numbness? (to assess broader neurological involvement) * Can you recall when you first noticed these changes and whether they have been constant or variable? (to better delineate timeline) * How are you coping emotionally? Do you feel overwhelmed or anxious outside of this? (to assess overall psychological state) - Approach strategy: Use open, nonjudgmental questions, validate her concerns, and gently guide her to provide specific examples. Emphasize that detailed information helps provide the best care, which can reduce her anxiety. Incorporate empathetic listening to build trust and facilitate disclosure. - Priority order: Start with functional impact questions to establish how significant her visual changes are in daily life, then explore associated symptoms, followed by clarifying the timeline with concrete examples. This approach ensures comprehensive understanding while addressing emotional distress early.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports gradual visual changes over several months, including perceived blurring, foggy vision, a central dark spot, and decreased color sharpness, predominantly in the right eye. Her language indicates emotional distress, anxiety, and some ambiguity about the timeline and severity, suggesting she may be magnifying her symptoms or experiencing some denial. She minimizes severity by denying pain or sudden disturbances but expresses concern that the condition could worsen or lead to blindness. There is a chance she is underreporting additional symptoms like fluctuating vision, light sensitivity, or other neurological signs. Her family history of optic nerve issues and mitochondrial disorder are relevant but do not confirm specific pathology without further tests. Her communication patterns suggest her functional impairment may be more significant than she describes. Objective examination findings are not available here, so clinical assessment must rely on her subjective report, interpreted with bias awareness.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 42-year-old female. Chief complaint: Progressive visual disturbances, including blurriness, central dark spots, and decreased color vision, predominantly in the right eye, developing over several months. Present illness: The patient reports a gradual decline in vision over recent months, characterized by a fog or tunnel vision sensation and a dark central spot. She denies ocular pain or acute visual loss and is concerned about potential permanent damage or blindness. Her description may understate the current level of visual impairment, which could be more severe or functionally limiting. She has a family history of optic nerve problems and a mitochondrial disorder but has not provided details on other symptoms. The timeline suggests a slow progression, but emotional distress and anxiety may influence her perception. Associated symptoms: No specific neurological symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, or numbness have been reported; further inquiry needed. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The nature of her reported visual changes and the timeline of progression. - Medium confidence: Severity and extent of functional impairment, potential additional symptoms, and precise progression details\u2014these may be exaggerated or minimized. - Low confidence: The actual acuity levels, objective findings, and any associated neurological signs or symptoms are unknown. - Missing information: Formal ophthalmologic examination and imaging data, detailed family history, and neuro-ophthalmologic assessment are needed for confirmation.\nANSWER: A 42-year-old female presents with several months of gradually worsening visual disturbances, including blurriness, a central dark spot, and reduced color perception, primarily affecting the right eye. The patient reports episodes of foggy or tunnel vision but denies ocular pain or sudden vision loss. Her concerns about permanence and potential blindness are driven by subjective perception, which may be amplified by emotional distress. She has a family history of optic nerve issues and mitochondrial disorders. Objective assessment and diagnostic testing are necessary to determine the underlying cause and severity of her visual impairment.",

The patient reports episodes of foggy or tunnel vision but denies ocular pain or sudden vision loss. Her concerns about permanence and potential blindness are driven by subjective perception, which may be amplified by emotional distress. She has a family history of optic nerve issues and mitochondrial disorders. Objective assessment and diagnostic testing are necessary to determine the underlying cause and severity of her visual impairment.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\n**COMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:** - Pattern observed: The patient employs cautious, tentative language, and hedges her descriptions with qualifiers like \"kind of blurry,\" \"maybe,\" and \"I think,\" indicating hesitance and possible minimization of severity. She is emotionally expressive about her anxiety and fears, but her responses suggest internal conflict and uncertainty. Her mention of vague timelines and slow progression hints at response confusion, with some avoidance of fully committing to specific details. - Bias detected: The primary biases are response confusion and mild minimization. The patient appears to understate the severity and has difficulty recalling exact timelines, possibly to avoid further anxiety or because of genuine memory issues compounded by emotional distress. - Confidence level: Medium; the pattern of hesitation and qualifying language supports this assessment, though her overall coherence lends some reliability to her account. - Reasoning: The evidence of hedging, vague timelines, and emotional tone indicates response confusion and minimization biases that likely hinder an accurate detailed history.  **LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION:** - Minimized symptoms: The true severity and speed of vision loss may be understated; she might be experiencing more profound visual impairment or more rapid deterioration than she reports. - Withheld information: She may be hesitant to share early subtle symptoms, peripheral deficits, or episodic fluctuations that she perceives as insignificant but clinically relevant. - Amplified concerns: Her anxiety and fear of blindness probably lead her to overemphasize the permanency and severity, possibly exaggerating the risk based on her family history. - Temporal distortions: The actual onset of symptoms could be earlier, with initial minor disturbances going unnoticed or forgotten, making the reported timeline somewhat delayed or compressed.  **OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE:** Based on the analysis, the true clinical picture may involve a more gradual and possibly earlier onset of visual changes than the patient perceives, with symptoms that could be more severe or fluctuating. Her emotional distress might amplify her worries, but she may have experienced some minor earlier deficits that went unnoticed or unremembered. The progression could be insidious, with some early symptoms being subtle or dismissed, leading to an underestimation of severity and an inaccurate timeline. Her concerns about worsening and risk of blindness are valid but possibly based on an incomplete recall of her early signs.  **RECOMMENDED_PROBING:** - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you recall if you noticed any changes in peripheral vision or things like seeing halos or needing more light to see clearly before now?\" (to identify earlier unreported symptoms) - \"Have your symptoms fluctuated, improved at times, or suddenly worsened?\" (to assess variability) - \"Did you experience any episodes of sudden vision loss or blurriness that lasted seconds or minutes?\" (to clarify episodic issues) - \"Are there specific activities that seem to make your vision worse or better?\" (to understand functional impact)  - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, open-ended questions that normalize early symptoms to reduce anxiety about admitting minor issues. - Offer reassurance that early subtle signs are common and important to understand, encouraging detailed recounting. - Frame questions to explore consistency without implying judgment, helping her feel comfortable sharing uncertain or incomplete memories.  - Priority order: 1. Clarify early symptoms and initial onset to reconstruct an accurate timeline. 2. Investigate fluctuation or episodic features, which may signal different pathology. 3. Explore functional impact and specific situations that worsen her vision to guide examination and diagnosis. 4. Assess emotional state and fears explicitly to address anxiety that influences her perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's hesitant and hedging language suggests response confusion and potential minimization of symptom severity. She describes a gradual worsening of vision over several months, with subjective impressions of fog, tunnel vision, and a dark central spot. Her emphasis on anxiety and family history indicates concern but may lead her to overstate fears of irreversible damage or blindness. Given these communication patterns, actual severity may be greater, or onset earlier, than reported. She may also be withholding or not fully recalling earlier subtler symptoms or episodic fluctuations. Therefore, while her report points to a progressive visual disturbance, the true extent and timeline likely underestimate the initial symptom onset and may be more severe or variable than she perceives. Additional probing is necessary to clarify early symptoms, episodic changes, and functional impact.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 42-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Gradually worsening visual disturbances, including blurriness, a central dark spot, and reduced color perception, primarily affecting the right eye.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing worsening vision over the past several months, with descriptions of foggy or tunnel vision and a dark central spot. She states the initial symptoms appeared approximately three months ago but is uncertain about the exact onset. The visual deterioration appears progressive, with worsening in the right eye. She denies ocular pain, headaches, or episodes of sudden vision loss. Her account suggests a slow progression, but communication bias indicates the possibility of earlier, subtler symptoms or more rapid initial deterioration not recognized or recalled. She expresses concern about the permanence of her symptoms and risk of blindness but may be influenced by anxiety, leading to potential overestimation of severity.  Associated symptoms: No reports of pain, diplopia, or flashes; the patient's descriptions do not include other ocular or neurological symptoms with high confidence. The possibility of earlier mild visual disturbances not reported cannot be ruled out.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The current visual symptoms as described\u2014blurriness, central dark spot, and color perception issues\u2014are acknowledged and likely present. - Medium confidence: The exact timeline, initial onset, and full severity are uncertain due to communication hesitancy and hedging. - Low confidence: The true extent of early or episodic symptoms and potential fluctuations remains unclear. - Missing information: Additional details on episodes of sudden vision changes, peripheral vision, early subtle symptoms, and fluctuating nature of vision are needed for a comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Evidence includes inconsistent symptom onset reports, vague descriptions, and exaggerated worry expressed through impactful language. - Confidence level: Medium, because her overall narrative appears genuine but clouded by cognitive and emotional biases, affecting exact historical accuracy. - Reasoning: These patterns suggest her current account is shaped by anxiety and memory confusion, leading to underreporting of early symptoms and overemphasizing current severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may have experienced earlier mild disturbances, floaters, or intermittent blurriness that she dismisses or does not recall, potentially indicating a longer-standing, slowly progressing issue. - Withheld information: She might feel embarrassed about neglecting early signs or unsure about what is relevant, leading to underreporting. - Amplified concerns: She might be overestimating the current severity due to anxiety, perceiving her symptoms as worse than they are objectively. - Temporal distortions: The timeline likely underestimates the true duration, with an earlier onset not fully remembered, leading her to believe symptoms appeared more suddenly recently.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the clinical picture probably involves a longer, insidious onset of visual changes that began months earlier, with initial subtle symptoms unrecognized or dismissed by the patient. The current symptoms\u2014vision blurriness, dark spots, tunnel vision\u2014are likely more advanced; her emotional response may be amplifying her perception of severity. Recent redness and tearing post-soccer are probably reactive but unrelated to the core progression. The overall condition suggests a gradually progressing ocular pathology, such as a degenerative or vascular process, with early signs possibly missed or not remembered accurately.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any floaters, flashes of light, or any brief episodes of visual disturbance\u2014no matter how small\u2014earlier in the past months or years?\" - \"Have you ever had any eye pain, sensitivity to light, or other uncomfortable eye sensations before the recent redness?\" - \"When you think back, were there days or times when your vision was slightly blurry or different, even if it wasn't as noticeable or alarming as now?\" - \"Did anyone in your family experience similar eye issues or visual problems that you are aware of?\" - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language to explore early symptoms, emphasizing that subtle issues can be important. - Normalize memory difficulties and reassure that recalling detailed timelines is challenging for many patients. - Encourage her to describe recent changes clearly, then gently probe into earlier periods. - Priority order: - Start with clarifying recent visual symptoms (more reliable), then systematically explore earlier signs. This order helps build rapport and gathers reliable data first and then fills gaps with sensitive questioning about past symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication shows hesitation, inconsistent timelines, and an emotional tone that likely amplifies her perception of symptom severity. She reports progressively worsening vision, including blurriness, dark spots, and tunnel vision, with onset estimated around three months ago, though she is uncertain about the exact timing. Her recent redness and tearing are probably reactive events related to recent eye irritation or trauma after playing soccer, offset the core pathology. She may be underreporting early or subtle symptoms, such as mild floaters or intermittent blurriness, due to recall difficulties or minimization. Her expressed concern and worry may inflate her current symptom severity. Therefore, the objective clinical picture suggests a gradually progressive ocular or neurological condition affecting the visual pathway, with a longer insidious onset than her history indicates. Additional probing of early symptoms and family history is needed to clarify the underlying cause.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 42-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Progressive visual disturbances, described as blurriness and dark central spots, with recent ocular redness and tearing.  Present illness: The patient reports that approximately three months ago she began experiencing visual changes characterized by blurriness, a dark central spot, and tunnel vision.

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Linda\u2019s responses are hesitant, scattered, and laden with hedging language, indicating uncertainty and possible difficulty recalling or fully acknowledging her symptoms. - Bias detected: The primary biases include confusion (due to inconsistent and vague recall) and minimization (possibly underreporting symptom severity or progression). - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her communication pattern points to real uncertainty, but some details are likely underestimated or blurred. - Reasoning: As her language reveals hesitance and inconsistency, she appears unsure about the timeline and extent of her visual decline, which influences the clarity of her history.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She is probably underreporting the severity of her visual loss, possibly downplaying recent deterioration or associated visual disturbances like floaters or flashes, which she may not recognize as significant. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to admit to confusion, memory lapses, or feelings of shame about her uncertainty or perceived health decline. - Amplified concerns: Her anxiety about blindness is evident, but she might be amplifying her worries internally without fully acknowledging the extent of her actual symptoms. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of onset and progression may be misrepresented\u2014she could be overestimating the duration or underestimating the rapidity of decline, given her confusion and vagueness.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, Linda\u2019s true clinical picture likely involves more significant and possibly more rapid visual deterioration than she reports, with underlying confusion affecting her recall of symptom progression. She probably experiences additional visual symptoms (floaters, flashes) that she is not fully aware of or is hesitant to disclose. The recent redness and tearing are likely secondary to an inflammatory or infectious process overlaying her chronic visual decline. Her fears of blindness are genuine but may be disproportionately heightened by her uncertainty and emotional distress.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \u201cCan you describe any other visual changes you\u2019ve noticed, such as floaters, flashes, or pain?\u201d (to uncover overlooked associated symptoms) - \u201cHow has your vision affected your daily activities over the past few months?\u201d (to gauge functional impact) - \u201cAre you experiencing any problems with light sensitivity or difficulty seeing in low light?\u201d (to assess severity) - \u201cCan you recall if your vision has been worsening gradually or if you noticed certain episodes more suddenly?\u201d (to clarify progression) - \u201cHas anyone close to you noticed changes in your vision or mentioned any concerns?\u201d (to corroborate her account) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language to reduce anxiety and encourage openness. - Invite her to describe her experiences in her own words, avoiding pressure for precise dates. - Validate her feelings of uncertainty while guiding her to provide more specific observations. - Priority order: 1. Clarify symptom types and associated visual phenomena (floaters, flashes). 2. Explore functional impact and daily life effects. 3. Probe for timeline details and changes over time. 4. Cross-check with family or support persons if possible, to corroborate her account.  This approach will help uncover the full scope of her visual condition, address gaps, and support a comprehensive clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication indicates hesitancy, scattered responses, and possible minimization or confusion regarding her symptoms. She reports a gradual and somewhat vague perception of visual worsening over several months, with specific mention of fog, tunnel vision, and a dark central spot. Her description of recent redness and tearing following playing soccer may be recent and exaggerated or underrecognized since she states her vision has remained \"about the same\" or \"a little worse.\" She may be underreporting acute symptoms such as floaters, flashes, or pain, and her memory of symptom onset and progression is unreliable due to her confusion. Anxiety and emotional distress likely influence her reporting, possibly amplifying her concern about blindness. Her longstanding visual changes could be more severe and have evolved more rapidly than she perceives. Additional symptoms like floaters or flashes may be present but are underdisclosed. Objective assessment should include clarification of these features, corroboration from support persons, and detailed exam findings to determine the true extent and nature of her visual impairment.\nANSWER: The patient is a 42-year-old female presenting with a history of progressive visual disturbances over several months, including perceived fogginess, tunnel vision, and a dark central scotoma. She reports these changes began approximately three months ago, with a gradual worsening. Recent episodes of redness and tearing occurred after playing soccer two days prior, which she associates with her current ocular discomfort. She denies significant pain but describes visual changes as slightly worse or unchanged, with possible underreporting of additional symptoms such as floaters or flashes. Her communication suggests confusion about symptom timing and severity, potentially indicating more significant underlying visual pathology. Her history includes familial optic nerve issues and a mitochondrial disorder, which may increase her risk for optic or retinal pathology. Examination and further testing are necessary to clarify the full scope of her visual deficits, correlate her subjective symptoms with objective findings, and guide management.",
