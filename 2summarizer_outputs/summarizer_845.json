I get so dizzy, like I might faint, and I\\u2019m just so tired, even when I haven\\u2019t done much. I\\u2019m worried it\\u2019s something with my heart or maybe a new problem.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Margaret communicates with emotionally charged, descriptive language emphasizing severity and distress, with an anxious tone that magnifies her symptoms. - Bias detected: Amplification bias due to anxiety, inflating her perception of symptom severity and urgency. - Confidence level: Medium to high; the emotional descriptors strongly suggest amplification but do not necessarily distort all factual details. - Reasoning: Her vivid descriptions and focus on worsening symptoms are typical of anxiety-driven amplification, though her report likely contains some accurate core symptoms.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild or transient episodes, previous baseline feelings, or less alarming signs that she perceives as insignificant or irrelevant. - Withheld information: She does not seem embarrassed, but she might underreport reassurance or periods of normalcy. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of a serious heart event, possibly disproportionate to her actual risk. - Temporal distortions: She perceives her symptoms as worsening more than they have objectively, likely influenced by her emotional distress rather than true progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture is probably: Margaret experiences intermittent episodes of chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue, which are moderate in intensity and have been relatively stable over time. Her perception of worsening and severity is heightened by anxiety; actual symptoms may fluctuate without significant progression. She does not report any associated symptoms like palpitations, exertional chest pain, or syncope at a clinical level. Her perceptions are influenced by emotional distress rather than a clear, continuous deterioration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how often these episodes happen? How long do they last? Are there specific triggers or activities that bring them on? Have you noticed any other symptoms like palpitations or shortness of breath during these episodes?\" (to clarify actual symptom pattern) - Approach strategy: Use a calm, reassuring tone, validating her concern but gently encouraging her to provide detailed, factual descriptions, reducing emotional bias\u2019s influence. - Priority order: First, analyze the timing and frequency of symptoms; next, inquire about associated symptoms and triggers; then, explore her feelings about her health and any past similar episodes, to differentiate between anxiety-driven perception and actual physical risk.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's descriptions are marked by emotional and vivid language, suggesting heightened anxiety and amplification bias that likely exaggerates symptom severity and perceived progression. While the patient reports chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue, these may be more moderate and intermittent in reality, with subjective reports influenced by emotional distress. There is a possibility that some symptoms, such as mild episodes or less alarming symptoms, are minimized or overlooked, and patient anxiety may lead to overestimation of symptom significance. A thorough, objective assessment should explore the frequency, duration, and triggers of symptoms, as well as any associated features, to clarify true clinical findings versus psychological amplification.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified.  Chief complaint: Intermittent chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue, perceived as worsening but likely stable in severity.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing episodes characterized by chest tightness, described as a heavy, squeezing sensation, accompanied by dizziness and fatigue. These episodes are reported as coming and going, with a recent perception of constant presence. Based on communication patterns, the actual severity and frequency may be overestimated due to anxiety. Objective symptoms such as persistent chest pain, palpitations, or syncope are not confirmed at this time; symptoms may be less severe or less frequent than described.  Associated symptoms: No mention of palpitations, shortness of breath, or exertional symptoms; the confidence that these are absent is high, but further probing is needed to confirm.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s report of chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue. - Medium confidence: The perceived worsening of symptoms and overall severity, likely influenced by anxiety. - Low confidence: The actual frequency, severity, and persistence of symptoms; these may be less intense or less frequent in reality. - Missing information: Specific details about symptom timing, triggers, associated features, and any prior episodes or health conditions.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with reports of intermittent chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue, which she perceives as worsening over time. However, communication patterns suggest emotional distress may be amplifying the perceived severity and progression of symptoms. Objective assessment indicates that episodes are likely moderate in intensity and may be less frequent or severe than reported, with no confirmed ongoing or associated symptoms such as palpitations, exertional chest pain, or syncope. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to characterize true symptom frequency, duration, and potential triggers, while considering the influence of anxiety on patient perception.",

It\\u2019s gotten worse, and I get short of breath even just walking to the door.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nAn adult patient presents with reports of intermittent chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue, which she perceives as worsening over time. However, communication patterns suggest emotional distress may be amplifying the perceived severity and progression of symptoms. Objective assessment indicates that episodes are likely moderate in intensity and may be less frequent or severe than reported, with no confirmed ongoing or associated symptoms such as palpitations, exertional chest pain, or syncope. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to characterize true symptom frequency, duration, and potential triggers, while considering the influence of anxiety on patient perception.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her symptoms with vivid, emotionally charged language, emphasizing their severity and persistence. Her responses are detailed and expressive, driven by anxiety, which may amplify her perception of danger. - Bias detected: Amplification bias, mainly due to anxiety, leading her to overstate the severity and impact of her symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium to high; her language clearly suggests emotional exaggeration, though her overall coherence supports trustworthiness. - Reasoning: Her use of intense descriptors and concern suggest heightened emotional response influencing her perception without full objective severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing psychological stress, mood disturbances, or anxiety symptoms not explicitly reported, which amplify her sensations. - Withheld information: She does not appear embarrassed, but possibly some intermittent symptoms (like palpitations or episodes of pain) are underreported if she deems them less important or fears appearing overly anxious. - Amplified concerns: She likely overestimates the threat\u2014perceiving her symptoms as more severe or ominous than clinically warranted\u2014due to her anxiety. - Temporal distortions: Her view of worsening symptoms might be more magnified emotionally; the actual progression may be more stable or less severe in reality.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the true clinical scenario probably involves moderate, episodic chest discomfort associated with anxiety or benign causes, with some amplification of perceived severity. Her dizziness and fatigue could stem from stress, sleep disturbances, or mild physiological factors, rather than ongoing severe cardiac pathology. The symptoms' overall pattern suggests functional or stress-related etiology, with no clear evidence of acute coronary syndrome or severe cardiac dysfunction.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you notice these symptoms relate to emotional stress or specific situations?\" \"Do you experience palpitations, shortness of breath, or fainting during these episodes?\" \"How often do these episodes occur, and how long do they last?\" \"Have you noticed any patterns or specific triggers?\" such as stress, exertion, or certain activities. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic inquiry to explore psychological factors, emphasizing that many symptoms can be related to stress or anxiety, which are common and treatable. Normalize her experiences, reducing stigma or shame. - Priority order: First, clarify the nature, frequency, and duration of episodes to establish accurate baseline data. Next, explore associated physiological symptoms to differentiate cardiac from stress-related causes. Finally, inquire about emotional, psychological, or situational factors that might influence her perceptions.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses emotionally charged language and vivid descriptions that suggest she perceives her symptoms as more severe and persistent than they may actually be. Her descriptions of chest tightness, heaviness, burning, dizziness, and fatigue appear amplified by anxiety. While she reports symptoms that suggest potential cardiac concern, objective assessment is necessary to differentiate between true pathology and stress-related presentations. Her communication pattern indicates possible overestimation of symptom severity, which warrants cautious interpretation. She may also be minimizing or withholding details about episodic symptoms like palpitations, brief chest pain, or fainting, which could provide further diagnostic clues. The timeline suggests a worsening perception of symptoms, but actual symptom frequency and duration may be less severe. Additional inquiry is needed to assess physiological correlates, symptom triggers, and emotional factors, while being aware of her tendency toward emotional exaggeration.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Perceived persistent chest tightness and heaviness, with associated dizziness and fatigue, believed to be worsening over time.  Present illness: The patient reports a sensation of a tight, squeezing, and burning feeling in her chest that is constant and has increased in severity. She also describes dizziness described as feeling faint, and pervasive tiredness, even without exertion. These descriptions are influenced by heightened emotional distress. Objective examination and vital signs are currently unreported but are necessary to evaluate further. It is possible that her actual symptoms are moderate and episodic, with emotional factors amplifying her perception of severity and persistence. She may be experiencing underlying anxiety which could be contributing to her sensations. She might be underreporting episodic symptoms such as palpitations or brief chest pain. The timeline suggests her perception of symptom worsening, but the true onset and frequency require clarification.  Associated symptoms: No specific mention of palpitations, shortness of breath during exertion, chest pain episodes, or syncope on history provided, though further assessment is needed to confirm.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Reports of chest tightness, dizziness, fatigue currently present as described. - Medium confidence: The true severity and frequency of symptoms, influenced by emotional distress and communication biases, may differ from reported. - Low confidence: Exact symptom episodicity, triggers, and objective findings are not yet documented. - Missing information: Physical examination, diagnostic tests (ECG, echocardiogram, labs), vital signs, and detailed symptom timeline.\nANSWER: An adult female patient presents with complaints of persistent chest tightness described as squeezing and burning, along with dizziness and fatigue. These symptoms have reportedly worsened over time, but communication suggests a significant emotional component may be amplifying her perception of severity. Objective assessment is needed to evaluate for cardiac, pulmonary, or functional causes. Initial examination and testing should focus on determining the presence of any true cardiac pathology, while also exploring potential psychological factors contributing to her symptom perception. Further detailed inquiry into symptom frequency, triggers, associated physiological symptoms, and emotional context is recommended.",

These symptoms have reportedly worsened over time, but communication suggests a significant emotional component may be amplifying her perception of severity. Objective assessment is needed to evaluate for cardiac, pulmonary, or functional causes. Initial examination and testing should focus on determining the presence of any true cardiac pathology, while also exploring potential psychological factors contributing to her symptom perception. Further detailed inquiry into symptom frequency, triggers, associated physiological symptoms, and emotional context is recommended.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient exhibits emotionally charged, somewhat vague descriptions with a tendency to amplify concerns while utilizing minimization language about her activity levels. Her responses suggest she may be seeking reassurance, with potential underreporting of emotional distress or secondary symptoms. - Bias detected: Both emotional amplification and somatic fixation biases are influencing her report. Her high emotional distress likely inflates perceived symptom severity and urgency. - Confidence level: Medium; the communication pattern strongly indicates these biases but does not confirm any actual severity or clinical pathology. - Reasoning: Her use of emotive language and exaggeration of symptom impact, combined with subtle minimization and withholding tendencies, suggests her perception of her condition is currently influenced by anxiety and emotional distress, which may not fully align with objective clinical findings.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may not fully acknowledge how her stress, emotional pain, or sleep issues contribute to her physical sensations, underreporting psychological influences. - Withheld information: Embarrassment or shame may prevent her from discussing emotional vulnerabilities or stressors unrelated to physical symptoms. - Amplified concerns: Her fear of heart attack or serious illness is probably exaggerated; she may be overestimating the danger due to her emotional state. - Temporal distortions: She may be overstating how quickly her symptoms worsened or how persistent they are, driven by distress rather than accurate progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, her symptoms likely include moderate physical discomfort that may be exacerbated by emotional stress, with persistent chest tightness, burning, dizziness, and fatigue. The symptoms may have been stable or gradually worsening, but her current distress level skews perception toward overestimating severity. Underlying anxiety or emotional factors may be playing a significant role, potentially amplifying her somatic complaints and affecting her assessment of risk.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you describe what your typical day looks like? Are there particular times when symptoms are worse or better? Do you notice symptoms when you're stressed or upset?\" to explore emotional triggers. - Approach strategy: Gently inquire about mood, stressful life events, sleep, and emotional well-being to normalize emotional factors' role, and validate her feelings while guiding toward an objective picture. - Priority order: Start with detailed symptom timeline and activity-log questions, then explore emotional correlates, to differentiate physical from psychological influences and obtain a clearer, less biased clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s emotional tone and language use suggest amplification of symptom severity, which may lead to overreporting of physical symptoms and urgency. She describes persistent chest tightness, burning, dizziness, and fatigue, primarily when active. While these symptoms are clearly present, her report may be influenced by anxiety, causing her to perceive her condition as more severe or persistent than it might be. She tends to focus on symptoms occurring during activity, and her worry about serious illness likely amplifies her perception. There is potential underreporting of emotional or psychological stressors and secondary symptoms such as sleep disturbance or emotional vulnerability. Because of communication biases, the actual symptom intensity and underlying cause might be less severe or different than perceived; further objective testing and exploration of emotional factors are needed for clarification.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Persistent chest tightness with burning sensation, described as a squeezing feeling, along with dizziness and fatigue. The presentation appears to be influenced by emotional distress, with symptoms worsening during physical activity.  Present illness: The patient reports a continuous sensation of chest tightness that has intensified over time, with associated burning. She experiences dizziness and fatigue, primarily during exertion such as walking or climbing stairs. The symptom severity seems exaggerated by emotional distress and anxiety, which may inflate her perception of urgency. The timeline suggests gradual worsening, but her distress level indicates she might be perceiving her symptoms as more persistent and severe than they objectively are. Likely, her symptoms include moderate physical discomfort, potentially amplified by emotional factors, and her perception may include heightened concern about serious cardiac or pulmonary pathology.  Associated symptoms: Shortness of breath on exertion, possible sleep disturbance, emotional distress\u2014confidence in these being primary is moderate, as some symptoms may be underreported or unrecognized by the patient.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of chest tightness, burning sensation, dizziness, fatigue during activity. - Medium confidence: The severity and persistence of symptoms, likely inflated by emotional distress. - Low confidence: Exact cause (cardiac, pulmonary, or psychological), due to communication biases. - Missing information: Details about emotional well-being, sleep quality, stressors, and further objective testing outcomes needed for definitive diagnosis.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, hedging language and qualifiers, showing hesitation and some minimization of her symptoms, while also providing vivid, possibly exaggerated descriptions indicative of anxiety. She seems cautious yet distressed, with inconsistent clarity about the symptom timeline. - Bias detected: The primary bias is *information withholding*, supported by her use of qualifying words and vague timelines, with some tendency toward *amplification* driven by anxiety symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium, because her responses are organized but not fully transparent, so some uncertainty remains regarding the actual severity. - Reasoning: The combination of hedging, vivid but non-specific descriptions, and inconsistent timeline comments indicates she may not fully disclose or recognize the true extent of her symptoms, possibly influenced by worry or shame.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more frequent or intense episodes or longer-lasting chest tightness and dizziness than she admits, as her description suggests she dubs symptoms \"just there\" and \"coming and going,\" which might understate their impact. - Withheld information: She could be embarrassed to discuss the full extent of her fears or autonomic symptoms, possibly hiding panic or concern that she\u2019s downplaying her risk for a cardiac event. - Amplified concerns: Her anxiety might lead her to over-perceive danger, making her worry about a heart attack more intense than the clinical picture warrants, especially given her focus on chest squeezing and dizziness. - Temporal distortions: She reports symptoms as \"out of nowhere\" and worsening \"lately,\" which might be more episodic or chronic; the vague language suggests her understanding of the timeline isn't precise, possibly underestimating how long she\u2019s been symptomatic.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, her symptoms are likely more frequent and intense than described. The episodes might persist or recur more regularly and include associated autonomic features such as palpitations, sweating, or more severe dizziness, which she possibly minimizes or omits. The progression may have been more abrupt or sustained than her vague timeline suggests. Her fear of cardiac issues is genuine but possibly hyperfocused, leading to anxiety-driven amplification of symptom perception. Overall, her presentation suggests significant anxiety overlaying potentially modest to moderate cardiovascular symptoms that require thorough investigation but are possibly less immediately life-threatening than feared.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Do you experience any other symptoms during these episodes, such as palpitations, sweating, or nausea?\" (to uncover autonomic symptoms) * \"Can you tell me more about how often these symptoms happen and how long they last?\" (to clarify frequency/duration) * \"Have you noticed any particular triggers besides activity, like stress or eating?\" (to identify other factors) * \"Are there moments when your symptoms get better or worse without activity?\" (to assess variability) - Approach strategy: Use a calm, empathetic tone to validate her worries, encouraging open dialogue and minimizing her fears by clarifying that understanding her experience helps ensure proper care. - Priority order: Start with questions about associated symptoms and duration to gather objective data; then explore triggers and impact, to build trust and reduce her urge to withhold or minimize.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's descriptions suggest that her subjective report may be influenced by anxiety, leading to amplification of symptoms such as chest tightness, burning sensation, dizziness, and activity-related discomfort. She Minimizes or omits details that could indicate autonomic symptoms or frequency, and her language indicates uncertainty about the timeline. Objective clinical facts are likely more severe or persistent than reported, and she may be experiencing episodic symptoms that have become more constant.

The patient reports worsening symptoms with exertion, such as walking and climbing stairs, and experiencing dizziness during episodes that may approach syncope. She characterizes the onset as occurring \"lately,\" but the true frequency, duration, and intensity are likely understated due to communication hesitations and anxiety-related exaggeration. There is no explicit report of additional autonomic symptoms like palpitations or sweating, though these could be present. Further assessment of associated symptoms, episode frequency, and potential triggers is needed to clarify the clinical picture and guide appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, softened language (\"kind of,\" \"just there\") and responds cautiously, indicating possible minimization and withholding. She demonstrates emotional distress through hurried responses and expressions of fear, which may amplify her actual symptom severity. Her descriptions focus on anxiety-driven concerns rather than detailed clinical features, suggesting emotional overlays affecting accuracy. - Bias detected: The primary bias is an **information withholding bias**, influenced by anxiety and possible shame about lifestyle or health behaviors, leading to understated reporting of symptom severity and history. There may also be some emotional amplification of fears, complicating objective assessment. - Confidence level: medium. I believe her subjective report is valid but incomplete, with certain symptoms and relevant history likely understated or omitted. - Reasoning: Her language choices and response style indicate an effort to soften or withhold details, complemented by emotional concerns and hesitation, which collectively suggest moderate bias.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual severity of chest pain, frequency, duration, and associated limitations are probably worse than described, as she downplays or is reluctant to fully disclose her discomfort. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or ashamed about her lifestyle habits, such as diet or exercise, and may not have fully disclosed prior episodes or health check details. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about a heart attack and the perception of worsening symptoms could be exaggerated due to anxiety, not entirely aligned with objective findings. - Temporal distortions: The vague use of \u201clately\u201d and increasing frequency could obscure a gradual worsening, which she may not be fully aware of or unwilling to admit, leading to an incomplete history.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves persistent, possibly severe chest discomfort\u2014more intense and frequent than described\u2014potentially with episodic increased autonomic symptoms such as dizziness or discomfort levels she minimizes. Her physical activity exacerbates her symptoms, and her fears suggest significant anxiety overlay. Her lifestyle and past health management are probably suboptimal, with the true symptom timeline being more extended or gradual. The overall picture indicates a need for cautious evaluation of cardiac risk, with an understanding that her self-report may understate actual medical danger due to emotional and communicative biases.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: - \"Can you tell me exactly how long you've been experiencing these symptoms and how they've changed over time?\" (to clarify timeline) - \"Do you experience any other symptoms during episodes, such as sweating, palpitations, or shortness of breath?\" (to uncover omitted autonomic symptoms) - \"How often do these episodes happen, and how severe do you feel they are on a scale of 1 to 10?\" (to quantify severity) - \"Can you describe your typical daily activity, diet, and any recent changes?\" (to assess lifestyle factors) - \"Have you had any previous heart screenings or evaluations?\" (to gather historical health data) - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language to reduce shame or embarrassment, encouraging openness. Normalize discomfort while gently challenging minimizations with specific questions, reinforcing that full disclosure aids accurate diagnosis. - Priority order: First, clarify the timeline and frequency of symptoms to gauge urgency. Then, explore associated autonomic symptoms (dizziness, sweating) to assess severity. Next, delve into lifestyle and previous health evaluations. This structured approach minimizes emotional distress and promotes comprehensive disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates a tendency to underreport the severity, duration, and frequency of her symptoms due to anxiety, emotional distress, and possible shame; this can lead to minimization of her condition, while her focus on fears suggests her symptoms may be more severe or persistent than she acknowledges. Her language indicates hesitations and emotional overlays that could amplify her reported discomfort, especially in describing autonomic symptoms like dizziness and sweating. Therefore, objective clinical facts include the presentation of persistent chest discomfort characterized as tight, squeezing, and burning, with worsening activity-related symptoms and episodes of dizziness. Likely, her true symptom severity and frequency are underestimated, and some autonomic symptoms may be underreported or omitted. Her timeline suggests an increasing, more continuous pattern over days, with symptoms worsened by physical activity. Additional symptoms such as sweating and dizziness occur during episodes, but their true extent may be greater. To accurately assess her condition, further targeted inquiry into episode details, previous evaluations, and lifestyle factors is essential, considering her communication biases.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged adult female. Chief complaint: Persistent chest discomfort, described as tight, squeezing, and burning, with increased severity and consistency over recent days. Present illness: The patient reports that chest discomfort has become more constant, with sensations of tightness and burning, worsening with physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. She experiences episodes of dizziness during these discomforts, and reports increased sweating when symptoms intensify. The true severity, duration, and frequency are likely underestimated due to her hesitant and anxious communication style. Her symptoms appear to have gradually worsened over the last several days, with a more persistent and activity-exacerbated pattern. Associated symptoms: Dizziness and sweating, potentially more frequent or severe than described, though her reporting may be biased. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of chest discomfort with exertion, dizziness, and sweating. - Medium confidence: The exact severity, duration, and frequency of episodes, which are probably understated. - Low confidence: The complete scope and full impact of symptoms; additional autonomic and non-cardiac symptoms may be present but unreported. - Missing information: Detailed timeline, prior evaluations, lifestyle factors, and complete autonomic symptom history.\nANSWER: A middle-aged adult female presents with persistent chest discomfort characterized as tight, squeezing, and burning that has progressively increased in severity and duration over the past several days. Symptoms are exacerbated by physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs, with episodes of dizziness and increased sweating during discomfort. The current presentation suggests a more continuous and severe pattern than initially described, though her communication style indicates her report may understate the true extent of her symptoms. Further assessment of symptom frequency, associated autonomic symptoms, and prior cardiovascular evaluations is necessary for comprehensive risk stratification and management.",
