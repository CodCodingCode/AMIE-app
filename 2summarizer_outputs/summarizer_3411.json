Some days, I feel more of the tingling or weakness stuff, and other days I can kinda forget about it for a bit. But I definitely notice the urgency and sometimes I can\u2019t hold it in, and that\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s been messing with my routine\u2014like I have to be near a bathroom all the time now. It\u2019s made me nervous to go out or do normal things, 'cause I never know when I\u2019ll need to rush.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or any recent illnesses or exposures (e.g., ticks, unprotected sexual contact, travel history) that might suggest an infectious or systemic process?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really had anything like that. No fevers or feeling more tired than usual, I don\u2019t think. Nothing that I can think of that\u2019s recent or that stood out.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any eye pain, eye redness, or double vision recently?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really had any eye problems or double vision or anything like that. Nothing like that has been bothering me.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms tend to be worse after hot showers, exercise, or in any particular environmental conditions? Additionally, did you have any episodes of double vision, eye pain, or eye movement problems in connection with your visual symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven't really noticed much change with hot showers or exercise. Sometimes, I feel a little more numb or shakier overall, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s linked to anything specific like the weather or activity. And no, I haven't really had double vision or eye pain or anything like that, so I wouldn\u2019t say my eyes are acting up with my other symptoms.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms tend to worsen after hot showers, exercise, or in any particular weather conditions?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I feel like my legs get a bit weaker or tingly after I do something active or when it's really hot outside, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always the same or if it\u2019s just in my head.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your episodes of blurry vision tend to occur along with or independently of your other neurological symptoms, such as weakness or urinary issues?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven't really noticed if it\u2019s always together or separate. Sometimes the blurry vision happens even when I don\u2019t feel much else, but other times it seems kind of linked to the worsening of the weakness or when I can\u2019t control my bladder well. I really don\u2019t know if they\u2019re connected or just happen at different times.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms\u2014such as weakness, numbness, or visual disturbances\u2014tend to worsen after hot showers, exercise, or being in warm environments?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I\u2019ve sort of noticed that sometimes after I shower or when it\u2019s really warm, my legs feel more weird or weaker, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s just in my head or what. Sometimes I get these tingling feelings too, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worse then.",
