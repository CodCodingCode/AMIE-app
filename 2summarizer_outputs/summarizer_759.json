Responses are detailed, logically sequenced, and free from minimization or exaggeration. - Bias detected: Minimal bias; her emotional distress may slightly amplify her perception of severity but overall, her report seems credible and accurate. - Confidence level: High. Her detailed, consistent responses support trustworthiness, with only mild concern about emotional overlay. - Reasoning: The absence of evasiveness or minimization, combined with her emotional tone reflecting genuine concern, suggests her report is valid, though anxiety might slightly exaggerate her perceived urgency.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possibly some psychological distress like anxiety or depression affecting her overall wellbeing, not easily expressed; she may not mention social support issues. - Withheld information: She might be hesitant to fully disclose fears about social circumstances, her capacity to cope, or past mental health history, though none are overtly indicated. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about her baby seems proportionate, but her anxiety may cause her to interpret symptoms as more severe or urgent than they might objectively be. - Temporal distortions: Unlikely; her timeline appears consistent.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely indicates a woman experiencing significant symptoms of jaundice, fatigue, and right upper quadrant pain progressing over a week, consistent with hepatitis or similar hepatic pathology. Her distress and worry about her baby are prominent but proportional to her physical symptoms; no evidence suggests serious underreporting. She may also have underlying anxiety, heightening her perception of severity, which should be explored further.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced any fever, dizziness, or vomiting?\"\u2014to uncover additional physical symptoms; \"How are you feeling emotionally\u2014any feelings of anxiety, sadness, or hopelessness?\"\u2014to assess psychological state; \"Do you have support at home or someone helping you?\"\u2014to evaluate social context. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language to encourage openness about emotional burdens; reinforce that discussing all feelings is important for effective care. - Priority order: First, clarify physical symptoms to confirm the clinical picture, then gently explore emotional wellbeing and social support to identify psychological or social factors impacting health and treatment adherence.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication conveys a detailed and emotionally expressive account of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain over approximately one week. Her reports are consistent and logically sequenced, suggesting credibility; however, her expressed concern for her baby and emotional distress could potentially amplify her perception of symptom severity. There is minimal evidence of minimization, but anxiety may cause her to overemphasize the urgency. She does not mention other symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or dizziness, which could be either absent or underreported due to distress. Her overall diagnosis is suggestive of hepatic illness, possibly hepatitis or another hepatic pathology, but more objective assessment is necessary to confirm findings. Areas needing further exploration include emotional well-being, social support, and additional physical symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult woman, gestational age unspecified but concerned about pregnancy. Chief complaint: Progressive jaundice with associated fatigue and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Present illness: The patient reports feeling increasingly unwell over the past week, with yellowing of skin and eyes. She experiences persistent nausea and right-sided abdominal pain. Her described timeline suggests symptom progression over seven days. She denies explicit mention of fever, vomiting, dizziness, or additional systemic symptoms, though these should be verified. Her concern for her fetus indicates emotional distress, which may heighten her perception of severity. Associated symptoms: No mention of fever, vomiting, dizziness, or weight loss; confidence in absence of such symptoms is moderate, pending further questioning. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain over a week. - Medium confidence: Exact severity of symptoms and full extent of associated features, due to potential symptom amplification. - Low confidence: Specific physical findings (e.g., fever, hepatomegaly), emotional state, social support, and additional symptoms not currently detailed. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, laboratory results, detailed medical and social history, emotional and mental health status.\nANSWER: An adult woman presents with a one-week history of progressive jaundice, characterized by yellowing of her skin and sclerae, accompanied by fatigue and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She reports persistent nausea and an overall worsening of her condition during this period, without explicitly reporting fever or vomiting but warrants further inquiry to exclude additional systemic symptoms. Her concern for her pregnancy and emotional distress are noted, which may influence her symptom perception. Further evaluation should include physical examination, laboratory testing for hepatic function, and assessment of her emotional and social support systems to accurately determine the underlying cause and her health status.",

She reports persistent nausea and an overall worsening of her condition during this period, without explicitly reporting fever or vomiting but warrants further inquiry to exclude additional systemic symptoms. Her concern for her pregnancy and emotional distress are noted, which may influence her symptom perception. Further evaluation should include physical examination, laboratory testing for hepatic function, and assessment of her emotional and social support systems to accurately determine the underlying cause and her health status.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Maria communicates with concise, factual statements that focus on key physical symptoms, avoiding emotional and detailed descriptions. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization/stoic concealment bias, as she underplays symptom severity and emotional impact. - Confidence level: Medium; her responses suggest underreporting but do provide truthful symptom mentions. - Reasoning: The limited elaboration, avoidance of emotional content, and repetitive descriptions indicate she is minimizing her condition, likely to appear stoic or protect herself from emotional vulnerability.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may have more profound fatigue, unreported systemic symptoms such as fever or worsening jaundice, or additional signs like dark urine or pale stools. - Withheld information: Emotional distress, fears about her pregnancy, feelings of anxiety or shame, which she may avoid expressing openly. - Amplified concerns: She likely worries greatly about her health and her baby's safety but does not openly admit fear, which she might find embarrassing or culturally uncomfortable. - Temporal distortions: The symptom onset may be earlier than one week or gradually worsening over a longer period, but she minimizes or does not recognize this progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely reveals that Maria has a more severe hepatic or biliary condition progressing over multiple weeks, with possible systemic symptoms such as high-grade jaundice, persistent nausea, and fatigue that she underreports. She may also be experiencing emotional distress related to her pregnancy, which she minimizes but is significant. Her subtle communication obscures the true extent of her illness, which requires thorough physical exams and laboratory testing to clarify.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any dark urine or pale-colored stools?\" (to assess cholestasis severity) - \"Are you having any fevers or chills?\" (to evaluate systemic infection or inflammation) - \"How have your symptoms changed over the past few weeks?\" (to understand progression) - \"Do you feel anxious or worried about your health or your baby?\" (to explore emotional state) - \"Can you tell me about any other symptoms you might have noticed but haven't mentioned?\" (to uncover hidden issues) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, empathetic language to encourage openness, acknowledging that discussing health fears can be difficult. - Normalize feelings of worry or discomfort to reduce shame or embarrassment. - Frame questions around her experience rather than symptom checklists to promote detailed responses. - Priority order: - First assess for systemic symptoms (fever, dark urine, pale stools). - Then explore emotional concerns related to pregnancy. - Follow up with timeline clarification to understand progression. - Throughout, remind her that her full experience helps us provide the best care, encouraging honesty.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern indicates a tendency to minimize or avoid discussing the full extent of her symptoms and emotional distress. She provides concise descriptions of her jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain, which suggests these symptoms are likely more severe than she reports. She also does not mention other relevant symptoms such as dark urine or pale stools that could support the severity of her liver or biliary issue. Her expressed concern about her pregnancy and feeling \"so sick\" might be underemphasized, and she may be withholding additional systemic or emotional symptoms due to emotional discomfort or cultural factors. This communication pattern necessitates cautious interpretation, recognizing that her perceived symptom severity and emotional state may underestimate her actual condition, which could be more serious and prolonged.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, presenting with a one-week history of jaundice and systemic symptoms.  Chief complaint: Jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, with a possible underreporting of symptom severity and emotional impact.  Present illness: The patient reports onset of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal discomfort over approximately one week. She describes her skin and sclerae turning yellow and a worsening feeling of sickness, including inability to eat. Objective signs include visible jaundice; further physical examination is needed to assess for hepatomegaly, tenderness, and other systemic signs. She is likely experiencing more severe hepatic or biliary pathology than she admits, with symptoms such as dark urine or pale stools possibly present but unreported. The timeline suggests a progression over the past week, but the illness may have been ongoing longer. Emotional distress concerning her pregnancy may be minimized or concealed.  Associated symptoms: Dark urine, pale stools, possible low-grade fever, or systemic symptoms are not explicitly reported but should be assessed due to the suspected severity.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient has jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain present. - Medium confidence: Symptom severity may be underestimated; her emotional distress may be understated. - Low confidence: The full extent of systemic symptoms like fever, dark urine, and pale stools is uncertain. - Missing information: Physical exam findings, comprehensive laboratory tests (liver function tests, bilirubin levels), imaging, and detailed emotional assessments are necessary.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult woman presenting with a one-week history of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. While she reports that her skin and eyes have turned yellow and she feels increasingly unwell, her communication suggests these symptoms may be more severe than described. She likely has significant hepatic or biliary pathology, potentially progressing over a longer period than she reports. Additional clinical assessment, including physical examination, laboratory testing, and investigation of systemic and emotional symptoms, is required to determine the underlying cause and severity of her condition.",

While she reports that her skin and eyes have turned yellow and she feels increasingly unwell, her communication suggests these symptoms may be more severe than described. She likely has significant hepatic or biliary pathology, potentially progressing over a longer period than she reports. Additional clinical assessment, including physical examination, laboratory testing, and investigation of systemic and emotional symptoms, is required to determine the underlying cause and severity of her condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly about her physical symptoms but emphasizes her emotional distress, using amplification (\"so sick,\" \"terrible\") that may reflect heightened anxiety. - Bias detected: Anxiety-related amplification, leading her to overstate the severity of her symptoms and worry about her baby, though her physical descriptions are generally consistent. - Confidence level: Medium-high; her physical complaints seem genuine but are influenced by emotional factors, possibly inflating perceived severity. - Reasoning: Her emotional state shapes her language, consistent with anxiety-driven exaggeration, but her detailed descriptions suggest her symptoms are real and significant.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Less likely, as she openly reports her concerns, but she might not recognize or report subtle signs of worsening systemic illness, such as mental confusion or dehydration. - Withheld information: Possible emotional despair or hopelessness she may be hesitant to acknowledge, especially if overwhelmed. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about her baby may cause her to overstate her symptoms, potentially perceiving them as more life-threatening than they are. - Temporal distortions: Her timeline appears consistent, but her anxiety could lead to an overemphasis on recent worsening rather than gradual progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a woman with a one-week history of jaundice and systemic symptoms suggestive of significant liver pathology\u2014possibly hepatitis or biliary obstruction\u2014exacerbated by anxiety. Physical exam and labs are needed to assess severity, mental status, dehydration, and systemic involvement. Her emotional state adds concern but does not fully distort her physiological symptoms; instead, it highlights the importance of addressing her anxiety as part of treatment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any confusion, difficulty concentrating, or feeling more sleepy than usual?\" (to assess mental status), \"Have you experienced any fever or chills?\" (to gauge infection severity), \"Are you able to stay hydrated and keep fluids down?\" (to evaluate dehydration), \"Have your symptoms changed or worsened since you first noticed them?\" (to assess progression). - Approach strategy: Use empathic, non-judgmental questions\u2014\"Many people worry when they feel unwell; can you tell me more about how you\u2019re coping physically and emotionally?\"\u2014to help her feel supported and reduce amplification driven by anxiety. - Priority order: First probe mental status and hydration to catch signs of systemic decompensation; then clarify symptom progression and specific features of her discomfort to refine diagnosis and urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication indicates significant emotional distress and anxiety influencing her perception and reporting of symptoms. While she openly describes jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, her exaggerated emotional description\u2014such as feeling \"so sick\"\u2014may amplify her perceived severity. Her worry about the baby and intense emotional state suggest she may also be underreporting or withholding subtle systemic symptoms, such as mental status changes or dehydration signs. The timeline appears consistent at about one week, but her anxiety could lead her to overestimate recent worsening. The objective clinical picture suggests a likely hepatic or biliary pathology, possibly hepatitis or obstruction, but her reported severity might be inflated. Further assessment, including mental status, hydration, and physical examination, is necessary for a more accurate evaluation.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult woman, approximately mid-30s to early 40s. Chief complaint: Jaundice with systemic symptoms, subjective severity possibly exaggerated by emotional distress. Present illness: The patient reports a one-week history of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She describes feeling \"so sick,\" with difficulty eating, and is worried about potential harm to her baby. - Well-established symptoms: Jaundice, fatigue, nausea, right upper quadrant pain. - Likely minimized symptoms: Signs of systemic illness such as mental confusion, dehydration, or fever may be underreported or unnoticed. - Possibly withheld symptoms: She may be experiencing or hiding worsening mental status or physical distress beyond what she reports due to anxiety or emotional overwhelm. - Timeline: Symptoms began approximately one week ago, with potential recent worsening, though her anxiety could distort perceived progression. Associated symptoms: Emotional distress, worry about pregnancy; confidence in physical symptoms is moderate, given amplification tendencies. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, right upper quadrant pain. - Medium confidence: Severity of systemic illness and exact progression, influenced by emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Degree of physical deterioration and subtle symptoms like mental status changes or dehydration. - Missing information: Objective physical exam findings, laboratory results, mental status assessment, hydration status, and any signs of systemic decompensation.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates primarily through brief, guarded responses, emphasizing physical symptoms and concern for her pregnancy but avoiding detailed emotional disclosures. She tends to understate her emotional distress and is reluctant to elaborate. - Bias detected: Minimization bias, as she downplays herself and her emotional state. There is also guardedness indicative of possible withholding or reluctance to fully share her experience. - Confidence level: Medium; based on her brief responses and hedging, I suspect she may be holding back emotionally or exaggerating her worries slightly out of concern. - Reasoning: The limited elaboration, focus on physical symptoms, and indirect language suggest she is minimizing her emotional vulnerability, possibly due to cultural factors or anxiety about appearing vulnerable.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more profound fatigue, pain, or systemic symptoms (e.g., abdominal discomfort, fever) she is not mentioning, possibly to avoid seeming overly ill or vulnerable. - Withheld information: Emotional distress, fears about her health and pregnancy, or feelings of helplessness may be understated or hidden due to cultural tendencies or anxiety. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about her baby and fear of serious illness may be heightened internally but understated verbally; her concern might mask internal panic or despair. - Temporal distortions: She might be underreporting how long symptoms like jaundice have been present, possibly minimizing the duration or severity to appear less ill.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves significant systemic illness\u2014possibly hepatic or infectious in nature\u2014manifesting with fatigue, jaundice, and eye symptoms. The emotional impact may be severe but underreported, with underlying anxiety and fear about both her health and pregnancy. The timeline may be somewhat distorted, with symptoms developing over a longer period than she admits. Her reluctance to fully disclose her feelings suggests the need for careful, empathetic probing to uncover the full extent of her physical and emotional needs.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed over the past few days? Are you experiencing any fever, abdominal pain, or other new symptoms? How are you feeling emotionally about your health and pregnancy?\"\u2014these help clarify progression and emotional state. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions with reassurance (\"I'm here to understand everything you're experiencing, and there's no judgment\"). Validate her feelings to reduce guardedness and encourage honesty. - Priority order: First, explore the physical symptoms in detail\u2014duration, associated symptoms, severity\u2014to get an accurate medical picture. Then, gently probe emotional well-being and fears, ensuring she feels safe sharing openly.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication exhibits guardedness, focusing primarily on physical symptoms like jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, with little to no emotional disclosure. She consistently emphasizes feeling very sick and worried about her pregnancy, but tends to repeat these concerns without elaborating on her emotional state. This suggests potential minimization of overall severity or emotional distress, and possible withholding of additional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or darker urine, which could indicate more systemic illness. Her focus on physical manifestations and avoidance of detailed emotional information imply she might underreport or conceal the extent of her symptoms. The duration of symptoms may be longer or more severe than she admits, as she may be minimizing her illness to appear more resilient or out of fear. Therefore, objective facts include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right-sided abdominal pain, likely of hepatic or infectious origin. Symptoms such as fever or changes in stool color are not explicitly reported but should be explicitly inquired about to avoid underestimating severity. Her emotional concerns are real but undercommunicated, possibly driven by anxiety related to her pregnancy. Confidence in objective symptom presence is high; confidence in the full severity and emotional impact is medium to low owing to communication barriers. Further probing is necessary to clarify the true extent and progression of her illness and emotional well-being.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, possibly of childbearing age  Chief complaint: Jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain with concern for her pregnancy  Present illness: The patient reports recent onset of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain localized to the right upper abdomen, with a symptom duration described as approximately one week. She states feeling very sick and unable to eat, and expresses concern for her pregnancy. These symptoms have reportedly worsened over the past week; however, the patient may be minimizing the true duration and severity. She does not report fever or changes in stool color explicitly, though these should be explored. No additional systemic symptoms or associated complaints are provided, but communication biases suggest she may be withholding information about more systemic or severe symptoms.  Associated symptoms: None explicitly reported, though systemic illness may be present given her clinical presentation. Emotional distress is evident but underreported, with potential underlying anxiety.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain - Medium confidence: Duration of symptoms and severity may be understated due to guarded responses - Low confidence: Extent of emotional distress, additional systemic symptoms, and full duration of illness - Missing information: Fever presence, stool and urine color changes, weight change, detailed emotional state, and any additional systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain of approximately one week in duration. She reports feeling very sick and unable to eat, with concern for her pregnancy. Clinical presentation suggests a possible hepatic or infectious etiology, potentially involving significant systemic illness. Communication patterns indicate she may be underreporting the severity and full extent of her illness and emotional distress.

Further detailed inquiry into associated symptoms such as fever, stool and urine discoloration, weight changes, and emotional well-being is essential for comprehensive assessment.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her symptoms cautiously, minimizing severity, with brief, guarded responses. She emphasizes her worries but avoids detailed descriptions of systemic signs or worsening features. - Bias detected: Predominantly minimization bias, with emotional restraint. She likely underreports the true severity of her illness due to a combination of fear, shame, or cultural tendency to understate health issues. - Confidence level: Medium. While her statements suggest significant illness, her guarded responses and minimization bias mean clinical signs may be objectively worse. - Reasoning: Her language choices, reluctance to affirm systemic symptoms, and focus on emotional distress point toward underreporting, which could obscure the urgency of her condition.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible dark urine, worsening pain, systemic signs like fever or chills that she is hesitant to confirm. - Withheld information: Details that may imply severity\u2014more intense symptoms, rapid deterioration, additional discomforts\u2014possibly out of embarrassment or fear. - Amplified concerns: She genuinely worries about her baby and her health, but her expressed concern may underestimate her internal fears and the potential seriousness. - Temporal distortions: Her perception of the timeline might underestimate how quickly her condition is worsening, leading to underappreciation of urgency.

RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: Ask directly about urine and stool color (\"Have you noticed your urine darker than usual?\"), inquire explicitly about fever or chills (\"Have you had any fever today?\"), and about worsening pain (\"Is your pain getting worse or spreading?\"). Also, ask about decreased appetite, weight changes, and other systemic symptoms. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental tone; reassure her that detailed sharing helps ensure her and her baby's safety. Frame questions as routine to reduce shame. - Priority order: Start with physical symptom inquiries about systemic signs to gather objective data, then explore emotional impact to understand her distress, encouraging fuller disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient emphasizes feelings of tiredness and jaundice but tends to underreport systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or changes in stool and urine color, suggesting possible minimization or emotional shielding. Her guarded responses likely underrepresent the severity of her condition, potentially masking signs of systemic illness or progression. Her concern for her pregnancy may influence her communication, leading to underdisclosure of worsening symptoms or systemic signs. Adjustments to her symptom severity are necessary, assuming underlying issues may be more pronounced. More detailed inquiry into urine/stool color, pain progression, and systemic signs is needed to clarify her clinical status.

Chief complaint: Jaundice and overall malaise, with significant fatigue and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, reported to have begun approximately one week prior, with possible underreporting of systemic and severity signs.  Present illness: - Well-established symptoms: Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), fatigue, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, decreased appetite, and inability to tolerate food. - Likely minimized symptoms: Fever, chills, dark urine, changes in stool color, worsening pain, weight loss. - Possibly withheld symptoms: Additional systemic signs such as high fever, worsening pain severity, or rapid functional decline. - Timeline: Symptoms have persisted for about one week, with potential recent progression, but the patient\u2019s communication suggests she perceives her illness as less severe than it may be.  Associated symptoms: No confirmed fever or chills; stool and urine colors reportedly unchanged by patient, but objective signs may include dark urine and pale stool which she has not explicitly confirmed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, right upper quadrant pain of about one week duration. - Medium confidence: Patient's report of unchanged stool and urine color and absence of fever, which may be underreported. - Low confidence: Actual severity of systemic illness due to guarded and minimized patient responses; real symptom intensity may be greater. - Missing information: Exact details on urine/stool color changes, fever, pain progression, weight changes, and other systemic signs are necessary for comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: The patient is a pregnant woman presenting with jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain that has lasted approximately one week. While she reports no fever, chills, or changes in stool or urine color, objective signs may include dark urine and pale stool indicative of hepatobiliary dysfunction. She appears emotionally distressed and worried about her health and pregnancy but tends to understate the severity of her systemic symptoms, suggesting that her clinical illness may be more advanced than her disclosures imply. Additional assessment of systemic signs, including detailed inquiry about fever, pain worsening, stool and urine changes, and weight loss, is necessary to determine the acuity and cause of her illness.",
