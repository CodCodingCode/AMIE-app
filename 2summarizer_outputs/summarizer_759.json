    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: Um, I'm 14 and a girl. I guess I just feel like things are really hard, especially with school and stuff. Sometimes I can\u2019t see well in the dark, and I\u2019ve always had extra toes, but I don\u2019t really understand all of this. It just all feels... strange and kind of scary.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how you're feeling overall\u2014like your mood, your energy levels, and whether you're experiencing any difficulties with balance, coordination, or other changes you might have noticed?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t know... sometimes I feel kind of tired, and I have trouble keeping my balance, especially if I stand for a long time. I guess I feel a little off, like I stumble a lot, and I don\u2019t have much energy most days. It\u2019s kind of confusing 'cause I don\u2019t really know what's going on with me.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling overall\u2014what's been challenging for you lately, both physically and emotionally, and how these feelings are affecting your day-to-day life?\\nPATIENT: I guess I feel kind of tired a lot, and sometimes everything looks weird or like blurry, especially in dim lights. It\u2019s hard to keep up with school and stuff, and I sometimes feel really upset or frustrated because I can't do things like other kids.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have been affecting your schoolwork, your interactions with friends and family, and how you've been feeling emotionally overall?\\nPATIENT: Um, school has been hard lately, I get distracted or forget things more than before, and I don\u2019t always want to be around other people. Sometimes I feel kind of sad or worried, but I don't really know why.\\nDOCTOR: Does the patient have any family members with similar limb anomalies, neurological issues, or vision problems? Additionally, has she experienced any other developmental delays, scoliosis, or cardiac issues?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I don\u2019t really know if anyone else in my family has stuff like my feet or vision or anything. My mom says my sister doesn\u2019t seem to have the same things, but I guess I haven\u2019t really asked much. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had scoliosis or heart stuff, but sometimes I feel kinda off or tired, and I don\u2019t remember if I\u2019ve ever been told about delays or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Has she experienced any episodes of weakness, numbness, tremors, seizures, or other neurological events? Also, at what age did she achieve her developmental milestones such as walking, talking, and her motor skills?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't really remember having any seizures or like, if I ever felt really weak or numb anywhere. Sometimes I get shaky, but I think that's just when I'm tired or something. I started walking when I was about two, I guess, but I don't know if that was late or normal. My speech was okay, I think, but I do struggle a bit with some movements and keeping steady now.\\nDOCTOR: Has she noticed if her difficulty seeing in the dark has been worsening over time, and are her visual symptoms uniform across both eyes or more prominent in one?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, it does seem like I can\u2019t see as well in the dark now, and sometimes it's more difficult on one side, I think, but it\u2019s all kinda blurry either way. It\u2019s been like that for a while, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your difficulty seeing in the dark has been getting worse over time, and are the visual problems more noticeable in one eye compared to the other?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it\u2019s been maybe worse, like, I don\u2019t see as well in the dark as I used to, but I\u2019m not really sure if one eye is more affected than the other. It just sort of feels the same overall.\\nDOCTOR: Have your visual symptoms, such as difficulty seeing in the dark or blurriness, been getting worse over time, and are these problems equally affecting both eyes or more prominent on one side?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, I think I\u2019ve been having a harder time seeing at night, like everything is really dark or fuzzy. It\u2019s kind of the same in both eyes, I guess, but sometimes one feels more blurry than the other.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if you've experienced symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands or feet, or any other signs of anemia such as pale skin or fatigue?\\nPATIENT: Um, I haven't really noticed anything like that. Sometimes I just feel really tired, but I don't know if that's anything. My hands and feet feel kinda weird sometimes, but I don't know if that's the same thing.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation reaffirmed and added details about her visual symptoms worsening over time, her motor milestones, and confirmed the absence of neurological events. It did not introduce new systemic or family history issues beyond what was previously noted.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 14-year-old girl who reports feeling that things are really hard, especially with school. She has difficulty seeing in the dark, with visual symptoms worsening over time, affecting both eyes equally but sometimes more blurry on one side. Her vision appears blurry in dim lighting. She has extra toes. She reports feeling tired most days with low energy, and has trouble maintaining balance after standing for long periods, often stumbling and feeling shaky when tired. She sometimes feels upset or frustrated about her difficulties and has noticed problems with concentration and memory, as well as social withdrawal. She has no known family history of limb anomalies, neurological issues, or vision problems; her mother states her sister does not have similar issues. She has not been told of scoliosis or cardiac issues. Her motor milestones, such as walking, were achieved around age two. She has not experienced seizures or other neurological events."
