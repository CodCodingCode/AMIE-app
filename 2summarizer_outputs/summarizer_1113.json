I\\u2019ve been like this for a couple of weeks now, and it\\u2019s just getting worse.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient expresses intense emotional distress with vague, hesitant language, revealing a guarded but emotionally expressive communication style. She discusses feelings of heaviness, emptiness, and worsening over two weeks but avoids specifics about her history or severity. - Bias detected: Both amplification (overemphasizing distress to seek reassurance) and withholding (concealing prior episodes, suicidal thoughts, or precise details) are present. - Confidence level: Medium. This assessment is based on linguistic cues, hesitations, and emotional intensity but may need clarification from further probing. - Reasoning: Her emotional language and guarded responses suggest she wants validation but also avoids full disclosure, indicating biases in her reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be understating the severity of functional impacts, such as inability to perform daily activities or extent of emotional pain. - Withheld information: Possible past suicidal ideation, previous episodes, or details about prior suicidal behaviors are likely concealed. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of losing control or hurting herself may be genuine but possibly exaggerated due to current emotional overload. - Temporal distortions: The true duration of her symptoms may exceed two weeks, with earlier recurrent issues underreported.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: The patient likely has a history of recurrent depressive episodes, possibly including prior suicidal thoughts or attempts that she is reluctant to disclose. Currently, she experiences significant emotional suffering, with feelings of heaviness, emptiness, and hopelessness that have worsened recently. The severity might be underestimated due to her guardedness, but the emotional intensity indicates genuine risk factors for worsening depression and possible suicidality. Her current presentation suggests an urgent need for detailed assessment of past episodes and risk factors, considering her potential biases.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling over the past months or years? Have you experienced similar feelings before?\" (to explore history) - \"Have you ever had thoughts about ending your life or harming yourself in the past?\" (to clarify suicidal history) - \"When you say you can\u2019t get out of bed or feel really bad, how much are those symptoms affecting your daily life?\" (to assess functional impact) - \"Are there times when these feelings are worse or better? What tends to trigger or ease them?\" (to understand pattern and triggers) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, nonjudgmental language, normalize questions about mood and thoughts to reduce shame. - Approach with curiosity rather than interrogation, emphasizing confidentiality. - Gradually build rapport to encourage full disclosure. - Priority order: - First explore her psychiatric history\u2014prior episodes, suicidal thoughts or behaviors\u2014to ascertain risk. - Then delve into current functional impairment and specific symptoms. - Follow with questions about daily routines, triggers, and supports to contextualize her distress.  This structured approach will help uncover concealed information, refine risk assessment, and guide appropriate intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's emotional descriptors\u2014overwhelmed and empty feelings persisting for weeks\u2014are genuine but may be amplified due to current emotional distress. Her hesitant, guarded language suggests she might be concealing past episodes of depression or suicidal thoughts, minimizing the severity or duration of her symptoms. She may also withhold specifics about functional impairment or previous mental health history. The communication pattern indicates a need for careful probing to uncover possible underlying recurrent depressive episodes, past suicidality, or other symptoms she might be minimizing. The current presentation suggests significant emotional suffering, but the severity could be underestimated due to guardedness, and there is a possibility of more complex psychiatric history that remains undisclosed.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified, but likely adult based on context. Chief complaint: Feelings of being overwhelmed and empty, reported as worsening over the past two weeks, with an emphasis on emotional distress. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing persistent feelings of heaviness and emptiness for approximately two weeks, with worsening symptoms. She describes emotional suffering but avoids discussing the impact on daily functioning or specific prior episodes. She appears emotionally expressive but guarded in her disclosures, suggesting possible concealment of prior depression or suicidal thoughts. No objective evidence of psychosis, hallucinations, or suicidal behavior was elicited during this conversation. Associated symptoms: Not explicitly reported; however, emotional symptoms such as despair and possibly sleep or appetite disturbances are likely present but not yet confirmed due to limited disclosure. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The patient's current emotional distress and symptom duration as reported. - Medium confidence: Her overall severity, functional impact, and historical information, which may be exaggerated or understated. - Low confidence: The true extent of prior depressive episodes or suicidal ideation, which she may be hiding. - Missing information: Past psychiatric history, prior episodes, suicidality, functional impairment, specific symptoms like sleep, appetite, energy levels, and any previous mental health treatment or hospitalizations.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient openly expresses intense emotional distress with vivid descriptions and clear internal conflict, but reveals possible guardedness regarding specific details or behaviors\u2014potentially underreporting severity or missing important aspects like active suicidal thoughts. - Bias detected: Amplification (catastrophizing her emotional state) and internal conflict (guilt and shame suppressing full disclosure). - Confidence level: Medium\u2014while her emotional expression suggests high distress, variability in detail indicates some underreporting, especially regarding risk behaviors. - Reasoning: Her language indicates genuine suffering but also signs of emotional amplification and possible concealment of more dangerous symptoms, a common pattern in severe depression.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be experiencing severe sleep disturbances, anhedonia, or appetite changes she hesitates to mention, possibly viewing them as less important or embarrassing. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose active suicidal plans or previous attempts due to shame or fear, especially since she expresses fears about self-harm but doesn\u2019t specify plans. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of self-harm may be exaggerated by her depressive state, but the underlying risk still warrants caution. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of symptoms might be more chronic or fluctuating than she acknowledges, which could influence risk assessment and treatment planning.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the patient likely suffers from a severe depressive episode characterized by significant emotional distress, guilt, hopelessness, and passive death wishes. The severity of her self-described feelings might be magnified by her mood state, and she probably has additional symptoms such as sleep disturbance, anhedonia, and possible passive suicidal ideation not fully articulated. Her internal conflict and guardedness suggest she might be concealing active suicidal intent or more severe functional impairment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or plans to end your life?\" \"Can you tell me about any thoughts you\u2019ve had about wanting to sleep forever or not wanting to wake up?\" \"Are you experiencing any difficulty with sleep, appetite, or daily activities?\" \"Have you thought about acts of self-harm or attempted anything before?\" - Approach strategy: Use calm, non-judgmental language emphasizing safety and confidentiality, reassuring her that details are important to help her get better, and exploring her feelings with gentle validation. - Priority order: Start with assessing her suicidal thoughts plainly and safely, then inquire about functional impact and physical symptoms, followed by exploration of her emotional experiences, to build rapport and clarify critical risk factors.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient openly reports experiencing feelings of being overwhelmed, emotional heaviness, guilt, and thoughts of self-harm, but expressions of internal distress may be amplified due to depressive mood. She indicates that symptoms have persisted for a couple of weeks and are worsening, suggesting a significant mood disturbance. Given her guardedness and concern about self-harm, she might be concealing active suicidal plans or more severe symptoms such as sleep disturbances, anhedonia, or appetite changes, which are commonly present in severe depression but may be minimized or unreported. Her language implies high emotional suffering, but the lack of specific detail on behaviors or active ideation indicates a cautious or guarded presentation, necessitating careful probing for safety issues. The communicated timeline suggests a subacute to chronic depressive episode with notable functional impairment, though the severity may be underrepresented in her self-report due to emotional amplification or shame. Additional assessment of physical symptoms, energy level, sleep, appetite, and precise risk of self-harm is essential to complete the clinical picture objectively.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female.  Chief complaint: Initial report of feeling overwhelmed and emotionally empty, with worsening symptomatology over two weeks.  Present illness: The patient describes persistent feelings of heaviness, emotional exhaustion, and guilt. She reports thoughts of self-harm, including passive wishes to sleep forever, suggesting significant depressive symptoms. She indicates functional decline, such as reduced motivation to engage in activities and work. She admits to feelings of fear regarding her self-harm thoughts but may not disclose active suicidal intent or detailed plans; other physical symptoms such as sleep disturbances, anhedonia, or appetite changes are not explicitly mentioned but are likely present given the mood state.  Associated symptoms: Emotional distress with crying episodes, possibly decreased energy and passion for daily activities; confidence regarding physical symptoms remains moderate, with likelihood of additional depression-associated features.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of significant emotional distress, guilt, and passive suicidal thoughts. - Medium confidence: Severity of symptoms may be underestimated; level of functional impairment and physical symptoms potentially more severe. - Low confidence: Exact details of suicidal planning, physical symptoms like sleep or appetite changes, and prior history are not fully known. - Missing information: Specifics regarding active suicidal plans or attempts, sleep patterns, appetite, energy levels, previous episodes, and safety assessment details.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient presents with emotionally charged, vague, and repetitive descriptions of her distress. She emphasizes feelings of heaviness and fears of self-harm, but her responses are hesitant, tearful, and include emotional exaggeration. Her focus is mainly on internal states rather than specific behaviors, with signs of internal conflict and shame. - Bias detected: Amplification bias is evident, as she overstates her emotional suffering and fears, possibly to garner attention or express her internal pain. There\u2019s also evidence of withholding behaviors, as she avoids elaborating on concrete self-harm actions or past attempts, perhaps out of shame or fear of judgment. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014while her emotional expressions are genuine, their exaggeration and hesitation suggest some overstatement and incomplete disclosure. - Reasoning: The detailed, emotionally intense language, tearfulness, and reluctance to specify behaviors point towards amplification and withholding biases impacting her reporting. Her reluctance to share concrete details indicates caution or shame.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be downplaying active suicidal plans or recent self-harm behaviors, as she focuses on fears and emotional states rather than actions. - Withheld information: She could be embarrassed or ashamed to disclose actual attempts or plans, which she avoids discussing openly, as indicated by tearfulness and hesitant responses. - Amplified concerns: Her reported fear of doing something harmful might be exaggerated or focused on worst-case scenarios; actual risk may be less severe but emotionally magnified. - Temporal distortions: She reports symptoms beginning \"a couple of weeks ago,\" but emotional accentuation may cause her to perceive her suffering as more intense or recent than actual, possibly distorting the timeline of onset or progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, her true functional impairment likely involves persistent depressive and anxious symptoms characterized by emotional distress, passive fears of self-harm, and internal conflict. She may have past or potential suicidal ideation with no clear active plans. Her emotional exaggeration suggests her distress is real but possibly overwhelming her self-assessment, leading to an overestimation of severity. She probably maintains some coping strategies or support systems not disclosed, and her current risk appears moderate but warrants careful assessment of active ideation or plans.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you ever thought about hurting yourself in a specific way or made any plans?\" (to clarify active ideation) - \"Have you ever tried to hurt yourself in the past?\" (to assess history of attempts) - \"Do you have any safety measures or people you talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed?\" (to evaluate support and safety) - \"Can you tell me if there is anything you've thought about doing recently that concerns you?\" (to gauge the immediacy of risk) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language, emphasizing that it\u2019s okay to disclose difficult feelings. - Acknowledge her distress but encourage specific details to reduce ambiguity. - Normalize fears and feelings to reduce shame, fostering honest dialogue. - Priority order: 1. Clarify suicidal ideation and previous behaviors\u2014this directly impacts safety assessment. 2. Explore support systems and coping strategies\u2014these influence management plans. 3. Delve into recent thoughts and plans\u2014determine if immediate risk exists. This structured approach balances sensitivity with the need for concrete information for accurate risk assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's emotional and vague, repetitive descriptions suggest significant internal distress, but the language used\u2014heavy feelings, racing mind, fears of self-harm\u2014may be exaggerated or overemphasized due to amplification bias. She displays hesitation and tearfulness that could indicate underlying shame or reluctance to disclose details, possibly leading to underreporting of active suicidal plans or previous attempts. While she reports feeling overwhelmed, the subjective nature of her descriptions means her assessed severity might be higher than her actual current risk. Her focus on internal states without clear mention of behaviors or concrete plans suggests she may be minimizing or withholding specific information about her level of risk. The communication patterns necessitate cautious interpretation, with specific probing needed to clarify active ideation, past attempts, and support systems.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified, but presumed adult based on communication pattern, gender unspecified.  Chief complaint: Feelings of emotional heaviness, overwhelming distress, and fear of self-harm, reported as persisting for several weeks.  Present illness: The patient reports feeling heavy, trapped, and unable to stop racing or shutting down mentally. She expresses concern about potentially harming herself and fears losing control, with these symptoms beginning approximately two weeks prior. The descriptions are emotionally charged, with tearfulness and hesitation indicating emotional distress; however, the severity may be overestimated due to amplification bias. She reports thoughts of sleeping forever as an expression of exhaustion but provides no specific details about active plans or attempts. She also reports guilt and avoidance behaviors, but details about concrete self-harm actions are limited or withheld, possibly out of shame. The timeline is approximately two weeks, but emotional perception may enhance perceived duration or intensity.  Associated symptoms: Feelings of guilt, racing thoughts, mental fatigue, and passive fears of self-harm; confidence in these symptoms is moderate but affected by bias.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s subjective experience of emotional distress and the duration of symptoms (~two weeks) are reliable. - Medium confidence: The descriptions of heaviness, racing thoughts, and guilt are emotionally valid but may be exaggerated. - Low confidence: The extent of self-harm risk, specific suicidal ideation, past attempts, or plans, due to hesitancy and potential withholding. - Missing information: Clarification on active suicidal thoughts or plans, history of self-harm attempts, current safety measures, and support systems.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult presenting with persistent emotional distress characterized by feelings of heaviness, mental fatigue, and racing thoughts lasting approximately two weeks. She reports fears of self-harm and suicidal ideation, expressed more as passive fears than specific plans, and demonstrates hesitancy and tearfulness during discussion, indicating emotional vulnerability. Communication patterns suggest the possibility of amplification of distress and potential underreporting of active risk behaviors. Further assessment is required to clarify the presence of active suicidal ideation, past self-harm or attempts, and available support systems to appropriately evaluate her risk level.",

She reports fears of self-harm and suicidal ideation, expressed more as passive fears than specific plans, and demonstrates hesitancy and tearfulness during discussion, indicating emotional vulnerability. Communication patterns suggest the possibility of amplification of distress and potential underreporting of active risk behaviors. Further assessment is required to clarify the presence of active suicidal ideation, past self-harm or attempts, and available support systems to appropriately evaluate her risk level.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient presents with emotionally charged, hesitant responses. She uses minimization language but also expresses fears of self-harm. Her responses reveal internal conflict, with signs of emotional vulnerability and guardedness, especially when discussing self-harm. - Bias detected: Both minimization and amplification biases are apparent; she minimizes the severity of her depression while overemphasizing fears related to self-harm and losing control. There is also evidence of withholding delicate details, likely due to shame or fear. - Confidence level: Medium. These patterns suggest her self-report is influenced significantly by emotional biases, but important information may be concealed. - Reasoning: The combination of emotional language, hesitations, and reluctance to disclose specifics indicates her communication is impacted by internal conflict, shame, and anxiety, leading to potential underreporting of actual risk and severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true depth of her depression, including possible hopelessness, persistent functional impairment, and any active suicidal planning, are likely more severe than conveyed. - Withheld information: She might be concealing specific intent, detailed self-harm behaviors, or attempts, due to shame or fear of judgment or consequences. - Amplified concerns: Her expressed fears about losing control suggest there could be underlying impulsivity or anxiety-driven catastrophizing, potentially inflating perceived immediate danger but warranting caution. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms may have been more chronic and persistent than just the last two weeks, with possible earlier episodes or ongoing issues not fully communicated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: The patient probably suffers from moderate to severe depression characterized by persistent emotional heaviness, fatigue, racing thoughts, and fears of self-harm. Her defensive communication style suggests she is underestimating her symptom severity but also experiencing significant internal distress that she has difficulty fully articulating. She may harbor active suicidal thoughts or plans, but shame, fear, and emotional reserve hinder full disclosure. Her anxiety about losing control and self-harm indicates a need for careful risk assessment and a supportive, gradual inquiry into her true internal state, including prior episodes and current safety.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me more about your thoughts when you feel like you might hurt yourself? Have you ever made any plans or taken any steps?\" (to clarify risk and intent) * \"Are you currently thinking about waking up in the morning or making plans about the future?\" (to assess Hopelessness) * \"Have you tried to hurt yourself before, even if it was a long time ago?\" (to understand past behaviors) * \"What helps you feel a bit better when you're overwhelmed?\" (to gauge support systems) - Approach strategy: * Ask in a non-judgmental, empathetic tone, emphasizing safety and understanding, encouraging honesty. * Use open-ended, gentle prompts to reduce shame and resistance. * Normalize her feelings to reduce embarrassment and foster trust. - Priority order: * First, clarify current risk: suicidal thoughts, plans, recent behaviors. * Then, explore past attempts or self-harm history. * Next, discuss support systems and coping strategies. * Finally, assess the severity and duration of her depression and anxiety for a comprehensive picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional vulnerability, hesitancy, and potential underreporting of severity. She describes feeling \"heavy,\" fatigued, and experiencing racing thoughts for approximately two weeks. While she reports fears of self-harm and suicidal ideation, her language suggests some minimization of the severity, and emotional guarding indicates she may withhold or understate some details, such as the presence of active planning or past attempts. The mention of thoughts about \"sleeping forever\" reflects passive suicidal ideation, but her guarded responses and emotional distress imply her symptoms may be more severe and persistent than currently communicated. Her expressions of fear and internal conflict suggest a significant level of internal distress, potentially with underlying hopelessness or unmentioned prior episodes. There is a need for cautious interpretation and further detailed assessment of risk, current plans, and support systems.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (specific age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Emotional heaviness, fatigue, and racing thoughts persisting for about two weeks, with reported passive suicidal thoughts.  Present illness: The patient reports persistent emotional distress, feelings of heaviness, and mental fatigue. She describes racing thoughts and a desire to sleep forever, indicating severe distress. She admits to having thoughts about self-harm, such as \"not waking up\" or \"sleeping forever,\" but communicates these more as fears than explicit intent. The duration appears to be approximately two weeks; however, based on communication biases, her symptoms may have been more prolonged or severe. She is emotionally guarded, with hesitation and emotional vulnerability during the interview, suggesting she may be underestimating or concealing the true extent of her symptoms. She does not report specific previous suicide attempts or plans during this interview, but her internal conflict indicates possible unspoken or undisclosed history or severity.  Associated symptoms: Anxiety signs are implied through racing thoughts; tearfulness and emotional vulnerability are observed but not explicitly detailed. The full scope of her mood symptoms, functional impairment, and past psychiatric history requires further inquiry.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of depressive symptoms such as emotional heaviness, fatigue, and racing thoughts over the past two weeks. - Medium confidence: The reported passive suicidal ideation and fears of self-harm, recognizing the potential for underreporting. - Low confidence: The severity and duration of her symptoms, the presence of active suicidal intent or plans, and past suicide attempts, which are likely underreported or withheld. - Missing information: Detailed history of past episodes, active suicidal planning, self-harm behaviors, prior attempts, current safety, and available support systems.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with a two-week history of persistent emotional distress characterized by feelings of heaviness, mental fatigue, and racing thoughts. She reports passive suicidal thoughts, including ideas of sleeping forever or not waking up, though she does not disclose active planning or recent self-harm attempts. Emotional vulnerability and hesitancy are evident during the interview, indicating possible underreporting of symptom severity. The current symptoms suggest moderate to severe depression, but communication biases imply her distress may be more profound and enduring than initially conveyed.

She reports passive suicidal thoughts, including ideas of sleeping forever or not waking up, though she does not disclose active planning or recent self-harm attempts. Emotional vulnerability and hesitancy are evident during the interview, indicating possible underreporting of symptom severity. The current symptoms suggest moderate to severe depression, but communication biases imply her distress may be more profound and enduring than initially conveyed. Further assessment is required to clarify her risk for self-harm, determine past psychiatric history, and evaluate her support system.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional verbosity, emphasizing distress but employing vagueness and qualifiers that obscure the full severity of her suicidal thoughts and plans. Her responses are emotionally loaded but avoid specific details, indicating internal conflict and shame. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification combined with mild minimization influences her reporting. She overstates her distress to convey suffering but downplays the immediacy or concreteness of suicidal plans, likely due to shame or fear of judgment. - Confidence level: Medium. While her emotional expressions are genuine, the vagueness and hesitance suggest her risk might be underrepresented. - Reasoning: Her language and response style show she is overwhelmed but intentionally or unconsciously concealing critical details about her risk, necessitating cautious risk assessment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true severity and persistence of suicidal ideation, including whether there are passive or active plans, may be more significant than disclosed because she avoids specifics. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed about the gravity of her thoughts or any past attempts, leading her to omit details about her actual plans or urge to harm herself. - Amplified concerns: Her expressions of fear about \"losing it\" and worsening symptoms could be magnified as an expression of internal anxiety, which may not correspond fully to her actual level of danger. - Temporal distortions: She might inaccurately recall or interpret her symptom timeline, possibly overreporting or underreporting the duration or intensity of her thoughts.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette suggests she suffers from significant depressive symptoms with pervasive passive suicidal ideation. Her distress is likely more intense and persistent, with potential for suicidal plans or self-harm that she is hesitant to disclose fully. Internal conflict, shame, and emotional amplification obscure her factual risk level, warranting a thorough safety assessment and cautious monitoring.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you ever had thoughts about how or when you might hurt yourself? Do you ever think about methods or specific times? Have you ever made any plans or taken steps toward acting on these thoughts?\" (to uncover active planning or intent) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathic, non-judgmental language, emphasizing concern and support, e.g., \"It's common to have difficult thoughts, and you're not alone\u2014let's talk about everything honestly so I can help you.\" - Priority order: First, clarify the presence and specifics of suicidal plans or intent, then explore the duration and frequency of these thoughts, followed by past attempts or interventions, and lastly assess support and protective factors, to determine actual risk and needed interventions.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with emotional distress characterized by feelings of heaviness, mental fatigue, and racing thoughts. She reports passive suicidal ideation\u2014such as wishing to sleep forever or not wake up\u2014but denies active plans or recent self-harm. However, her communication style involves emotional verbosity, use of qualifiers, and avoidance of specific details, which suggests she may underreport the severity and immediacy of her suicidal thoughts. Her language and hesitance imply internal conflict, shame, or fear of judgment, potentially leading to minimization of her symptoms. She may also be experiencing more persistent depressive symptoms than she openly reports, and her internal distress could be more profound. The absence of detailed plans or actions does not rule out significant risk, but current reporting biases necessitate cautious interpretation and further inquiry. Overall, her symptom picture is consistent with moderate to severe depression with passive suicidal ideation, but the true extent of her risk remains uncertain due to communication factors.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Persistent emotional distress with feelings of heaviness, mental exhaustion, and racing thoughts, with passive suicidal ideation.  Present illness: - Well-established symptoms: Over the past two weeks, the patient reports being emotionally overwhelmed, experiencing a sense of heaviness, mental fatigue, and racing or shutting-down thoughts. She admits to passive suicidal thoughts, including wishing to sleep forever or not wake up, without active planning or recent attempts. - Likely minimized symptoms: The severity of her suicidal ideation, including underlying thoughts or potential plans, may be underreported due to shame, internal conflict, or fear of judgment. - Possibly withheld symptoms: She may be concealing more active or detailed suicidal plans, past attempts, or other symptoms such as hopelessness or anhedonia. - Timeline: Symptoms have been ongoing for approximately two weeks, with persistent distress and passive suicidal thoughts.  Associated symptoms: Anxiety symptoms indicated by racing thoughts; mood symptoms suggestive of depression, given the emotional heaviness and fatigue; confidence level regarding other symptoms is moderate, but additional details are needed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of emotional distress, depressive symptoms, and passive suicidal thoughts. - Medium confidence: The severity and immediacy of suicidal ideation and underlying risk factors. - Low confidence: Exact nature of suicidal plans, true risk level, and past psychiatric or self-harm history. - Missing information: Details about any active or specific suicidal plans, past attempts, duration and frequency of thoughts, safety and support system, and past psychiatric treatment.\nANSWER: An adult female reports experiencing persistent emotional distress over the past two weeks, characterized by feelings of heaviness, mental fatigue, and racing thoughts. She admits to passive suicidal ideation, including thoughts of sleeping forever or not waking up, without any specific plans or recent attempts. Her communication exhibits emotional verbosity and qualifiers, which may obscure the true severity of her symptoms. She appears to minimize or withhold detailed information regarding any active plans or past self-harm, and her internal conflict and shame may influence her disclosures. While current symptoms suggest moderate to severe depression with passive suicidal thoughts, further careful assessment is necessary to evaluate actual risk and determine appropriate safety measures.",
