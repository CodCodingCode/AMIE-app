    "output": "THINKING: The latest conversation added details about the onset and progression of symptoms over a few years, including initial stiff or heavy legs, increasing frequency of falls, and worsening symptoms with tiredness or during tasks like writing or buttoning. The patient has not identified any factors that improve symptoms. These details are confirmatory and specific. The prior vignette already summarized most of these, but now it includes the timeline (a few years ago) and the symptom triggers (tiredness, fine motor tasks).  \nANSWER: The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting with a few-year history of progressively worsening difficulty walking, frequent falls, and recent trouble with his hands and speech. The symptoms started with feelings of stiff or heavy legs and have been increasing over time, particularly worsening with tiredness and during activities like writing or buttoning."
