Her responses are expressive and driven by emotional tone, indicating significant distress but no evident attempt at concealment. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias, as she emphasizes severity and uses emotionally charged language to describe her experiences. - Confidence level: Medium; her subjective account is likely inflated in severity, but her openness suggests the core report is somewhat accurate. - Reasoning: The consistent use of intense descriptors and emotional focus suggest her perception of symptoms is amplified, typical of panic or anxiety-driven responses.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be underreporting baseline anxiety levels or previous panic episodes, which could explain her heightened response. - Withheld information: Less likely, given her openness about cannabis use, but there could be unreported substance use or previous mental health issues. - Amplified concerns: She appears to be exaggerating the threat of severe medical emergencies, like heart attack or losing her mind, likely influenced by her emotional state. - Temporal distortions: She may perceive her symptom onset as more sudden or severe than it objectively is, due to panic reaction.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a transient panic or anxiety episode triggered by recent cannabis use. Her physiological sensations such as pounding heart and disorientation are real but probably not indicative of a life-threatening condition. Her emotional distress significantly skews her perception, leading her to overestimate severity. Underlying anxiety or panic predispositions may exist but remain unreported. Her symptoms are acute, linked temporally to substance intake, and probably resolve with reassurance and rest.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced similar symptoms before, even without cannabis?\" \"Can you tell me more about your usual anxiety levels?\" \"Are you experiencing any other physical symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?\" \"Did you notice any changes or feelings before the symptoms started?\" - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to validate her distress while gently guiding her toward more objective descriptions. Frame questions to normalize panic-like reactions and distinguish these from serious medical issues. - Priority order: First, clarify the nature and duration of physical symptoms to assess urgency; then, explore her mental health history and baseline anxiety; finally, understand her substance use patterns to address potential triggers.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with subjective reports of feeling disoriented, a pounding heart, and fears of fainting or a heart attack shortly after using a significant amount of cannabis. Her emotional tone and hyperbolic language suggest heightened distress, likely amplifying her perceived severity of symptoms. While she describes her physical sensations as severe, these are consistent with anxiety or panic reactions, which can include palpitations, disorientation, and chest discomfort. Given her openness about recent substance use, her symptoms are probably transient and related to acute anxiety or panic rather than a primary cardiac event. There may be underlying or past anxiety issues that she is not mentioning, and she might be minimizing baseline anxiety levels. She appears to be overestimating the threat posed by her current symptoms, which is common in distress-driven presentations. Additional assessment of her medical and mental health history, prior episodes, and substance use is necessary to clarify severity and underlying predispositions.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 29-year-old biological female.  Chief complaint: Feeling disoriented, with a pounding heart, fears of fainting or a heart attack, occurring shortly after increased cannabis use.  Present illness: The patient reports onset of symptoms approximately one hour prior to evaluation, including sensations of disorientation and palpitations. Symptoms are temporally linked to recent cannabis use. She expresses significant distress, with hyperbolic concern about losing her mind and experiencing a life-threatening cardiac event. Objective findings are limited at this time; physical examination and vital signs are not described, but symptoms are consistent with acute anxiety or panic episodes. She may be overreporting severity due to emotional distress, though physical symptoms such as palpitations and disorientation are likely real but self-limited. Additional symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness are not explicitly reported but need further inquiry. The patient\u2019s recounting suggests transient symptoms linked to substance use, with possible underlying anxiety predisposition unmentioned but worth exploring.  Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The temporal relationship between cannabis use and symptom onset, and symptom description. - Medium confidence: The severity of symptoms as reported and her emotional state influencing perception. - Low confidence: The extent of any underlying cardiac or chronic medical conditions, as these are unreported. - Missing information: Detailed physical assessment, vital signs, medical history, mental health history, prior similar episodes, and substance use patterns.\nANSWER: The patient is a 29-year-old woman presenting with acute symptoms including disorientation and palpitations occurring approximately one hour after increased cannabis use. She expresses significant distress and fears of fainting or a heart attack. The clinical picture suggests a transient episode of anxiety or panic likely triggered by recent substance intake. Physical examination and vital signs are needed to further assess for any potential cardiovascular issues, but current symptoms are consistent with a benign, self-limited panic response. Additional information on her medical history, prior episodes, baseline anxiety levels, and substance use is required for comprehensive evaluation.",

She expresses significant distress and fears of fainting or a heart attack. The clinical picture suggests a transient episode of anxiety or panic likely triggered by recent substance intake. Physical examination and vital signs are needed to further assess for any potential cardiovascular issues, but current symptoms are consistent with a benign, self-limited panic response. Additional information on her medical history, prior episodes, baseline anxiety levels, and substance use is required for comprehensive evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses highly emotional, vivid language emphasizing distress and perceived severity. She openly describes her symptoms and fears but does so in a way that amplifies the gravity of her experience. - Bias detected: Amplification bias driven by anxiety and distress, leading her to overstate symptom severity and danger. - Confidence level: Medium; the pattern of exaggeration points toward her emotional influence, but her account aligns with typical panic responses. - Reasoning: Her detailed, emotionally charged descriptions suggest a strong anxiety component affecting her perception, though physical symptoms are likely less severe than described.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may not fully acknowledge milder physical sensations like slight dizziness, weakness, or subtle disorientation\u2014possibly because focus is on intense feelings. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to disclose past similar episodes, frequency of substance use, or her general mental health history, which could clarify her baseline. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of serious health issues (heart attack, psychosis) are probably overblown relative to her actual physical status, driven by her panic. - Temporal distortions: She may perceive her symptoms as lasting longer or being more severe than they objectively are, influenced by her anxiety and emotional state.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should likely include: A transient panic attack episode triggered by increased cannabis use, characterized by acute disorientation, palpitations, and chest discomfort, beginning approximately one hour after substance intake. While she perceives her symptoms as very severe, physical examination and vital signs are needed for confirmation. Her distress is significant but probably disproportionate to physiological danger. She might have residual anxiety or mild cognitive fuzziness, but no evidence suggests ongoing medical emergency.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: Past episodes of similar symptoms or panic attacks? Baseline mental health issues like anxiety disorders? Past substance use patterns? Functional impact of episodes? Any previous medical conditions, especially cardiac or neurological? - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental questioning to validate her experience while gently exploring her history, emphasizing safety and reassurance. Normalize panic responses to reduce shame and encourage honest disclosure. - Priority order: First, inquire about her mental health history and previous episodes to contextualize her current experience; second, explore her physical health status and medication; third, clarify substance use details and past coping strategies. This order helps establish a comprehensive understanding while building rapport and minimizing amplification tendencies.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's emotional, vivid descriptions indicate significant anxiety and distress, which may amplify her perception of severity regarding her symptoms. She reports acute disorientation, palpitations, chest discomfort, feelings of movement, and memory difficulties occurring approximately one hour after increased cannabis use. While these symptoms are consistent with a panic attack, her communication style suggests she may overstate their severity. She might minimize or withhold certain symptoms such as mild dizziness or fatigue and may have heightened fears of serious medical conditions like cardiac events or psychosis, possibly influenced by her anxiety. Recognizing this, her current symptoms are likely self-limited and primarily anxiety-driven, but physical examination and vital signs are essential to confirm or exclude medical emergencies. Additional history regarding previous similar episodes, mental health background, substance use patterns, and physical health is necessary but currently unknown.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 29-year-old biological female.  Chief complaint: Acute episode of disorientation and palpitations following recent increased cannabis use, perceived as severe but likely representing a panic response.  Present illness: The patient describes feeling disoriented, with sensations of movement, difficulty recalling words, and palpitations beginning roughly one hour after using a greater amount of cannabis than usual. She reports feeling \"terrible\" and \"really scared,\" emphasizing distress. Symptoms may be exaggerated due to her anxiety, and some physical symptoms such as mild dizziness or fatigue could be underreported. Timeline suggests an initial trigger with symptoms peaking shortly thereafter, with possible residual anxiety. She also describes chest discomfort but does not specify other physical symptoms like weakness or sweating. She expresses fears of fainting and heart attack, which are likely influenced by her emotional state.  Associated symptoms: She reports a pounding heart, fuzzy head, and difficulty concentrating. Confidence in the physical severity is moderate given her emotional context, but vital signs and physical exam are needed for confirmation.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Symptoms onset correlates with increased cannabis use, describing disorientation and palpitations. - Medium confidence: The severity and interpretation of symptoms are influenced by her distress; physical findings may be less severe than perceived. - Low confidence: Exact physical status and presence of subtle symptoms are unknown without examination. - Missing information: Medical history, prior episodes, baseline mental health, detailed substance use history, and current physical exam and vital signs.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotionally charged, somewhat vague language, emphasizing distress but providing limited specific details. Her responses are inconsistent, with tendencies toward minimization and amplification, reflecting emotional turbulence and possible cognitive disorientation. - Bias detected: The primary biases are a mixture of minimization (downplaying baseline mental or physical symptoms) and amplification (exaggerating current distress and fears), affecting the accuracy of her self-report. - Confidence level: Medium; her emotional state and communication patterns reduce certainty about the true severity and timeline of her symptoms. - Reasoning: Her vague language, emotional emphasis, and response style suggest she may overstate current distress due to anxiety while underreporting or not fully articulating prior baseline functioning. Her memory issues and scattered responses indicate possible cognitive disorientation that further complicates accurate assessment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her baseline mental state might include ongoing cognitive or emotional difficulties that she perceives as normal, thus underreporting them. - Withheld information: She may hesitate to disclose past mental health issues, prior similar episodes, or physical health concerns, possibly out of shame or fear. - Amplified concerns: Her current fears about her physical health may be exaggerated by anxiety, making her perceive imminent danger when it might be less severe. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms could have been present, fluctuating, longer before her cannabis use, but she attributes initial onset to this recent event, leading to an incomplete timeline.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a transient acute anxiety or panic episode possibly triggered or exacerbated by recent heavy cannabis use. Underlying cognitive or mood issues may be present, with some physical symptoms such as dizziness, perceptual disturbances, and emotional distress. Her current state appears intensified by anxiety, with possible subtle chronic issues that she is not fully aware of or willing to disclose.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced similar feelings or episodes before?\" \"What is your usual mental and emotional state during your regular day?\" \"Do you have any past diagnoses or previous episodes of anxiety or depression?\" \"Can you tell me more about your sleep patterns and mood generally?\" \"Are you experiencing any other physical symptoms like chest pain or headaches regularly?\" These questions aim to uncover prior baseline symptoms and physical health. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language, emphasizing curiosity about her experience rather than suspicion. Reinforce that many people have similar experiences and that understanding her full history will help her get the best support. - Priority order: First, clarify her baseline functioning and previous episodes to understand her starting point. Next, explore physical health and sleep patterns to identify other contributing factors. Finally, probe her substance use and how it relates to her current state, ensuring a holistic view.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s subjective report suggests acute perceptual and emotional disturbances, including dizziness, feelings of movement (spinning, moving), difficulty with word recall, and somatic symptoms like pounding heart and shakiness. However, her emotionally charged language, vague descriptions, and inconsistent responses indicate a tendency to amplify current distress and possibly exaggerate perceptions of severity. She attributes the onset of symptoms to recent cannabis use but may not fully report baseline mental and physical health or prior episodes, which could be minimal or certain symptoms that are understated. Her communication style suggests she might be experiencing a panic attack or acute anxiety episode triggered or worsened by substance use, with underlying cognitive or mood vulnerabilities that are underreported. Objective findings are limited as this is a subjective account, and her current state may reflect emotional lability influencing her perception of symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 29-year-old biological female. Chief complaint: Acute sensation of perceptual disturbance and feelings of being overwhelmed, with physical symptoms such as pounding heart and shakiness, post recent cannabis use. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing feelings of disorientation, perceptual changes (e.g., everything feeling strange, moving, or spinning), difficulty with word recall, and emotional distress characterized by anxiety. These symptoms began approximately one hour prior following increased cannabis consumption. She reports morning shakiness and odd visual perceptions upon waking, and during daily activities, anxiety intensifies with symptom amplification. She denies significant physical symptoms such as chest pain or headache beyond what she describes. Likely minimized symptoms: Baseline mental health issues, if any, and the full extent of previous similar episodes are not disclosed. Likely withheld symptoms: Past psychiatric history, sleep patterns, and other physical health issues are unknown, as she may be reluctant to disclose or unaware of their significance. Timeline: Symptoms started roughly one hour before consultation, but her narrative indicates potential longer-standing perceptual or emotional disturbances that she perceives as normal, with acute exacerbation following cannabis use. Associated symptoms: She reports perceptual disturbances, emotional anxiety, and physical sensations like heart pounding and shakiness, with moderate confidence. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Recent cannabis use as a precipitant. - Medium confidence: Current symptoms of perceptual disturbances and anxiety. - Low confidence: Extent of ongoing baseline or past psychiatric symptoms, with possible underreporting. - Missing information: Past mental health history, prior similar episodes, sleep quality, and physical health details.\nANSWER: The clinical picture suggests an acute anxiety or panic episode possibly triggered or intensified by recent heavy cannabis consumption, accompanied by perceptual disturbances and physical symptoms consistent with anxiety. Underlying mood or cognitive vulnerabilities may be present but are not fully disclosed.

Her responses are somewhat vague regarding duration and severity, emphasizing distress rather than objective details. - Bias detected: Amplification bias is prominent, as she exaggerates her symptoms and fears beyond what might be objectively present. - Confidence level: Medium; while her distress seems genuine, her perception is likely skewed by anxiety, making some of her reports potentially inflated. - Reasoning: The detailed emotional language and focus on catastrophic outcomes indicate she tends to magnify her symptoms, especially when anxious, which can distort clinical interpretation.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be downplaying more severe or persistent physical symptoms such as chest pain, serious neurological deficits, or panic-related autonomic symptoms, due to fear or shame. - Withheld information: Concerns about stigma or not wanting to appear weak could lead her to hide feelings of helplessness or deeper anxiety issues. - Amplified concerns: She probably overstates her perception of danger (heart attack, fainting) due to her fear-driven focus. - Temporal distortions: Her report of \"kind of stays around\" suggests difficulties in accurately tracking the duration or frequency of symptoms, possibly overestimating their persistence.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, her true clinical picture likely includes: - Anxiety and panic symptoms triggered or intensified by cannabis use, with perceptual disturbances such as visual flickering or shapes. - Physical sensations like dizziness, disorientation, and shakiness, which are genuine but possibly less severe or persistent than perceived. - Occasional perceptual distortions and physical discomfort that may be transient or situational. - An underlying anxiety vulnerability that amplifies her perception of threat and discomfort. - She may have additional autonomic symptoms (palpitations, chest tightness) that she is hesitant to disclose fully. - Her emotional response significantly influences her perception, leading to overestimation of severity and danger.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me if you've experienced any chest pain or palpitations during these episodes?\" (to uncover unreported physical symptoms) * \"Have you noticed these visual disturbances or dizziness during other times when you're not feeling anxious?\" (to assess baseline perceptual issues) * \"How often do these symptoms occur, and how long do they typically last?\" (to clarify the timeline) * \"Do you experience any other physical or emotional symptoms that you haven't mentioned?\" (to identify suppressed feelings) * \"Have you ever had similar episodes in the past, or is this the first time?\" (to determine chronicity) - Approach strategy: Use a gentle, validating tone, acknowledging her distress while reassuring her that she is safe and her symptoms are understandable. Frame questions to reduce shame or fear of judgment. - Priority order: Start with physical symptom questions to gather factual data; then, explore her perceptions and feelings to understand her emotional impact; finally, clarify the timeline and any history of similar episodes for context.  **Note:** This approach aims to reduce her anxiety-driven exaggeration, encourage accurate reporting, and ensure that essential clinical concerns are thoroughly explored.",

Her communication shows a tendency to amplify her distress, with vivid descriptions and focus on worst-case outcomes, indicating possible amplification bias. She emphasizes the severity and persistence of her symptoms, but her vague timeline and focus on catastrophic fears suggest her perception may be exaggerated. She mentions recent increased cannabis use, which could have contributed to her symptoms, but the extent of any underlying or baseline issues remains unclear, especially given her tendency to overstate her distress. There is a possibility that she underreports or minimizes other significant physical symptoms, such as chest pain or autonomic disturbances, due to fear or shame.

I\\u2019ve felt anxious sometimes, but not like this\\u2014like, I keep feeling like I\\u2019m losing my mind and I just get so scared. It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m not really here, and I keep thinking I might pass out or something.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with acute perceptual disturbances, including visual flickering and shapes, along with physical sensations such as dizziness, shakiness, and a rapid heartbeat, occurring shortly after increased cannabis use. She reports waking with shakiness and visual distortions, which she associates with heightened anxiety. Her communication pattern indicates significant distress and possible symptom overstatement, but objective signs and prior history are not yet available. Further assessment of physical symptoms, history of similar episodes, and baseline mental health is necessary to differentiate between a transient anxiety/panic episode and other potential underlying conditions.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs highly emotional language and exaggerates their distress, describing symptoms as severe and persistent, possibly to seek reassurance and validation. She provides vague descriptions and an elaborate narrative, reflecting high anxiety and difficulty focusing, which may distort her perception of severity. Her mention of \"not like this\" prior experiences suggests potential minimization of past episodes, while her current descriptions contain amplification cues.  - Bias detected: Amplification bias is prominent, with exaggeration of symptom severity and fear, coupled with potential minimization of past mild episodes or previous similar experiences. There may also be some withholding of subtle or less distressing details due to shame, and confusion markers reflect disrupted focus rather than factual inaccuracies.  - Confidence level: Medium; the pattern of exaggeration and emotional expression is clear, but some subjective descriptors remain open to interpretation.  - Reasoning: The language choices and inconsistent specificity point toward a patient overwhelmed by anxiety, leading to overstatement of current symptoms. The reluctance to acknowledge past episodes points to possible minimization or shame. The overall emotional tone suggests amplification of distress, typical in panic or anxiety states.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may be underreporting mild or less alarming past anxiety episodes, possibly viewing them as insignificant or not worth mentioning, which could suggest her actual baseline involves more frequent or milder panic-like symptoms. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to disclose the extent of her cannabis use or past mental health difficulties, possibly out of shame or fear of judgment, which could influence her reporting. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of losing control, passing out, or having a heart attack are likely exaggerated by her panic, and the actual medical risks may be less imminent than her perception suggests. - Temporal distortions: She presents her symptoms as recent and severe but may have experienced similar episodes in the past that she downplays or does not recall clearly, leading to a perception that this is unprecedented or more severe than usual.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased view likely entails a primary episode of acute panic or anxiety characterized by transient perceptual disturbances, physical sensations such as shakiness, dizziness, and visual distortions, occurring shortly after cannabis use. These symptoms are probably amplified by her high anxiety levels, catastrophizing tendencies, and possible substance effects. She may have a history of mild or unrecognized panic episodes that she minimizes, and her current presentation is influenced by intense emotional distress leading to exaggeration. The physical symptoms are likely transient, typical of panic attacks, but her perception of severity and persistence is inflated. Her fears about severe medical catastrophe are consistent with panic catastrophizing but should be scaled back in clinical assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you experienced similar feelings or visual disturbances before, even if they were less intense?\" (to uncover past episodes) - \"Can you tell me more about your past experiences with anxiety or panic attacks?\" (to establish baseline) - \"How often do you use cannabis, and have your symptoms changed with different amounts or types?\" (to clarify substance involvement) - \"Are there days when you feel less anxious or have fewer symptoms? What helps or worsens your feelings?\" (to identify triggers and fluctuations) - \"Do you notice any other physical sensations, like chest tightness or shortness of breath?\" (to get a fuller physical symptom picture) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental questions that normalize variable experiences to reduce shame or fear. Emphasize that symptoms can fluctuate and that understanding past patterns will help determine the best treatment. - Priority order: First, explore past episodes to differentiate new from recurring patterns; then, clarify substance use and triggers; finally, assess current physical symptoms comprehensively to guide diagnosis and treatment planning.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with subjective reports of perceptual disturbances, physical sensations, and anxiety symptoms following increased cannabis use, with indications of high emotional distress and exaggeration of severity. Her descriptions include visual flickering and shapes, dizziness, shakiness, and a racing heart, which are typical of acute panic or anxiety episodes. The communication analysis suggests she may be overestimating her symptoms' severity and duration, using emotionally charged language, and possibly underreporting past similar episodes or milder symptoms to avoid stigma or shame. Her fears of passing out or having a heart attack are likely heightened by her anxiety. Objective signs and thorough history are required to differentiate transient panic attacks from other medical or psychiatric conditions, and she may have experienced less intense or unnoticed episodes previously. Her cannabis use appears linked to her current symptoms but needs further clarification regarding her typical usage patterns and possible substance effects. Overall, current physical symptoms are likely consistent with an anxiety/panic episode, but the reported severity and perception are probably amplified.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 29-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Acute perceptual disturbances and physical sensations consistent with anxiety or panic episodes, exaggerated through patient\u2019s communication style.  Present illness: The patient reports initiating symptoms shortly after increased cannabis use, including visual flickering, shapes, dizziness, shakiness, and a racing heartbeat. She describes waking with shakiness and visual distortions, and experiencing heightened anxiety that worsens her perceptual disturbances. She perceives these episodes as severe and persistent, although objective assessment suggests these are characteristic of transient panic attacks. She indicates no prior similar episodes of this intensity but acknowledges occasional mild anxiety. The timeline appears to be recent onset, within the past hour, correlated with substance use and heightened emotional state.  Associated symptoms: The patient reports feelings of losing her mind, fear of passing out or having a heart attack, and visual phenomena. The physical sensations\u2014dizziness, shakiness, rapid heartbeat\u2014are typical of panic attacks but may be somewhat amplified by her anxious state and substance effects. She also reports waking with symptoms, indicating possible baseline vulnerability to anxiety symptoms, although she underreports prior episodes.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of recent perceptual disturbances, physical sensations (dizziness, shakiness, tachycardia), and onset after substance use. - Medium confidence: The severity and persistence of symptoms, since communication indicates possible exaggeration but aligns with typical panic attack presentation. - Low confidence: The extent of historical episodes and baseline mental health, as she appears to minimize prior episodes. - Missing information: Past mental health history, frequency and amount of cannabis use, prior episodes of similar symptoms, physical examination and vital signs, and assessment of other medical or psychiatric conditions.\nANSWER: The patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with recent-onset perceptual disturbances, including visual flickering and shapes, along with physical sensations such as dizziness, shakiness, and tachycardia, occurring shortly after an increase in cannabis use. She reports waking with symptoms and feelings of losing her mind, with heightened anxiety and fears of passing out or a heart attack. While these symptoms are consistent with an acute panic or anxiety episode, her communication pattern suggests possible symptom exaggeration and heightened emotional distress. She does not report prior episodes of similar severity but indicates occasional mild anxiety. Objective assessment and further history are necessary to confirm the diagnosis, differentiate from medical causes, and evaluate her baseline mental health and substance use patterns.",
