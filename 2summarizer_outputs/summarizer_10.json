It started as just a small bump, maybe three or four weeks ago, but now it\\u2019s gotten bigger really quickly, and it bleeds so easily, even if I just gently touch it or bump it.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes a lesion that is rapidly growing, bleeding easily, and evolving over a few weeks but attempts to minimize the severity with words like \"small bump\" and \"not really painful,\" despite the clinical signs that suggest more significant concern. Her language includes hesitations and vague timeline references, indicating some ambivalence and anxiety. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization combined with health-related anxiety is influencing her reporting. She downplays some symptoms that may be more serious, while her focus on growth and bleeding reveals genuine concern. - Confidence level: Medium. Her participation is honest but affected by anxiety and minimization, which could obscure the true severity. - Reasoning: The internal pattern of softening descriptions amidst detailed concern about growth and bleeding points to an effort to suppress perceived severity, typical of anxious patients trying to balance honesty with self-protection.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her description of the bump as \"small\" and \"not really painful\" suggests she may be experiencing more discomfort or larger size than she admits, with potential ulceration or surface changes not described. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to share fears of the lesion being malignant or her own feelings of helplessness or embarrassment about the lesion\u2019s appearance or progression, which could evoke more intense anxiety or shame. - Amplified concerns: Her focus on bleeding and rapid growth might exaggerate the perceived threat, especially if her anxiety about cancer influences her perception. - Timeline distortions: She may underestimate the speed of growth or overstate the initial size, as memory of the progression could be fuzzy or emotionally colored, leading her to describe it as \"small\" initially when it might have been more significant.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the lesion is likely larger and more aggressive than perceived\u2014possibly a rapidly enlarging vascular lesion such as a lobular capillary hemangioma or similar benign tumor that has been growing quickly over weeks, with frequent bleeding episodes. Pain may be more significant than she reports, or discomfort might be present that she downplays. The timeline probably indicates a faster progression, and her anxiety may cause her to over-worry about malignancy, skewing her emotional response but not necessarily her factual reporting. She may also be underestimating surface ulceration or surface changes, which are important for clinical assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how big the bump is now? Do you have any measurements or pictures?\" (to clarify size) - \"How many times in the last week have you noticed bleeding from the bump, and is it heavy or light?\" (to gauge bleeding frequency/severity) - \"Have you experienced any pain, discomfort, or surface ulcers besides the bleeding?\" (to assess associated symptoms) - \"Has the bump changed in size or appearance at all since it started?\" (to clarify the growth pattern) - \"Are there any other symptoms like feeling tired, fever, or other skin changes?\" (to rule out systemic signs) - Approach strategy: Use empathic, non-judgmental language to encourage open disclosure, normalize anxieties about skin changes, and gently explore details without making her feel judged or minimized. Frame questions to acknowledge her concerns but also guide her toward detailed, factual descriptions\u2014this helps reduce anxiety-induced distortion and promotes accurate reporting. - Priority order: First, confirm the current size and bleeding frequency to assess urgency. Then, explore any additional symptoms or surface changes. Next, clarify the timeline to establish progression speed. This order ensures critical, potentially urgent information is obtained early, while fostering her comfort to share detailed observations.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes a rapidly enlarging, bleeding skin lesion on the nose, suggesting a concerning process. However, her tendency to minimize symptoms\u2014calling it a \"small bump\" and stating it is \"not really painful\"\u2014indicates she may be underreporting the lesion's size or severity, or may have some ambivalence or anxiety influencing her descriptions. She emphasizes growth over the past few weeks and bleeding episodes, which are objective signs of a lesion that warrants further investigation. Her communication suggests possible underestimation of surface changes or discomfort, and she might be withholding concerns about malignancy or more serious symptoms like ulceration, pain, or systemic symptoms. Since her account lacks precise measurements or detailed progression, additional probing is necessary to clarify size, bleeding frequency, pain, surface ulceration, and other associated symptoms. The assessment should consider that her anxiety may amplify her perceived threat, but objective signs\u2014such as rapid growth and bleeding\u2014are concerning regardless of her subjective report.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult, female. Chief complaint: Rapidly enlarging, bleeding nose lesion, possibly more aggressive than described. Present illness: The patient reports a skin lesion on the nose that has grown over three to four weeks, has been bleeding repeatedly, and was initially small. She states it is not very painful, though the precision of these descriptions may be biased. The lesion is reportedly enlarging quickly, but her description of size (\"small bump\") may underestimate actual dimensions; her focus on growth and bleeding suggests active surface changes. She may be experiencing more discomfort or surface ulceration than acknowledged, and the lesion's true size or surface features need further clarification. Associated symptoms: No systemic symptoms are reported, but the patient's anxiety might lead to underreporting other surface or systemic signs; further inquiry is needed regarding pain, surface ulceration, or additional symptoms like fatigue or systemic illness.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The lesion is located on the nose, has enlarged over weeks, and has bled repeatedly. The patient's report of rapid growth and bleeding is reliable. - Medium confidence: The exact size, surface characteristics, and degree of pain or ulceration are likely underestimated due to her minimization and anxiety. - Low confidence: The current severity of symptoms, surface ulceration, and pain levels, as these could be more significant than communicated. - Missing information: Precise measurements of the lesion, description of surface features, frequency and amount of bleeding, associated pain or discomfort, and any systemic symptoms or changes.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a progressively enlarging skin lesion on the nose that has developed over the past three to four weeks. The lesion has been bleeding repeatedly and appears to be growing rapidly. The patient describes the lesion as a small bump that is not very painful; however, her descriptions may underestimate the true size and severity. She reports frequent bleeding episodes but minimizes associated discomfort and surface changes. Further assessment is needed to determine the lesion's current dimensions, surface characteristics, presence of ulceration or surface disruption, and any additional symptoms such as pain or systemic signs. Given the rapid growth and bleeding, prompt further evaluation, including physical inspection, measurement, and potentially imaging or biopsy, is indicated to determine the nature of the lesion.",

Her responses are cooperative but show mild uncertainty. - Bias detected: Slight amplification of progression and bleeding, along with mild minimization of initial lesion size. These biases suggest she is emphasizing severity possibly to prompt prompt evaluation. - Confidence level: Medium; her overall report is credible but likely exaggerates aspects of progression. - Reasoning: Her use of \"pretty fast,\" \"really quickly,\" and emphasizing bleeding indicates a desire to convey urgency, but her vague timeline and descriptors point to mild memory or perception biases.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Potentially, discomfort or surface changes (ulceration, surface disruption) are more prominent than she reports. - Withheld information: She does not seem embarrassed or hiding info, but may overlook or underreport systemic symptoms or prior skin issues. - Amplified concerns: She might be overestimating the urgency, perceiving it as more threatening due to rapid change. - Temporal distortions: Actual onset might have occurred earlier or more gradually; her perception of rapid growth might be exaggerated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette suggests a lesion that likely started as a small, benign-appearing bump, with slow or unnoticed initial development. Over the past several weeks, it appears to have undergone surface changes, perhaps ulceration, with episodes of bleeding triggered by minor trauma. The perceived rapid growth and bleeding may be somewhat exaggerated; objectively, the lesion\u2019s size may be moderate, with surface features requiring examination. The lesion\u2019s behavior warrants urgent assessment, but the timeline may be more gradual than described, and surface characteristics might reveal features (ulceration, irregular borders) not fully appreciated by the patient.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the bump? Did it appear suddenly or gradually?\" and \"Have you noticed any pain, surface ulceration, or changes apart from size?\" These target understanding of onset and surface features. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental questions to normalize the normal progression of skin changes and reduce anxiety, encouraging accurate recounting. - Priority order: First, clarify the timeline and size, then surface changes and symptoms, to establish an accurate progression and physical features necessary for diagnosis.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description emphasizes rapid growth and bleeding, which may lead to overestimating the severity or speed of lesion progression. Her vague timeline and emphasis on urgency suggest some bias toward amplifying symptoms. She reports only mild surface changes and minimal discomfort, but these may be underreported. Objective examination is needed to assess actual size, surface features, and behavior of the lesion, including ulceration or irregular borders. Additional symptoms such as pain or systemic signs are not mentioned but should be specifically probed, as they could be minimized or unreported. Confidence in the current symptom report is medium; the lesion's true size and progression are likely more gradual than perceived, and surface features might be more prominent. Further detailed assessment and physical examination are required to clarify the lesion\u2019s characteristics and progression timeline.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, age unspecified. Chief complaint: Progressively enlarging skin lesion on the nose with frequent bleeding. Present illness: The patient reports noticing a small red bump approximately three to four weeks prior, which has grown larger over this period and bleeds easily upon minor trauma. She describes the lesion as having increased in size quickly, with frequent episodes of bleeding, but minimizes associated pain or surface disruptions. The timeline suggests gradual development, although her perception indicates rapid growth; surface features such as ulceration or irregular borders have not been described and require assessment. Other symptoms like pain, systemic signs, or surface changes are not reported but should be actively elicited during examination. Associated symptoms: No additional systemic symptoms or surface ulceration reported; the actual presence of such features cannot be confirmed without physical assessment. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s report of the lesion\u2019s growth over three to four weeks and bleeding episodes. - Medium confidence: The perceived rapid progression and severity of bleeding, which may be exaggerated. - Low confidence: Exact size, surface characteristics, and presence of ulceration or other surface changes, as patient\u2019s descriptions are subjective. - Missing information: Precise lesion dimensions, surface features, presence of ulceration, pain, systemic symptoms, and any prior skin issues or history.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with some uncertainty about precise timelines, emphasizes rapid recent changes, and uses hedging (\"maybe,\" \"like\") indicating mild confusion or recall difficulty. She tends to understate initial signs (\"tiny\") and emphasizes recent concerns (\"growing fast,\" \"bleeding easily\"), which may reflect anxiety. - Bias detected: Mild minimization of initial lesion size and duration, coupled with some confusion about the timeline, possibly affecting her overall report. - Confidence level: Medium; her pattern suggests her reported details are mostly accurate but likely underrepresent initial severity or duration. - Reasoning: Her repeated hedging, emphasis on recent rapid changes, and description of initial appearance as \"tiny\" support that initial presentation may have been more substantial than reported, and her recall of exact timing is uncertain.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The initial lesion may have been larger or present longer than she admits, and early signs such as slight bleeding, itchiness, or discomfort might have been ignored or unnoticed. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment about the lesion or its appearance, leading to mild underreporting of initial size or duration. - Amplified concerns: Her current focus on rapid growth and bleeding may reflect genuine worry, but could be heightened by heightened health anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The lesion could have appeared earlier or developed slowly initially, with her recall truncated or confused about the precise onset.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a lesion that may have appeared more than 3-4 weeks ago, possibly larger or more noticeable initially, with a slow initial progression that has recently accelerated. It likely has been bleeding intermittently, perhaps unnoticed or underestimated initially. Her current concern about rapid growth and bleeding aligns with a potentially concerning skin lesion requiring assessment, but her timeline recall is somewhat unreliable.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes or signs before the three or four weeks you mentioned? Did it look or feel different earlier? Have you experienced other symptoms like itchiness, pain, or changes in your skin besides what you've described?\" (To clarify early history and associated symptoms) - Approach strategy: Ask gently and nonjudgmentally, acknowledging her concern but encouraging detailed recall: \"Sometimes, we notice small changes that we forget or overlook. Can you think back to whether it was bothering you at all before you saw it grow?\" (To reduce anxiety and promote openness) - Priority order: First, clarify the onset and early characteristics, then explore associated symptoms, and finally assess her feelings about possible diagnosis or reasons for concern\u2014this will help build a clearer timeline and gather missing details.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's reports are characterized by hedging and emphasis on recent rapid changes, suggesting possible anxiety and some difficulty recalling precise timing or initial symptoms. She describes the lesion as small and recently-growing, with easy bleeding, but her tendency to minimize initial size and onset indicates the lesion may have been larger, older, or more prominent than she reports. Communication bias likely leads her to understate early symptoms, which may have included more noticeable features such as larger size, longer duration, or additional symptoms like itchiness or discomfort. Her current focus on rapid growth and bleeding indicates concern, but the true severity or duration of the lesion might be underestimated. Objective assessment would need to verify lesion size, appearance, duration, and associated features, acknowledging potential underreporting of earlier signs.\nANSWER: Patient is a likely adult presenting with a skin lesion on the nose that has reportedly appeared approximately three to four weeks ago. The lesion is described as a red bump that has increased in size and is prone to bleeding with minor trauma. The patient perceives rapid growth and bleeding as recent developments; however, communication patterns suggest the lesion may have been larger or more noticeable earlier, with initial size and duration possibly understated. The lesion's tendency to bleed easily and its recent apparent acceleration warrants clinical evaluation to exclude concerning diagnoses such as vascular or malignant lesions. Additional history about early appearance, associated changes such as itchiness or discomfort, and physical examination are necessary to establish precise characteristics and guide management.",

The lesion is described as a red bump that has increased in size and is prone to bleeding with minor trauma. The patient perceives rapid growth and bleeding as recent developments; however, communication patterns suggest the lesion may have been larger or more noticeable earlier, with initial size and duration possibly understated. The lesion's tendency to bleed easily and its recent apparent acceleration warrants clinical evaluation to exclude concerning diagnoses such as vascular or malignant lesions. Additional history about early appearance, associated changes such as itchiness or discomfort, and physical examination are necessary to establish precise characteristics and guide management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes a lesion that appeared three to four weeks ago as a tiny bump that has lately grown quickly and bleeds easily. She emphasizes recent changes, uses emotional language (\"worried,\" \"mostly worried\"), and occasionally hedges her statements, indicating uncertainty and anxiety. Her detailed descriptions suggest openness but also some inconsistency and potential overstatement of recent symptoms. - Bias detected: Anxiety-driven amplification, leading to overestimating how fast the lesion has grown and how easily it bleeds, which may distort the clinical picture. Mild minimization of early symptoms is also present, possibly underreporting the initial lesion characteristics. - Confidence level: Medium. Her responses are informative but influenced by emotional factors, so some details may be exaggerated or incompletely recalled. - Reasoning: The pattern of repeated, emotional reporting coupled with hesitations indicates anxiety influencing her perception, especially regarding severity and timeline.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The initial lesion was likely smaller, with minimal or no discomfort, and may have been less noticeable early on. She seems to understate initial size and severity. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to disclose earlier asymptomatic periods or less dramatic early features, possibly due to embarrassment or fear of minimizing the concern. She may also avoid mentioning mild or transient symptoms. - Amplified concerns: Her focus on rapid recent growth and easy bleeding suggests her perceived severity is exaggerated by anxiety; the true progression may have been slower. - Temporal distortions: The actual onset and growth rate may have been more gradual, with her perception intensified by anxiety, leading to overestimation of speed and severity of change.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the Chain of Thought, the lesion probably started as a small, asymptomatic or mildly noticeable bump around three to four weeks ago, with slow initial growth. The recent acceleration in size and bleeding appears real but likely somewhat exaggerated by her anxiety. Her overall concern may be higher than warranted by the objective features, and her recall of early history is incomplete or biased. The lesion might be a benign vascular or inflammatory process, but the presentation warrants careful evaluation to exclude malignancy.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if the bump was always small and painless, or did you notice any change before three weeks ago?\" (to clarify early history); \"Have you noticed any other symptoms like itching, pain, or other skin changes?\" (to assess associated features); \"Did the bump ever cause discomfort or bleed before now?\" (to gauge baseline severity); \"Have you observed any other similar bumps or changes elsewhere?\" (to evaluate systemic or skin-related patterns). - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic language to validate her worries while encouraging detailed recollections. Frame questions to reduce anxiety about judgment, emphasizing curiosity over concern. - Priority order: Start with clarifying early history of the lesion, then inquire about associated symptoms and any prior bleeding or changes, to establish a more accurate timeline and symptom profile. This approach helps connect her perception with objective facts and reduces emotional bias influence.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports a skin lesion on the nose that appeared approximately three to four weeks ago, describing it as a small red bump that has recently grown rapidly and started bleeding easily. Her communication reveals emotional concern and potential distortion of timeline and severity, possibly exaggerating recent changes due to anxiety. She minimizes initial symptoms, suggesting the lesion may have been asymptomatic or less noticeable early on, and may have overemphasized recent growth and bleeding. There is a likelihood that the visible lesion has been present for several weeks with slow initial growth, and that her perception of rapid recent change and bleeding is amplified by anxiety. Additional symptoms such as discomfort, pain, or other skin changes are not clearly detailed, and she might withhold mild or early symptoms to avoid worry. Objective clinical assessment requires examination for characteristics such as size, color, bleeding tendency, and other features, but communication bias suggests her concern may be higher than the lesion\u2019s actual severity warrants at this stage. Further history about early lesion features, prior bleeding, and associated symptoms is needed for complete assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult (exact age and gender not specified).  Chief complaint: Concern about a rapidly enlarging, bleeding skin lesion on the nose.  Present illness: The lesion is described as a red bump that appeared roughly three to four weeks ago. It has increased in size over that period, with recent acceleration in growth and bleeding with minor trauma. Objective evaluation is necessary to determine the lesion\u2019s characteristics. The early phase of the lesion was likely asymptomatic or minimally noticeable, with slow initial growth. Current symptoms of quick growth and bleeding might be exaggerated by patient\u2019s anxiety. The patient may have experienced minor earlier symptoms not recalled or reported.  Associated symptoms: No specific mention of itchiness, pain, or other dermatologic changes; presence and significance of these are uncertain and require further inquiry.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The lesion is present and has increased in size over three to four weeks, and it has bled with minor trauma. - Medium confidence: The perceived rapid growth and bleeding may be slightly overstated due to anxiety, but are supported by the patient\u2019s report. - Low confidence: Exact early lesion characteristics, precise timeline, and current lesion details depend on physical examination. - Missing information: Objective lesion description (size, morphology, border, color, bleeding pattern), early symptom history, any associated pain or other skin changes, prior similar lesions or systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with a skin lesion on the nose identified as a red bump that initially appeared approximately three to four weeks ago. The lesion has shown notable enlargement over this period, with recent reports of easier bleeding following minor trauma. While the patient perceives rapid growth and bleeding as recent developments, communication analysis suggests the lesion may have been stable or slow-growing initially, with the recent acceleration possibly exaggerated by anxiety. No current symptoms of itching or pain are reported, but there may be underreporting of mild or early symptoms. Clinical evaluation is necessary to characterize the lesion, including assessment for features consistent with benign or malignant processes, before definitive diagnosis.",

The lesion has shown notable enlargement over this period, with recent reports of easier bleeding following minor trauma. While the patient perceives rapid growth and bleeding as recent developments, communication analysis suggests the lesion may have been stable or slow-growing initially, with the recent acceleration possibly exaggerated by anxiety. No current symptoms of itching or pain are reported, but there may be underreporting of mild or early symptoms. Clinical evaluation is necessary to characterize the lesion, including assessment for features consistent with benign or malignant processes, before definitive diagnosis.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, tentative language and tends to emphasize recent rapid growth and bleeding, while downplaying or avoiding specific details about lesion borders, ulceration, or other findings. Responses are hesitant, indicating uncertainty and possible discomfort. - Bias detected: Both minimization and confusion biases are present. She appears to underreport subtle or concerning features while overemphasizing recent changes, likely driven by anxiety. - Confidence level: Medium, as the communication provides some useful information but likely omits or underrepresents critical lesion features. - Reasoning: Her language suggests she is unsure about lesion specifics, possibly hiding or glossing over details she perceives as alarming while focusing on her fears about growth and bleeding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible subtle ulceration or border irregularity that she perceives as less serious or is uncomfortable discussing. - Withheld information: Details about lesion surface irregularities, tenderness, or associated symptoms (itching, numbness) she might find embarrassing or confusing. - Amplified concerns: Her focus on rapid growth and bleeding may be exaggerated, driven by anxiety, making her overstate severity. - Temporal distortions: She may have overemphasized recent rapid changes, while neglecting the initial stability period; some details about lesion progression remain vague or inconsistent.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Given these biases, the lesion could be a benign process such as a vascular or keratinized lesion that has been slowly present but now appears more aggressive due to patient anxiety or minor trauma. The actual growth may be less rapid, and ulceration or border irregularity may be minimal or absent. Bleeding might be mild or moderate and more related to superficial trauma than an inherent malignancy. The lesion's surface might be more irregular than she admits, and associated symptoms like pain or ulceration might be understated or unrecognized. Her emotional distress might be influencing her perception of severity, so a careful physical exam with reassurance is necessary.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you describe exactly how the edges of the bump look? Are they smooth, raised, or uneven?\" (to clarify border features) - \"Have you noticed any open sore, scabbing, or ulceration on the bump?\" (to detect subtle ulceration) - \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like numbness, itching, or more pain?\" (to explore associated symptoms) - \"Has the lesion changed in appearance or symptoms since it first appeared, and how?\" (to better understand progression) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language to normalize concerns, encouraging the patient to share details freely. - Reassure her that detailed examination can help find the best approach and alleviate fears. - Focus on calming anxiety to facilitate open, honest dialogue. - Priority order: - First, clarify physical characteristics (border, ulceration) to obtain vital diagnostic clues. - Next, explore associated symptoms and timeline to understand progression. - Lastly, address emotional concerns, providing reassurance and guidance.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description suggests a red, possibly raised lesion on the nose that has been changing over approximately three to four weeks. While she reports rapid growth and bleeding, her hesitant and tentative language indicates potential overemphasis on recent changes and underreporting of subtle features like border irregularity, ulceration, or associated symptoms such as discomfort. She may be minimizing or unaware of mild ulceration or surface irregularities, and her focus on bleeding and size may be driven by anxiety rather than actual severity. There is a possibility that the lesion has been more stable initially, with her perception of rapid progression magnified by emotional distress. Objective findings will need careful physical examination to clarify border definition, ulceration, and other features, as her communication suggests potential underreporting of concerning signs. A thorough assessment is necessary to differentiate benign from malignant possibilities, accounting for her psychological factors that may influence symptom reporting.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified, approximate age not provided.  Chief complaint: Presence of a red bump on the nose that has reportedly increased in size over three to four weeks, with recent easy bleeding.  Present illness: A red, raised lesion on the nose, initially smaller than its current size, appearing around three to four weeks ago. The lesion has enlarged over this period, and recent bleeding has been triggered by minor trauma or contact. The patient reports the lesion is tender when pressed but denies significant pain, ulceration, or surface irregularity. She notes the lesion has grown faster lately and has become more tender, particularly when pressed or bumped.  Associated symptoms: Mild tenderness upon pressure; no reported itching, numbness, or other sensory changes. The patient does not report ulceration or open sores, but her hesitant communication suggests these may be understated if present. Other symptoms such as pain or ulceration might be more subtle or initially unrecognized, and the patient may be experiencing additional concern or anxiety about growth and bleeding.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The lesion is a red, raised bump on the nose that appeared roughly three to four weeks ago and has enlarged. - Medium confidence: The lesion's borders are smooth and slightly raised, with no current evident ulceration or open sore. - Low confidence: Exact extent of ulceration, border irregularity, or surface surface features, due to possible underreporting. - Missing information: Precise characteristics of border definition, presence of ulceration or scabbing, and granular surface details; associated symptoms like numbness or itching; detailed timeline of progression and stability of the lesion.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with a red, raised lesion on the nose that originated approximately three to four weeks ago. The lesion has visibly enlarged over this period, with recent episodes of bleeding following minor trauma or contact. The patient reports the lesion is tender when pressed but denies significant pain, ulceration, or surface irregularities, although her communication suggests some features\u2014such as border irregularity or ulceration\u2014may be underreported. The lesion's borders are described as somewhat smooth and raised, and there is no current evidence of ulceration or open sore. She indicates increased tenderness and growth in the recent week, but her hesitation and emphasis on bleeding and size may reflect heightened anxiety. Further physical examination is required to assess border characteristics, possible ulceration, and surface irregularities to determine the lesion's nature accurately. Additional inquiry into other symptoms such as itching, numbness, or more subtle signs of malignancy is necessary, as her subjective report may underrepresent the true extent of lesion features.",
