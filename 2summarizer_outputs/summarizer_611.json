I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but it\\u2019s pretty scary.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with high emotional charge, focusing on fear and hallucinations, with scattered responses and a tendency to emphasize distress, likely due to amplification bias. - Bias detected: Amplification bias, as their fear and paranoia are likely exaggerated by their emotional state. - Confidence level: Medium to high\u2014based on the consistent focus on fear and emotional distress, typical of amplification effects. - Reasoning: Their language choices and reactive responses suggest emotional amplification, which inflates perceived severity beyond clinical measures, though they are sincere in their distress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible depression, cognitive issues, or physical health symptoms may be downplayed due to emotional focus on hallucinations. - Withheld information: Past psychiatric treatments, history of previous episodes, family psychiatric history, or other mental health issues may be avoided out of shame or fear. - Amplified concerns: Their fears of \u201cgoing crazy\u201d and paranoia are probably amplified, rooted in distress but possibly not as severe objectively. - Temporal distortions: The vague timeline might mask ongoing or earlier symptoms, or earlier episodes, which are not remembered clearly due to distress or cognitive overload.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would likely be: - The patient experienced initial hallucinations and paranoid thoughts beginning shortly after using synthetic weed, with symptoms peaking approximately within a few days. These hallucinations are visual and auditory, involving fear and paranoia. The emotional response is intense, with high distress levels that could magnify perceived severity. They may have underlying mood or psychiatric issues not yet disclosed. The current state involves significant anxiety, fear, and paranoia, possibly fluctuating, with some cognitive or mood symptoms potentially unreported. Their social isolation and estrangement from family may contribute to their distress and perceived severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced any low mood, sadness, or loss of interest?\" (to assess depression); \"Do you have a history of mental health issues or previous episodes?\" (to understand past, implicit history); \"Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, memory, or physical health?\" (to probe for additional symptoms); \"Can you tell me more about your support system or relationships?\" (to assess social context). - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language; validate their distress without reinforcing exaggerated fears; frame questions around ongoing feelings and experiences to reduce defensiveness. - Priority order: First, explore mood and history to contextualize hallucinations, then inquire about detailed substance use and previous mental health, and finally assess social support, ensuring a comprehensive understanding while reducing emotional overwhelm.  **Note:** This systematic analysis aims to parse out bias effects and reconstruct a more balanced clinical picture, guiding tailored intervention strategies.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's verbal report emphasizes visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and fear following synthetic cannabis use. Their high emotional charge and focus on distress suggest possible amplification bias, meaning the severity of symptoms may be overstated. Conversely, details such as mood, past psychiatric history, or additional symptoms might be minimized or withheld due to emotional distress or stigma. The patient may also be experiencing underlying or past mental health issues not disclosed. The timeline of symptom onset seems to correlate closely with recent substance use, but a comprehensive history is needed to confirm previous episodes or other mental health concerns. Communication patterns indicate a need for probing questions about mood, prior psychiatric history, and social factors to obtain a more accurate clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender not specified.  Chief complaint: Recent onset of hallucinations and paranoia, presumably initiated shortly after synthetic cannabis use.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations along with paranoid thoughts beginning within days after using synthetic cannabis obtained from a friend. They describe the hallucinations as distressing, involving fear and perceptions that are not based in reality. The emotional response is intense and may be amplifying perceived symptom severity. The patient reports significant fear and distress but may not fully disclose or recognize the extent of mood symptoms or other psychiatric issues. The timeline suggests symptom onset shortly after substance use, with ongoing distress; specific duration and course are unclear. Additional symptoms such as depressive mood, cognitive difficulties, or physical health changes have not been explicitly reported but may be present and underrecognized.  Associated symptoms: Anxiety, fear, paranoia\u2014confidence in these reports is moderate, but underlying mood symptoms or other psychiatric manifestations are not confirmed due to limited history.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The association of hallucinations and paranoia with recent synthetic cannabis use. - Medium confidence: Emotional distress and symptom severity, which may be exaggerated. - Low confidence: Presence of other mood or psychiatric symptoms, history of mental health issues, and overall symptom severity due to communication biases. - Missing information: Past psychiatric history, prior episodes, mood symptoms, physical health status, social support, and detailed substance use history.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with recent onset of visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts occurring within days after using synthetic cannabis obtained from a friend. The patient reports high emotional distress related to these symptoms, including fear and paranoia. While these hallucinations and paranoid thoughts are actively experienced, their reported severity may be exaggerated due to amplification bias. The timeline suggests the symptoms are closely linked to recent substance use; however, additional information regarding prior mental health history, mood symptoms, and physical health status is needed to fully contextualize the presentation. The patient\u2019s communication indicates significant distress but may withhold or minimize certain symptoms, requiring further investigation into mood, prior psychiatric episodes, and social factors to establish an accurate clinical picture.",

The patient reports high emotional distress related to these symptoms, including fear and paranoia. While these hallucinations and paranoid thoughts are actively experienced, their reported severity may be exaggerated due to amplification bias. The timeline suggests the symptoms are closely linked to recent substance use; however, additional information regarding prior mental health history, mood symptoms, and physical health status is needed to fully contextualize the presentation. The patient\u2019s communication indicates significant distress but may withhold or minimize certain symptoms, requiring further investigation into mood, prior psychiatric episodes, and social factors to establish an accurate clinical picture.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotionally charged and vague language, emphasizing distress while hesitating on specifics. They tend to hedge with qualifiers and show signs of emotional amplification and potential minimization. - Bias detected: Amplification bias dominates, inflating perceived severity and worry; some minimization occurs around the onset and specifics; possible withholding exists regarding detailed history or context. - Confidence level: Medium \u2014 emotional distress influences their narratives, and some details are uncertain or unconfirmed. - Reasoning: Clear indicators include exaggerated language about worsening symptoms, hedging that suggests discomfort or shame, and vague timeline responses. These patterns point to biases that distort objective understanding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may be downplaying the full severity or persistence of hallucinations and paranoia, perhaps due to shame about drug use or fear of judgment. - Withheld information: They might be reluctant to disclose prior psychiatric history, past substance use, or previous mental health episodes, especially if stigmatized. - Amplified concerns: Their current fears of going crazy or losing control are probably exaggerated but genuinely distressing to them, potentially inflating perceived danger. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of symptom onset and progression is likely skewed; symptoms may have appeared more suddenly or persisted longer than described, but recall is muddled by emotional and cognitive factors.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased picture likely involves an acute onset of hallucinations (visual and auditory) and paranoid thoughts, closely following recent synthetic cannabis use. Symptoms are probably more persistent and severe than described, with a possible underlying vulnerability to substance-induced psychosis or undiagnosed psychiatric disorder. The initial symptoms might have appeared within hours post-ingestion, rapidly intensifying over a few days, with associated emotional distress, anxiety, and confusion. Some prior psychiatric or mood symptoms may exist but are unreported, and the impact on functioning could be significant. The fear of losing control is real but possibly exaggerated by anxiety.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly when these hallucinations and paranoia started? Were there any changes in your mood or physical health around that time?\" to clarify timeline; \"Have you experienced similar symptoms before, even briefly?\" to assess past episodes; \"Are you experiencing mood swings, sleep problems, or physical symptoms like headaches or fatigue?\" to explore comorbidities; \"Are you still using any substances regularly?\" to evaluate ongoing risk. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language, emphasizing confidentiality and support, to reduce shame or defensiveness. Validate their distress while guiding them toward more precise descriptions. - Priority order: First establish the exact timeline and current symptom severity to understand acuity. Next, explore past psychiatric history and substance use to assess risk factors. Lastly, pinpoint associated symptoms like mood, sleep, or physical health to guide comprehensive care.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional distress, exaggeration of symptom severity, and hedging, indicating potential amplification bias and possible underreporting of certain symptoms or past history. While they report hallucinations and paranoia beginning shortly after synthetic cannabis use, their description likely overemphasizes current distress and symptom impact. They may be minimizimg previous psychiatric issues or ongoing substance use, and their recall of onset is uncertain. Objective clinical facts include recent onset of visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in close temporal relation to synthetic cannabis ingestion, with associated emotional distress. However, the true severity, duration, and possible persistence of symptoms are likely greater than described. Symptoms may have begun within hours of ingestion and potentially persisted or worsened over days. Additional symptoms such as mood disturbances, sleep impairment, or physical signs are unreported but should be inquired about, as they could inform diagnosis. Communication biases suggest the need for careful probing of past psychiatric history, substance use, and detailed symptom timeline. More objective information is necessary to distinguish substance-induced psychosis from underlying psychiatric pathology.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient (age and gender unspecified).  Chief complaint: Recent onset of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts, likely linked to recent synthetic cannabis use, with reported significant emotional distress.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts starting within days after using synthetic cannabis obtained from a friend. They describe the onset as sudden and severe, with rapidly worsening symptoms over a few days. The patient indicates high emotional distress, including fear and paranoia; however, their descriptions may be exaggerated due to amplification bias. They may be underreporting past psychiatric history, previous episodes, or ongoing substance use, which could influence symptom severity and etiology. Timing suggests the symptoms began shortly after drug use and persisted at least through the time of evaluation, although exact duration and severity could be greater than expressed.  Associated symptoms: Emotional distress, anxiety, confusion; no details provided about sleep, mood, or physical health, which warrant further exploration (medium confidence).  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Recent onset of hallucinations and paranoia in close temporal relation to synthetic cannabis ingestion. - Medium confidence: That the distress level may be amplified and symptoms are more severe than described. - Low confidence: Exact timeline, prior psychiatric history, ongoing substance use, and full symptom severity, due to communication biases and incomplete reporting. - Missing information: Detailed psychiatric history, prior episodes of similar symptoms, current substance use status, sleep pattern, mood symptoms, and physical health indicators.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with recent onset of visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts occurring within days after using synthetic cannabis obtained from a friend. The patient reports that the symptoms began suddenly and have worsened over a few days, accompanied by significant emotional distress including fear and paranoia. Communication patterns suggest potential amplification of symptom severity and emotional distress, with possible underreporting of prior psychiatric history, past episodes, and ongoing substance use. The current assessment indicates the presence of hallucinations and paranoia closely linked to recent substance use, likely representing a substance-induced psychotic episode, though underlying vulnerabilities cannot be excluded. Further inquiry is needed to clarify the precise timeline, review past psychiatric history, and assess for additional symptoms such as mood disturbances, sleep issues, or physical complaints to guide diagnosis and management.",

Further inquiry is needed to clarify the precise timeline, review past psychiatric history, and assess for additional symptoms such as mood disturbances, sleep issues, or physical complaints to guide diagnosis and management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotionally charged language, brief responses, and vague timelines. They show signs of distress and guardedness, with tendencies to amplify fears but minimize background details. Responses suggest emotional arousal affecting clarity and detail. - Bias detected: The dominant bias is emotional amplification coupled with minimization. The patient\u2019s fear and distress inflate perceived severity, while prior mental health issues are underreported, possibly to avoid stigma or due to memory issues. - Confidence level: Medium. Evidence from the conversation supports amplification but also indicates possible withholding of past history. The vagueness in timelines and reluctance to elaborate suggest cognitive or emotional distortions. - Reasoning: The emotionally charged language and rapid symptom progression post-substance use indicate amplification bias. Minimal detail on prior history and vague timelines point to minimization and confusion.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may be downplaying the severity or frequency of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts prior to this episode, possibly not recognizing past vulnerabilities or dismissing them as insignificant. - Withheld information: They might be embarrassed about prior mental health issues or substance misuse, leading to underreporting of past episodes, psychiatric diagnoses, or ongoing difficulties. - Amplified concerns: Current fears of losing control and the danger they perceive may be exaggerated due to their emotional distress and effects of intoxication, possibly overemphasizing the risk. - Temporal distortions: The vague, inconsistent timelines suggest the actual onset and progression might have been more abrupt or prolonged than perceived, complicated by memory impairment caused by substances or emotional arousal.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering the biases, the true clinical picture likely involves a severe psychotic episode induced by synthetic cannabis, with hallucinations and paranoia that are more persistent and intense than the patient reports. There may be underlying predispositions or prior episodes of mental health issues that are unacknowledged or unrecognized. The onset was rapid, correlating closely with substance ingestion, with symptoms potentially lasting longer or being more complex. Additional symptoms such as sleep disturbance, emotional dysregulation, or mood issues may be present but underreported due to shame or lack of insight. The patient\u2019s current distress is magnified, and their memory and reporting are affected by emotional state and substance effects.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me if you've experienced similar feelings or hallucinations before, even if they were less intense?\" (to assess past episodes) - \"Are there times when your symptoms have lasted longer or felt different from what you described?\" (to clarify duration) - \"Have you noticed any other changes, like sleep problems, mood swings, or physical sensations?\" (to uncover additional symptoms) - \"Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for mental health issues before?\" (to identify underlying vulnerabilities) - \"Can you talk more about how you felt before you took the synthetic weed, and how that might have affected your experience?\" (to understand baseline state) - Approach strategy: Ask gently and with validation, emphasizing that many people have complex experiences and it's okay to share difficult or embarrassing details, reducing shame and encouraging openness. Use open-ended questions first, then specific ones. - Priority order: First, explore past mental health and prior episodes to determine baseline; then clarify timeline and symptom duration; lastly, probe for other symptoms and contextual factors influencing their experience.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication suggests emotional arousal and possible distortion of memory or perception, which may lead to exaggeration of current symptoms and underreporting of past mental health issues or substance use history. The rapid onset of hallucinations and paranoia following synthetic cannabis use appears objective, but the severity and duration may be underestimated due to emotional distress or shame. There is an inclination to minimize prior episodes or diagnoses, leading to potential underappreciation of underlying vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the core features\u2014auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid thoughts\u2014are objectively present and likely exacerbated by recent substance use. The patient's reporting indicates severe psychotic symptoms that are likely more persistent or intense than described, with possible additional symptoms such as mood or sleep disturbances that remain unreported. More detailed probing into past psychiatric history, previous similar episodes, and other associated symptoms is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management planning.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified.  Chief complaint: Recent onset of visual and auditory hallucinations with paranoia following synthetic cannabis use.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing hallucinations (visual shadows, hearing voices) and paranoid thoughts that began shortly after using synthetic weed obtained from a friend. Symptoms reportedly increased in severity over several days. The patient describes feeling as if losing control, with heightened fear, though their account may be emotionally amplified and lacking specific timelines.

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides vague, emotionally charged responses, minimizes or forgets details about onset, and emphasizes worsening, indicating emotional distress and possible discomfort or confusion in sharing specifics. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification and minimization bias, which inflate distress but obscure the true severity and timeline. - Confidence level: Medium. While distress is genuine, the extent and details of hallucinations, their timing, and related symptoms are likely underreported or distorted. - Reasoning: These conclusions stem from the patient\u2019s hesitations, vague timelines, and emotional language, which collectively suggest distortion influenced by confusion, shame, or anxiety.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The hallucinations and paranoia may be more persistent or intense, but the patient downplays their severity, possibly due to fear of judgment or shame related to substance use. - Withheld information: Additional symptoms such as sleep disruption, cognitive disorientation, or mood symptoms might be unreported, and the true onset is probably more sudden and severe than described. - Amplified concerns: The fears of losing control or permanent psychosis are likely exaggerated by anxiety; the actual risk may be moderate but feels catastrophic to the patient. - Temporal distortions: The memory gaps suggest an earlier or more abrupt onset, especially around substance use or intoxication, which the patient cannot accurately recall.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the patient's symptoms likely involve acute psychotic features\u2014vivid hallucinations (visual and auditory), paranoid delusions, and emotional distress\u2014that may have been triggered or worsened by synthetic cannabinoid use. The onset was probably abrupt, occurring near the time of substance ingestion, with symptoms escalating rapidly. The patient\u2019s cognitive and emotional confusion may be obscuring the severity and clarity of their symptoms. Their distress is real but amplified, and they may be underreporting certain features due to shame or disorientation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Ask specifically about: \"Can you tell me if you\u2019ve seen or heard things that others don\u2019t see or hear, and how often that happens?\" (targets hallucinations) \"Have you experienced these symptoms before, or is this the first time?\" (clarifies past history) \"Did the symptoms start soon after using the synthetic weed, and have they changed in intensity?\" (connects substance use to onset) \"Are there any other symptoms like trouble sleeping, feeling numb, or difficulty concentrating?\" (uncovers additional features) - Approach strategy: Use a gentle, non-judgmental tone, emphasizing understanding and safety. Ask open-ended questions, validating their feelings, to reduce shame and encourage disclosure. Focus on factual descriptions rather than interpretations to avoid paranoia or defensiveness. - Priority order: Start with enabling questions about sensory experiences to establish symptom presence, then inquire about substance use and timing, followed by questions about emotional and functional impact. This sequence builds trust and gathers critical details effectively.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s responses exhibit emotional distress, potential confusion, and hesitation, indicating that subjective reports of hallucinations and paranoia may be exaggerated or underreported. Communication patterns suggest possible minimization of severity and delayed recall of symptom onset. Although the patient reports visual and auditory hallucinations (shadows, voices) and paranoid thoughts about being watched and harmed, these symptoms may be more persistent or intense than described. The symptoms are linked temporally to synthetic cannabis use, with an apparent escalation over a few days. There may be additional unreported features such as sleep disturbance, cognitive disorientation, or mood symptoms. Due to the emotional and psychological presentation, there is a likelihood of underlying transient psychosis, substance-induced, but the true severity and full scope of symptoms remain uncertain, compounded by possible shame or fear influencing disclosures.

The patient reports feelings of losing control and fear but may be minimizing the severity and extent of symptoms; additional unreported features such as sleep disruption, disorientation, or mood changes are possible. Further assessment is needed to determine the full scope, past psychiatric history, and risk factors.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional intensity, emphasizing distress while providing vague and minimally detailed descriptions of hallucinations and paranoia. They respond openly but with hesitations and vague timelines, suggestive of discomfort in sharing fully. - Bias detected: Moderate emotional amplification, perhaps combined with mild minimization of episodic severity and some withholding of detailed symptom information. - Confidence level: Medium-high. Responses are consistent but biased by emotional distress, which may overstate perceived threat and underestimate episodic details. - Reasoning: The patient's strong emotional language and vague timeline responses suggest distress-driven exaggeration and some avoidance of full disclosure; thus, the clinical picture might be more severe and persistent than reported.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Duration, frequency, or severity of hallucinations and paranoia, as they may feel shame or fear judgment. - Withheld information: Past psychiatric history, previous episodes, or longstanding issues with mental health or substance use, not openly discussed but relevant. - Amplified concerns: The level of threat or danger posed by hallucinations or paranoia may be exaggerated emotionally; they feel overwhelmed and afraid, which might inflate perceived danger. - Temporal distortions: Onset appears associated with recent drug use, but the actual timeline could be more complex; symptoms might have been developing unnoticed prior to recent use. They may also overestimate the rapid worsening due to distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would depict a patient experiencing acute, substance-related psychosis characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations plus paranoid delusions, with symptom severity likely exceeding their current report. Symptoms may include persistent hallucinations, paranoid ideation, sleep disruption, and possible disorientation, with onset closely linked to recent synthetic cannabis use. The patient's distress is real but likely magnifies perceived threat, while their description underrepresents episodic or chronic aspects.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how often you see shadows or hear voices each day?\" \"Have you experienced these kinds of hallucinations or paranoid thoughts before?\" \"How have your sleep and mood been overall?\" \"Do you have any previous mental health diagnoses or substance history?\" \"Are these symptoms constant or come and go?\" Rationale: To obtain concrete, quantifiable data and clarify past history. - Approach strategy: Use a calm, empathetic tone to gently explore specifics, assuring the patient that honesty helps get the best support. Normalize substance-related experiences to reduce shame. - Priority order: Start with clarifying current symptom frequency and severity, then explore past psychiatric history, followed by the impact on daily functioning. This sequence gaining baseline clarity before delving into elaborations will optimize understanding and rapport.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional distress and vague reporting, suggesting they may be overestimating the severity of their hallucinations and paranoia or withholding details about their overall mental status. The descriptions of visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid thoughts are consistent but likely exaggerated due to distress. Their responses imply that symptoms may be more persistent or severe than acknowledged, and other features such as sleep disturbance, disorientation, or mood changes may be present but unreported. The temporal association with recent synthetic cannabis use is clear, indicating a likely substance-induced psychotic episode. However, the patient's guarded communication style warrants cautious interpretation of symptom severity and history.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown age and gender.  Chief complaint: Experiencing hallucinations and paranoid thoughts, with recent worsening of symptoms post synthetic cannabis use.  Present illness: The patient reports visual hallucinations characterized by shadows moving out of the corner of the eye and auditory hallucinations involving voices that are perceived as internal or in the head. Paranoid beliefs include feeling watched and threatened. The onset appears to be recent, closely following synthetic cannabis ingestion, with symptoms reportedly worsening over the past few days. It is probable that actual symptom severity exceeds current self-report due to emotional distress and potential minimization.  Associated symptoms: Possible sleep disruption, feelings of losing control, and heightened fear. Other symptoms such as disorientation or mood changes are not explicitly reported but may be present.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The temporal relationship between substance use and onset of hallucinations and paranoia. - Medium confidence: The current severity and persistence of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts, which may be exaggerated. - Low confidence: Detailed past psychiatric history, prior episodes, and full extent of associated symptoms such as sleep or mood disturbances. - Missing information: Frequency and duration of hallucinations and paranoia, prior mental health history, presence of other psychiatric or physiological symptoms, and impact on functioning.\nANSWER: The patient is experiencing acute psychotic symptoms characterized by persistent visual hallucinations, specifically shadows moving out of the visual periphery, and auditory hallucinations involving voices perceived internally. Paranoid delusions include feeling watched and threatened. These symptoms emerged following recent synthetic cannabis use and have intensified over days, suggesting a substance-induced psychotic episode. While the patient reports significant distress and fear, communication biases imply that symptom severity and persistence may be underrecognized, and additional issues such as sleep disturbance, disorientation, or mood changes are possibly present. Further assessment is necessary to determine the full extent, underlying mental health history, and risk factors.",
