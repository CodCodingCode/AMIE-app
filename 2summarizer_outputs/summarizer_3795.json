Additionally, the patient reports numbness and tingling in the buttocks and thighs, as well as bowel issues including trouble initiating bowel movements and episodes of incontinence. These symptoms are new confirmed clinical details that suggest possible neurological or spinal cord involvement. No new details from previous interactions are provided, so I will append these facts to the existing vignette.\n\nANSWER: The patient has had lower back pain for a few months that has been worsening.
