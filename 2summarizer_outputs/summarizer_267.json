There is limited elaboration on functional or emotional effects, and responses suggest discomfort with vulnerability.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is prominent, leading to potentially underestimating the true extent of symptoms and their impact on daily life.\n- Confidence level: Medium. The language strongly suggests minimization, but some details like vomiting and breathlessness imply genuine symptoms. Additional probing is needed to fully assess severity.\n- Reasoning: The concise and cautious responses, along with dismissive language, support the conclusion that the patient is underreporting, either due to stoicism, discomfort, or lack of insight.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me more about how fatigue affects your daily activities\u2014do you find it hard to do things you used to enjoy or need assistance with anything?\" (To uncover functional limitations)\n- \"How often do you experience shortness of breath, and does it happen even when resting or only during activity?\" (To assess severity more objectively)\n- \"Are you experiencing any dizziness, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort?\" (To rule out other serious signs)\n- \"Have you noticed any weight changes, night sweats, or fevers?\" (To identify systemic symptoms)\n- Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental questioning, emphasizing curiosity rather than suspicion. Normalize the difficulty in describing symptoms to reduce defensiveness.\n- Priority order: First, explore functional impact and daily life (to gauge real limitations), then delve into symptom severity and systemic signs.

However, the true severity and episodic nature remain uncertain.\n- Reasoning: The pattern of vague, guarded responses, the frequent downplaying of symptoms, and the absence of detailed or emotionally loaded descriptions support the conclusion of deliberate minimization bias affecting reporting accuracy.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n-- \"Can you tell me more about what you experience during these 'bad' times\u2014what symptoms bother you most, and how they affect your daily routine?\" (rationale: encourages detailed description and may reveal hidden severity)\n-- \"Are there days when your symptoms feel worse than usual? If so, what do you notice during those days?\" (rationale: explores episodic worsening that might be underreported)\n-- \"Have you noticed any other changes, like weight loss, night sweats, or feelings of dizziness?\" (rationale: checks for systemic or more serious signs)\n-- \"How long do these episodes typically last? Are they getting more frequent or intense?\" (rationale: assesses progression and possible escalation)\n-- \"Do you ever feel anxious or worried about your health that you haven't mentioned?\" (rationale: uncovers emotional concerns hidden behind stoicism)\n- Approach strategy:\nUse a sensitive, nonjudgmental tone to build trust, emphasizing that all symptoms are important and that sharing openly helps in providing the best care. Normalize the patient's tendency to minimize and express understanding, reinforcing that their feelings and experiences are valid.\n- Priority order:\nStart with open-ended questions about daily experiences during episodes to gather detailed qualitative data, then narrow down to systemic symptoms and emotional concerns.

Present illness: The patient reports experiencing fatigue, intermittent dull abdominal pain, increased bowel movements, and occasional vomiting, which he perceives as mild and tolerable. He states that symptoms have been present for about a month, with no significant episodes of worsening or severe distress reported. He describes feeling more tired and out of breath with exertion but does not feel these symptoms severely impact his daily functioning. He reports that symptoms are relatively constant but downplays their impact, suggesting the possibility of greater underlying severity. No systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fevers, or night sweats have been reported or noticed, though these require further investigation. He does not report worse symptoms specifically at night or during sleep, but given his guarded communication, these areas need explicit probing to determine true symptom burden and functional impact.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, brief, and guarded terms, consistently downplaying the presence and impact of symptoms, with minimal emotional or detailed elaboration.\n- Bias detected: A **stoic minimizer bias**, leading to deliberate or subconscious downplaying of symptom severity and variability.\n- Confidence level: **Medium**; evidence strongly suggests minimization, but some degree of underreporting may be influenced by emotional restraint or cultural factors.\n- Reasoning: The persistent vagueness, reluctance to specify symptom fluctuations, and use of dismissive language support the conclusion of minimization bias, which could lead to underestimation of true clinical severity.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you noticed if your shortness of breath or abdominal pain gets worse when you lie down at night or during sleep?\" (to clarify nocturnal symptoms)\n- \"Can you tell me if your symptoms sometimes feel different on some days compared to others?\" (to assess variability)\n- \"Have you experienced any weight loss, fainting, or dizziness that you haven't mentioned?\" (possible omitted systemic symptoms)\n- \"How do these symptoms affect your daily activities or work \u2014 do they sometimes interfere without you realizing?\" (to uncover functional impact not openly acknowledged)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use gentle, non-judgmental phrasing; normalize their experience to encourage openness.\n- Emphasize that it's common for symptoms to fluctuate or intensify silently, reducing shame or the need to minimize.\n- Build rapport by validating their effort to share, which may ease their guarded stance.\n- Priority order:\n- Start with clarifying nocturnal and positional symptoms, as these are most likely to be underestimated or omitted due to emotional discomfort.\n- Follow with questions about systemic signs like weight loss or fainting to uncover hidden severity.\n- Then inquire about daily life impact to assess real functional impairment beyond their guarded narrative.",

He denies significant distress, weight loss, fevers, or night symptoms, though the communication pattern suggests possible underreporting of symptom severity and variability. Examination findings are pending, and further targeted inquiry is needed to clarify nocturnal or positional symptom exacerbation, systemic signs such as weight loss or dizziness, and the true impact on daily functioning.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, minimization-heavy language, providing minimal detail and responses that downplay severity. His responses are brief, avoiding specifics about symptom fluctuation, especially at night or with activity.\n- Bias detected: The dominant bias is Minimization, characterized by deliberate or unconscious downplaying of symptoms and avoidance of detailed disclosure.\n- Confidence level: Medium. Based on consistent hedging and vague responses, it is likely that actual symptom burden is underrepresented, but the exact extent remains uncertain without further probing.\n- Reasoning: The pattern of language and response style strongly suggests the patient is either unaware of or intentionally minimizing symptom severity, which could mask underlying clinical issues such as nocturnal hypoxia, systemic fatigue, or gastrointestinal distress.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me if your breathing or discomfort feels different when you lie flat at night?\" (rationale: to clarify potential nocturnal worsening)\n- \"Have you noticed if your energy declines more after certain activities or times of day?\" (rationale: to uncover activity-related fatigue)\n- \"Do you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, or dizziness when standing or during the day?\" (rationale: to assess systemic impact and orthostatic symptoms)\n- \"Have you lost weight unintentionally or felt worse overnight?\" (rationale: to explore systemic symptoms that might be underdisclosed)\n- \"How often do you notice these symptoms worsening, and what brings on the worst episodes?\" (rationale: to understand true variability)\n- Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to create a safe space so the patient feels comfortable sharing more openly. Emphasize that it's normal to have ups and downs and that full disclosure helps provide the best care.\n- Priority order: First, clarify nocturnal symptoms, given the common tendency to underreport or minimize sleeping-related issues; then explore activity-related fatigue and systemic signs; finally, address emotional factors or concerns about health impact.",

The absence of overt exaggeration or distress further supports this conclusion.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n* \"Can you tell me more about how your symptoms affect your daily activities, even if they feel manageable?\" (to uncover hidden functional impairment)\n* \"Do you notice any sleep disturbances or night-time symptoms that you haven't mentioned?\" (to clarify nighttime severity)\n* \"How do you feel emotionally about these symptoms?

It's probably nothing, I think.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a 55-year-old male presenting with a one-month history of increased general fatigue, intermittent dull stomach pain, increased frequency of bowel movements, and occasional vomiting after meals. He reports exertional shortness of breath that he perceives as mild and does not significantly limit daily activities, although this may be understated due to stoic reporting. He denies noticing worsening symptoms at night or when lying down, but given communication patterns, nocturnal or positional exacerbations may be underrecognized. No significant emotional distress or sleep disturbances are acknowledged by the patient, though these areas remain areas for further assessment. Objective findings may include signs consistent with gastrointestinal or cardiopulmonary conditions, but clinical evaluation is needed to clarify severity, functional impact, and potential underlying pathology, considering the likelihood of symptom minimization.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, minimizing terms, providing brief, guarded responses that downplay symptom severity, with occasional hesitation, especially regarding sensitive topics like lumps or yellowing.\n- Bias detected: Minimize bias, with evidence in repeated softening language, reluctance to elaborate, and avoidance of specific symptom details.\n- Confidence level: Medium. Although the pattern is clear, some ambiguity remains about the true severity due to possible underreporting or subtle hesitation.\n- Reasoning: The patient's language choices and response style consistently aim to understate issues, likely to avoid worry or embarrassment. This suggests their real clinical picture may be more serious than indicated.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Can you tell me more about how your breathing feels during the day and at night? Do you notice any symptoms waking you up or making it harder to breathe when lying flat?\"\n(Rationale: To uncover nocturnal or positional symptoms that they might be minimizing or unaware of.)\n2. \"Have you noticed any swelling, lumps, or changes in your abdomen or skin that you haven't mentioned?\"\n(Rationale: To address possible hidden concerns they are hesitant to report.)\n3. \"Are there any other symptoms you've experienced, like weight changes, night sweats, or fatigue that seem worse than you think?\"\n(Rationale: To explore systemic or unacknowledged symptoms.)\n- Approach strategy: Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone, emphasizing that all symptoms are important and that sharing details helps ensure you understand their health fully, which can reduce shame or embarrassment.\n- Priority order: Start with questions about breathing during sleep and activity to identify objective signs of severity, then proceed to abdominal and systemic symptoms, ensuring a comprehensive understanding while fostering openness.",

Confidence in the current symptom report is medium, with a need for additional detailed inquiry to accurately gauge the underlying severity.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient consistently uses vague, minimization language, providing minimal details and avoiding potentially alarming symptoms. Responses are concise and cautious, suggesting reluctance or discomfort in fully revealing symptom severity.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is minimization bias, as evidenced by deliberate understatement and vague descriptions of symptoms, likely to avoid concern, stigma, or because of perceived insignificance.\n- Confidence level: medium. My reasoning is based on consistent patterns of minimization and vagueness, though some truthful reporting is present. The bias may obscure true symptom severity.\n- Reasoning: These communication patterns strongly suggest the patient perceives or wants to portray their symptoms as less severe than they might actually be, which is typical of minimization bias. This masking effect could hinder accurate clinical assessment.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you noticed any yellowing of your skin or eyes, or any dark urine?

He notes increased bowel frequency\u2014described as very frequent\u2014and occasional vomiting after eating. He also mentions experiencing mild shortness of breath during activity, which he perceives as not significantly limiting. He reports that symptoms have been persistent without clear worsening or severe episodes, and he does not notice significant changes at night. He denies systemic signs like jaundice, abdominal swelling, or weight loss. His communication suggests he may be minimizing symptom severity, as he describes symptoms as not bothersome and avoids detailed discussion of nocturnal or positional changes.\nAssociated symptoms: Mild shortness of breath during exertion; no explicit reports of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, jaundice, or edema\u2014though these may be underreported.\nConfidence assessment:\n- High confidence: The patient's reported symptoms as described\u2014fatigue, intermittent stomach pain, increased bowel movements, occasional vomiting, mild activity-related shortness of breath.\n- Medium confidence: Actual severity of symptoms\u2014possible underreporting of nocturnal dyspnea, systemic signs like jaundice or edema, and true extent of respiratory compromise.\n- Low confidence: Underlying severity, progression, and systemic involvement, due to communication bias.\n- Missing information: Detailed assessment of nocturnal or positional respiratory symptoms, signs of systemic illness such as jaundice or edema, weight changes, and the impact of symptoms on daily activities.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient consistently responds with brief, vague, and minimizing language, avoiding detailed or confirmatory descriptions of nocturnal or positional symptoms. They show emotional hedging (\"a bit embarrassed\") and lean toward underplaying symptom severity.\n- Bias detected: \"Stoic Minimizer\" bias, as evidenced by downplaying symptoms, reluctance to confirm worsening, and emotional guardedness. Their responses tend to underreport true symptom burden, especially regarding night-time exacerbation.\n- Confidence level: Medium. While their language suggests significant minimization, some acknowledgment of increased frequency hints at awareness, yet true severity remains uncertain.\n- Reasoning: The discrepancy between reports of no change and previous mentions of increased symptoms indicates possible underreporting driven by emotional concerns or cultural stoicism. The carefully guarded responses and avoidance support a moderate bias influencing clinical clarity.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you ever woken up at night feeling breathless or needing to sit up suddenly? How often does that happen?\" (to detect nocturnal symptoms hidden by minimization)\n- \"Do you notice any swelling in your ankles or legs lately?\" (to uncover systemic signs missed due to underreporting)\n- \"Have you experienced any weight gain or loss recently?\" (to assess fluid retention or systemic involvement)\n- \"Can you tell me about your sleep\u2014do you wake up feeling tired or short of breath?\" (to clarify potential nocturnal issues)\n- \"How do your symptoms impact your daily activities? Do you avoid certain things because of how you feel?\" (to gauge functional impact and unspoken concerns)\n- Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing concern for health rather than judgment, encouraging openness. Normalize feelings of embarrassment or stoicism by sharing that many people find these issues hard to discuss.\n- Priority order: Start with questions about nocturnal symptoms, as these are most likely underreported and critical for assessment. Then, explore systemic signs and functional impact to gain a fuller picture and assess whether the minimizations reflect true stability or masked severity.",

The patient reports mild breathlessness during activity and some nocturnal symptoms, such as waking feeling exhausted and slightly out of breath, although he denies severe or systemic features like swelling or jaundice. His communication indicates an inclination to minimize symptoms, particularly nocturnal or systemic manifestations, which warrants further probing to fully assess the potential severity of his condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient demonstrates a consistent tendency to minimize symptoms through vague language, guarded responses, and reassurance statements. They acknowledge some tiredness and mild breathlessness but downplay its severity.\n- Bias detected: Minmization bias is primary, evidenced by intentionally or unconsciously underreporting symptoms' severity and impact, especially nocturnal and respiratory issues. This bias is moderate, possibly concealing more serious underlying pathology.\n- Confidence level: Medium. The communication patterns strongly suggest minimization, but without corroborative data, certainty about actual severity remains limited.\n- Reasoning: Their use of non-specific language, reluctance to emphasize symptoms' impact, and attempts to reassure themselves and the clinician point toward a bias that can obscure the true clinical picture.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n* \"Can you tell me exactly how often you wake up feeling exhausted or out of breath? Are there nights when it\u2019s worse?\" \u2014 to quantify nocturnal symptoms more precisely.\n* \"Do you notice if your symptoms interfere with your sleep quality or cause you to wake up gasping or choking?\" \u2014 to explore possible sleep apnea.\n* \"Have you ever experienced swelling in your legs or ankles, or noticed any changes in your skin color or jaundice?\" \u2014 to detect unreported systemic issues.\n* \"During the day, how tired or short of breath do you feel? Does this limit your activities?\" \u2014 to gauge actual functional impact.\n- Approach strategy:\nUse gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing curiosity rather than suspicion: \"Many people don't realize how much their sleep impacts their health, so I want to understand your experience fully.\" This helps reduce defensiveness and encourages openness.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, clarify nocturnal symptoms with specific, measurable questions, as sleep disturbance can be subtle and often underreported. Next, explore daytime impacts and associated systemic symptoms, as these can reveal more severe underlying conditions. This systematic approach helps uncover concealed severity and guides appropriate evaluation.",

He reports experiencing mild shortness of breath and tiredness, with some nocturnal symptoms such as increased fatigue and brief episodes of shortness of breath when lying flat, which he describes as mild and infrequent. He denies systemic symptoms such as swelling, jaundice, or fainting. The patient tends to minimize symptom severity and impact, which may obscure the underlying extent of his condition. Objective assessment should include evaluation for potential cardiopulmonary or gastrointestinal pathology, with particular attention to nocturnal dyspnea, systemic signs, and symptom progression. Further detailed questioning is warranted to accurately assess symptom severity and functional impact.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient responds with brief, guarded answers, often using qualifiers that diminish the perceived severity of symptoms. He admits to experiencing symptoms but emphasizes their mild or infrequent nature, likely to avoid concern or judgment.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is prominent, as he consistently understates symptom severity and impact.\n- Confidence level: High, given consistent language patterns and responses across the dialogue.\n- Reasoning: The patient's cautious responses and frequent qualifiers indicate an unconscious or conscious effort to underreport symptoms. The external motivation (family encouragement) further supports this protective tendency, but the core reporting remains understated.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you describe exactly how often you wake up feeling exhausted or short of breath? Are there nights when this happens every night?\" (to clarify true frequency)\n- \"Do you notice your breathing or fatigue worsening over the past few weeks, especially when lying down?\" (to assess progression)\n- \"Have you experienced symptoms like swelling in your legs, bluish lips, or fainting spells?\" (to identify systemic or more severe signs not mentioned)\n- \"How does your breathing affect your daily activities and sleep quality?\" (to gauge functional impact)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use gentle, open-ended questions emphasizing concern for well-being to create a safe space.\n- Acknowledge the patient's attempt to downplay, validating their experience but gently encouraging fuller disclosure.\n- Clarify that subtle symptoms can be important and that honest detail can help ensure the best care.\n- Priority order:\n- First, explore the actual frequency and severity of nocturnal symptoms to understand true impact.\n- Next, assess for systemic or more serious signs the patient might be hesitant to admit.\n- Finally, inquire about functional impairments to gauge overall effect and urgency.",

It\\u2019s happened a few times, but I don\\u2019t want to make a big deal.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nPatient demographics: 55-year-old male. Chief complaint: Approximately one month of increased fatigue, intermittent dull abdominal pain, increased bowel movements, and post-meal vomiting, with mild, infrequent shortness of breath\u2014particularly when lying flat\u2014and occasional night-time exhaustion. Present illness: The patient reports a one-month history of fatigue, which he describes as mild overall but sometimes pronounced enough to wake him feeling exhausted and short of breath when lying flat. He notes intermittent dull, non-specific abdominal pain that has persisted for a few weeks, along with increased bowel movements and occasional vomiting after meals. He states these symptoms do not severely impair daily activities and denies more severe episodes like fainting or significant distress, although his responses suggest overall symptom burden may be underestimated. No notable swelling, jaundice, or weight changes are mentioned. The patient indicates that symptoms are fairly constant but attributes some nocturnal shortness of breath and fatigue to stress or tiredness, possibly minimizing their significance. The actual frequency and severity of nighttime symptoms remain uncertain, and systemic signs such as edema or weight change have not been reported.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, Minimizing language, downplays symptoms, and avoids detailed descriptions, particularly regarding nocturnal breathing issues. Responses suggest an effort to present as unaffected, despite symptoms that may be more significant.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is predominant, causing underreporting of symptom severity, especially related to sleep disturbance and respiratory difficulty.\n- Confidence level: Medium to low, since the consistent minimization suggests the true symptom burden could be substantially higher.\n- Reasoning: The patient's cautious language and reluctance to detail symptoms point to an unconscious or conscious effort to minimize illness severity, which masks the true clinical picture.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me if you ever feel short of breath or have to sit up quickly during the night\u2014how often does this happen?\"\n- Rationale: To directly elicit frequency and severity of nocturnal symptoms, bypassing minimization.\n- \"Do you ever wake up with headaches, feeling foggy, or with swelling in your legs?\"\n- Rationale: To identify systemic signs that the patient might not voluntarily mention.\n- \"When you wake up tired, do you feel it\u2019s because you had trouble breathing overnight, or just general tiredness?\"\n- Rationale: To differentiate between sleep disturbance and fatigue from other causes.\n- Approach strategy: Use empathetic, open-ended questions that normalize the experience of sleep issues, e.g., \"Many people experience occasional night-time awakenings from breathing difficulty. Have you noticed anything like that?\" This reduces perceived judgment.\n- Priority order: First clarify nocturnal breathing difficulties with concrete frequency and impact questions to quantify symptoms, then explore systemic signs like swelling or headaches, and finally inquire about subjective fatigue causes to contextualize symptoms.",

He also reports infrequent mild shortness of breath, particularly when lying flat, and waking feeling exhausted during sleep. Although he describes these nocturnal symptoms as only occasional and not severe, communication suggests they may be more frequent and bother him more than expressed. No systemic signs such as swelling, jaundice, or weight loss are reported. Physical examination and further diagnostics are needed to determine the severity of these symptoms and to assess for underlying systemic or cardiopulmonary conditions.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient provides brief, guarded responses, frequently downplaying symptoms with vague language such as \"not really\" and \"not that bad.\" They avoid emotional or detailed descriptions, suggesting a tendency to minimize and withhold information. Their responses are concise, indicating discomfort with full disclosure.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias. The patient underestimates symptom severity, consciously or unconsciously downplays nocturnal shortness of breath and fatigue, and avoids emphasizing potential distress.\n- Confidence level: Medium to high. The consistent pattern of minimization across multiple responses supports this conclusion strongly, though some hidden severity cannot be absolutely confirmed without further probing.\n- Reasoning: The patient's language choices and response style reflect an active minimization bias, likely influenced by discomfort, shame, or an attempt to avoid concern. This bias affects the reliability of their self-reporting and suggests that their symptoms are probably more severe than they express.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n* \"When you wake up feeling tired, do you ever feel you need to sit up or move around to breathe more easily, even if it\u2019s not happening every night?\"\n* \"Have you noticed any episodes where your breathing feels more difficult than usual, or any times you wake up feeling anxious or short of breath?\"\n* \"Are there times during the day or night when you feel more fatigued than you\u2019re letting on?\"\n* \"Have you experienced swelling in your legs, chest tightness, or any other symptoms you haven't mentioned?\"\n* \"Do you feel comfortable talking about your level of fatigue and breathlessness, or do you prefer to keep some of that private?\"\n- Approach strategy: Ask these questions gently, emphasizing that many symptoms can be subtle and normalizing concerns to reduce defensiveness. Use open-ended questions initially, then follow up with specific ones to clarify severity. Be aware of the patient's possible reluctance or shame, and reassure that honesty helps provide the best care.\n- Priority order:\n1. First, assess the frequency and severity of nocturnal symptoms in detail to gauge true impact.\n2. Then, explore associated symptoms like swelling, chest discomfort, or sleep disturbances.\n3. Finally, discuss daily fatigue levels more openly, encouraging full disclosure by normalizing variability in symptoms.",
