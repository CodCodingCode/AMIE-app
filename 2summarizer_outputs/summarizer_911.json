It\\u2019s been getting worse over the last few days, and I\\u2019m really scared I might fall or not be able to walk at all soon.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Margaret communicates her symptoms with detailed and emotionally charged language. She is eager to report her experiences but is likely influenced by high anxiety, leading to amplification of her perceived symptom severity. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification/Anxiety-driven exaggeration, which may inflate her perception of severity and urgency. - Confidence level: Medium; her descriptions are consistent and detailed, but her emotional state suggests her perception is affected. - Reasoning: Her vivid language and stated fears align with emotional amplification bias, although her openness reduces the likelihood of withholding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting subtle signs such as coordination issues, sensory deficits, or autonomic symptoms that she perceives as less urgent. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment or shame about the extent of her fears or dependency concerns; also, details about previous episodes or reassurance from prior evaluations may be omitted. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about immediate fall risk and paralysis are likely exaggerated; she might be overestimating her current neurological risks. - Temporal distortions: Her perception of rapid deterioration over days might be an emotional amplification, whereas clinically, symptoms might be more slowly progressive.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves a neurological process with some degree of peripheral sensory disturbance and mild weakness, progressing gradually. Her sensations are real but possibly less severe than described; her fears are understandable but likely exaggerated by anxiety. The actual neurological deficits may include early signs consistent with demyelinating or neurodegenerative processes but are unlikely to be as acutely disabling or rapidly worsening as perceived.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you experienced any problems with your balance or coordination outside of the numbness and weakness?\" (to detect subtle cerebellar or proprioceptive issues) - \"Do you notice any changes in your vision, speech, or swallowing?\" (screen for cranial nerve involvement) - \"Have you experienced any bladder or bowel control problems?\" (to assess for autonomic involvement) - \"Have you had any episodes of dizziness or blackouts?\" (to evaluate for ongoing balance problems) - \"Can you tell me if your symptoms have changed gradually over weeks or days?\" (to clarify timeline) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, open-ended questions to reduce anxiety and encourage honest reporting. - Normalize her fears but guide focus toward objective signs. - Validate her feelings without reinforcing catastrophizing. - Priority order: - First, explore other neurological symptom domains (vision, balance, cranial nerves) to get a fuller picture. - Next, ask about the timeline and progression to differentiate between acute and chronic processes. - Finally, probe for systemic or autonomic symptoms to shape comprehensive assessment.  **Overall,** I would proceed with careful, empathetic exploration targeting identified gaps to obtain a more accurate clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports numbness, tingling, weakness, and a perception of rapidly worsening symptoms. Given the emotionally charged and detailed language, there is likely an amplification bias driven by anxiety, which may lead to overestimating severity and acuity. The patient's fears of falling or paralysis may be exaggerated, and some symptoms, such as subtle coordination deficits or Autonomic issues, may be underreported or minimized if they seem less urgent. The patient's description suggests a neurological process affecting sensory and motor pathways, but the perception of rapid deterioration over days might be an emotional amplification; the actual progression could be more gradual. Confirming the presence or absence of additional signs like balance issues, cranial nerve involvement, or autonomic symptoms, through further questioning, is necessary to refine the clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown age and gender. Chief complaint: Numbness and tingling in the feet and legs, with perceived extension into arms, associated with weakness. Present illness: Symptoms include sensory disturbances and muscle weakness, which the patient reports as worsening over a few days. Due to emotional amplification, the severity and rapidity of symptom progression may be overestimated; symptoms may be less acute or severe than described. There is no objective confirmation of cranial nerve involvement, balance issues, or autonomic symptoms at this time\u2014these areas need further assessment. The patient\u2019s fears about falling or paralysis are likely heightened by anxiety, possibly exaggerating the perceived urgency. Associated symptoms: No specific mention of vision changes, speech difficulties, swallowing problems, bladder or bowel control issues, dizziness, or blackouts provided; these areas require further probing for accurate assessment. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports sensory disturbances and weakness. - Medium confidence: The degree of severity and rapid progression is likely exaggerated by anxiety. - Low confidence: The true extent of deficits and the presence of additional neurological signs are uncertain without further evaluation. - Missing information: Objective neurological examination findings, detailed review of associated systems, and additional symptom domains are needed to establish a clearer clinical picture.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly about her symptoms and fears but with an emotional tone that possibly amplifies perceived severity. Her responses include detailed descriptions that sometimes lack precise specificity, and she occasionally hesitates or uses vague language, indicating some uncertainty or emotional influence. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification of her symptoms driven by anxiety and fear, with some mild minimization of the true functional impact. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014core symptoms are likely accurate, but their severity and timeline are probably somewhat exaggerated due to emotional state. - Reasoning: Her vivid language and emotional tone suggest heightened distress, which can inflate perception of symptoms. The hesitations and vague phrasing indicate some level of underreporting of nuanced or less severe symptoms, possibly for emotional comfort.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be underreporting milder sensory abnormalities or fatigue, perhaps perceiving them as less important or fearing they indicate weakness. - Withheld information: She may feel shame or embarrassment about dependency or balance issues, leading her to downplay or omit related problems. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of paralysis or losing mobility are likely magnified by her emotional distress, which can overstate the immediacy of danger. - Temporal distortions: The symptoms' progression might be perceived as more rapid than reality; she may be overestimating how quickly her condition worsened due to anxiety.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves a patient experiencing sensory disturbances (numbness, tingling) in distal extremities with some weakness, gradually worsening over several days. The symptoms are real but may be less severe functionally than described, with the patient emotionally amplifying her fears of sudden paralysis and loss of mobility. The progression is probably slower than perceived, and associated symptoms like pain or additional sensory deficits might be present but underreported or understated. Her emotional state influences her reporting, leading to possible overestimation of urgency.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * Can you describe exactly what sensations you're feeling in your limbs\u2014are they numbness, tingling, burning, or something else? (to clarify sensory details) * How do these symptoms affect your daily activities\u2014are you able to perform routine tasks? (to gauge functional impact) * Do you experience any pain, weakness, or other symptoms like vision changes or dizziness? (detect associated symptoms) * How quickly have your symptoms changed\u2014did they come on suddenly or gradually? (to determine progression speed) * Are there any triggers or factors that make your symptoms better or worse? (to understand pattern) - Approach strategy: * Use calm, empathetic questioning to reduce anxiety, framing questions non-judgmentally, encouraging honest disclosure. * Validate her fears without dismissing her experiences, fostering trust. * Ask open-ended questions first, then more specific, concrete inquiries to build a comprehensive picture. - Priority order: * Start with functional impact questions to understand real impairment. * Follow with specific sensory and associated symptom questions. * Conclude with timeline and emotional state inquiries to understand context and influence on perception.  # Short Answer",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's emotional tone and detailed descriptions suggest that she is experiencing real neural symptoms like numbness, tingling, and weakness, but her reporting likely amplifies perceived severity and urgency. She appears to focus on rapid progression and maximum functional impairment, which may overstate the true course and severity of her symptoms. Her language indicates high emotional distress, possibly leading to overestimation of symptom immediacy and intensity, while she may be underreporting less bothersome or subtle symptoms such as mild sensory deficits or fatigue. Given these biases, the actual neurological deficits are probably present but less severe than described, with a gradual onset over days. More precise assessment of sensation types, progression timeline, and functional impact is necessary, as some symptoms may be understated or emotionally magnified.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: unspecified age and gender. Chief complaint: Sensory disturbances and weakness in extremities, perceived as rapidly worsening. Present illness: The patient reports numbness and tingling starting in the feet, spreading to the legs and arms, with increasing weakness affecting mobility over a few days. Symptoms are described with emotional emphasis, possibly exaggerating their severity. - Well-established symptoms: Sensory symptoms involving numbness and tingling in distal limbs, reported weakness affecting standing. - Likely minimized symptoms: Possible mild sensory abnormalities or fatigue not emphasized. - Possibly withheld symptoms: Additional signs such as visual changes, dizziness, or less severe sensory deficits or systemic features possibly not mentioned. - Timeline: Onset over several days with perceived rapid worsening, though the actual progression may be slower. Associated symptoms: No mention of pain, vision changes, or autonomic symptoms; confidence in these areas is low. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of sensory disturbances and weakness. - Medium confidence: Severity and rapid progression are likely overestimated. - Low confidence: Exact timeline, extent of functional impairment, and presence of additional symptoms. - Missing information: Specific sensory qualities, detailed functional impact, and associated systemic or neurological signs.\nANSWER: The patient presents with sensory disturbances characterized by numbness and tingling in the feet, extending to the legs and arms, along with some weakness affecting mobility. These symptoms have been reportedly worsening over a few days, with high emotional distress influencing her perception of severity and progression. Clinically, the findings suggest a neurological process involving peripheral or central pathways, but the true extent of impairment and timeline may be less severe and more gradual than described. Further detailed examination and probing are necessary to accurately assess sensory qualities, functional impact, and associated features.",

Clinically, the findings suggest a neurological process involving peripheral or central pathways, but the true extent of impairment and timeline may be less severe and more gradual than described. Further detailed examination and probing are necessary to accurately assess sensory qualities, functional impact, and associated features.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with vivid emotional language and emphasizes severity, but her responses are concise and sometimes vague, hinting at anxiety and possible emotional amplification. She avoids detailed discussion of emotional and functional impacts. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification with moderate exaggeration influenced by anxiety, leading her to perceive and describe her symptoms as more severe and rapidly worsening than may be objectively true. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014evidence of amplification is clear, but some details like timeline and extent of neurological deficits require further clarification. - Reasoning: Her hyper-emotional descriptors and emphasis on deterioration suggest amplification. The vague timeline and lack of detailed functional info point to possible underreporting of subtle symptoms. Her responses reflect distress-driven overestimation rather than denial or minimization.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be downplaying emotional or cognitive struggles, or subtle neurological signs, which she perceives as less urgent than physical sensations. - Withheld information: She may be hesitant to share emotional vulnerabilities, mental health concerns, or detailed daily functioning issues, possibly due to embarrassment or fear. - Amplified concerns: Her fear of falling and inability to walk could be amplified by anxiety; she might be interpreting minor deficits as severe threats. - Temporal distortions: Her rapid perceived progression over days likely exaggerates the actual, more gradual course; emotional distress inflates her sense of urgency.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her emotional amplification and potential withholding, her true neurological symptoms may be milder and develop more gradually. Sensory disturbances are probably present but less severe, with some mild weakness and no rapid deterioration. The timeline may be overestimated, and her emotional distress is significantly influencing her perception. She seems genuinely distressed but may not fully recognize or articulate the extent of her functional impairment or emotional factors involved.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \u201cCan you tell me if your sensations have changed in any way overnight or if they have remained steady?\u201d (to clarify progression) - \u201cHave you noticed any issues with balance, coordination, or controlling your bladder or bowels?\u201d (to detect other neurological signs) - \u201cHow are you feeling emotionally\u2014do you have worries or feelings you'd like to share?\u201d (to gauge emotional and mental health) - \u201cTell me how your symptoms have affected your daily routine or activities.\u201d (to assess functional impact) - Approach strategy: Ask gently and empathetically, validating her distress to encourage openness, while clarifying details without leading. Use concrete, specific questions to elicit precise responses. - Priority order: First, clarify the timeline and severity of sensory symptoms; second, explore associated neurological signs like coordination, balance, or continence issues; third, address emotional health to understand anxiety\u2019s role and gather a holistic view.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication style indicates emotional amplification and possible exaggeration of symptoms severity and rapid progression. She emphasizes sensation of burning, tingling, and weakness using vivid language and expresses significant fear of falling and inability to walk, which may be influenced by anxiety. Her responses are somewhat vague regarding the timeline and extent of neurological deficits, suggesting that her perception of rapid deterioration may not be entirely objective. This pattern points toward potential symptom magnification, while some clinical features such as sensory disturbances are confirmed. However, baseline or subtle deficits and other neurological signs, including coordination or autonomic issues, may be underreported or minimized. Therefore, while the core complaints are sensory disturbance with weakness, the severity and timeline should be interpreted cautiously and verified through further examination.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Sensory disturbances involving numbness, tingling, and burning sensations, predominantly in the feet, extending to the legs and arms, with associated weakness affecting mobility.  Present illness: The patient reports onset of numbness and tingling initially in the toes, with progression upwards to involve the legs and arms. She describes the sensations as burning and sharp, with recent worsening over several days, and a subjective inability to stand properly or walk confidently. However, her description of rapid deterioration and the severity of symptoms may be overstated due to emotional distress and anxiety. Sensory symptoms are likely present to some degree but may be milder or more gradual than perceived. No specific mention of autonomic symptoms or bowel/bladder issues has been made, and the timeline suggests more gradual progression than the patient perceives. Her emotional state may lead to overestimation of symptom severity and urgency.  Associated symptoms: No mention of balance problems, coordination issues, or autonomic disturbances such as bladder or bowel control disruptions\u2014confidence in these areas is medium, pending further assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Sensory disturbances of numbness, tingling, and burning involving feet and limbs; reported weakness affecting mobility. - Medium confidence: Severity, rapidity of progression, and functional impairment are likely exaggerated due to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Precise timeline, extent of weakness, and neurological deficits outside sensory symptoms. - Missing information: Detailed neurological examination findings, presence of additional signs such as coordination or autonomic dysfunction, and emotional or psychiatric comorbidities.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with sensory disturbances characterized by numbness, tingling, and burning sensations primarily in the feet, extending to the legs and arms. She reports a recent and worsening progression over a few days, with associated weakness affecting her ability to stand and walk, although her perception may be influenced by notable anxiety and emotional distress. She denies current autonomic symptoms such as bladder or bowel control issues. Physical examination and further diagnostic workup are necessary to assess the true extent of neurological impairment, which may be more moderate and gradual than her descriptions suggest.",

She avoids discussing certain aspects (e.g., bladder/bowel) and may be influenced by anxiety. - Bias detected: Amplification bias impacting her reporting, with potential minor underlying minimization in certain autonomic or functional areas. - Confidence level: Medium to high, because her language shows clear signs of emotional exaggeration, though the core symptoms are likely genuine. - Reasoning: The alarming descriptions and emotional tone suggest her distress amplifies her symptoms; her reluctance to discuss some topics indicates possible underreporting of autonomic issues but overall, her symptoms are credible, just possibly exaggerated in severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Autonomic disturbances (dizziness, balance issues, bladder or bowel problems) may be present but not reported, likely due to embarrassment or fear. - Withheld information: Emotional state, cognitive changes, or additional subtle neurological signs might be concealed to avoid increased concern or shame. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about falling and mobility loss are likely amplified by anxiety, possibly over-inflating her actual risk. - Temporal distortions: Her perception of rapid progression over days may overstate the true clinical course; actual progression may be more gradual.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves: - Significant sensory disturbances (numbness, tingling, burning sensations) in the feet spreading proximally, with weakness affecting mobility. - The symptoms may be more gradual and less intense physiologically than described; her perception is amplified by anxiety. - Possible underlying demyelinating or inflammatory process affecting peripheral or central pathways, but with autonomic symptoms (bladder/bowel issues) possibly present but unreported. - Her emotional distress is influencing her subjective report, necessitating careful objective evaluation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions about bladder and bowel control: \u201cHave you experienced any difficulty controlling your bladder or bowel? Any episodes of incontinence or urgency?\u201d to uncover autonomic signs. - Assess for balance, coordination, cerebellar signs: \u201cHave you noticed any dizziness or feeling unsteady? Any double vision or difficulty with fine movements?\u201d to clarify autonomic and cerebellar involvement. - Explore cognitive or emotional state: \u201cAre you feeling anxious, scared, or overwhelmed by these symptoms?\u201d to gauge emotional impact. - Approach: Ask these questions gently, emphasizing reassurance, and normalize concerns to reduce shame or embarrassment. - Prioritize questions on autonomic and functional capabilities early in the interview to gather comprehensive data, then correlate with physical exam findings.",

She reports these symptoms as worsening over the past few days, accompanied by weakness affecting mobility. While she describes her symptoms as severe and progressive, her emotional distress and anxiety may be amplifying her perception of severity. She denies current urinary or bowel incontinence but may underreport such autonomic symptoms. Objective findings should include sensory deficits in the affected dermatomes and weakness in lower and possibly upper limbs; however, the true extent of her deficits may be less severe than her descriptions suggest. Further assessment is needed to evaluate for possible demyelinating or inflammatory processes, and to investigate for covert autonomic or cerebellar involvement.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs emotionally charged language that emphasizes severity, with verbose and repetitive descriptions indicating distress and anxiety. She tends to focus on prominent sensory symptoms but shows hesitation or reticence when discussing autonomic functions, suggesting possible withholding due to embarrassment. Her responses reflect emotional amplification of symptoms, potentially exaggerating their impact. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification influences her reporting, leading her to overstate symptom severity and urgency. There is also some minimization of autonomic issues, possibly to avoid embarrassment or due to limited awareness. - Confidence level: Medium; her descriptions are credible but likely inflated, especially concerning emotional distress and perceived severity. - Reasoning: The emotional tone and inconsistent revelation of autonomic symptoms point to amplification and withholding biases. Her narrative suggests genuine neurological deficits but also reflects anxiety-driven exaggeration.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Autonomic dysfunctions like bladder or bowel issues may be underreported due to embarrassment. She might also have subtle cerebellar or visual disturbances not fully acknowledged. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or cognitive issues, which could signal more extensive neurological involvement. - Amplified concerns: Her fear of falling and overall decline may be exaggerated by her anxiety and emotional distress. - Temporal distortions: The recent escalation might overshadow intermittent or fluctuating symptoms that are less distressing but still relevant for accurate diagnosis.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should include: - Sensory deficits predominantly affecting the feet, legs, and arms, with signs of clear dermatomal or distributional loss, but possibly less severe than described. Objective testing might reveal moderate to mild impairments. - Motor weakness consistent with peripheral or central demyelination but less dramatic than her emotional descriptions suggest. - Evidence of autonomic dysfunction (e.g., bladder or bowel issues) may be present but is underdisclosed; clinically, these features warrant explicit assessment. - Neurological signs such as cerebellar signs, visual disturbances, or cognitive changes may be subtle or absent; their omission is likely due to emotional factors. - Symptoms likely developed over weeks, with recent worsening, influenced by anxiety levels.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel control, such as leakage, urgency, or difficulty starting urination or bowel movements?\" (to evaluate covert autonomic involvement) * \"Do you experience double vision, dizziness, or balance problems, especially when moving around?\" (to detect cerebellar or visual issues) * \"Have your symptoms ever come and gone, or been worse at certain times?\" (to understand fluctuation) * \"Do you ever feel confused or have trouble concentrating?\" (to check for subtle cognitive issues) - Approach strategy: * Use open, gentle questions to reduce embarrassment and encourage honest disclosure. * Normalize symptoms to ease shame (\"Many people with these kinds of symptoms find it difficult to talk about these issues\u2014it's common and nothing to be embarrassed about\"). * Validate feelings to reduce anxiety-driven exaggeration. - Priority order: 1. Assess for autonomic symptoms comprehensively. 2. Clarify symptom progression and fluctuation. 3. Screen for other neurological signs (vision, coordination). 4. Explore emotional state and its impact on symptom perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's verbose and emotionally charged descriptions suggest she is amplifying her symptoms, likely overestimating their severity and impact. She predominantly reports numbness, tingling, burning sensations, and weakness in her limbs, which are consistent with neurological deficits but may be less severe objectively. Her reluctance or hesitation to mention autonomic symptoms like bladder or bowel issues indicates possible underreporting or withholding these details due to embarrassment or unaware of their relevance. Her emphasis on symptoms spreading and feeling constant aligns with genuine neurological involvement, though the intensity and distress are likely exaggerated by her anxiety. Further assessment is necessary to confirm the extent of her sensory and motor deficits, evaluate for autonomic involvement, and identify any additional neurological signs she might not have disclosed. The timeline suggests recent worsening over days, but the true progression could be more gradual or fluctuate.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged adult female.  Chief complaint: Sensory disturbances including numbness, tingling, burning sensations, and weakness affecting the limbs, with recent progression.  Present illness: The patient reports numbness and tingling initially in the toes, spreading up the legs and into the arms, with sensations described as constant and burning. She reports increasing weakness impairing mobility and balance over the past few days. Based on communication patterns, the true severity of sensory deficits and weakness may be moderate rather than severe as described. Objective examination is planned to evaluate for sensory deficits in distal and proximal dermatomes, motor strength, reflexes, and coordination. While she denies current urinary or bowel disturbances, these may be underreported and should be explicitly assessed. No reported double vision or dizziness at present, but subtle signs cannot be ruled out. The symptoms' recent exacerbation suggests a possible demyelinating or inflammatory process, but honest disclosure of autonomic or cerebellar symptoms needs to be confirmed.  Associated symptoms: No overt autonomic or cerebellar signs reported; cognitive function likely intact but should be evaluated if further deficits are suspected.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presenting sensory disturbances and weakness. - Medium confidence: Severity and exact extent of deficits due to amplification in reporting. - Low confidence: Absence of autonomic symptoms and other neurological signs, considering possible underreporting. - Missing information: Detailed assessment of bladder and bowel function, cerebellar and visual examination, and neurological testing to confirm deficits and exclude other causes.\nANSWER: The patient is a middle-aged woman presenting with sensory disturbances characterized by numbness, tingling, and burning sensations initially in the toes, which have subsequently spread proximally into the legs and arms. She reports recent worsening of these symptoms over the past few days, along with weakness affecting her gait and balance, leading to concern about falls. While she describes her symptoms as severe and persistent, objective findings are necessary to determine the true extent of sensory and motor deficits. She denies current autonomic symptoms such as bladder or bowel issues, but these may be underdisclosed. A thorough neurological exam, including sensory testing, motor strength assessment, reflex examination, and evaluation for cerebellar and cranial nerve involvement, is recommended. Further questioning about autonomic function and subtle cerebellar signs is needed, recognizing her communication may influence the accuracy of her reported severity. Overall, her neurological signs are likely present but less dramatic than her descriptions suggest, and additional testing will clarify the underlying pathology.",
