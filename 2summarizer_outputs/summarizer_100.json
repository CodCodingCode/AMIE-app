My ear\\u2019s been hurting really bad, like a terrible burning pain. There\\u2019s also this rash and blisters on the skin just inside and around my ear. The worst part is, my face on that side feels really droopy and numb now. It all started about three days ago with that sharp ear pain, then yesterday the rash showed up. Now I\\u2019m worried about losing control of my face or even my hearing. Do you think this is dangerous? Do I need treatment right away?\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with highly emotional, detailed, and organized descriptions, emphasizing symptom severity through charged language without signs of minimization or withholding. - Bias detected: The main bias is anxious amplification, wherein emotional language exaggerates perceived severity and threat. - Confidence level: Medium-high; the patient's factual details appear credible but are emotionally intensified. - Reasoning: The structured, detailed report and absence of withholding suggest genuine symptoms, though the emotional tone indicates they may be overestimating danger due to anxiety.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possibly, the patient underreports coping mechanisms or actual sensory function, but no strong evidence supports this. - Withheld information: They may be reluctant to share feelings of fear, helplessness, or perceived impact on daily activities, which could be more distressing. - Amplified concerns: They are likely overestimating the threat of permanent paralysis or hearing loss, driven by emotional distress. - Temporal distortions: The timeline seems accurate but may be influenced by worry, potentially overemphasizing rapid worsening or urgency.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the clinical presentation likely includes: - Acute facial nerve weakness or paralysis, with associated ear pain and rash consistent with herpes zoster. - Visible blisters and rash inside/around the ear. - Ear pain of moderate to severe intensity. - Likely some degree of hearing loss, possibly sensorineural or conductive. - Emotional distress, with worry about permanent deficits, possibly magnified compared to actual severity. - Timeline of symptom onset appears consistent with viral reactivation, possibly progressing over a few days.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: * \u201cCan you tell me exactly how your facial movement has changed? Are you able to close your eye or smile on that side?\u201d (assesses neurological deficits) * \u201cHow is your hearing now? Do you notice muffled sounds or ringing?\u201d (clarifies hearing loss severity) * \u201cHave you noticed any other changes, like dizziness or weakness elsewhere?\u201d (detects additional neurological signs) * \u201cHow are you coping emotionally with these symptoms? Do you feel overwhelmed?\u201d (addresses emotional impact and reassurance needs) - Approach strategy: * Ask in a calm, empathetic manner to reduce further anxiety and facilitate honest sharing. * Use open-ended questions to explore fears and perceptions for better understanding. * Validate their feelings while gently guiding them toward factual understanding of their condition. - Priority order: First, confirm neurological status and symptom severity with objective questions. Next, explore emotional impact and concerns to address anxiety. This order ensures safety assessment while also providing emotional support.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a high level of emotional distress and uses charged language, which suggests anxiety may amplify their perception of severity. They describe severe ear pain, rash, blisters, and facial droop with numbness, which are consistent with herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome). However, their concern about losing control of facial movement or hearing may be exaggerated due to anxiety. The detailed timeline indicates symptoms started three days ago, with progression over time. There is no mention of additional neurological symptoms like dizziness, other sensory deficits, or weakness, which slightly tempers the suspected severity. Objective signs such as facial nerve weakness, visible rash, and blisters are likely present but not confirmed explicitly. The emotional overlay suggests that symptoms could be more severe or extensive than described, and some aspects such as degree of hearing loss or completeness of facial paralysis could be underestimated or withheld. Objective assessment would require neurological testing and otologic examination to confirm deficits but are currently unverified. Gathering further details on facial nerve function, hearing status, and additional neurological signs is necessary, and reassurance should be balanced with urgent evaluation given potential for complications.\nANSWER: The patient is a 68-year-old individual presenting with a three-day history of moderate to severe ear pain, accompanied by a rash and blisters on and around the ear. They report recent onset of facial drooping and numbness on the affected side, with concern for possible facial paralysis or hearing loss. Clinical examination is needed to assess facial nerve function, the extent of the rash, and auditory status. Symptoms consistent with herpes zoster oticus are suspected, but confirmation through physical examination and potentially further diagnostic testing is indicated to evaluate for facial nerve paralysis, amount of hearing impairment, and other neurological involvement. Emotional distress is notable, and while symptoms appear genuine, some perception of severity may be heightened by anxiety, requiring careful assessment to determine appropriate urgency and treatment.",

Their focus on severity and fear indicates amplification of symptoms due to worry. - Bias detected: Amplification bias strongly influences their reporting, magnifying perceived severity and risking overstatement of potential neurological damage. - Confidence level: Medium-high, since language and focus on catastrophic outcomes clearly suggest anxiety-driven exaggeration, though the descriptions are credible and detailed. - Reasoning: The vivid description and concerns about permanent damage align with anxiety-induced amplification, and their openness indicates no withholding but a possible overemphasis on worst fears.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: They may not acknowledge any mild or improving symptoms, potentially overlooking signs of partial recovery or less severe issues. - Withheld information: It\u2019s less about withholding and more about overemphasis; however, they might be hesitant to mention prior mild symptoms or previous health concerns that could give a broader perspective. - Amplified concerns: Their fears about permanent paralysis and deafness are likely exaggerated; the actual risk might be lower, and symptoms could be more temporary. - Temporal distortions: They seem to perceive the symptom progression as rapidly worsening with catastrophic implications, which may not reflect the true course.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Given the bias toward amplification, the realistic scenario likely involves a herpes zoster oticus with facial nerve involvement and some auditory symptoms, but not necessarily permanent damage. The course might be variable, with potential for improvement with treatment. Mild initial symptoms or partial recovery signs may be underreported or overlooked due to the patient's focus on severe symptoms and fears. The actual neurological deficits could be less extensive or more recoverable over time.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Have you noticed any changes or improvements in your facial weakness or numbness since the symptoms started?\" (to gauge recovery trends). 2. \"Are there any other symptoms, like mild ear ringing or minor facial twitching, that you've noticed but didn't mention?\" (to identify overlooked signs). 3. \"How are your symptoms today compared to when they first appeared?\" (to assess progression). 4. \"Have you experienced similar symptoms before or other recent illnesses?\" (to understand baseline health). - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, validate their feelings, and gently guide toward a balanced view, reassuring yet realistic. - Priority order: Start with questions about current changes and signs of improvement to de-emphasize catastrophic focus, then explore the full symptom spectrum, finishing with background health questions to contextualize their fears.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates an emotional, anxiety-driven reporting style, emphasizing worst-case scenarios such as facial paralysis and hearing loss. While they describe symptoms like severe ear pain, rash with blisters, facial drooping, numbness, and tinnitus, their heightened concern suggests possible amplification of severity. Likewise, there may be unacknowledged milder or improving symptoms, and some details may be exaggerated due to fear. The communication pattern indicates the need to interpret the symptoms with caution, recognizing that their perception of severity could be overestimated, and that objective assessment\u2014such as physical examination\u2014is necessary to clarify the realistic extent of neurological involvement and injury progression.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old individual, unspecified gender.  Chief complaint: Recent onset of ear pain, rash with blisters, facial drooping and numbness, and tinnitus.  Present illness: The patient reports a three-day history beginning with severe, burning ear pain, followed by the appearance of a rash with blisters around and inside the ear, and now facial drooping and numbness on the affected side. The patient is highly concerned about potential neurological damage, including facial paralysis and hearing loss, and describes the symptoms as severe and worsening.  Associated symptoms: Tinnitus and ear sensitivity are reported, though the patient\u2019s description may be amplified; other neurological signs are not confirmed at this time.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The timeline of symptom onset and the presence of ear pain, rash, and facial weakness/numbness. - Medium confidence: The reported severity of symptoms due to anxiety-driven amplification. - Low confidence: The extent of neurological deficit (degree of paralysis, hearing impairment) and permanence. - Missing information: Objective findings from physical examination, result of neurologic assessment, hearing testing, and possible laboratory or imaging data to confirm diagnosis and severity.\nANSWER: The patient is a 68-year-old presenting with a three-day history of moderate to severe ear pain, accompanied by a rash with blisters around and inside the ear, and new-onset facial drooping and numbness on the same side.

The patient expresses significant concern about potential neurological damage, including facial paralysis and hearing loss. Objective clinical evaluation, including physical examination, is necessary to assess facial nerve function, the extent of skin involvement, and auditory status. Symptoms consistent with herpes zoster oticus are suspected; however, severity may be overrepresented due to patient anxiety. Further diagnostic workup will be required to determine the extent of nerve involvement, presence of concurrent neurological deficits, and to guide appropriate treatment.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with high emotional charge and exaggeration, emphasizing severity and danger, especially concerning neurological consequences. His responses are detailed but framed through fear, which amplifies perceived threat. There is little overt minimization, but emotional distress likely skews severity perception. - Bias detected: The main bias appears to be amplification of symptom severity and danger perception. The patient's use of intense language and focus on worst outcomes support this. - Confidence level: Medium; the symptom reports align with clinical expectations but are likely exaggerated due to anxiety, so physical severity may be somewhat overestimated. - Reasoning: The consistent emotional expressiveness and amplification indicators, combined with the lack of minimization clues, suggest overstatement driven by distress rather than intentional deception.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient may be underreporting prior functional health or emotional factors that help contextualize current symptoms; they might be unaware of or unwilling to mention ongoing stress or past similar episodes that resolved uneventfully. - Withheld information: Possible reluctance to disclose mental health state, stress levels, or previous experiences with similar symptoms that could influence perception. They may also be hesitant to admit doubts or fears about recovery or diagnosis. - Amplified concerns: The fears of paralysis and hearing loss are probably exaggerated; the patient might be overestimating permanence or severity due to emotional overload, possibly magnifying real neurological deficits. - Temporal distortions: The timeline is fairly consistent but filtered through anxiety, likely leading to an overemphasis on rapid progression and current severity that might not reflect actual symptom evolution.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased clinical scenario likely involves an acute neurological-inflammatory process, such as herpes zoster oticus, presenting with intense pain, rash, and facial weakness. The physical symptoms are probably severe but not necessarily at the worst imaginable level; the patient's distress inflates their perception of severity and threat. The timing appears accurate, with onset around three days ago and progression consistent with viral reactivation. Emotional factors contribute to the overemphasis of symptom severity, though the physical presentation warrants urgent attention.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you experienced similar symptoms in the past without such worry?\" (to assess baseline health and emotional state) - \"Are there any other symptoms you haven't mentioned, like dizziness, weakness elsewhere, or recent stress?\" (to identify potential additional issues) - \"Can we look at your facial movements and hearing to see how they are functioning now?\" (to objectively assess neurological deficits) - \"How have you been feeling emotionally\u2014any recent stress or anxiety?\" (to understand the impact of mental health on symptom perception) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, reassuring language emphasizing that understanding all aspects helps provide the best care, which can help reduce fear-driven exaggeration. - Priority order: Start by clarifying baseline health and emotional wellbeing to contextualize current fears, then proceed to detailed neurological assessment to objectively measure deficits, and finally, explore timeline and progression to confirm symptom evolution.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates heightened emotional expression and an emphasis on severity and danger, likely leading to an overestimation of symptom intensity and neurological threat. Although he reports severe pain, rash with blisters, facial drooping, numbness, ringing, and touch sensitivity, the emotional distress appears to magnify perceived severity. There is no indication of explicit minimization, but his overconcern suggests possible exaggeration of deficits and change progression. He likely might be underreporting or withholding details about previous health, mental health, and other associated symptoms such as dizziness or additional neurological deficits, which could influence the overall clinical picture. The timeline described (symptom onset about three days ago) seems consistent but may be perceived as more rapid or severe due to anxiety. Therefore, physical findings (nerve function, skin involvement, hearing) should be objectively assessed to characterize the actual severity.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old individual presenting with recent neurological and dermatological symptoms. Chief complaint: Acute onset of ear pain, rash with blisters, and facial drooping, with concerns about neurological damage. Present illness: The patient reports a three-day history starting with sharp, burning ear pain followed by rash with blisters inside and around the ear. He describes subsequent development of facial drooping and numbness on the same side, with additional symptoms including ringing in the ear and increased pain upon touch. These descriptions likely reflect an inflammatory or viral process, such as herpes zoster oticus, but the emotional context suggests symptom severity may be amplified. Associated symptoms: Patient reports facial weakness, numbness, and ear ringing; other neurological symptoms, such as dizziness or additional weakness, are not mentioned but should be evaluated. Timeline: Symptoms began approximately three days prior, with progression from pain to rash and facial weakness over this period. The emotional distress likely influences perceived speed of symptom progression.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of ear pain, rash with blisters, facial drooping on one side, and associated neurological symptoms. - Medium confidence: Severity and extent of nerve involvement and functional deficits, which may be overestimated due to patient anxiety. - Low confidence: Precise neurological deficits, hearing loss magnitude, and completeness of facial paralysis, potentially exaggerated. - Missing information: Objective assessment of facial nerve function, hearing status, skin examination for rash extent, and presence of other neurological signs; mental health and baseline functional status to contextualize current fears.\nANSWER: The patient is a 68-year-old individual presenting with a recent three-day history of intense ear pain, accompanied by a blistering rash around and inside the ear, as well as new-onset facial drooping and numbness on the same side. He reports additional symptoms including ringing in the ear and heightened pain upon touch. While these symptoms suggest a possible herpes zoster oticus, objective examination is necessary to ascertain the degree of facial nerve impairment, skin involvement, and auditory function. The patient's emotional distress appears to amplify perceived severity, potentially overrepresenting the extent of neurological deficits. Further assessment is required to confirm the precise neurological and dermatological findings, evaluate for additional signs such as dizziness, and form an accurate diagnosis to guide management.",

Their responses are elaborative, with a focus on fears of permanent damage, which suggests emotional amplification rather than neutral reporting. - Bias detected: Amplification/over-reporting driven by high anxiety and fear of neurological damage. This bias inflates the perceived severity of symptoms and may distort clinical assessment. - Confidence level: Medium. I believe the patient\u2019s emotional response influences their perception significantly, but the presence of physically observable symptoms like rash and facial droop supports actual pathology. - Reasoning: The detailed description of symptoms coupled with emotional language indicates amplification, not necessarily denial or minimization. Their worry likely magnifies their perception of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Subtle residual motor deficits or minor sensory disturbances may be present but not perceived or reported due to emotional overwhelm. - Withheld information: Embarrassment is unlikely, but the patient might be reluctant to acknowledge feelings of hopelessness or fear of ending up permanently disabled, though their current statements already show high anxiety. - Amplified concerns: They seem to overstate the permanence of neurological damage, possibly fearing lifelong paralysis or deafness that may not be as severe or lasting. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears accurate, but their perception of rapid progression or outcome could be exaggerated, emphasizing worst-case scenarios.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely includes: - A diagnosis consistent with herpes zoster oticus, presenting with ear pain, vesicular rash, facial weakness, and sensory symptoms. - The actual severity of facial paralysis may be moderate rather than complete; the patient perceives it as more severe. - Dizziness and ringing are present but not necessarily as disabling as described. - Extra neurological deficits may be mild or absent; the emotional evaluation amplifies perceived deficits. - The overall symptom timeline is accurate, but the perceived severity and permanence are overstated due to anxiety.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you try to smile for me and tell me if the affected side moves completely or only partially?\" (assessing motor function) * \"Are your hearing and ringing very loud or more mild?\" (clarifying auditory deficits) * \"Do you notice any weakness when you try to lift your face or close your eyes?\" (motor strength) * \"Have you experienced any other neurological symptoms like dizziness or difficulty coordinating movements?\" (additional assessments) - Approach strategy: Use calm, empathetic language, validating their distress but encouraging objective assessment. Acknowledge their fears and reassure that examination will help clarify what is happening. - Priority order: First, assess motor and facial nerve function directly, then evaluate auditory symptoms, followed by more general neurological exam and emotional support, to disentangle genuine deficits from anxiety-related perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's subjective reporting is heavily influenced by emotional distress, leading to potential exaggeration of neurological deficits and overall symptom severity. While they report intense ear pain, vesicular rash, facial drooping, numbness, ringing, and dizziness, objective clinical examination is necessary to confirm the extent of facial nerve involvement, assess motor strength, and determine the severity of auditory symptoms. The patient\u2019s emphasis on fears of irreversible damage suggests that some symptoms may be perceived as more severe than they objectively are, and they might be underreporting subtle motor or sensory deficits due to anxiety or emotional distress. The timeline provided appears consistent, but the perception of rapid progression or permanence could be overstated. Overall, the clinical picture likely includes herpes zoster oticus features with moderate facial paralysis and sensory involvement, but the actual deficits may be less severe than perceived by the patient.

OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old individual  Chief complaint: Recent onset of ear pain, rash, and facial drooping, with concern for serious neurological and auditory complications, acknowledging potential exaggeration of severity due to emotional distress  Present illness: The patient reports a three-day history of severe, burning ear pain, followed by the appearance of a vesicular rash around and inside the ear. They also describe facial drooping, numbness, and heaviness on one side, with associated ringing in the ear and episodes of dizziness. The patient believes symptoms are worsening, but some deficits may be less severe than perceived. The timeline suggests symptom onset starting three days ago, with progression to facial weakness and sensory changes happening over that period.  Associated symptoms: Ringing in the ear (auditory symptoms), dizziness (confidence level medium, based on patient report), and facial weakness and numbness (likely moderate in severity, possibly exaggerated). Additional neurological deficits such as weakness when trying to move the face or elevations in sensory disturbances are not explicitly confirmed but warrant assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of ear pain, vesicular rash, and facial drooping on exam; timeline of symptom onset. - Medium confidence: Severity of facial paralysis and sensory deficits, due to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Exact extent of hearing impairment and neurological deficits, which require formal examination. - Missing information: Objective assessment of facial nerve function, motor strength, hearing status, and presence of additional neurological signs.\nANSWER: The patient is a 68-year-old individual presenting with a three-day history of severe ear pain and a vesicular rash localized around and inside the ear, suggestive of herpes zoster oticus.

While the patient expresses concern about severe and possibly permanent neurological damage, their communication pattern indicates that some perceived severity may be influenced by emotional distress, and objective findings are necessary to clarify the severity of deficits. Examination and further neurological assessment are essential to establish the diagnosis and guide management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with high emotional intensity, emphasizing symptom worsening and fears of permanent damage. The responses show openness but are heavily laced with catastrophizing language, which may amplify perceived severity. - Bias detected: Catastrophizing/amplification bias. The evidence includes emotionally charged language and fixation on worst-case outcomes, likely inflating symptom impact and prognosis. - Confidence level: Medium. While he is cooperative and forthcoming, his emotional expression suggests overestimation of severity. - Reasoning: The focus on fears of permanence and exaggeration of symptoms aligns with an amplification bias driven by anxiety, affecting the objectivity of his self-report.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The patient might be overestimating their current deficits, but could also be overstating the severity of impairment\u2014such as complete paralysis or deafness\u2014actually less advanced. - Withheld information: Less likely, he appears eager to share all concerns; however, he might be amplifying fears, not intentionally withholding. - Amplified concerns: He is likely exaggerating the permanence of deficits and the severity of symptoms due to anxiety. - Temporal distortions: His perception of rapid, unstoppable deterioration may be exaggerated; some stabilization or slight improvement could have occurred.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture should note that the patient has confirmed facial weakness, vesicular rash consistent with herpes zoster oticus, and subjective reports of worsening pain, hearing issues, and dizziness. The emotional distress and catastrophizing bias may lead him to overestimate the severity and permanence of deficits. Therefore, objectively, some neurological deficits are present but may not be as severe or permanent as feared. There may be some initial motor and sensory involvement, with potential for partial spontaneous recovery. The current distress and fears are valid but likely somewhat exaggerated and need reassurance.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how much movement you have in your face now, like trying to smile or close your eye?\" (to objectively assess motor function) - \"Have you noticed any improvements at all since the symptoms first started?\" (to evaluate progression and potential signs of recovery) - \"What specific concerns do you have about whether this will get better or stay the same?\" (to explore fears more deeply) - \"Have you experienced any periods where your hearing or facial strength seemed better or the same?\" (to identify fluctuations) - Approach strategy: - Use calm, empathetic language to acknowledge fears while gently guiding towards more balanced perspectives. - Reframe catastrophic thoughts by discussing typical disease courses and possible improvements. - Priority order: - First assess motor and sensory function objectively. - Then explore his timeline of symptom changes. - Follow with addressing fears, providing reassurance, and discussing prognosis realistically.  This approach helps to balance validating his emotional distress while obtaining accurate, clinically useful information.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits high emotional distress and exaggerated concern about severe, possibly permanent deficits, which suggests catastrophizing bias. Although they report significant facial weakness, pain, ringing, dizziness, and hearing difficulty, their emotional responses may lead them to overstate the severity and permanence of symptoms. Objective findings are needed to confirm the extent of nerve involvement. The timeline indicates symptoms started three days ago with sharp ear pain, followed by rash yesterday, then worsening facial weakness, ringing, and dizziness today. Some symptoms, such as facial weakness and rash, are reliably reported and likely present. However, the reported severity of motor weakness, deafness, and permanence should be interpreted cautiously, as distress may inflate perceived deficits. The patient may also be minimizing subtle recovery signs or fluctuation in symptoms. Further assessment of facial motor function, hearing status, and neurological examination are necessary to distinguish true deficits from perceived severity influenced by anxiety.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old individual presenting with recent onset of neurological and dermatological symptoms. Chief complaint: Severe ear pain, facial drooping, numbness, and hearing issues, with concern about permanent neurological damage. Present illness: The patient reports starting three days prior with a sharp, burning pain in the ear, followed by the appearance of vesicular rash inside and around the ear yesterday. Currently, they describe persistent facial weakness with inability to smile symmetrically, numbness, heaviness on the affected side, ringing in the ear, and intermittent dizziness. Based on communication biases, the actual motor weakness and hearing impairment might be less severe or more variable than reported. Associated symptoms: subjective dizziness episodes, increased ringing, persistent pain. Confidence in the extent of neurological deficits is moderate, as emotional distress may exaggerate symptom severity. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of vesicular rash consistent with herpes zoster oticus. - Medium confidence: Reported facial weakness, hearing issues, and dizziness, which may be overestimated. - Low confidence: The severity and permanence of deficits without examination; patient\u2019s emotional state influences reporting. - Missing information: Objective neurological assessment data, motor and sensory testing, audiological evaluation, and signs of recovery or fluctuation in symptoms.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
