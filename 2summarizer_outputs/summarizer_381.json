I haven't really thought about it much.\\nDOCTOR: Has your pain been associated with any sudden episodes of worsening or increasing severity, especially with movement or changing positions?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes it feels like it's worse when I move around or even when I try to sit up straight, but I'm not really sure how to tell if it's getting worse suddenly.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if the pain worsens after any particular activity or movement, such as physical activity, twisting, or sudden position changes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it sometimes feels worse if I move or turn suddenly, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s just when I do something specific or if it\u2019s all the time.

It emphasizes that the pain is intermittent, localized mostly to one side, worsens with movement or position changes, and she has gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting.

The previous summary already captures most of these facts; no contradictions are present.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 22-year-old girl with sudden, worsening pelvic pain that is mostly on one side, started about three days ago. The pain is intermittent and worsens with movement and sitting up. She reports abdominal bloating, nausea, and occasional vomiting. Her periods have been irregular.
