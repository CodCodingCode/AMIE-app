    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: Uh, well, I guess I\u2019ve been having these episodes for about two years now. I keep feeling this weird dizziness and sometimes I get all off balance, and it\u2019s really hard to focus or do things like write. It happens mostly when I\u2019m stressed or move my head suddenly, and it kind of scares me because I don\u2019t know why it keeps happening.\\nDOCTOR: Can you describe what happens during these episodes, such as how long they last, if you notice any warning signs beforehand, and whether anything helps relieve or worsen your symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Um, they usually last like, 10 or 15 minutes maybe? Sometimes I feel like a weird sensation or kind of dizzy before it actually happens, but not always. Things like resting or sitting down seem to help, but sometimes stress or quick head turns seem to make it worse.\\nDOCTOR: Could you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed over the past two years? For example, have they become more frequent, severe, or are you noticing any new symptoms like hearing changes, headaches, weakness, or visual difficulties?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think they\u2019ve kind of stayed about the same most of the time, but sometimes they do feel a little stronger? Like, I can\u2019t really write or do stuff properly during an attack more often than before, I guess. And I don\u2019t really remember anything new like hearing or headaches or anything, just the dizzy spells and that funny feeling in my head.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me about your daily routines or any recent changes in your life\u2014such as new medications, stress levels, sleep habits, or recent illnesses\u2014that might be related to when your symptoms occur or have changed?\\nPATIENT: Well, um, I guess my work has been pretty hectic lately\u2014lots of long shifts, and I think I\u2019ve been more stressed out. My sleep\u2019s been kind of patchy, sometimes I can\u2019t fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night. I haven\u2019t taken any new medicines or anything, but I\u2019ve noticed that when I\u2019m really tired or stressed, the spells seem worse or happen more often.\\nDOCTOR: 1. Do you notice any weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or visual changes (such as blurred vision or visual field deficits) during or after these episodes?  \n2. Have you experienced any episodes of double vision, ringing in the ears, or hearing disturbances?  \n3. Do you have any risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, or a history of cardiovascular disease?  \n4. Are there any other unassociated seizure-like events, such as involuntary movements, loss of awareness, or confusional states?  \n5. Have you ever undergone imaging studies of your brain or vascular imaging? If so, what were the results?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed weakness or numbness or trouble talking or seeing anything weird like blurred vision, but sometimes I do feel a bit out of sorts during the episodes, like I can\u2019t quite focus or coordinate properly. I haven't really had ringing or hearing issues, and I don\u2019t have any of those stroke risk factors that I know of \u2014 I don\u2019t smoke, and I try to eat healthy, but I do work a lot and stress a lot sometimes. I haven\u2019t had any seizures or anything that felt like a losing consciousness or confusion beyond the imbalance stuff. As for scans, I think I had a brain MRI done before, but I\u2019m not really sure what it showed, just that it was okay.\\nDOCTOR: Can you describe in detail which specific head positions or movements tend to trigger or worsen your episodes, and how long each episode typically lasts during these positional changes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it\u2019s usually when I move my head quickly or tilt it in certain ways, like looking up or to the side suddenly. Sometimes during those times, I get really dizzy and everything feels a bit off, and then the episodes last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but sometimes it\u2019s even shorter. I don\u2019t always know exactly what I was doing before it started, though.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if you experience any brief nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) during these episodes, particularly when you move your head?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, sometimes when I move my head or during these spells, my eyes kinda feel like they\u2019re twitching or bouncing, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean or if it\u2019s supposed to be like that.\\nDOCTOR: Do you notice any new weakness, difficulty speaking, visual changes, or other neurological symptoms during or after these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really had weakness or speech problems during it. Sometimes I feel kinda disoriented or like everything spins, but I haven\u2019t noticed anything sudden or really different after. It\u2019s mostly just that feeling of imbalance and nausea.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if your dizziness or imbalance is consistently triggered by specific head positions, such as looking up or to the side, and whether these episodes happen immediately upon changing position? Additionally, have you undergone any recent treatments or tried any maneuvers for these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I notice it more if I move my head a certain way, like looking up or to the side. It kind of happens right when I change position usually, but not always. I haven't really tried any special maneuvers or treatments myself, just... hoping it would just stop or be okay.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation provided detailed information about the nature of the episodes, including triggers, duration, associated phenomena like nystagmus, and relevant medical history. All new details are consistent with confirmed facts from earlier statements; no inconsistencies or unconfirmed details are introduced.  \nANSWER: The patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness, imbalance, difficulty focusing or writing, and nausea for about two years. Each episode lasts approximately 10 to 15 minutes, sometimes shorter. The patient feels a strange or dizzy sensation before episodes begin. These episodes are triggered or worsened by quick head movements or tilting the head suddenly, such as looking up or to the side. Resting or sitting down relieves symptoms. Stress and fatigue seem to make episodes more frequent or intense. During episodes, the patient sometimes experiences involuntary eye twitching or bouncing (nystagmus). No weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or visual changes occur during or after episodes. No hearing issues like ringing or dizziness. The patient has no known stroke risk factors, does not smoke, and maintains a healthy diet. No seizures, loss of consciousness, or confusion beyond imbalance are reported. A prior brain MRI was performed and reported as normal."
