As for the headaches, yeah, they do seem worse if I bend down or straining or something, I guess. It\u2019s all a bit hazy.\\nDOCTOR: Have you measured your blood pressure and heart rate at home or during clinic visits? If so, can you tell me if you've noticed significant drops in blood pressure, especially when standing up?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I haven't really checked my blood pressure myself at home, but yeah, I do sometimes feel dizzy when I stand up quickly, and my head feels funny, kinda heavy, I guess. I haven't noticed like a big drop or anything specific, I just feel different sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these symptoms tend to get worse when you bend over or strain, and do you experience any nausea or vomiting along with these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think maybe I feel a little worse or more dizzy when I bend down or do anything that puts pressure on my head? And sometimes I feel kind of sick, like I might throw up, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s because of the headaches or something else.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any episodes of nausea or vomiting along with your headaches, or any recent changes in your weight or mood that might suggest increased intracranial pressure or other underlying issues?\\nPATIENT: Well, I think I kind of felt a little sick to my stomach sometimes when the headaches come, but I can't really say for sure if I was actually throwing up or not. And I haven't really noticed any changes in my weight or anything, no.",

    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: I\u2019m 42, and I\u2019m a man. Lately, I\u2019ve been having these really bad headaches in the front of my head that just come and go, but they\u2019ve been worse over the last few weeks. I also feel dizzy sometimes, and I\u2019ve actually fainted a couple of times out of nowhere. My wife says I\u2019ve been acting a bit confused, especially in the mornings, and I just feel off in my head.\\nDOCTOR: \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately\u2014any changes in your memory, mood, sleep, or other symptoms that you've noticed?\"\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling more foggy in my head, like I don\u2019t really feel clear or sharp, especially in the mornings. Sometimes I feel kind of dizzy and weird, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve had a few times where I just kind of forget what I was doing or get confused for a bit. It\u2019s been worse recently.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have been affecting your daily life\u2014such as when they started, what seems to worsen or improve them, and if you\u2019ve noticed any other changes in your health or sensations?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, I guess it started about a month ago, and at first, it was just a dull headache kind of in my forehead, but now it\u2019s worse and more constant. The dizziness comes and goes, and I\u2019ve had those times where I feel confused, especially in the mornings\u2014like I wake up and it takes a while to think straight. Some days are better, and some are just uncomfortable all day. I don\u2019t really know if anything makes it better or worse, honestly. It\u2019s just been kind of turning my days upside down\u2014like I\u2019m not myself.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing, especially any patterns or triggers you've noticed, and how these symptoms are affecting your daily life?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling pretty off for a while now. The headaches kinda come and go, but they\u2019ve been getting worse, and they\u2019re mostly in the front part of my head. Sometimes, I feel dizzy, and a couple of times I\u2019ve just blacked out without warning, like I wasn\u2019t expecting it. It\u2019s making me scared to do even simple things because I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll feel okay or if I\u2019ll suddenly feel worse. I\u2019ve been feeling kinda slow or foggy in the mornings, too, like my brain is not working right.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any recent head injuries, falls, or trauma?\\nPATIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I don\u2019t remember hitting my head or falling or anything like that, but I've been feeling pretty off lately, so I\u2019m not really sure.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or difficulty with coordination? Do you experience headaches that worsen when you change position or strain?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed weakness or trouble speaking really, but my vision does get a bit fuzzy sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. As for the headaches, yeah, they do seem worse if I bend down or straining or something, I guess. It\u2019s all a bit hazy.\\nDOCTOR: Have you measured your blood pressure and heart rate at home or during clinic visits? If so, can you tell me if you've noticed significant drops in blood pressure, especially when standing up?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I haven't really checked my blood pressure myself at home, but yeah, I do sometimes feel dizzy when I stand up quickly, and my head feels funny, kinda heavy, I guess.

And I haven't really noticed any changes in my weight or anything, no.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, or problems with coordination or balance?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really noticed any weakness or problems with walking or balance, I think... but sometimes I do feel a bit off or shaky, especially when I get those dizzy spells.",
