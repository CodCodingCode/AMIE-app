She just, I dunno, started twitching or jerking sometimes, more than once, and she seems like she\u2019s not really herself. She looks kind of lost sometimes, and she doesn\u2019t really smile or laugh like other babies. Lately, she\u2019s been having those staring spells and other strange little movements, and I just feel like she\u2019s been worse, more tired or different than before.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me how your baby girl has been acting lately\u2014her feeding, sleep patterns, interactions with you or others, and any new or unusual behaviors you've noticed?\\nPATIENT: Well, she\u2019s been a bit more fussy when she eats, and she doesn\u2019t seem to smile or look at us like she used to. Sometimes she just stares off and turns her eyes away, and she doesn't sleep very well, waking up a lot. I feel like she\u2019s not quite herself lately, but I don\u2019t really know what to make of it.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your baby girl has been acting overall lately\u2014her feeding, sleep patterns, interactions, and if you've noticed any changes in her behavior or development compared to before?\\nPATIENT: Well, she's been, um, eating sometimes okay and other times not so much, like she\u2019s just not as interested in feeding, and she doesn't really smile or look at us the way she used to. She seems kind of sleepy or just not very active, and I\u2019ve noticed she\u2019s not really reaching any of her milestones like she should be. Sometimes she\u2019s just staring, and I don\u2019t know if that's normal or if I should be worried.\\nDOCTOR: Has your baby girl had any recent illnesses, fevers, or signs of infection? Were there any complications during pregnancy or delivery, such as birth trauma or perinatal hypoxia?\\nPATIENT: Um, she\u2019s been okay, I think? She didn\u2019t seem sick or anything, no fevers that I noticed. As for the pregnancy, I don\u2019t recall anything happening during labor, no injuries or oxygen issues that I know of. It all just... feels so confusing, and I worry about her a lot.\\nDOCTOR: Has your baby girl experienced any specific types of movements or seizures, such as stiffening, jerking, or cyclical movements? Also, were there any subtle signs around birth, like difficulty during feeding, abnormal muscle tone, or unrecognized hypoxia?\\nPATIENT: Well, she kinda just spasms sometimes, and her eyes kind of roll or stay weird for a little while. She\u2019s always been kinda floppy and didn\u2019t really latch well when she was born, but I didn\u2019t think much of it. It all just feels really confusing and a bit scary.\\nDOCTOR: Has there been any observed eye movements or behaviors during the staring spells, such as eye deviation, automatisms, or facial twitching?\\nPATIENT: Uh, sometimes her eyes kinda stare or drift to the side, and her face kinda twitch or make weird movements. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what she\u2019s doing during those times.\\nDOCTOR: Are these abnormal movements and staring spells occurring multiple times a day, and have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to bring them on?\\nPATIENT: Yes, they happen a lot, like several times every day. I haven\u2019t really noticed any clear reason or anything that makes them start. It just seems to happen randomly, and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new or worsening episodes of abnormal movements, changes in her alertness or responsiveness, or any new signs that concern you since our last discussion?\\nPATIENT: Um, yes, sometimes she seems a bit more spacey or just not herself. There are moments she doesn\u2019t respond like she usually does, and her movements can be kind of different\u2014like she\u2019s more stiff or maybe more jerky. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s better or worse, but I just feel like she\u2019s acting a little different sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent changes in her sleep patterns, feeding interest, or responsiveness that worry you or seem different from before?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, um, she seems to be sleeping a bit more during the day, and she\u2019s not as interested in eating as she used to be. Sometimes she just stares off and looks kinda out of it, not responsive like she was before. It\u2019s kinda scaring us because she\u2019s not acting like herself.",
