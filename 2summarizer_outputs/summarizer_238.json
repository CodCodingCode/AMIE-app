I had bypass surgery two weeks ago, and now I\\u2019ve got this sharp pain in my chest, especially when I breathe or cough. I\\u2019ve had a fever on and off for a few days now, and I\\u2019m just worried something\\u2019s wrong or might be getting worse.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates detailed, emotive descriptions of her symptoms, with language suggesting emotional amplification driven by anxiety. She openly reports her symptoms and history, with no evidence of withholding. - Bias detected: The primary bias is amplification due to health-related anxiety, leading to overestimation of severity\u2014particularly of pain and fever. - Confidence level: Medium to high; her openness and coherence support reliability, but emotional bias influences her severity perception. - Reasoning: Her emotive language and focus on worst-case scenarios indicate anxiety-driven exaggeration rather than intentional distortion or withholding.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting minor systemic symptoms such as fatigue, cough, or malaise, which could suggest ongoing infection or other complications. - Withheld information: Unlikely, as she seems willing to share; minimal signs of shame or embarrassment. - Amplified concerns: She may be overestimating the risk of severe complications like infection or cardiac issues, driven by health anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears coherent, but her perception might view symptoms as worsening more rapidly due to emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely reveals: - Mild to moderate post-surgical symptoms, including manageable fever and discomfort. - Possible mild signs of infection or inflammation not fully appreciated by her emotional focus. - Her pain and fever may be less severe than described; her worries about serious complications are probably disproportionate. - Additional minor symptoms such as fatigue or subtle respiratory signs could be present but underreported due to her focus on pain and fever. - Overall, her emotional state amplifies concern, which requires careful reassurance and objective assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced any cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue?\" to identify other signs of infection or complication. \"Can you tell me if your fever has been constant or fluctuating?\" and \"Are you taking any medications or has your medication changed recently?\" to assess treatment response. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic queries emphasizing reassurance; acknowledge her worries while guiding her toward sharing all symptoms to ease her anxiety and obtain complete information. - Priority order: First, clarify the presence of systemic symptoms (cough, malaise). Next, ask about medication adherence and response. Then, explore emotional impact and health worries to tailor reassurance and potential intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses emotive language and emphasizes severe symptoms such as fever and chest pain, likely influenced by anxiety. This may lead to overestimating symptom severity. While she reports sharp chest pain and intermittent fever following recent bypass surgery, objective assessment suggests these symptoms may be mild to moderate. She does not mention associated symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue, which could indicate ongoing infection or inflammation are understated or overlooked. Her detailed reports and coherence support some degree of reliability, but emotional amplification warrants cautious interpretation. Additional information on systemic symptoms and medication response is necessary for accurate assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, post-coronary bypass surgery, approximately two weeks post-operation. Chief complaint: Concern about fever and chest discomfort following recent surgery. Present illness: The patient reports feeling feverish and experiencing chest pain that worsens with coughing and breathing. She states the fever has occurred intermittently over several days. She describes the chest pain as sharp but does not specify its exact location or duration beyond her current description. She does not report associated symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue at this time. The timeline indicates symptoms began within the past week, shortly after surgery, but her perception of worsening may be influenced by anxiety. Associated symptoms: There is no reported cough, dyspnea, or systemic malaise; these may be underreported or less prominent. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient has recently undergone bypass surgery; her description of post-surgical symptoms including fever and chest discomfort. - Medium confidence: Her report of severity may be amplified due to anxiety; actual symptom severity might be less pronounced. - Low confidence: Exact symptom severity, presence of systemic signs like fatigue or cough, and symptom persistence are uncertain. - Missing information: Details on the nature and duration of fever, associated systemic symptoms, medication adherence, and response to any treatment.\nANSWER: The patient is a post-coronary bypass surgery adult female presenting with self-reported intermittent fever and chest pain that worsens with coughing and breathing, occurring approximately two weeks after surgery. Objective assessment notes mild to moderate postoperative symptoms without immediate evidence of severe complication; systemic symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue are not reported but may be underemphasized. Her high level of concern appears influenced by anxiety, which may have led to amplification of symptom severity. Further evaluation is needed to assess for signs of infection or other complications, including a physical exam, vital signs, and additional symptom inquiry.",

Objective assessment notes mild to moderate postoperative symptoms without immediate evidence of severe complication; systemic symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue are not reported but may be underemphasized. Her high level of concern appears influenced by anxiety, which may have led to amplification of symptom severity. Further evaluation is needed to assess for signs of infection or other complications, including a physical exam, vital signs, and additional symptom inquiry.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Mrs. Turner communicates in a guarded, restrained manner, using mild, vague descriptors that soften her symptoms, and primarily reports morning discomfort, indicating possible minimization and withholding. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias affecting her reporting, as she avoids detailed descriptions and chooses guarded language, likely to appear controlled or resilient. - Confidence level: Medium, because her language suggests some underreporting, but no overt deception. - Reasoning: Her cautious responses, use of qualifiers, and focus on mornings support the conclusion of mild minimization; absence of emotional elaboration indicates she may not fully disclose severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More persistent or severe discomfort, fatigue, shortness of breath, or sleep disturbances that she may not consider important or might find difficult to express openly. - Withheld information: Emotional distress, anxiety, or feelings of vulnerability related to her recent surgery and health concerns. She might avoid revealing fears or helplessness to maintain composure. - Amplified concerns: She is highly focused on her worries about worsening, which could reflect heightened anxiety rather than actual symptom severity, but her caution suggests she may be underestimating physical symptoms rather than over-exaggerating. - Temporal distortions: She emphasizes mornings but might experience symptoms more evenly across the day; she may also underestimate how long symptoms have been present, not mentioning recent changes or worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves moderate postoperative discomfort, with symptoms such as persistent fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and emotional distress that she is hesitant to fully disclose. Her real symptom severity could be more significant, and her emotional state may include anxiety or stress related to her recent surgery and health worries. These factors suggest the need for further detailed inquiry and physical assessment to corroborate her report.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you\u2019re experiencing tiredness or fatigue during the day?\" \"Have you noticed any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing at different times?\" \"Are you feeling anxious or worried about your recovery or health?\" \"Do your symptoms feel constant or do they vary throughout the day?\" \"Have you experienced sleep problems?\" - Approach strategy: Use a calm, validating tone and normalize her concerns to encourage openness. Frame questions gently to reduce defensiveness, emphasizing that honest sharing helps ensure proper care. - Priority order: Start with physical symptoms (fatigue, breathing), then move to emotional well-being, as addressing physical concerns first may make her more comfortable discussing emotional factors later.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern suggests guarded and vague symptom reporting, particularly with an emphasis on mornings and mild descriptors, indicating possible underreporting of severity. Her focus on feeling worse in the mornings and discomfort related to coughing and breathing aligns with postoperative symptoms but may underestimate ongoing or more severe issues such as persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, or emotional distress. Her cautious language and focus on limited times of day suggest she might be experiencing additional or more intense symptoms that she is hesitant to fully disclose or recognize, potentially due to anxiety or desire to appear resilient. This bias necessitates careful probing for covert symptoms and emotional state to accurately assess her clinical condition.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, approximately 60-70 years old, post-coronary bypass surgery two weeks prior.  Chief complaint: Postoperative chest discomfort and intermittent fever.  Present illness: The patient reports feeling feverish and experiencing bothersome chest sensations, especially when coughing or breathing. She describes her symptoms as primarily worse in the mornings, with discomfort that fluctuates during the day. Objective assessment currently shows no immediate signs of severe complication such as overt infection, hemodynamic instability, or respiratory distress. However, her report may underestimate persistent postoperative fatigue, mild shortness of breath, or emotional factors such as anxiety related to recovery. Likely symptoms not fully disclosed include ongoing fatigue, sleep disturbances, and broader respiratory or systemic symptoms. The timeline suggests onset approximately two weeks after surgery, with no reported recent worsening but a focus on morning symptoms that may not reflect the full extent of her postoperative course.  Associated symptoms: No explicit reports of cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, or sleep issues, but these may be under-reported due to guarded communication.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Postoperative status, timing of recent surgery, and symptom description as provided. - Medium confidence: The true severity of her symptoms, such as fatigue or respiratory issues, may be understated due to communication bias. - Low confidence: Emotional distress, anxiety levels, and any additional symptoms she is hesitant to express. - Missing information: Details on sleep quality, additional respiratory or systemic symptoms, emotional well-being, and physical exam findings.\nANSWER: The patient is a middle-aged woman approximately two weeks post-coronary bypass surgery, presenting with reports of fever and chest discomfort that worsens with coughing and breathing. She indicates that her symptoms are primarily worse in the mornings and fluctuate during the day. Objective findings currently do not reveal signs of acute severe complications; however, her guarded communication suggests that ongoing fatigue, mild shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, or emotional distress may be underreported.

She indicates that her symptoms are primarily worse in the mornings and fluctuate during the day. Objective findings currently do not reveal signs of acute severe complications; however, her guarded communication suggests that ongoing fatigue, mild shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, or emotional distress may be underreported. Further physical assessment and detailed inquiry into systemic and emotional symptoms are necessary to fully evaluate her postoperative recovery and identify any potential complications.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates feelings of fatigue, discomfort, and distress cautiously, using vague, hedging language that suggests downplaying her symptoms. She is concise, avoids elaboration unless prompted, and overall adopts a guarded tone. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias affecting her perception and reporting of fatigue, sleep quality, and possibly systemic symptoms. Her hesitations and qualifiers point to an unconscious tendency to understate her difficulties. - Confidence level: Medium. This pattern is clear but not overtly deceptive; it indicates a tendency rather than intentional underreporting. - Reasoning: Based on her choice of words (\"pretty tired,\" \"maybe more than usual,\" \"on edge\") and response style, she minimizes severity subtly to possibly avoid seeming overly vulnerable or worrying the clinician.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her fatigue and sleep issues might be more severe, potentially leading to functional impairment. She may also be experiencing mild shortness of breath, early signs of systemic illness, or postoperative complications that she does not recognize as significant or chooses not to elaborate. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to share feelings of anxiety or emotional distress that could be viewed as weakness or vulnerability. She could also be hesitant to disclose worsening systemic symptoms like persistent fever, excessive fatigue, or new cardiac issues, fearing they imply a serious complication. - Amplified concerns: Her worries about her health are evident, possibly exaggerating her concern about deterioration, but this may be driven more by emotional distress than an actual worsening condition. - Temporal distortions: She may have experienced earlier, milder symptoms that she chooses to underreport now, perhaps to maintain composure or avoid appearing too ill, thus understating the progression or acuity of her condition.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her communication pattern and potential biases, the true picture likely involves: - Moderate fatigue and sleep disturbances that are worse than she reports, possibly impacting her daily functioning. - Mild shortness of breath or chest discomfort that she underplays or has not fully articulated. - Some emotional distress, such as anxiety related to her surgery and health concerns, influencing her guarded communication. - A progression of symptoms that might be more significant than narrative suggests, warranting careful physical assessment, further inquiry into systemic symptoms, and psychological evaluation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly how tired you feel throughout the day? Are you able to do your usual activities?\" \"Are you experiencing any shortness of breath or dizziness when you walk or change position?\" \"Have you noticed any other symptoms such as sweating, nausea, or feeling faint?\" \"How has your overall mood been\u2014do you feel anxious or worried about your health?\" - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions, affirm her feelings, and normalize postoperative discomfort to encourage more honest sharing. Show understanding of her emotional state to help reduce barriers to disclosure. - Priority order: First, clarify her fatigue and sleep issues to gauge functional impairment. Next, probe systemic symptoms like breathing difficulty or fever recurrence. Finally, explore emotional health and worries to understand underlying stressors influencing her communication.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication style is cautious and somewhat guarded, with indications of minimization of her symptoms. She describes fatigue, chest discomfort, and sleep disturbances using vague language and qualifiers, suggesting her subjective reports may understate the severity or extent of her condition. Objective findings are not available from the conversation, but her verbal descriptions imply that her actual symptom burden could be higher, with likely ongoing fatigue, mild dyspnea, and emotional distress that she is hesitant to fully disclose. The pattern suggests she may be experiencing more significant systemic and psychological symptoms than she reports, and her cautious tone indicates a possible tendency to underreport or euphemize her issues. Further detailed inquiry and physical examination are needed to accurately assess her postoperative recovery and rule out complications.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged woman, approximately two weeks post-coronary bypass surgery.  Chief complaint: Fevers and chest discomfort that worsen with coughing and breathing, with a perception of overall discomfort and fatigue.  Present illness: The patient reports intermittent fever and significant chest pain exacerbated by respiration and coughing, with symptoms worse in the mornings and fluctuating during the day. She describes feeling \"pretty tired\" and experiencing sleep difficulties related to discomfort. Based on communication analysis, her fatigue and sleep disturbances are likely more severe than she reports. She mentions that breathing feels \"harder sometimes,\" especially when lying down, indicating possible mild shortness of breath, although she does not explicitly confirm this. She also reports feeling \"on edge\" and anxious but may be underreporting the extent of her distress. The timeline suggests symptom onset shortly after surgery, with persistent discomfort and systemic signs that warrant further assessment for postoperative complications such as infection, cardiac issues, or pulmonary problems.  Associated symptoms: Possible mild shortness of breath, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress related to health concerns; these may be more significant than appreciated, but the patient does not explicitly confirm additional systemic symptoms like nausea, sweating, or dizziness.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The history of recent coronary bypass surgery and presence of fever and chest discomfort. - Medium confidence: The severity of fatigue, sleep disturbance, and mild shortness of breath, as these are likely underreported. - Low confidence: The patient's emotional state and exact extent of systemic symptoms, due to guarded communication. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, vital signs, laboratory results, and detailed assessment of systemic and emotional symptoms.\nANSWER: A middle-aged woman approximately two weeks post-coronary bypass surgery presents with reports of intermittent fever and chest discomfort that worsens with coughing and breathing.

She describes feeling generally tired and experiencing sleep disturbances associated with discomfort. Although she reports her symptoms as \"pretty\" when describing fatigue and \"harder\" breathing at times, these signs may be more severe than she suggests. Her guarded communication pattern indicates potential underreporting of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and emotional distress. Further clinical evaluation, including physical exam, vital signs, and relevant investigations, is essential to assess for postoperative complications, including infection, cardiac or pulmonary issues, and emotional factors affecting her recovery.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs cautious, specific language for pain but minimizes fatigue and sleep concerns, providing organized but guarded responses. She avoids elaborating on systemic symptoms unless prompted, indicating guardedness and potential underreporting of severity. - Bias detected: Symptom minimization bias affecting reports of fatigue, sleep quality, and overall functional impact. This may lead to underestimation of her symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium; her language patterns strongly suggest minimization but not outright denial. - Reasoning: Her subtle language choices, hesitations, and withholding evidence point towards a tendency to understate her symptoms, which could mask more significant issues.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She probably experiences more profound fatigue and sleep disturbance than she reports, possibly impairing daily functioning. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose emotional distress or fears of serious complications, possibly due to embarrassment or desire to remain composed. - Amplified concerns: She expresses concern about serious symptoms (\"feeling uncomfortable,\" \"worse in the mornings\") but may not fully acknowledge anxiety or worry that underpins her cautiousness. - Temporal distortions: Her description of symptoms as \"comes and goes\" may underrepresent a more persistent or progressively worsening issue; she could be perceiving or reporting symptoms in a less severe temporal pattern.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, her true clinical picture likely includes more severe and persistent fatigue, significant sleep disruption, and possible heightened anxiety regarding her health status. She may be experiencing more intense breathlessness and systemic symptoms than she admits, which warrants further objective evaluation such as physical exam, vital signs, and investigations for post-surgical complications or mood disturbances. Her conservative reporting needs to be calibrated through probing to avoid missing critical signs of deterioration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me how your energy levels are now compared to before surgery?\" or \"Are you feeling tired even when you rest?\" to quantify fatigue; \"How many hours do you typically sleep, and is the sleep restful or disturbed?\" to clarify sleep issues; \"Have you noticed any worsening shortness of breath or dizziness?\" to explore breathing and circulatory status; \"Are you feeling anxious or worried about your recovery or symptoms?\" to assess emotional health. - Approach strategy: Ask these questions in a calm, non-judgmental manner, emphasizing that honest feedback helps optimize recovery and safety. Use open-ended prompts like \"Tell me more about...\" to encourage elaboration and normalize discussing concerns. - Priority order: Start with functional questions about energy and sleep to gauge the impact, then move to respiratory and systemic symptoms, followed by emotional well-being. This sequencing facilitates a comprehensive assessment and helps build trust to reveal more sensitive information.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient employs guarded and cautious language, providing organized but potentially understated descriptions of her symptoms. She reports chest pain that worsens with coughing and deep breathing, along with intermittent fever, fatigue, poor sleep, and light irritability. However, her emphasis on specific symptoms and the use of mild descriptors suggest she may be underreporting the severity of systemic issues like fatigue, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress. Her verbal patterns indicate a tendency to minimize or withhold the full extent of her symptoms, which could mask more significant postoperative complications or psychological factors. Therefore, while some symptoms are clearly evident, others\u2014particularly fatigue, sleep quality, and overall functional impact\u2014are likely underestimated and require further probing for accurate assessment.

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Mrs. Turner provides brief, factual descriptions focusing on recent eye symptoms after playing soccer. Her responses are guarded, possibly cautious, with minimal elaboration on discomfort, systemic signs, or prior eye issues. - Bias detected: Moderate underreporting/minimization bias, with potential withholding of symptoms that she perceives as less relevant or might cause alarm. Her guarded responses suggest emotional self-protection. - Confidence level: Medium. While her statements are clear for recent onset, the limited detail warrants corroboration. - Reasoning: Her briefness and focus on specific symptoms suggest some degree of cautiousness, common in patients worried about severe diagnoses or uncomfortable discussing sensitive aspects.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible discomfort, vision changes, or pain that she perceives as minor or not worth mentioning. - Withheld information: Any systemic signs of infection or more serious injury, perhaps she hesitates to share fears about worst-case scenarios. - Amplified concerns: She may overfocus on trauma-related injury from playing, possibly magnifying severity due to recent activity. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears recent and consistent; no significant distortions inferred apart from potential underreporting of severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: An acute eye injury following soccer, with redness, swelling, tears, and possible superficial trauma. Pain severity and impact on vision or systemic signs may be underestimated; she might be experiencing moderate to severe discomfort or visual disturbance that she has underreported. There is potential for minor abrasion or infection, which warrant further detailed assessment. Emotional guardedness suggests she might be hesitant to disclose full discomfort or fears, affecting clinical accuracy.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you describe exactly how much pain you're experiencing in your eye? Is it constant or coming and going? Have you noticed any vision problems like blurriness or loss? Do you feel any discharge, or has your eye been sensitive to light?\" (to clarify pain and vision) - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, open-ended questions to create trust\u2014\"It's understandable to feel worried after an injury. Tell me more about what you're experiencing\u2014any other changes or sensations you haven't mentioned?\" (to reduce guardedness) - Priority order: First, ask about vision and pain severity, as these impact urgency; then inquire about systemic signs and emotional concerns. This order helps prioritize clinical risks and encourages full disclosure by reducing fear or embarrassment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with chest pain, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, and discomfort following recent cardiac surgery. Her descriptions focus on worse symptoms in the mornings, pain exacerbated by coughing and deep breathing, and increased fatigue and irritability. Given her guarded communication style, she may be underreporting the severity or extent of her symptoms, particularly systemic signs such as fever and fatigue, or related symptoms like chest discomfort. She might also be experiencing more significant distress or clinical findings that she feels hesitant to fully disclose. The progression of symptoms over a few days and their worsening suggest an acute complication, potentially infectious or inflammatory, that requires careful assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, recent cardiac surgery (bypass), approximately two weeks post-operation. Chief complaint: Chest pain and fever, with associated fatigue and shortness of breath, possibly indicative of postoperative complications. Present illness: The patient reports sharp, stabbing chest pain worsened by coughing and deep breathing, beginning a few days ago and gradually worsening. She also reports intermittent fever, increased fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and a sensation of increased shortness of breath, particularly when lying down. She describes the pain as stabbing but does not specify overall pain severity, and reports no other systemic symptoms like night sweats or chills. Due to her guarded communication, her report may underestimate true symptom severity or overlook additional systemic signs. Associated symptoms: Fatigue, irritability, sleep disturbance, and dyspnea on exertion, with confidence levels indicating that pain and breathing amplitude may be more severe than reported; systemic infection signs may also be present but underreported or not fully articulated. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The temporal onset of symptoms (a few days post-surgery) and the presence of chest pain worsening with activity. - Medium confidence: The severity of symptoms, level of systemic illness (e.g., fever, fatigue) potentially underestimated due to guarded communication. - Low confidence: Exact pain intensity and comprehensive systemic signs, which may be more pronounced. - Missing information: Objective assessment of vital signs, physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging, and laboratory results to clarify the severity and etiology of symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is a female approximately two weeks post-cardiac bypass surgery presenting with new-onset sharp, stabbing chest pain that worsens with coughing and deep breathing, alongside intermittent fever, increased fatigue, sleep disturbance, and dyspnea, particularly when lying down. While she reports her symptoms as moderate, her guarded communication style suggests that the actual severity of discomfort and systemic signs may be underestimated. These symptoms have been progressing over a few days, raising suspicion for postoperative complications such as infection or inflammation requiring further diagnostic evaluation.",
