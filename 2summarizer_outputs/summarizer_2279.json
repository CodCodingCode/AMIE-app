She experienced delayed speech development and has always been somewhat slow to develop.

She exhibits increased unsteadiness and stiffness, and has trouble holding objects and sitting without help. She has been more easily frustrated or upset lately, and sometimes appears calmer than usual. Her symptoms are affecting her daily activities, with increased falls, unsteady gait, and difficulty performing age-appropriate tasks. She has undergone an MRI, which showed differences in brain appearance, specifically missing parts in the white matter, though the significance of these findings is unclear. There is no history of recent illnesses, injuries, seizures, vomiting, or lethargy. She has no known family history of neurological, genetic, or metabolic disorders."
