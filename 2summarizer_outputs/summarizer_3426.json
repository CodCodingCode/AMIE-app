Have you noticed any problems with bladder or bowel control?\\nPATIENT: I haven't really noticed any numbness or tingling, but sometimes my legs feel a bit weird, like they're out of place or tight, even when I haven't done much. Bowel or bladder stuff? Umm, not really sure, I guess I haven't paid close attention to that.\\nDOCTOR: Do you experience any weakness in your arms or hands, dizziness, problems with coordination, or any other neurological symptoms besides your gait issues?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, sometimes my arms feel like they\u2019re not really working right, and I\u2019ve had moments where I get kind of dizzy, especially if I move too fast or stand up too quick. I guess I just feel off sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure exactly what that means.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any changes in your vision, such as blurred vision, blind spots, or pain with eye movement?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? My vision mostly just feels normal and I haven\u2019t noticed anything weird like blurry spots or pain when I move my eyes. Sometimes I focus hard and it feels fuzzy, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision, such as blurring, double vision, or pain with eye movement?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? I haven\u2019t really noticed any special problems with my vision. Sometimes I do feel a bit like things aren\u2019t quite clear, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really happening or just in my head.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any periods where your symptoms suddenly get worse or where you experience new neurological problems, such as additional weakness or cognitive changes, that improve or fluctuate over time?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't really notice anything suddenly getting worse all at once. Sometimes it feels like my legs are even tighter or harder to move, but it doesn\u2019t really come and go in waves or anything. I guess sometimes I feel more tired or like I\u2019m stumbling more, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s new or just part of all this.\\nDOCTOR: Have your symptoms ever suddenly worsened or new neurological problems appeared for a period then improved, such as additional weakness, numbness, or vision changes, indicating episodes of relapse and remission?\\nPATIENT: No, I don't think so. It just seems to be slowly getting worse overall, but I haven't really had any times where everything suddenly felt different or better for a little while.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation mostly confirms and reiterates previously provided details; no new clinical facts are introduced. Therefore, the full vignette remains unchanged.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of symptom onset during his teenage years. He has worsening difficulty walking, with leg stiffness, heaviness, and tightness, leading to increased falls and fatigue, affecting daily activities and causing concern about disease progression. He reports no numbness, tingling, sensory changes, or bladder/bowel control issues. He sometimes feels his arms are not working properly and has experienced dizziness, especially when standing quickly or moving fast. His vision generally feels normal, with occasional sensations of fuzziness when focusing, but no significant visual disturbances like blurriness, double vision, or pain."
