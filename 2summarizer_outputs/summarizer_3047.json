    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: I\u2019m 35, and I\u2019m a woman. Well, I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of weaker in my legs for a long time, and I keep getting these weird cramps and tingling in my hands and feet. It\u2019s been hard to walk up stairs and everything, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m just worried because it\u2019s been happening more and more.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how these symptoms have been affecting your daily activities and if you've noticed any other changes or concerns?\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess it\u2019s gotten kind of harder to do some stuff like climbing stairs, and I feel more tired than I used to, especially in my legs. Sometimes my hands feel weird, like numb and tingly, and I worry about whether I\u2019ll lose more control or feeling in them. It\u2019s kind of scary because I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening, and I worry it might get worse or affect my work.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if you\u2019ve noticed any other changes in your vision, bladder or bowel habits, or if you\u2019ve experienced any episodes of dizziness or difficulty with coordination?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really notice anything with my vision or bladder stuff, and I haven\u2019t had any dizzy spells or really strange problems with walking or balancing, I think. It\u2019s just mainly the legs and hands that feel weird.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if you've noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to make your symptoms worse or better, or if you've experienced any new symptoms such as fatigue, muscle stiffness, or issues with coordination?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s anything that makes it worse or better. Sometimes, I guess, my legs feel more tired, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or just how it\u2019s been. I also feel a little wonky sometimes when I try to do things quickly, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all the time, and I haven\u2019t noticed anything really changing suddenly.\\nDOCTOR: Does she have any history of episodes of limb weakness or numbness that resolve partially or completely, or any episodes of unexplained fatigue or episodic worsening of symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Hmm, I can't really remember any times where my limbs suddenly got really weak and then got better. Sometimes I feel more tired than usual, but it kind of stays that way, and I haven't noticed anything that comes and goes suddenly.\\nDOCTOR: Has she noticed any additional symptoms such as fatigue, muscle stiffness, or episodic worsening of symptoms? Additionally, does she have any history of autoimmune diseases, recent infections, unexplained weight loss, or family history of neurological conditions?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of tired sometimes, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just because of everything else going on. I haven\u2019t noticed anything like muscle stiffness or really sudden changes. No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any weird infections or anything, and I haven\u2019t lost weight or anything like that. As for family, my aunt had similar issues, but no one else really.\\nDOCTOR: Has she noticed any periods of rapid worsening or fluctuating symptoms, or episodes involving muscle weakness that resolve partially? Also, does she have any history of frequent infections, vaccinations, or recent travel that might suggest an infectious or environmental cause?\\nPATIENT: No, I don't really remember any sudden drops or anything that comes and goes like that. My legs just kinda feel weaker over time, and I haven't had any recent infections or trips that I can think of.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new symptoms, such as increased weakness, numbness spreading to other areas, or any difficulty with balance or walking that has recently developed?\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess I feel like things are just a little more off than before. Sometimes, my feet feel sort of unsteady or like I might fall if I\u2019m not careful, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new. The numbness in my fingers and toes has been there for a while, but lately, I think it feels... different, like more noticeable.\\nDOCTOR: Has she experienced any episodes where her weakness or sensations suddenly worsened or improved, such as relapses or remissions, or has her symptoms been gradually worsening without clear episodes?\\nPATIENT: It's mostly been a slow, steady worsening for years, but sometimes I feel like it\u2019s a little worse or a little the same, not really sudden flips or anything.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any episodes where your weakness or numbness suddenly worsened or improved, such as relapses or remissions?\\nPATIENT: Um, not really... I mean, it\u2019s kind of been slowly getting worse for a long time, and I can\u2019t really remember any sudden changes, but sometimes the numbness feels a little different, like, more intense or less, I guess.",
