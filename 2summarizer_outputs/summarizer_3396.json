Sometimes he has trouble swallowing and breathes kinda funny, so I thought maybe we should check if he's okay.",
    "output": "THINKING: The current conversation introduces details about the patient's son experiencing weakness in his face and arms, fatigue with activity, difficulty swallowing, and abnormal breathing. These are new confirmed clinical features to be added to the ongoing vignette. There are no previous details about the patient's own health, so this passage primarily expands on the patient's concerns regarding his son's symptoms.\n\nANSWER: The patient's son has been feeling weak, especially in his face and arms, and gets tired easily during activities such as playing or eating. He sometimes has trouble swallowing and breathes abnormally."

Sometimes he just looks really tired and weak, especially after playing or eating, and then it seems worse.

He experiences fatigue that worsens with activity and improves temporarily with rest. His symptoms tend to fluctuate, being worse after exertion or when tired, and sometimes better after rest. He has no family history of similar neurological conditions and recently had a cold and recent vaccination, but no clear temporal relationship to symptom onset."
