I don\u2019t really notice if it\u2019s worse or better at certain times, and I can\u2019t remember if it hurts behind my eyes, really. It just kind of feels weird, like I can\u2019t see clearly, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s pain exactly.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation did not provide new confirmed clinical details beyond what was previously summarized.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 45-year-old man with a three-week history of headaches, mental fog, blurred vision, weakness on the right side, fatigue, and feeling strange; he reports episodes of visual disturbances such as blurriness or double vision, and weakness in his right arm. He has experienced some nausea or sick feeling but no seizures or loss of consciousness. He feels more \"out of it\" and has difficulty concentrating. The weakness and mental status feeling are somewhat worse but it's unclear if symptoms have changed recently; no new neurological symptoms such as difficulty speaking, facial drooping, or loss of coordination have been confirmed."
