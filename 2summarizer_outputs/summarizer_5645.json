    "output": "THINKING: The conversation confirmed the presence of a long-standing bump that is increasing in size and redness, with recent signs of warmth and soreness. The patient reports ongoing difficulty with walking, weakness, numbness, tingling, and heaviness in the legs, which have been worsening. She experiences urinary urgency and bowel issues, notably constipation. Her symptoms are aggravated by activity and improving somewhat with rest. No new systemic symptoms like fever or chills have been reported, though the skin over the lesion appears more red and warm sometimes, indicating possible local inflammation. These details expand on the past summary but do not introduce new, unconfirmed facts.\n\nANSWER: The patient has a bump on her back that has been present since childhood and has recently increased in size and become red, with the skin appearing more red and warm at times and feeling sore. She experiences difficulty walking, with her legs feeling heavy, tingly, or numb, leading to frequent tripping and difficulty maintaining balance. She reports weakness and abnormal sensations in her legs, including heaviness and numbness. She experiences episodes of bladder urgency and has ongoing bowel issues such as constipation. Her neurological symptoms tend to worsen after activity like running or playing, and may improve with rest.
