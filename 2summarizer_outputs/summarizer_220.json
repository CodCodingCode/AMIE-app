I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s gotten worse or better since then.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Are the redness and soreness on your buttocks only on one side, or do they affect both sides equally?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, I think it's kind of the same on both sides, but I haven't really paid attention to whether it's just one side or both. It's mostly around her bottom and between her legs. I didn't notice one side being worse than the other, but maybe I wasn't looking closely enough.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in the redness, soreness, or pain since it first started, such as it getting worse, better, or staying the same?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Well, she\\u2019s been fussier and crying when I change her, and I think the redness looks pretty much the same, maybe a little more irritated, but I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s gotten worse or better exactly.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Are the redness and soreness confined to the skin surface, or do they extend into any skin folds or creases around the diaper area, and are there any pustules, crusts, or cracks?\",\n  \"PATIENT: The redness and soreness are mostly on the surface of her skin, and I haven't seen any cracks or crusts or open sores, just a little bit of pimples here and there.

I don\\u2019t see any crusts or cracks or open sores, just a red, sore-looking area with a few small bumps. It seems to be spread out a bit, mainly around her diaper zone.
