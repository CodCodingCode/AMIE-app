Do they sometimes feel overwhelming or out of control?\"\n(Rationale: To gauge the true severity and possible catastrophizing.)\n\"Have you experienced episodes where you felt you couldn't breathe or feared losing control?\"\n(Rationale: To detect panic episodes that may be underreported.)\n- Approach strategy:\nUse empathetic, non-judgmental framing to encourage openness, emphasizing that it's common to minimize or feel embarrassed about anxiety. Reassure confidentiality and normalize these experiences to reduce shame. Frame questions gently to avoid confrontation, inviting the patient to elaborate honestly.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, explore functional impact and emotional experiences to understand how anxiety affects their life. Then, inquire about specific physical symptoms and panic episodes to uncover underlying severity.

Are they happening daily, multiple times a day, or less frequently?\" *This helps clarify actual frequency and severity.*\n- \"Have you noticed any additional physical symptoms during these episodes, like chest tightness, dizziness, or tingling?\" *To uncover potentially omitted physical signs.*\n- \"How do these feelings affect your daily activities or work? Are there things you avoid because of them?\" *To assess functional impairment.*\n- \"Do you ever experience these feelings when you're alone or only around others?\" *To differentiate social versus generalized anxiety.*\n- \"Have you experienced any thoughts or worries that you find really hard to control?\" *To explore underlying cognitive patterns and insight.*\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, emphasizing understanding and normalizing feelings.\n- Frame questions gently to reduce shame, e.g., \"Many people experience these kinds of feelings, and it can be tough to fully describe them. Would you feel comfortable sharing more details about what happens during those times?\"\n- Encouraging honest disclosure while reassuring confidentiality can reduce guarded responses.\n- Priority order:\n- First, clarify the frequency and impact on daily life to gauge functioning.\n- Second, delve into physical symptoms to assess for more severe panic or physiological components.\n- Third, ask about emotional thoughts and worries to understand the cognitive aspect and distress level.\nThis progression helps build trust, reduce defensiveness, and gather comprehensive data for accurate assessment.",

The patient\u2019s language suggests possible underreporting of severity and additional symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates using vague, hesitant language, with frequent qualifying phrases that serve to soften or minimize their symptoms. They avoid detailed elaboration on the severity, frequency, or impact, despite acknowledging some distress. Responses are concise and guarded, indicating discomfort or shame.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias is **minimization and guarded response bias**, which results in underreporting of symptom severity and functional impairment.\n- Confidence level: Medium. While consistent with their communication, their guardedness makes it difficult to determine the full extent of their symptoms purely from language. Further probing is needed for clarification.\n- Reasoning: The cautious language, qualifiers, and avoidance suggest a tendency to underplay their condition, possibly due to embarrassment or fear of stigma.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me if you've ever had physical symptoms that felt more intense than what you've described, such as chest pain, dizziness, or feelings of losing control?\" (to uncover possibly unacknowledged physical symptoms)\n- \"How often do these episodes affect your daily activities, like working or socializing, even if you don't mention them?\" (to assess functional impact)\n- \"Have you ever avoided certain places or situations entirely because of these feelings, even if you haven't said so?\" (to explore hidden avoidance behaviors)\n- \"Are there times when you feel worse but prefer not to tell anyone about?

I\\u2019m not sure.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is an adult presenting with a one-year history of episodic physical and emotional symptoms characterized by sensations of heat, sweating, and nervousness, predominantly triggered by social interactions such as being around new people or in group settings. The episodes are described as sudden with accompanying dizziness and fear of fainting, suggestive of panic or anxiety episodes. The patient reports avoiding social activities and public places, indicating significant functional impairment. Due to guarded communication and possible minimization, the true severity, frequency, and extent of physical symptoms may be underestimated and likely more severe than currently acknowledged. Additional assessment is necessary to clarify the full scope of symptoms and their impact.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates cautiously, using qualifiers and vagueness, indicating an attempt to minimize symptoms or discomfort. Hesitations and vague timelines resemble reluctance or shame about fully sharing their experiences, especially physical symptoms during episodes.\n- Bias detected: Predominant minimization bias, possibly compounded by social stigma or embarrassment regarding internal sensations.\n- Confidence level: Medium. The pattern of hedging and vague responses strongly suggest underreporting, but some details are still shared directly.\n- Reasoning: The patient's reliance on qualifiers and reluctant responses point toward a tendency to understate severity. They acknowledge distress but in a guarded manner, which suggests their actual symptom burden may be greater.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Can you tell me if you've experienced any physical sensations like chest tightness or a rapid heartbeat during these episodes? Sometimes, people don't mention symptoms they find embarrassing or frightening\u2014so it's okay if you felt these but didn't mention them.\" (Rationale: Directly addressing potential hidden symptoms without judgment encourages disclosure.)\n2. \"When you feel dizzy or like passing out, do you notice any other sensations like chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or tingling? These help understand how serious these episodes might be.\" (Rationale: Clarifies underlying autonomic responses.)\n3. \"Are there times when these feelings happen even when you're alone or resting, or do they only occur around people? Sometimes, people are more willing to share the full experience if asked in a gentle way.\" (Rationale: To assess if episodes are more frequent or severe outside social settings.)\n- Approach strategy: Employ empathetic, non-judgmental language, normalizing symptoms to reduce shame, and explicitly assure confidentiality to foster trust and openness.\n- Priority order: Begin with direct but caring questions about physical sensations during episodes, then move towards social versus non-social occurrence, and finally inquire about any additional or associated symptoms. This ensures initial disclosure is facilitated and lays groundwork for exploring more sensitive details later.",

Confidence in reported social triggers and feelings is moderate, whereas physical sensations during episodes could be more severe than described. Additional assessment is essential to evaluate autonomic symptoms and the impact of symptoms on functioning.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, hesitant terms, minimizing symptoms (\"not that bad,\" \"kind of scary\"), with emotional descriptors that suggest distress but also defensive guarding. Responses are brief and avoid detailed disclosure, especially regarding severity and full symptom spectrum.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is most prominent, evidenced by downplaying severity and hesitations, likely driven by embarrassment or fear of judgment. This bias diminishes the reliability of their report, hiding potentially more severe episodes such as fainting, chest discomfort, or panic.\n- Confidence level: Medium; language cues strongly suggest minimization and withholding but lack of detailed symptom description limits certainty.\n- Reasoning: The patient's tendency to avoid specifics, use of softening language, and emotional qualifiers all point toward active minimization and reluctance to fully reveal their condition, which affects clinical understanding.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Have you ever fainted or felt like you were going to pass out when you were alone or resting? If so, how often?\"\n*Rationale:* To clarify if more severe episodes occur outside social contexts and are hidden.\n2. \"Can you describe any physical sensations during these episodes, such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, or tingling?\"\n*Rationale:* To uncover autonomic symptoms that might be underreported.\n3. \"Are there times when you feel very panic or fear that you haven't mentioned\u2014perhaps when you're by yourself or in certain situations?\"\n*Rationale:* To explore unspoken panic or autonomic responses.\n4. \"How often do these episodes happen, and has their severity changed over the past year?\"\n*Rationale:* To establish a clearer timeline and frequency.\n- Approach strategy:\nUse empathetic, nonjudgmental language, validate their distress, and normalize the experience of anxiety or faintness to reduce shame. Gently encourage openness by framing questions around their safety and comfort.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, address episodes of fainting or passing out when alone, as these are critical autonomic symptoms potentially more severe than reported. Then, query about specific physical sensations and panic, to build a comprehensive symptom profile. This sequence minimizes defensiveness and maximizes accurate disclosure about severity.",
