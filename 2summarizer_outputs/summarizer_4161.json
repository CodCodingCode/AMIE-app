As for my hearing, the ringing is there a lot, and it's kind of annoying, but I don\u2019t know if my hearing loss is getting worse, or if I just feel a bit full or plugged in my ears sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any recent upper respiratory infections, ear infections, or other illnesses in the weeks before your symptoms started?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I haven\u2019t had a bad cold or anything like that, and my ears felt okay, like no pain or infection that I noticed. But maybe I could have overlooked something? It all kind of started after the dives, so I\u2019m not really sure.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent infections, such as a cold, flu, ear infection, or upper respiratory illness, in the weeks leading up to your symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I don\u2019t think I had any colds or flu or anything like that lately. I mean, maybe I felt a little stuffy sometimes, but I can\u2019t really say if it was an infection or just from diving or something.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if certain activities, foods, or stress levels seem to trigger or worsen your dizziness and other symptoms, and have you found anything that helps alleviate them?\\nPATIENT: Um, honestly, I don\u2019t really know if anything specific makes it worse, sort of just happens sometimes, especially when I\u2019m upset or tired. I haven\u2019t found anything that really helps, it\u2019s just there most of the time.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if specific head movements or changes in position, like rolling over in bed or looking up, tend to trigger or worsen your dizziness?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, sometimes when I turn over in bed or look up, it\u2019s like the room spins a little more or I feel\u3063less stable, like I might fall. It kind of comes on suddenly, and I don\u2019t really know exactly what makes it happen.",
