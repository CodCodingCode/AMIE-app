I\\u2019ve been having these panic attacks, and I can't seem to shake off this constant feeling of dread.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient prefers vague, mild language to describe distress, showing reluctance to fully detail the severity or scope of her symptoms. Her responses are scattered and anxiety-driven, indicating difficulty organizing her thoughts and possibly avoiding deeper disclosure. She minimizes her distress while signaling significant internal discomfort. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization and some withholding bias. She underplays symptom severity, avoids specifics, and may conceal full history to avoid shame or judgment. - Confidence level: Medium \u2014 my assessment is based on limited data but consistent communication cues suggest her reporting is biased toward minimization. - Reasoning: The vague language, early disclosure of distress, scattered responses, and reluctance to elaborate on past history all point toward her trying to self-protect by minimizing or withholding information.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing panic attacks that are more frequent or intense, physical symptoms like chest discomfort or dizziness, and functional impairment that she is not fully reporting. - Withheld information: Details about her full mental health history, previous episodes, family history, or substance use severity are likely under-discussed due to shame or fear of stigma. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about permanent damage and losing control seem exaggerated but may be based on her immediate anxiety levels rather than objective danger; her obsessive focus on damage suggests catastrophizing. - Temporal distortions: She might not clearly remember or choose to omit how long her symptoms have been worsening or their pattern over time, potentially minimizing chronicity or rapid escalation.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her communication biases, the true clinical picture probably involves more severe panic attacks with frequent episodes, significant physical anxiety symptoms, possible comorbid mood disturbances, and a history of substance use that she is hesitant to disclose fully. Her symptoms may have been escalating over weeks to months, with functional impairment and distress exceeding her verbal report. Her fears of damage and losing control are consistent with heightened anxiety and catastrophizing, which may intensify perceived severity beyond the actual clinical risk.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me how often you experience panic attacks and what symptoms you notice when they happen?\" (to quantify severity and physical symptoms) - \"Have you experienced similar feelings or episodes in the past?\" (to assess history) - \"How has your substance use changed recently? Do you think it's affecting your mood or anxiety?\" (to clarify cannabis impact) - \"How much do these symptoms interfere with your daily activities or sleep?\" (to evaluate functional impairment) - \"Are there other feelings or symptoms you've been avoiding mentioning?\" (to uncover potential hidden issues) - Approach strategy: Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone to encourage openness, normalize reporting distress, and validate feelings. Praise honesty and frame questions to reduce shame (\"Many people find it hard to talk about these things at first\") to promote disclosure. - Priority order: Start with concrete questions about symptom frequency and physical sensations to gather objective data, then explore history, substance use, and impact to build a comprehensive picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports experiencing panic attacks and a persistent feeling of dread, but her tendency to use vague, mild language and scattered responses suggest she may be minimizing the severity or frequency of her symptoms. Her immediate focus on distress and fears of damage or losing control likely reflect heightened anxiety and catastrophizing, potentially amplifying her perceived symptom severity. Conversely, she may be withholding detailed information about physical symptoms, past episodes, and functional impact due to shame or shame-related stigma. Her communication pattern indicates that her reported symptoms are probably underrepresenting the true clinical picture, which may include more frequent panic episodes, significant physical sensations such as chest discomfort or dizziness, and notable impairment of daily functioning. There is also a high likelihood that she is not fully disclosing her history of mental health issues or substance use. Additional probing into physical sensations, symptom frequency, history, and functional impairment is essential to attain a comprehensive assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Anxiety symptoms characterized by panic attacks and a pervasive feeling of dread, with an emphasis on self-reported distress which may be underestimating true severity.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing panic attacks accompanied by feelings of dread. She describes these episodes as recent but does not specify frequency or physical symptoms. She expresses concern about damage and losing control, indicative of heightened anxiety and catastrophizing. Her responses are scattered and non-specific, suggesting difficulty organizing thoughts and possible minimization of symptoms. The timeline and detailed history of past episodes, severity, or progression are not explicitly provided but are likely more significant than openly communicated. Physical symptoms such as dizziness, chest discomfort, or hyperventilation have not been detailed, but their presence is likely underestimated. The impact on daily functioning and sleep has not been clarified and likely exceeds the patient's initial report. Her communication style hints at possible withholding of information related to past episodes, full mental health history, or substance use.  Confidences: - High confidence: The patient reports experiencing panic attacks and feelings of dread. - Medium confidence: The severity, frequency, physical symptoms, and functional impairment are likely worse than reported, given communication biases. - Low confidence: Details regarding past episodes, mental health history, substance use, and specific physical symptoms are not provided and may be significantly underreported. - Missing information: Precise frequency of panic attacks, physical symptom details, history of episodes, impact on daily activities, substance use, and prior mental health treatment history.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient adopts a cautious, guarded communication style, using mild, minimization language and brief responses, indicating hesitance and possible shame or fear. She avoids full disclosure of her cannabis use and mental health history, and her description of symptoms is restrained. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias influences her reporting, leading her to understate the severity and possibly the persistence of her symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium; while her account provides valuable insight, it likely underrepresents the true severity of her condition, necessitating targeted follow-up questions. - Reasoning: Her language choices and response style strongly suggest she is deliberately or unconsciously downplaying her symptoms, which can hinder accurate assessment and appropriate treatment planning.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more intense panic attacks, autonomic symptoms (dizziness, sweating), or chronic anxiety that she perceives as less serious. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed or fearful about her cannabis consumption or recurrent mental health issues, leading to reluctance to disclose full details. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about going crazy or damaging her brain may be magnified by her anxiety, but are potentially disproportionate to actual risk. - Temporal distortions: Her report might understate the duration and worsening of symptoms; they could have been escalating over an extended period.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely indicates that: - Her panic attacks are more frequent and severe than described, possibly involving autonomic symptoms like dizziness or palpitations. - Her anxiety is persistent and impactful, potentially affecting her daily functioning. - Cannabis use might be substantial and contributing significantly to her symptoms, with her reluctance concealing extent and frequency. - Her fears about mental deterioration are driven by her anxious fears rather than current objective findings but warrant assessment. - Her history might include prior episodes of anxiety or mood issues that she is hesitant to share, affecting the full clinical picture.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how often you experience these panic attacks and what symptoms you notice besides chest tightness?\" \"How much and how often do you use cannabis?\" \"Have you had any previous mental health concerns or treatments?\" \"Have you noticed any changes in your daily activities or sleep?\"\u2014these aim to quantify symptoms and uncover hidden issues. - Approach strategy: Use a non-judgmental, empathetic tone, ensuring safety and confidentiality to reduce shame. Objectively reflect her feelings, prompting her to elaborate without feeling judged. - Priority order: First, clarify the severity and frequency of panic attacks and cannabis use to gauge current risk; next, explore history of mental health; finally, inquire about functional impact and other associated symptoms\u2014structured approach helps build trust and data completeness.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits a guarded and cautious communication style, using mild language and brief responses, which suggests possible minimization of symptoms and reluctance to disclose certain details, particularly regarding mental health and substance use. This communication pattern indicates that the actual severity and frequency of panic attacks and anxiety may be understated. The patient\u2019s mention of constant dread and panic sensations, especially after cannabis use, could mean more persistent and severe symptoms than described. There is a likelihood of additional autonomic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, palpitations) and functional impairment that she may not be fully reporting. Her fears about mental decline and her avoidance of detailed disclosure suggest possible underlying concerns about mental health or substance effects that require further inquiry. Overall, the clinical picture probably includes more severe and frequent panic and anxiety episodes, with significant contribution from cannabis use, which she might not be fully aware of or willing to acknowledge.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified, but likely an adolescent or young adult based on context. Chief complaint: Anxiety and panic attacks, potentially underreported in severity and frequency. Present illness: The patient reports feeling anxious with a persistent sense of dread, foggy cognition, and forgetfulness. She describes experiencing panic attacks characterized by chest tightness and difficulty breathing, particularly after cannabis use. She characterizes these symptoms as constant but is uncertain about their seriousness, indicating possible underestimation. Timeline suggests ongoing symptoms, possibly worsened or sustained over recent weeks. Associated symptoms: Anxiety, cognitive disturbances (such as forgetfulness and foggy thinking); autonomic symptoms (chest tightness, labored breathing) are likely present but may be underreported. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: Anxiety symptoms, presence of panic episodes (although severity may be underestimated). - Medium confidence: The extent of cannabis use and its relation to symptoms (likely substantial but undisclosed). - Low confidence: Exact severity, duration, and impact of symptoms, due to guarded reporting and minimization. - Missing information: Frequency and severity of panic attacks, details of substance use, prior mental health history, functional impact, and other autonomic or physical symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms characterized by a sense of dread and cognitive difficulties, alongside episodic panic attacks involving chest tightness and breathing difficulties, which are particularly associated with cannabis use. While the patient describes the symptoms as constant but mild, communication suggests that the true severity and frequency may be greater. There is an indication of ongoing anxiety that could be impacting daily functioning, with the possibility of additional autonomic or mood symptoms that are not fully disclosed. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate the full extent of her symptoms, substance use, and mental health history.",

While the patient describes the symptoms as constant but mild, communication suggests that the true severity and frequency may be greater. There is an indication of ongoing anxiety that could be impacting daily functioning, with the possibility of additional autonomic or mood symptoms that are not fully disclosed. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate the full extent of her symptoms, substance use, and mental health history.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates using vague, tentative language (\"kind of,\" \"off and on,\" \"probably\"), indicating she may be minimizing her symptoms. She acknowledges distress but couches it in uncertainty, suggesting reluctance to fully disclose severity or impact. - Bias detected: Minization bias. Evidence includes her use of non-specific language, tentative timelines, and the tendency to attribute symptoms to external causes like marijuana. - Confidence level: Medium. While clear signs of minimization are present, some detail is provided that helps form a partial picture. - Reasoning: Her hedging language and ambiguity suggest she might be underreporting the true severity and frequency of her symptoms, possibly out of shame, fear, or lack of insight.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More frequent panic attacks, autonomic symptoms, and functional impairment may be more severe than she admits, as her tentative descriptions suggest she is downplaying the problem. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment about substance use or mental health issues, leading her to soften or hide the extent of her distress. - Amplified concerns: She may be exaggerating her degree of uncertainty or normalizing her symptoms as \"not that bad,\" when they could be quite impairing. - Temporal distortions: Her vague timeline (\"off and on for a while,\" \"probably about a week\") may understate the duration and persistence of symptoms, potentially minimizing chronicity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, her actual clinical presentation likely involves persistent, possibly progressive anxiety with frequent panic attacks, autonomic and cognitive symptoms impairing her daily functioning. She may underreport severity due to minimization, but underlying distress is significant. The connection with cannabis might be a trigger or exacerbant but not the sole cause. She probably has underlying generalized anxiety disorder, with possible comorbid mood or substance use issues, with symptoms more pervasive and disruptive than indicated.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how many times a week you experience panic attacks? How long do they typically last? Do they happen even when you're not using cannabis?\" \"Have you noticed any other physical symptoms \u2014 dizziness, sweating, chest pain \u2014 during these episodes?\" \"How is your anxiety affecting your daily work, relationships, or sleep?\" \"Are you worried about your mental health or substance use, or would you feel comfortable sharing more about these?\" - Approach strategy: Use a calm, validating tone emphasizing confidentiality and support, encouraging honesty by normalizing trying to manage anxiety. Avoid judgment or leading questions to reduce defensiveness. - Priority order: First, clarify the frequency, severity, and functional impact of panic attacks; then explore broader anxiety symptoms and substance use patterns; finally, assess mood, sleep, and psychosocial stressors to obtain a fuller picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's tentative and vague language suggests she is likely minimizing the severity and frequency of her symptoms. She admits to feeling anxious and experiencing fogginess, but refers to these as \"off and on\" and \"probably\" about a week ago, indicating possible underreporting of ongoing or more severe symptoms. She attributes her panic episodes and increased anxiety to marijuana use, which may be an externalized explanation rather than the full picture. Automatic autonomic symptoms like chest tightness and difficulty breathing are described in relation to panic attacks, but without detailed severity or duration, which could underestimate their impact. Communication hints at possible withholding of information regarding the full extent of her distress, functional impairment, or additional symptoms such as dizziness or autonomic responses. Given her hedging, her actual symptom burden may be more persistent and impairing than she currently communicates, and underlying anxiety without substance trigger attribution remains likely. Additional inquiry is needed to clarify frequency, severity, and impact of symptoms, as well as substance use patterns.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: [unspecified in conversation, likely young adult].  Chief complaint: Subjective feelings of anxiety, cognitive fogginess, and episodes of panic with chest tightness and breathing difficulty, which she perceives to be related to recent increased marijuana use.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing episodic panic attacks characterized by chest tightness and dyspnea, especially following marijuana consumption. She describes recent feelings of persistent anxiety and cognitive impairment starting approximately one week ago, with a history of intermittent related symptoms beforehand. She states that her symptoms have worsened with increased marijuana use but frames the timeline as tentative and uncertain, implying the symptoms may be more chronic and severe than acknowledged. She uses tentative language that suggests possible underestimation of the frequency and intensity of her symptoms. Additional symptoms such as autonomic responses (dizziness, sweating) are likely present but not fully disclosed. Her reported symptoms suggest underlying anxiety, potentially generalized anxiety disorder, possibly exacerbated by substance use.  Associated symptoms: Likely autonomic symptoms including lightheadedness or dizziness during panic episodes; mood symptoms such as feelings of dread; cognitive difficulties like forgetfulness\u2014though the latter may be underreported.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient is experiencing episodic panic attacks involving chest tightness and breathing difficulties, and recent onset of anxiety symptoms. - Medium confidence: The recent increase in symptoms correlating with marijuana use, with possible ongoing autonomic and mood symptoms, but the full extent is probably underestimated. - Low confidence: The actual severity, frequency, and impact on daily functioning, due to hedging language and possible underreporting. - Missing information: Precise frequency, duration, and severity of panic attacks; detailed substance use history; impact on daily activities; additional autonomic or mood symptoms; past psychiatric history.\nANSWER: The patient is a young adult presenting with subjective reports of increased anxiety, cognitive fog, and episodic panic attacks characterized by chest tightness and breathing difficulties, particularly following increased marijuana use. She reports the onset of these symptoms approximately one week ago, with a history of intermittent similar experiences, though she describes them as \"off and on.\" Communication suggests she may be minimizing the severity and frequency of her symptoms, which could be more persistent and impairing than indicated. Autonomic symptoms such as dizziness or sweating during episodes are suspected but not explicitly disclosed. The overall clinical picture points toward an underlying anxiety disorder, possibly generalized anxiety disorder, with episodes of panic that are likely more frequent and impactful than her tentative reporting suggests.

LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing panic attacks more frequently (daily), with more intense physical symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, or chest pain that she isn't fully conveying. - Withheld information: She might feel embarrassed or ashamed of her cannabis use and its role in her symptoms, thus not fully elaborating on her substance intake or its correlation with her panic episodes. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about permanent brain damage or going \"crazy\" appear to be exaggerated worries rooted in anxiety, possibly amplified by her desire to find reassurance or avoid judgment. - Temporal distortions: The current escalation might have started earlier than one week ago, and her \"off and on\" pattern could be more persistent, but she minimizes the timeline to feel less alarming.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes: - Frequent panic attacks (possibly daily or multiple times per day) with physical symptoms such as chest tightness, dizziness, breathlessness, and possibly sweating\u2014more severe than reported. - Cannabis use pattern that is greater than she admits, likely contributing significantly to the onset and severity of her symptoms, possibly involving dependence or guilt. - Anxiety symptoms that are pervasive, with a core of generalized anxiety that exacerbates panic episodes. - Functional impairment affecting her sleep, work, and daily activities, probably more than she is reporting. - Underlying distress that is masked by shame and guardedness, contributing to minimization and uncertainty about severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how many times a day or week you experience these panic episodes, including all physical symptoms you notice?\" (to quantify severity) - \"How much do you typically smoke weed each day, and has your use increased recently?\" (to clarify substance role) - \"Are you experiencing any other physical symptoms during these episodes, such as sweating, dizziness, or chest pain?\" (to gather comprehensive symptom profile) - \"How is this affecting your daily life\u2014your work, sleep, relationships?\" (to assess functional impact) - \"Have you noticed any other changes in your mood or thinking besides anxiety?\" (to explore broader mental health impact) - Approach strategy: - Use empathic, nonjudgmental language to reduce shame (\"Many people find that substances affect them differently over time; tell me more about your experience.\") - Frame questions gently to encourage full disclosure (\"Sometimes people notice a lot happening and find it hard to describe everything at once; let's take it step-by-step.\") - Priority order: - First, clarify the frequency and physical symptoms of panic episodes to establish severity. - Second, explore substance use patterns to understand its influence. - Third, assess functional impairment to gauge impact on daily life. - Fourth, probe for additional symptoms to rule out comorbidities and obtain a comprehensive picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication patterns indicate guardedness, use of vague language, and hedging, suggesting potential minimization of symptom severity and frequency. She reports episodic panic attacks and feelings of anxiety, fogginess, and chest tightness, particularly after increased marijuana use. However, she appears to downplay how often episodes occur, possibly suggesting more frequent panic attacks (potentially daily or multiple times per day) rather than a few times per week. She may also be underreporting physical symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, or chest pain, which are common during panic episodes. Her concern about serious outcomes, despite minimizing current symptoms, indicates underlying anxiety that might be more severe and persistent than she admits. Her substance use might be more extensive than disclosed, contributing significantly to her symptoms. Overall, while she reports anxiety and panic symptoms affecting her daily activities, the true severity and frequency are likely underestimated due to her guarded reporting. Further assessment of her actual panic frequency, physical symptoms, and substance use is necessary for a complete clinical understanding.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Young adult, gender unspecified.

She reports that these episodes interfere with her work, sleep, and daily functioning. Her description likely underestimates the true intensity and frequency of symptoms due to emotional discomfort, shame, and minimization tendencies, with potential withholding of details about substance use and physical symptoms.

She describes physical symptoms but downplays their impact, using vague terms and hesitations that suggest reticence or embarrassment. - Bias detected: The primary bias is minimization, evidenced by her softening language (\"maybe,\" \"a little\"), vague frequency descriptions, and reluctance to admit how problematic her episodes are. - Confidence level: Medium; her expressions of worry and physical distress indicate genuine discomfort, but her hesitance suggests she may not fully acknowledge or recognize the true severity. - Reasoning: The communication patterns\u2014soft qualifiers, hedging responses, and emotional disclosures coupled with downplaying language\u2014point strongly toward underestimating her symptoms and impairment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She is likely experiencing more frequent and intense panic episodes involving physical distress than she admits, possibly daily or more, impacting her quality of life. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose the full extent of her functional impairment, such as missed work, exhaustion, or emotional difficulties. Embarrassment or fear of judgment about her physical reactions may also inhibit full disclosure. - Amplified concerns: While she worries about losing control or damaging her mind, these fears might be exaggerated due to anxiety magnification rather than objective severity, but this concern warrants clinical attention. - Temporal distortions: The onset may be earlier or longer-lasting than claimed, and her perception of triggering factors may be incomplete or inaccurate, meaning her anxiety pattern could be more chronic.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on Chain of Thought analysis, her anxiety and panic episodes are likely more frequent\u2014possibly daily\u2014and involve significant physical and functional impairment. She probably underreports the severity and impact due to emotional discomfort and minimization. The episodes may have started earlier than the past week she reports and might be more persistent. Her fears about mental decline are likely heightened but partially exaggerated by anxiety. Her physical symptoms are probably more intense and disruptive than she indicates.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you experience these episodes daily or multiple times a day? How long do they typically last? Do they sometimes prevent you from doing your daily activities or working? Are there physical symptoms like feeling faint, chest tightness, or sweating that worry you?\" (to clarify frequency and physical impact) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language, normalize her experiences (\"Many people feel anxious or have physical sensations sometimes\"), and emphasize confidentiality to reduce embarrassment. - Priority order: First, determine true episode frequency and severity; second, explore functional impact; third, ask about emotional responses and fears related to her symptoms\u2014these areas are crucial to understand the full scope and tailor effective intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes experiencing frequent episodes of anxiety characterized by physical symptoms such as chest tightness, dizziness, and sweating. However, the patient employs cautious and downplaying language, indicating possible minimization of severity and frequency. Communication patterns suggest that the actual symptom burden may be more intense and more disruptive than reported. The patient also mentions that the episodes seem to come \"out of nowhere\" and are triggered seemingly by stress or substance use, but may be less aware or less willing to disclose full details, leading to underestimation of the true frequency and impact. Given these cues, it is likely that her panic episodes occur more often\u2014potentially daily\u2014and are more severe than acknowledged, with significant functional impairment. She may also be concealing emotional distress or exhaustion related to her symptoms. More detailed inquiry is needed to accurately assess severity, duration, specific physical symptoms, and functional impact.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified, age and gender unknown.  Chief complaint: Recurrent episodes of anxiety and panic characterized by physical symptoms.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing anxiety and foggy cognitive states, with episodes marked by chest tightness, dizziness, sweating, and shortness of breath. She reports these episodes occurring a few times a week, sometimes multiple times per day, but minimizes their severity and impact during reporting. She perceives the episodes as largely coming out of the blue and associates them with stress or substance use, particularly cannabis. The timeline suggests a recent increase in frequency, but communication patterns imply that episodes may have been ongoing longer and more persistent, with greater severity and impairment than acknowledged.  Associated symptoms: Possible emotional distress, difficulty sleeping, and work-related stress, though these are not explicitly detailed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Physical symptoms such as chest tightness, dizziness, sweating, and their episodic occurrence. - Medium confidence: Frequency of episodes\u2014likely more frequent than patient reports\u2014and their impact on daily life due to communication biases. - Low confidence: Exact duration, triggers, and full extent of functional impairment; patient may be withholding or minimizing information. - Missing information: Precise episode frequency, duration, severity, impact on daily activities, emotional state, and history prior to the past week.\nANSWER: The patient presents with symptoms consistent with recurrent panic episodes, including chest tightness, dizziness, sweating, and shortness of breath. While reports indicate these episodes occur several times weekly, possibly multiple times daily, communication patterns suggest the severity, frequency, and functional impact may be underreported. The episodes are described as unpredictable and sometimes associated with stress or cannabis use. Further assessment is necessary to clarify true episode frequency, duration, physical and emotional impact, and to evaluate the need for targeted intervention.",
