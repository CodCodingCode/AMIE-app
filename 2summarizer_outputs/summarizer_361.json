That\\u2019s when I first started feeling sick. Now I have a fever and a pounding headache, and I just feel so exhausted all the time.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional intensity, emphasizing severity and distress through vivid language. She provides detailed symptom descriptions and connects recent activity directly to her health status, showing openness. - Bias detected: Amplification bias, as her emotional distress leads her to overstate symptom severity and urgency. - Confidence level: Medium; her honesty is evident, but emotional overlay likely inflates perceived severity. - Reasoning: Her use of emotional descriptors, detailed timeline, and eagerness to share suggest her perception is influenced by anxiety, which tends to magnify her symptoms rather than diminish them.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting less severe or less emotionally salient symptoms like localized swelling, rash, or systemic signs such as neck stiffness, which she might not mention because they seem less urgent. - Withheld information: She could be hesitant to discuss emotional distress, fears about diagnosis, or family implications; social or cultural factors may also inhibit full disclosure. - Amplified concerns: She appears to overemphasize her symptoms and worries about severe infection, possibly exaggerating her risk perception due to anxiety. - Temporal distortions: She might perceive her symptoms as worse or worsening more rapidly than they actually are, driven by distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would recognize she has experienced symptoms consistent with a viral illness\u2014weakness, headache, fever, exhaustion\u2014developing over the past several days, temporally linked to contact with monkeys, but her perception is significantly affected by anxiety, leading to exaggerated severity. Likely, some physical signs such as lymphadenopathy, rash, or other systemic features may be present but are not reported, possibly because she is overwhelmed or perceives them as less salient. Her emotional state colors her reporting, but she does have genuine symptoms warranting evaluation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Are you experiencing any rash, swelling, or other skin changes?\" (to identify physical signs of infection), \"Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed day by day?\" (to clarify progression), \"How are you coping emotionally with these worries?\" (to address anxiety), \"Have you noticed any neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, or other neurological symptoms?\" (to rule out serious infections). These targeted questions can help uncover clinically significant signs and emotional factors. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental questioning, validating her distress while gently guiding her toward concrete descriptions of physical findings; acknowledge her fears but encourage factual reporting. - Priority order: First, verify physical signs (rash, swelling, neurological symptoms), then explore the timeline and severity of symptoms, followed by emotional assessment. This systematic approach ensures critical clinical data are obtained and her anxiety is addressed compassionately.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s emotional intensity and anxiety-related language suggest her perception of symptom severity may be exaggerated, which could lead to overestimating the urgency and severity of her illness. She reports symptoms such as weakness, headache, fever, and exhaustion, with a recent onset after contact with monkeys, indicating possible concern for zoonotic infections. However, her focus on distress may cause her to underreport or overlook other physical signs such as rash, lymphadenopathy, or neurological symptoms that could be clinically significant. Her communication pattern indicates she may be minimizing less salient symptoms or withholding specific symptoms due to distress or fear. Objective findings are not available from the initial conversation, so physical signs need to be evaluated directly. Further probing is necessary to identify any rash, swelling, neurological changes, or other systemic signs, and to understand the progression of symptoms. Emotional factors should be addressed, but information gathered should prioritize physical examination to clarify her clinical status.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unknown). Chief complaint: Fever, headache, weakness, and exhaustion following recent contact with monkeys. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing fever, headache, weakness, and fatigue over the past several days, with symptoms beginning approximately after visiting a wildlife sanctuary where she was in contact with monkeys. She describes her symptoms using emotional language but may overstate their severity due to anxiety. Physical signs such as rash, lymphadenopathy, swelling, or neurological symptoms have not been reported and require clinical examination to assess objectively. Her symptom timeline suggests a recent onset with progressive worsening, but her perception of severity may be inflated by psychological distress. She may be underreporting or withholding other physical symptoms like skin changes, neck stiffness, or neurological signs that could inform diagnosis. Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms mentioned; neurological or dermatological signs need to be systematically evaluated. Laboratory and physical examination are necessary for further assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s symptoms include fever, headache, weakness, and fatigue, with a recent onset linked to zoonotic exposure. - Medium confidence: The severity of symptoms as described is likely exaggerated; actual physical findings are unknown without examination. - Low confidence: Exact physical signs, laboratory results, and neurological findings cannot be confirmed from the conversation alone. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, lab tests, and detailed symptom progression are needed to refine diagnosis and severity assessment.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, hesitant, and emotionally tinged language to describe her visual symptoms, indicating discomfort with precise reporting and possible emotional amplification. She presents a scattered narrative with emotional overlays, showing anxiety influencing her descriptions. - Bias detected: The primary bias is a combination of anxiety-driven amplification (exaggeration of worries and emotional concerns about her vision) and some minimization (vague descriptions that downplay the severity). She also exhibits hesitation that suggests possible withholding or difficulty articulating details. - Confidence level: Medium. While her emotional distress influences her reporting, she provides some descriptive cues that can be interpreted cautiously, but her perception of severity may be distorted. - Reasoning: The pattern of vague language, emotional worry, and scattered responses point toward emotional bias influencing her account. The possibility exists that her true underlying pathology is more serious than her words indicate.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting the severity of her visual deficits, systemic symptoms like fever, weakness, or neurological signs, to avoid alarming herself or the clinician. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or afraid to fully disclose the extent of her visual and systemic symptoms, perhaps fearing diagnosis or treatment implications. - Amplified concerns: Her worries about her vision and health could be exaggerating her perception of symptom severity, especially with visual disturbances being emotionally salient. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of symptom onset and progression may be more acute or more insidious than she reports, influenced by anxiety and emotional reactions.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased picture likely involves significant visual disturbances\u2014possibly more persistent flashes, double vision, or visual field deficits\u2014and systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, or weakness, which she may be minimizing or unaware of. The progression could be more rapid or severe than indicated, with her emotional state amplifying her concerns. Her visual impairment may be linked to underlying neurological or infectious processes requiring urgent evaluation, but her current communication conceals the full extent of severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you describe exactly how your vision changes throughout the day? Are you experiencing any other symptoms like weakness, numbness, or dizziness? Do you have a fever, neck stiffness, or new headaches?\" (to clarify systemic signs) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental inquiry that reassures her about the importance of all symptoms, emphasizing that honest sharing helps with accurate diagnosis. - Priority order: First focus on systemic symptoms and objective visual changes, then explore emotional concerns and how her symptoms impact daily life. This helps gather objective data while reducing anxiety and avoiding defensive responses.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional distress, hesitations, and vague descriptions, indicating a potential exaggeration of symptoms and anxiety-driven amplification. She reports systemic symptoms such as weakness, headache, fever, and visual disturbances that likely reflect more severe and possibly faster progression than she conveys. There is a possibility of underreporting certain visual deficits or systemic signs due to discomfort or fear, which may mask the true severity. Her narrative suggests systemic illness potentially linked to her recent animal contact, possibly infectious or neurological in nature, but the true extent of symptoms needs clarification through targeted questions.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified; presumed adult based on communication style. Chief complaint: Visual disturbances with systemic symptoms, including dizziness, weakness, headache, and fever, possibly more severe than described. Present illness: The patient reports a recent onset of visual symptoms characterized by fuzziness, seeing flashes and spots, and occasional double vision. She states these began after contact with monkeys at a wildlife sanctuary. She also reports systemic symptoms\u2014fever, profound fatigue, weakness, and headache\u2014with an escalation over time. She describes visual symptoms as bothersome and worsening but uses uncertain language, indicating possible emotional amplification. The timeline suggests symptom onset approximately one month prior, with progression, but exact timing and severity are uncertain due to hesitations and emotional overlays. There may be additional symptoms such as neck stiffness or neurological deficits that she is not fully disclosing. Associated symptoms: Fever, headache, fatigue, possible visual disturbance, with moderate confidence that symptoms are more persistent and severe than described; other neurological signs are not confirmed but should be queried.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports visual disturbances (fuzziness, flashes, spots, double vision) and systemic symptoms (fever, headache, fatigue). - Medium confidence: The severity and exact progression of visual and systemic symptoms may be exaggerated or distorted by emotional distress. - Low confidence: Details regarding the progression, severity, and full scope of neurological or systemic involvement due to hesitations and possible withholding. - Missing information: Precise onset and progression timeline, additional neurological signs, presence of neck stiffness, other systemic features, and measures of symptom severity.\nANSWER: The patient presents with a history of visual disturbances, including fuzzy vision, visual flashes, spots, and intermittent double vision, beginning after contact with monkeys at a wildlife sanctuary approximately one month prior. She reports associated systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, which appear to be worsening. However, her communication reflects emotional distress and hesitations, suggesting that her symptoms may be more severe and persistent than she describes. Objective assessment should include detailed inquiry about the progression, intensity of visual changes, presence of neurological signs, and other systemic features.

She reports associated systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, which appear to be worsening. However, her communication reflects emotional distress and hesitations, suggesting that her symptoms may be more severe and persistent than she describes. Objective assessment should include detailed inquiry about the progression, intensity of visual changes, presence of neurological signs, and other systemic features. Further examination and diagnostic testing are necessary to establish the underlying cause, which may include infectious, neurological, or inflammatory processes requiring urgent evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient expresses her visual and systemic symptoms with qualifiers and hesitations. Her language reflects anxiety and concern, often emphasizing unpredictability. She elaborates but softens or vague about specifics. - Bias detected: Emotional distress bias, leading to over-interpretation of symptom severity and uncertainty, combined with some minimization. Her anxiety magnifies her perception of unpredictability and danger. - Confidence level: Medium, as her descriptions are consistent but clearly influenced by emotional factors, making her subjective perception somewhat distorted. - Reasoning: Her hesitations, qualifiers, and hyper-focus on unpredictability suggest emotional bias affecting her subjective report despite actual symptoms being likely real.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be experiencing more significant neurological impairment, such as persistent double vision, visual field defects, or other neurological deficits that she downplays or neglects to mention due to fear or anxiety. - Withheld information: She could be hesitant to disclose severe systemic features like persistent high fever, neck stiffness, or altered mental status\u2014important for ruling out serious infections\u2014possibly fearing diagnosis or judgment. - Amplified concerns: She is likely magnifying her fears of severe neurological or infectious disease due to her anxiety, perceiving the evolution of symptoms as more unpredictable or dangerous than they truly are. - Temporal distortions: Her perception of fluctuation and unpredictability may be exaggerated, with normal symptom variability perceived as worsening, possibly influenced by her emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased clinical picture probably includes persistent visual disturbances such as blurry vision, flashes, and possibly subtle double vision that have been ongoing for about a month since contact with primates. Systemic symptoms of fever and headache are likely genuine, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process potentially neurotropic, such as viral encephalitis or meningitis linked to zoonotic exposure. Her symptoms might be more severe or involve neurological deficits not fully expressed due to anxiety or fear of admitting severity. The progression appears steady rather than fluctuating wildly, but her perception is skewed by distress. Further neuro-ophthalmological and neurological assessment is warranted to clarify deficits, and investigations should include neuroimaging and labs for infectious etiologies.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your limbs?\" (assess for neurological deficits) 2. \"Have you experienced any difficulty speaking, swallowing, or walking?\" (detect neurological involvement) 3. \"Are you currently experiencing any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light?\" (to assess meningeal signs) 4. \"Have your systemic symptoms like fever or headache changed in intensity?\" (clarify progression) 5. \"Is there anything about your vision that is bothering you more now than when you first noticed it?\" (determine true progression) - Approach strategy: Ask these questions gently and empathetically to reduce anxiety and encourage honest disclosure. Frame queries around functional impact rather than stigmatization. - Priority order: Start with neurological symptoms, as they could indicate urgent pathology; then clarify systemic features; finally, pinpoint changes in visual symptoms over time.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication exhibits anxiety, hesitations, and qualifiers that suggest her subjective symptom report may overstate or distort her condition. She describes visual disturbances and systemic symptoms consistent with an infectious process, but her emotional distress could lead her to exaggerate symptoms like unpredictability or severity. Conversely, she may be minimizing or withholding details about neurological deficits or systemic signs such as persistent high fever, neck stiffness, or balance issues, which are critical for diagnosis. Her description of visual changes since contact with monkeys raises suspicion for zoonotic infections, but her emphasis on fluctuation and unpredictability suggests she might not fully recognize or disclose the extent of her neurological impairment. The objective clinical picture, therefore, likely includes ongoing visual disturbances such as blurry vision, flashes, and possibly subtle double vision, coupled with systemic symptoms like fever and headache that have been persistent for approximately a month. There may be neurological deficits that she is hesitant or afraid to report fully. Additional focused examination and diagnostic testing are necessary to clarify the severity and underlying cause, with a high index of suspicion for infectious or neurological etiologies related to zoonotic exposure.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: unspecified, adult female. Chief complaint: Persistent visual disturbances and systemic symptoms following contact with primates. Present illness: The patient reports ongoing visual issues, including fuzzy vision, flashes, spots, and intermittent double vision originating about one month prior, with symptom fluctuation related to fatigue and stress. She describes systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and exhaustion, which are likely genuine but may be under- or over-reported in intensity. She emphasizes unpredictability and variability of visual symptoms, which could reflect anxiety-driven perception. Associated symptoms: Fever and headache are reported with moderate confidence; neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or balance problems are not confirmed but should be assessed. No mention of neck stiffness or photophobia yet. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Visual disturbances (fuzzy vision, flashes, spots, double vision), systemic symptoms (fever, headache). - Medium confidence: Disease severity and progression may be exaggerated due to anxiety; neurological deficits might be more severe or present but underreported by the patient. - Low confidence: The full extent of neurological involvement and recent changes in systemic symptoms, as patient communication may influence reporting. - Missing information: Objective neuro-ophthalmological findings, neurological exam, laboratory results, and imaging to confirm infection or neurological pathology.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotional, vague language with elaborate explanations intertwining physical symptoms and stressors, suggesting emotional distress heavily influencing her symptom description. She minimizes her physical symptoms despite distress signals and exhibits some inconsistency in timeline recall. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias is prominent, leading her to perceive her symptoms as more unpredictable and severe than they may objectively be, influenced by anxiety and stress. - Confidence level: Medium; her emotional overlay affects reporting, but symptoms are present and relevant. - Reasoning: The pattern of vague language, exaggeration of unpredictability, and minimization indicates emotional bias impacting her perception and reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible persistent or more severe visual deficits\u2014such as sustained vision impairment, headaches, or weakness\u2014that she is downplaying due to embarrassment or fear of appearing overly worried. - Withheld information: She might feel ashamed to admit how much her stress and anxiety are affecting her or disclose other neurological symptoms like sensory changes, to avoid judgment or further concern. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about health and the virus, likely fueled by anxiety, may amplify her perception of severity beyond the actual physical findings. - Temporal distortions: Her description of symptoms as unpredictable and rapid-worsening may not reflect the true progression, which could be steadier and less alarming.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, her neurological picture probably involves moderate visual disturbances\u2014possibly more persistent or severe than described\u2014that are influenced by emotional stress and anxiety. She may have underlying neurological signs that she underreports or perceives as transient due to emotional overlay. The timeline likely reflects a steady or slowly progressive course, with her perceived rapid changes driven by emotional amplification. Her stress and worry appear to intensify her perception of unpredictability and severity, obscuring objective assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: Clarify the exact nature, frequency, and duration of visual disturbances and neurological symptoms; ask about headaches, weakness, or numbness; inquire about the persistence, pattern, and any visual field defects. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to encourage openness; frame questions to distinguish between perception and actual deficits\u2014e.g., \"Can you tell me if any of these symptoms have persisted all day or come and go?\" - Priority order: Start with concrete symptom frequency and severity questions to establish objective data, then explore emotional factors and stress levels, to contextualize the symptoms and build rapport.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient communication exhibits emotional amplification and vagueness, especially regarding severity and timing, which likely leads to overestimating unpredictability and distress related to symptoms. She minimizes the persistence and severity of symptoms, perhaps to avoid worry or judgment, and may be withholding certain neurological issues such as persistent visual deficits or other signs of neurological compromise. Her stress and anxiety appear to influence her perception, making symptoms seem more sudden and severe than they might be. Objective clinical facts suggest neurological involvement with visual disturbances including flickering spots, flashes, fuzzy vision, and some dizziness, which could indicate a neurological process affecting the visual pathways or inner ear, but the true severity may be understated due to her emotional state and communicational biases.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Uncertain onset of visual disturbances and associated neurological symptoms, influenced by emotional stressors.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual errors such as fuzzy vision, flashing spots, and occasional double vision, with symptoms fluctuating in intensity and appearing unpredictably. She reports dizziness especially upon standing or when stressed. She attributes some worsening to fatigue and stress, with subjective improvement after rest. She mentions fatigue, headache, and general exhaustion but describes these as worsening with stress and tiredness.  Associated symptoms: Dizziness, headache, fatigue, and eye flashes. The patient\u2019s reports of visual flickering and movement-related visual changes are present, but severity and persistence may be underreported. No reports of weakness or sensory deficit provided, but these remain uncertain due to possible minimization.

Her responses are hesitant and fragmented, reflecting anxiety and potential self-censorship. - Bias detected: The primary bias is emotional amplification with simultaneous minimization. She likely overemphasizes distress while underreporting severity or persistence of sensory and neurological symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium. While her emotional distress influences her narrative, some details like episodic dizziness and visual blurring are clearly stated, though their true severity and duration are uncertain. - Reasoning: The mixture of emotional overlays, vague language, and hedging suggests her self-report is biased; she may be downplaying persistent neurological issues and overemphasizing emotional stress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing continuous or more severe visual deficits, persistent dizziness, numbness, weakness, or other neurological impairments that she sees as less important or fears disclosing. - Withheld information: Anxiety or shame about neurological or systemic illness may cause her to hide the true severity or full extent of her symptoms, especially if she fears a serious diagnosis. - Amplified concerns: Her emotional distress and stress-related complaints may be exaggerated, possibly to seek reassurance or due to heightened health anxiety. - Temporal distortions: She may not perceive or report the full course of her symptoms; episodes could be more frequent, longer, or progressively worsening than she indicates.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette is likely to show: - Persistent or intermittent visual disturbances (blurriness, spots, flashes) that may be more severe or sustained than described. - Frequent dizziness, possibly more than episodic, correlated with postural changes or stress. - Potential presence of other neurological signs (numbness, weakness) that she is hesitant to report. - Emotional stress contributing to symptom perception, but not solely responsible for physical signs. - An ongoing process that might be evolving, with possible underlying neurological or ocular pathology requiring further investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me if your vision or dizziness has been the same since it started, or has it gotten worse or more frequent over time?\" (to clarify progression) * \"Do you notice any numbness, tingling, weakness, or difficulty moving your limbs or face?\" (to uncover hidden neurological signs) * \"Are there times during the day when your symptoms are more intense or persistent?\" (to assess pattern and severity) * \"Have you experienced any headaches, changes in memory, or other neurological issues?\" (to identify associated symptoms) * \"How are your symptoms affecting your daily activities and how you\u2019re feeling emotionally?\" (to gauge functional impact and emotional context) - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental inquiry, emphasizing that honest sharing helps provide the best care. Considering her anxiety, framing questions gently and focusing on safety can help her open up. - Priority order: First, clarify the true severity and persistence of physical symptoms to assess urgency. Next, explore associated neurological signs and impact on functioning. Finally, address emotional factors and stress, recognizing their role in symptom perception.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's subjective reports indicate visual disturbances (blurriness, flashes, spots), dizziness, fatigue, and stress-related fluctuations, but her communication shows emotional amplification and hesitation, which may lead her to overstate emotional distress while underreporting persistent or severe physical symptoms. She describes episodic visual changes lasting minutes and occasional dizziness, but the true severity and frequency could be underestimated, or symptoms may be more continuous. She may be withholding or minimizing additional neurological issues like weakness, numbness, or more persistent deficits due to anxiety or fear. Her stress levels appear high, which likely influence her symptom perception but do not fully account for potential underlying pathology. The information suggests a need for further objective assessment to clarify symptom persistence, severity, and any additional neurological signs.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Visual disturbances and dizziness with associated fatigue and stress. Present illness: The patient reports intermittent episodes of blurred vision, flashes, spots, and dizziness appearing unpredictably and lasting several minutes, often exacerbated by tiredness or stress. She also reports feelings of exhaustion and stress related to work and family responsibilities. The severity and frequency described may be subject to emotional amplification, and she could be experiencing more persistent or severe symptoms than acknowledged. Associated symptoms: Fatigue, stress-related fluctuations in symptoms, occasional dizziness; other neurological signs such as weakness, numbness, or persistent vision loss are not explicitly reported but may be present and are likely underreported. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The presence of episodic visual disturbances and dizziness. - Medium confidence: The severity, frequency, and persistence of symptoms may be underestimated due to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: The full scope of neurological symptoms; potential hidden symptoms such as weakness, sensory deficits, or more severe vision loss. - Missing information: Objective neurological examination findings, details about symptom progression, and additional neurological or systemic signs are needed.\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with episodic visual disturbances, including blurry vision, flashing spots, and dizziness, which occur unpredictably and last several minutes, often associated with tiredness and stress. She also reports fatigue and stress-related symptom fluctuations but may understate the severity and persistence of her neurological symptoms. Further assessment is necessary to evaluate for underlying neurological or ocular pathology, including examination for additional neurological deficits and symptom progression.",
