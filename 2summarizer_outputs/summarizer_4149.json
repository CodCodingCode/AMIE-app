It gets worse when I\u2019m working, especially when I\u2019m lifting heavy stuff or extending my wrist a lot, and at night, it wakes me up and I have to shake my hand. I also feel like I have some trouble small stuff, like buttoning my shirt or gripping things, and my wrist seems a little swollen sometimes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has now described the duration of his symptoms as approximately six weeks and provided additional details about symptom severity related to activity, nocturnal awakening, and functional impairment. The mention of wrist swelling adds new clinical information. Since these details are clearly stated by the patient, they can be confidently incorporated into the cumulative vignette.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 52-year-old male experiencing numbness and a burning sensation in his left thumb, index, and middle fingers for about six weeks. The symptoms worsen with activity, particularly when lifting heavy objects or extending his wrist. The symptoms wake him at night, necessitating shaking his hand to relieve them. He has difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as buttoning his shirt and gripping objects. He reports that his wrist sometimes appears slightly swollen."
