She discloses general feelings but avoids specific behavioral details, indicating guardedness possibly driven by shame. - Bias detected: The primary bias is a combination of minimization of behavior severity and withholding of detailed incident information. - Confidence level: Medium; I am confident that her emotional distress is genuine, but the behavioral details are likely underreported. - Reasoning: Her brief, vague responses coupled with cues of hesitation and shame suggest she minimizes her behaviors and withholds specifics to avoid embarrassment or judgement, which is consistent with her communication pattern.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be more frequently acting out, with more intense urges or episodes than she admits, possibly including repeated public acts she prefers to keep concealed. - Withheld information: Specific details of incidents, their contexts, and triggers are likely omitted due to shame. - Amplified concerns: She might be exaggerating her distress (e.g., \"overwhelming feelings\") to express her internal suffering but underplaying the behaviors. - Temporal distortions: The onset and progression timeline may be inaccurate or incomplete; early episodes or patterns might not be fully recognized or disclosed.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture probably involves: - A history of intrusive urges starting in her twenties, associated with moderate to severe distress. - Frequent, possibly ongoing, public acting-out behaviors that she is reluctant to specify. - Significant shame and embarrassment impacting full disclosure, leading to underreporting of the scope. - Emotional distress that is genuine and persistent, likely worsening her quality of life. - Possible comorbid feelings of guilt, shame, or hypervigilance, which she suppresses verbally but may experience internally.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me more about the situations where you feel these urges? What do they look like?\" (to clarify context and frequency) * \"Have you acted on these urges in ways you haven't mentioned yet?\" (to uncover unshared behaviors) * \"How often do these urges happen? Are they ongoing or occasional?\" (to determine severity) * \"What kind of feelings or thoughts do you notice just before acting or when resisting?\" (to explore triggers and internal states) * \"Are there any physical sensations or emotions you experience during these urges?\" (to identify physiological or emotional patterns) - Approach strategy: * Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone emphasizing confidentiality and safety. * Validate her distress to reduce shame and encourage openness. * Normalize common experiences related to impulse control or compulsive behaviors. - Priority order: * First, explore the context and frequency of her behaviors to gauge severity. * Next, inquire about her emotional and physical experiences related to urges. * Finally, gently probe about specific incidents she's hesitant to disclose, fostering trust for more detailed sharing.  # Short Answer",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's vague and emotionally charged language, along with cautious responses, suggest she is hesitant to disclose specific details about her behavior, likely due to shame or embarrassment. Her brief disclosures indicate genuine distress but underreporting of the severity, frequency, and context of her urges and actions is probable. She may be minimizing or withholding information about possibly frequent or more intense behaviors, and her emotional symptoms may be underrecognized due to her guarded communication. To accurately understand her condition, further probing about specific incidents, triggers, and the extent of her behaviors is necessary, with an empathetic and validating approach to reduce shame and facilitate more open disclosure.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Female, age unspecified, presenting for evaluation of emotional distress and urges.  Chief complaint: Difficulties managing confusing feelings and urges, reported with emotional language and without detailed behavioral specifics.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing confusing feelings and urges that cause her distress. Her communication suggests that these feelings are persistent and genuine, but she minimizes the severity of her behaviors and likely withholds details about ongoing or frequent acting-out behaviors, especially in public or social settings. The reported onset is unspecified but appears to be associated with longstanding emotional discomfort. The timeline is uncertain, given her cautious responses. She exhibits significant shame, which may lead to underreporting, and her overall presentation indicates that her internal distress might be more severe than described. Associated symptoms such as guilt, shame, or hypervigilance are plausible but underdisclosed.  ConfidencesAssessment: - High confidence: The patient is genuinely distressed and experiencing urges that impact her emotional well-being. - Medium confidence: She may be minimizing or underreporting behaviors and the severity of her symptoms. - Low confidence: Complete understanding of the behavior frequency, trigger contexts, and full symptom scope due to defensive communication and withholding details. - Missing information: Specific details of her urges, behaviors, their frequency, triggers, and any previous episodes or treatment history.\nANSWER: The patient, a female, presents with persistent emotional distress and urges that she finds confusing and difficult to manage. Her communication indicates genuine internal suffering; however, she employs vague and emotionally charged language that suggests she may be minimizing or withholding information regarding the severity, frequency, and context of her acting-out behaviors. It is likely she experiences ongoing urges and possibly frequent episodes that she is reluctant to disclose fully due to shame and embarrassment. Her symptomatology appears to be impacting her emotional well-being significantly, but a comprehensive assessment including detailed inquiry about specific behaviors, triggers, and episode frequency is necessary to fully characterize her condition objectively.",

Her communication indicates genuine internal suffering; however, she employs vague and emotionally charged language that suggests she may be minimizing or withholding information regarding the severity, frequency, and context of her acting-out behaviors. It is likely she experiences ongoing urges and possibly frequent episodes that she is reluctant to disclose fully due to shame and embarrassment. Her symptomatology appears to be impacting her emotional well-being significantly, but a comprehensive assessment including detailed inquiry about specific behaviors, triggers, and episode frequency is necessary to fully characterize her condition objectively.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates using vague, non-specific language and responds briefly, showing avoidance and potential embarrassment. Her tone and hesitations imply discomfort discussing her urges fully. - Bias detected: Withholding and minimization biases significantly influence her reporting, likely leading to underestimation of symptom severity and frequency. - Confidence level: Medium; while her communication suggests concealment, some details are accessible, but the true extent remains uncertain. - Reasoning: Based on her vague descriptions, reluctance to elaborate, and emotional cues such as embarrassment, I infer that she is downplaying her symptoms and withholding detailed information possibly rooted in shame.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may experience more frequent and intense urges or behaviors than she admits\u2014possibly covert acts or episodes she considers shameful. - Withheld information: Specific details of compulsive acts linked to urges, contextual triggers, or the emotional aftermath. - Amplified concerns: She might be worried about being judged or misunderstood, leading her to be guarded about her full experience. - Temporal distortions: She may be unsure about the onset, course, or fluctuation of her symptoms; her perception might be skewed by emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the clinical picture likely involves frequent, distressing urges with possibly repetitive compulsive behaviors that she is reluctant to disclose fully. Her internal distress is probably more severe, including significant shame, guilt, and emotional turmoil. The symptom timeline suggests a chronic or recurrent pattern that she minimizes in her narrative, which impacts accurate assessment and treatment planning.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me about any acts or behaviors you think about or do that might be connected to these urges?\" \"How often do you experience these feelings, and how real or intense do they feel?\" \"Are there certain situations or thoughts that seem to trigger these urges?\" These aim to clarify the frequency and behaviors she may be avoiding. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language emphasizing confidentiality; validate her feelings to reduce shame and encourage openness. - Priority order: Start with questions about behaviors and triggers before exploring emotional impact, creating a safe environment for disclosure. Follow up with questions about associated feelings of guilt or shame, to understand the full scope of her internal experience.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s vague and emotionally charged language, along with brief responses and indications of discomfort when discussing urges, suggest potential underreporting or minimization of symptoms. Communication patterns point toward shame, embarrassment, or reluctance to share full details, likely hiding the true frequency and intensity of urges and any associated behaviors. As a result, the clinical picture may be more severe than the patient admits, with possible covert compulsive acts or episodes that she considers shameful. Confidence levels are moderate for current subjective symptoms but low for the actual severity and full scope of behaviors, emphasizing the need for detailed, gentle probing to uncover hidden aspects. Additional information about specific behaviors, triggers, and emotional aftermath is necessary for comprehensive assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: unspecified. Chief complaint: Reports experiencing confusing urges and feelings, specifically sudden impulses to engage in proximity or physical contact with others, described as happening out of nowhere. Present illness: Symptoms include sudden onset urges to brush against or be close to others in crowded settings. The patient indicates these feelings are brief and spontaneous, with no detailed account of behaviors or frequency. The patient employs vague language, likely minimization or withholding information about the severity, frequency, or specific nature of any compulsive acts. The timeline remains unclear but appears to be recurrent based on her report of persistent feelings. Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms such as distress, shame, guilt, or emotional disturbances explicitly reported, though psychological distress is implied. Confidence in symptom attribution is medium due to communication barriers, but actual symptom severity may be greater than reported. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of these urges and their spontaneous, non-specific nature. - Medium confidence: The true severity, frequency, and context of behaviors, due to guarded communication. - Low confidence: Exact impact on functional or emotional well-being, as patient may underreport or conceal emotional responses. - Missing information: Specific behaviors associated with urges, triggers, episode frequency, emotional responses, and any distress related to these symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient presents with recurrent, spontaneous urges to engage in physical contact or proximity with others, particularly in crowded settings. She reports these urges as sudden and brief, with a degree of emotional discomfort when discussing them, suggesting possible shame or embarrassment. Objective clinical assessment indicates that the urges are likely more frequent and severe than the patient is currently willing to disclose, potentially involving covert compulsive behaviors. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to clarify the nature, triggers, frequency, and emotional impact of these symptoms to inform appropriate diagnosis and management.",

She reports these urges as sudden and brief, with a degree of emotional discomfort when discussing them, suggesting possible shame or embarrassment. Objective clinical assessment indicates that the urges are likely more frequent and severe than the patient is currently willing to disclose, potentially involving covert compulsive behaviors. Further detailed inquiry is necessary to clarify the nature, triggers, frequency, and emotional impact of these symptoms to inform appropriate diagnosis and management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her urges with emotionally charged, detailed descriptions, emphasizing suddenness and intensity. Her responses are organized but include soft language and some hesitation, indicating nervousness and shame. She appears genuine but may subtly exaggerate the uncontrollability of her urges. - Bias detected: Emotional distress bias is prominent; her vivid, intense language could inflate perceptions of severity, and she may be underestimating her ability to manage or control urges. There\u2019s also slight minimization in her descriptions suggesting she downplays her efforts or the frequency of her behaviors. - Confidence level: Medium. Her honesty and consistency support reliability, but emotional factors influence her report's accuracy. - Reasoning: The combination of emotionally charged language, hesitations, and her tendency to focus on distress points to an emotionally amplified but reasonably honest portrayal that may overstate the severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be suppressing the true frequency or intensity of her urges, or her use of covert compulsive behaviors to manage the feelings, which she does not disclose. - Withheld information: She may feel embarrassed about engaging in physical proximity or contact that could be viewed as inappropriate or compulsive behaviors, leading her to underreport or avoid mentioning specific actions taken to cope. - Amplified concerns: Her emotional reactions and worries about \u201churting anyone\u201d may be overemphasized due to shame, possibly making her fears seem more severe than they are. - Temporal distortions: Her perception that urges appear \u201cout of nowhere\u201d might omit underlying patterns or triggers, such as specific situations or emotional states, which she is hesitant to admit or fully recognize.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves recurrent, spontaneous urges to engage in physical contact that are quite frequent and strongly experienced. These urges are triggered possibly by environmental cues such as crowded settings, and they produce significant emotional distress, shame, and possibly feelings of loss of control. She may be employing some covert coping strategies (e.g., suppression, avoidance) that she is not fully aware of or willing to disclose. There may be underlying compulsive tendencies, and associated symptoms like anxiety or shame-related avoidance are present but not explicitly reported.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \u201cCan you describe any routines or strategies you use to control or cope with these urges?\u201d (to uncover hidden compulsions); \u201cHow often do these urges happen each day or week?\u201d (to clarify frequency); \u201cHave you ever engaged in behaviors beyond just feeling urges, like physical actions?\u201d (to assess compulsivity); \u201cWhat thoughts or feelings come before or after the urges?\u201d (to understand emotional context). - Approach strategy: Ask gently and non-judgmentally, emphasizing understanding and support, to reduce shame and encourage more disclosure. - Priority order: First probe about specific behaviors and routines to identify hidden compulsions; then ask about frequency and triggers; finally, explore emotional experiences to assess impact and control.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication suggests she experiences recurrent, spontaneous urges to engage in physical proximity or contact with others, particularly in crowded environments. Her detailed, emotionally charged descriptions, along with her hesitations and mentions of shame, indicate that she may be overemphasizing the distress or severity of these urges, possibly to elicit understanding or sympathy. Conversely, she may be underreporting certain behaviors or the frequency of these urges, especially covert actions she might be using to manage her feelings. There is a likelihood that the actual severity and frequency are higher than reported. Her language hints at internal struggles with control and emotional distress, but real extent and specific behaviors remain unclear. Additional probing into routines, strategies, and emotional triggers would help clarify the true clinical picture and determine whether these symptoms align with a compulsive or impulsive disorder or are expressions of underlying anxiety or other psychological issues.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown age and gender.  Chief complaint: Recurrent urges to engage in physical contact or proximity with others, especially in crowded settings, described as sudden and intense.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing sudden, brief episodes of strong urges to brush against or be close to others. She describes these urges as hitting her \"out of nowhere\" and states they produce a rush or jolt that overwhelms her for a moment, with associated feelings of distress and embarrassment. She reports that these urges are frequent but may be minimized or underreported. It is possible that the patient employs covert coping mechanisms, such as suppression or avoidance, which she does not disclose. Her emotional language suggests significant distress, but this may be exaggerated due to shame or anxiety. Timeline suggests these urges are ongoing and recurrent, with no specific triggers identified in her account but likely associated with crowded environments.  Associated symptoms: The patient may experience emotional discomfort, shame, and possibly anxiety related to these urges; however, other symptoms such as compulsive behaviors or insight into these experiences have not been explicitly reported and may be underreported. Confidence in symptom descriptions is medium, given communication biases affecting her explicit disclosures.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of recurrent urges in environments described (crowded settings). - Medium confidence: The severity, frequency, and emotional impact of urges, given possible exaggeration or minimization. - Low confidence: Specific behaviors beyond urges, detailed triggers, and the full extent of distress, due to communication hesitations and possible concealment. - Missing information: Precise frequency, any compulsive acts, coping strategies used, and emotional or behavioral patterns surrounding these urges.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, hesitant language, emphasizing uncontrollability and suddenness, while avoiding detailed disclosure about triggers, frequency, or specifics. Her tone shows distress but also guardedness and shame. - Bias detected: Minimization bias is most prominent, with possible amplification of helplessness related to urges; she underreports triggers and contextual details. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her sincere distress is evident, but her guarded communication limits full understanding. - Reasoning: Based on her vagueness about triggers and control, and emphasis on uncontrollability, coupled with hesitations and minimizing language, it\u2019s clear she is intentionally withholding or downplaying information due to shame and fear of judgment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true frequency, specific circumstances, and environmental or emotional triggers of her urges are likely more frequent and specific than she admits. - Withheld information: Specific triggers, associated feelings of guilt or shame, presence of compulsive behaviors, or dissociative experiences are probably underdisclosed. - Amplified concerns: Her feelings of helplessness may be somewhat exaggerated to express internal distress, but real distress likely exceeds her portrayal. - Temporal distortions: She may be underreporting earlier episodes or the persistence of her urges, possibly from early adolescence or longer history, given her emphasis on \u201cgradual increase\u201d into her current state.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering these biases, the clinical picture likely includes frequent, context-dependent urges to touch or come close to others, particularly in social situations, with episodes that feel intense and uncontrollable. Emotional distress and shame are significant, contributing to guarded reporting, but underlying issues may involve recurrent compulsive behaviors and associated guilt. The urges might be more pervasive and less situational than she reports, with a history possibly extending earlier than her early twenties, indicating a chronic pattern.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me about any particular places or people where your urges happen most? How often do you feel these urges each week? Are there certain times or situations that seem to make them worse? Do you experience feelings of guilt or shame afterward? Are there any habitual behaviors associated with these urges, like touching yourself or others, that you haven't mentioned?\" - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language to encourage openness, normalize her experiences, and reassure confidentiality to reduce shame's impact. - Priority order: First, explore frequency and context to understand the scope; second, inquire about emotional responses and associated behaviors; third, probe earlier in life experiences to uncover possible longstanding patterns.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern reveals a tendency to emphasize the uncontrollability and sudden onset of urges, using vague and hesitant language. She appears to minimize the frequency, specific triggers, and context of her symptoms, potentially due to shame or fear of judgment. Her description suggests she experiences recurrent, intense urges to come into close contact with others, especially in crowded settings, which she perceives as uncontrollable and overwhelming. However, given her guarded presentation, she likely underreports the true severity, past frequency, and related behaviors, such as habitual touching or associated guilt. Her emotional distress is evident, but her guardedness limits full understanding. Consequently, the clinical picture probably involves more frequent and persistent urges than she admits, with possible underlying compulsive tendencies or longstanding patterns dating back earlier than her reporting suggests.\nANSWER: Patient is a young adult presenting with persistent urges to engage in close contact or tactile behaviors with others, particularly in social or crowded contexts. She reports these urges as sudden, intense, and uncontrollable, with episodes that she perceives as unavoidable. While she describes these experiences as occurring without specific triggers and emphasizes their spontaneity, the communication pattern suggests the actual frequency and environmental influences are likely understated. The patient exhibits significant emotional distress, shame, and guarded communication, which may obscure the full extent of her symptoms. The clinical picture indicates a probable pattern of recurrent, involuntary urges to touch or come close to others, potentially associated with compulsive behaviors or emotional regulation difficulties.

She reports these urges as sudden, intense, and uncontrollable, with episodes that she perceives as unavoidable. While she describes these experiences as occurring without specific triggers and emphasizes their spontaneity, the communication pattern suggests the actual frequency and environmental influences are likely understated. The patient exhibits significant emotional distress, shame, and guarded communication, which may obscure the full extent of her symptoms. The clinical picture indicates a probable pattern of recurrent, involuntary urges to touch or come close to others, potentially associated with compulsive behaviors or emotional regulation difficulties. The onset may be earlier in life than indicated, and the severity may be greater than currently acknowledged, with possible underlying feelings of guilt or shame influencing reporting. Further detailed inquiry is needed to clarify specific triggers, frequency, control, and related behaviors.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her urges with emotional metaphors and vague language, showing caution and shame. She emphasizes the suddenness and uncontrollability of her urges, using exaggerating metaphors, while simultaneously minimizing specific triggers. Her responses reflect hesitations and guardedness, indicating emotional discomfort. - Bias detected: A combination of emotional amplification (perceiving urges as more uncontrollable and severe) and minimization of environmental or situational triggers. She seems to exaggerate the unpredictability to justify her distress while withholding details that may reveal more structured patterns. - Confidence level: Medium. The consistent cautious language and metaphor use suggest certain truths, but emotional biases may distort severity and triggers. - Reasoning: The mixture of vivid expressive language with hesitations indicates emotional bias\u2014overinflating her distress emotionally but possibly hiding finer details of her triggers and control.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible specific triggers such as particular social settings or internal emotional cues that she perceives as shameful or embarrassing, leading her to underreport or omit them. - Withheld information: Details about her emotional states, underlying feelings like anxiety or guilt, and any habitual behaviors or coping strategies that she considers shameful or insignificant. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of losing control or hurting others might be emotionally magnified; her narrative creates a sense of extreme unpredictability and severity. - Temporal distortions: The actual frequency, onset, and progression of these urges may be earlier and more persistent than she admits, perhaps fluctuating over time with varying triggers that she is unwilling or unable to articulate fully.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves recurrent, involuntary urges tied to social or emotional cues that are more frequent and structured than she reports. These urges are probably less unpredictable and uncontrollable in reality but feel that way due to emotional distress and shame. There are likely specific triggers such as certain environments, emotional states, or interpersonal interactions that she is reluctant to disclose fully. Her emotional landscape suggests underlying guilt or shame that amplifies her perception of loss of control and severity, but she may also possess some coping strategies she is hesitant to acknowledge. Overall, her symptoms are probably more embedded and persistent, possibly with early onset, and her fears may be emotionally exaggerated rather than reflective of her actual capacity for control.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you think of any particular situations, places, or feelings that seem to trigger these urges more often?\" (to uncover hidden environmental or emotional triggers) - \"When you experience these urges, do you notice any patterns or common feelings beforehand?\" (to explore emotional precursors) - \"Are there times when the urges come but you are able to resist or manage them? What helps you in those moments?\" (to assess coping skills) - \"Have you noticed any physical sensations or thoughts that precede the urges?\" (to understand biomodal triggers) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing curiosity rather than judgment, encouraging openness. - Normalize some experiences to reduce shame and facilitate honest sharing. - Priority order: - First, explore triggers and emotional states to clarify environmental and internal influences. - Next, assess her perceived control and coping mechanisms. - Finally, probe for history and pattern details to establish timeline and persistence. This approach helps reduce shame barriers and uncovers detailed, clinically relevant information to better understand her true symptom profile.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern reveals emotional guarding, exaggeration of unpredictability and severity of urges, and possible minimization of environmental or internal triggers. She emphasizes the sudden and uncontrollable nature of her urges, using metaphors like \"a jolt or a rush\" and describing a lack of control. These descriptors suggest her perception of her symptoms may be amplified by emotional distress, shame, or guilt. Her reluctance to specify triggers or control strategies indicates she may be underreporting structured or situational factors that influence her symptoms. Additionally, her guarded language and hesitations could mask the true extent and frequency of her urges, which are likely more frequent and less uncontrollable in reality. The overall clinical picture suggests recurrent, involuntary urges to engage in tactile or close contact behaviors, particularly in social or crowded contexts, with a probable early onset and greater severity than reported. Further probing into specific triggers, emotional states, and coping mechanisms is necessary to clarify her experience fully.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Young adult female.

She states these experiences happen without specific triggers and feels unable to resist them, perceiving them as unavoidable. Based on communication cues, these episodes are likely more frequent and their triggers more specific, such as certain social environments or emotional states, than the patient explicitly reports. She exhibits emotional distress related to these urges, including shame and hesitation to fully disclose details, suggesting potential emotional or maladaptive internal factors. The severity and frequency are likely underestimated due to her guarded communication. Associated symptoms or underlying emotional conditions remain unclear and warrant further assessment.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Patient experiences recurrent, involuntary urges to engage in tactile or close contact behaviors, particularly in social settings. - Medium confidence: The urges are perceived as uncontrollable, but this may be an exaggeration influenced by emotional distress. - Low confidence: Specific triggers, the precise frequency, and detailed control strategies are not fully disclosed; likely more structured than reported. - Missing information: Triggers, emotional precursors, coping mechanisms, early onset, and details about related or compulsive behaviors require further exploration.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
