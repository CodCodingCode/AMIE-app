My mouth started hurting a few days ago, and now it\\u2019s really bad. It\\u2019s like these sores or ulcers, and I have bad breath even when I brush.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her main symptoms clearly but maintains a cautious, somewhat guarded approach regarding potential causes, avoiding detailed or specific information about her behaviors. She emphasizes her discomfort with minimal elaboration. - Bias detected: Social desirability/shame bias influences her reporting, leading to possible withholding of relevant behaviors such as poor hygiene or smoking. - Confidence level: Medium. Her presentation reliably reports symptoms but may underrepresent contributing factors. - Reasoning: The hesitations, vagueness, and selective sharing patterns fit with socially shameful behavior avoidance, which is common in oral health issues linked to personal habits.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be experiencing more severe or persistent sores, additional oral hygiene issues, or symptoms related to neglect that she isn't openly acknowledging. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose smoking, hygiene neglect, recent minor oral injuries, or stress-related behaviors influencing her condition. - Amplified concerns: Her expressed anxiety and \"really bad\" pain could be genuine but are potentially heightened by her emotional distress; she may also worry about serious illness more than her actual condition warrants. - Temporal distortions: Unlikely, but she may not fully recall or recognize the onset or course of her symptoms, especially if avoidant or anxious.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her guarded communication, the clinical picture likely includes significant oral hygiene neglect, possibly compounded by smoking or other habits, leading to ulcerations and halitosis. Her pain appears serious but may be worse than reported. Underlying factors such as minor trauma or stress could play roles but are not openly expressed. Addressing shame and encouraging full disclosure will be crucial for accurate diagnosis.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me about your daily oral hygiene routines?\" \"Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?\" \"Have you noticed any recent injuries or biting inside your mouth?\" \"Are you experiencing any stress or changes in your life that might affect your health?\" These promote honest sharing by normalizing routine behaviors and reducing shame. - Approach strategy: Frame questions sensitively, emphasizing that many people have similar habits, and that understanding all aspects helps provide the best care. Use nonjudgmental language and reassure confidentiality to decrease shame-related withholding. - Priority order: Start with routine and non-judgmental questions about oral care and habits to establish comfort, then gradually address more sensitive topics like smoking and stress\u2014this encourages full disclosure progressively.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication suggests she may be underreporting the severity or full extent of her oral health issues and related behaviors such as hygiene practices or smoking. Although she describes significant oral soreness and ulcers, her minimal elaboration and emphasis on discomfort could indicate underlying neglect or stress factors she is reluctant to disclose. Recognizing potential biases, the clinical picture might include more severe or persistent sores, signs of oral hygiene neglect, and possibly additional symptoms like halitosis or trauma that she is not openly acknowledging. To obtain an accurate assessment, sensitive probing about habits, hygiene routines, and recent injuries is necessary, with awareness that her discomfort might be magnified by stress or emotional factors.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient.  Chief complaint: Oral soreness and ulcers, described as severe and recently worsening.  Present illness: The patient reports a several-day history of oral soreness and ulcers with accompanying halitosis, describing the pain as \"really bad.\" Her description suggests significant discomfort, though her limited elaboration and guarded tone may lead to underestimating the full extent or chronicity. She may be experiencing additional oral health issues such as neglected hygiene, unnoticed injuries, or stress-related effects that are not openly shared. The timeline indicates symptom onset within the past few days, with possible underlying processes including poor oral hygiene, minor trauma, or systemic factors, but these are not confirmed. She does not report other associated symptoms explicitly.  Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms are currently noted, but the presence of halitosis aligns with possible oral hygiene or infection-related issues; confidence is moderate that halitosis is present but unconfirmed without further examination.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports oral soreness, ulcers, and halitosis. - Medium confidence: Severity of symptoms may be underestimated; actual discomfort and oral health status could be worse. - Low confidence: Details about hygiene behaviors, smoking, trauma, or stress are likely incomplete or withheld. - Missing information: Detailed oral examination findings, hygiene routines, substance use, injury history, and psychosocial factors are needed for comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with a several-day history of oral soreness and ulcers, describing the pain as severe and worsening, accompanied by halitosis. Despite her guarded communication, objective indications suggest significant oral mucosal lesions, potentially associated with neglected oral hygiene or minor trauma. The severity of her symptoms may be underestimated due to communication barriers, warranting further evaluation of her oral health routine, smoking status, recent injuries, and stressors to identify contributing factors and guide appropriate management.",

Despite her guarded communication, objective indications suggest significant oral mucosal lesions, potentially associated with neglected oral hygiene or minor trauma. The severity of her symptoms may be underestimated due to communication barriers, warranting further evaluation of her oral health routine, smoking status, recent injuries, and stressors to identify contributing factors and guide appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates cautiously, using mild and vague language to describe her oral hygiene habits and stress levels. Responses are brief and wait for direct questions, indicating guardedness and possible shame, especially about neglecting her oral care. - Bias detected: The primary bias is **minimization and withholding**. She underreports the extent of her neglect and is somewhat guarded in her disclosures. - Confidence level: medium. Based on her guarded responses and non-specific language, I believe the information is somewhat accurate but incomplete. - Reasoning: These conclusions follow from her use of vague, minimizing language, delayed disclosure of neglect, and reserved communication style.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true severity of her oral ulcers and tissue damage is likely greater; she may have more extensive ulcers, bleeding, or secondary infections she\u2019s not fully describing. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed about her oral hygiene habits, neglect, or lifestyle factors like stress or smoking, which she may not wish to disclose explicitly. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about potential severity may be proportionate, but her focus on stress and vague description could overstate the psychological impact relative to clinical severity. - Temporal distortions: Her self-reported timeline suggests symptoms started a few days ago, but neglect probably developed over a longer period, leading to more advanced pathology that she minimizes.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: - Significant oral mucosal ulceration and soreness likely more extensive than described, possibly with tissue necrosis or secondary infection. - Chronic neglect of oral hygiene, with brushing frequency much less than she admits\u2014possibly neglected for weeks or more. - Her stress and lifestyle factors (e.g., potential smoking or poor diet) likely contribute but are underreported, exacerbating tissue damage. - The progression of symptoms has probably been insidious, with gradual worsening masked by her minimization and reluctance to fully disclose neglect.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how often you brush your teeth each week?\" to quantify neglect. - \"Do you notice anything else unusual in your mouth\u2014like bleeding, discoloration, or larger sores?\" to assess extent. - \"Have you experienced any recent injuries, cuts, or trauma in your mouth?\" which might contribute. - \"How are you managing your stress and habits like smoking or alcohol?\" to identify other factors. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental phrasing, emphasizing curiosity rather than judgment, to encourage honesty. - Priority order: First understand the actual daily oral hygiene routine, then explore other contributing factors, followed by current symptom severity and progression\u2014to build an accurate, comprehensive picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's cautious and vague communication suggests she may underreport the severity and extent of her oral symptoms and neglect. Her response indicates possible minimization of her oral hygiene routine and stress levels, which could contribute to more extensive mucosal damage than she admits. Her admission of inconsistent brushing and recent stress points toward potential poor oral hygiene, but the actual condition of her oral mucosa may be worse, possibly with larger ulcers, secondary infections, or tissue necrosis. She may also be withholding information regarding other factors such as smoking, recent trauma, or more significant neglect that could exacerbate the oral lesions. The timeline of symptom development appears insidious, with gradual worsening that she might be underestimating or not fully aware of due to her guarded communication style. While she reports symptoms starting a few days ago, the pathology likely developed over a longer period, with progressive deterioration masked by her minimization. Further detailed probing about her oral care habits, injury history, and lifestyle factors is necessary to clarify the full scope of her condition.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (age unspecified). Chief complaint: Severe oral soreness and ulcers presenting within the past few days, with associated halitosis; her description may underestimate the true severity. Present illness: - Well-established symptoms: Mouth soreness and ulcers that are currently painful and worsening, with halitosis. - Likely minimized symptoms: The extent of oral tissue damage, ulcer size, presence of secondary infection, and possible bleeding are probably more severe than reported. - Possibly withheld symptoms: Additional oral discomforts, bleeding, larger ulcers, or secondary infections her neglect or shame might lead her to conceal. - Timeline: Symptoms have reportedly started a few days ago, but the oral tissue damage probably developed gradually over a longer period, likely worsened by ongoing neglect. Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms explicitly reported; however, poor oral hygiene and stress are contributing factors, with a potential for secondary infection yet to be assessed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient has oral ulcers and soreness that are currently symptomatic. - Medium confidence: The actual severity and extent of the mucosal damage due to possible underreporting or minimization. - Low confidence: The precise duration, full extent of neglect, and presence of secondary infection or trauma, as communication biases likely affect reporting. - Missing information: Detailed assessment of her daily oral hygiene practices, history of oral trauma, smoking, alcohol use, and the timeline and progression of her symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with several days of oral soreness and ulcers, with associated halitosis. Objective examination suggests extensive oral mucosal ulceration and tissue damage that may be more severe than her verbal report indicates. She reports inconsistent oral hygiene practices and increased stress, which are risk factors for mucosal breakdown. Given her guarded communication style, the true extent of her symptoms and neglect likely exceeds her self-report, possibly involving larger ulcers, secondary infection, or tissue necrosis. Further focused inquiry is needed to clarify her daily oral care routine, potential trauma, lifestyle factors such as smoking or alcohol use, and the progression of her oral lesions.",

She acknowledges pain but downplays her neglect, avoiding full transparency. - Bias detected: Under-reporting/minimization bias. Evidence includes her vague routine descriptions, emotional hedging, and reluctance to admit to severity. - Confidence level: Medium. The verbal cues suggest she underdiscloses her neglect; however, objective findings point to more severe pathology. - Reasoning: The combination of guarded responses, minimization, and emotional tone implies she is not fully revealing the extent of her hygiene neglect. Consequently, her self-report likely underestimates her true condition.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual severity of her oral ulcers and potential secondary infections are probably worse than she admits, given her guarded responses and the clinical appearance. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose poor habits like neglecting oral hygiene more extensively, possibly due to shame. She might also be hiding related factors such as smoking, alcohol use, or stressful circumstances impacting self-care. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about infection seems heightened relative to her actual clinical findings, possibly driven by pain intensity rather than the clinical severity. - Temporal distortions: The progression of her lesions may have been insidious, with some worsening over days she does not recognize or fully report, leading to an understated timeline.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the Chain of Thought, the true clinical picture is likely more severe: extensive mucosal ulceration with possible secondary bacterial or fungal superinfection, tissue necrosis in parts, and significant neglect of oral hygiene. She probably brushes less frequently than she reports\u2014possibly only sporadically or minimally\u2014and her stress and neglect have contributed to lesion progression. The initial mild description of sores has actual underlying severity that she minimizes emotionally and verbally, complicating assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me exactly how many times you brush your teeth each day? Do you rinse or use any mouthwash regularly?\" \u2014 To quantify actual hygiene frequency. * \"Are there any habits like smoking, alcohol, or drug use that you haven't mentioned?\" \u2014 To identify other contributing factors. * \"Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as fever, difficulty swallowing, or bleeding?\" \u2014 To check for signs of infection or systemic involvement. * \"How are you feeling emotionally? Do stressful situations usually affect your self-care routines?\" \u2014 To explore underlying psychological factors. - Approach strategy: Use nonjudgmental, empathetic inquiry to reduce shame and encourage honesty. Emphasize the importance of accurate information for effective treatment. - Priority order: Start with specific, non-threatening questions about hygiene habits to obtain concrete data; then proceed to lifestyle factors and emotional stressors. This order helps build trust and gradually uncovers hidden issues.  #",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication indicates she may be underreporting the severity of her oral condition and neglectful behaviors. While she reports painful mouth sores and poor oral hygiene, her vague descriptions and minimizing language suggest the actual extent of mucosal damage and neglect might be more severe. She likely brushes less frequently than admitted, potentially only sporadically, and may have unspoken contributing factors such as additional stress, smoking, or substance use. Her emotional tone and reluctance to fully disclose her habits imply she may be hiding the true severity of neglect and possible secondary infections or tissue necrosis. Therefore, her symptoms are probably underestimated, with actual lesion severity and neglect surpassing her verbal report, warranting further targeted inquiry.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Oral soreness and ulcers, with associated halitosis, likely more severe than self-described.  Present illness: The patient reports a several-day history of mouth soreness and ulcers that have worsened over time, accompanied by halitosis. She describes discomfort that discourages regular oral hygiene practices, such as brushing and rinsing, which she admits she attempts but often skips due to pain and fatigue. Her verbal descriptions suggest moderate symptoms; however, communication cues indicate she may be minimizing the extent of mucosal ulceration and neglect, with possible secondary infection, tissue damage, or necrosis.  Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms such as fever, dysphagia, or bleeding have been reported but should be explicitly queried, as they could indicate systemic involvement or secondary infection. Her emotional state suggests stress may impact her self-care routines, though this has not been directly confirmed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: She reports oral soreness, ulceration, halitosis, and inconsistent oral hygiene practices. - Medium confidence: The true severity of mucosal damage and neglect is higher than reported, based on communication cues. - Low confidence: Specific details about the size, number, and progression of ulcers, and presence of secondary infection or systemic symptoms. - Missing information: Precise frequency and quality of oral hygiene, behavioral factors such as smoking or alcohol use, and additional systemic or psychological symptoms.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a several-day history of oral ulcers and soreness, accompanied by halitosis. While she reports that discomfort makes her avoid regular brushing and rinsing, her guarded and minimization-oriented communication suggests her actual oral mucosal damage and neglect are likely more extensive than her subjective report indicates. Clinical examination may reveal widespread ulceration, tissue necrosis, or secondary infection consistent with significant neglect of oral hygiene.

Further detailed inquiry into her daily oral care routines, lifestyle factors, and systemic symptoms is necessary to accurately assess the severity of her condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient is verbally hesitant, uses hedging, and minimizes her oral hygiene behaviors, expressing discomfort and shame around neglect. - Bias detected: Primarily minimization bias, with underreporting of neglect severity driven by embarrassment. - Confidence level: Medium; while her disclosures suggest neglect, emotional influences likely cause underestimation. - Reasoning: The consistent use of qualifiers and vague language point toward underreporting, despite her symptoms indicating more severe neglect.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Likely, her neglect is more extensive, with more frequent skipping of routines, possibly leading to widespread or deep tissue ulcers, secondary infections, or necrosis that she won't fully disclose. - Withheld information: Embarrassment may cause her to understate the true duration and severity of neglect, possibly hiding ongoing, long-term issues. - Amplified concerns: While she reports significant symptoms (fever, tiredness), her emotional tone might exaggerate worries, but the actual condition is probably serious due to neglect. - Temporal distortions: The neglect likely started earlier than she admits, possibly weeks or months, with vague references masking a longer history.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, her true clinical state probably involves severe, longstanding oral neglect with inadequate routine care, resulting in extensive ulceration, mucosal damage, and possible secondary infections. Her present symptoms are consistent with significant tissue injury, but her guarded responses conceal the full extent. The neglect likely predates her current timeframe and is more severe than her report suggests, requiring thorough clinical examination and detailed history-taking.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me exactly how many times per day you brush and rinse? When did you last do so thoroughly? Are the ulcers and soreness worse with certain foods or times of day? Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as bleeding, bad taste, or worsening pain? How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?\" - Approach strategy: Ask in a non-judgmental, empathetic manner to reduce shame, emphasizing that honesty helps improve her care. - Priority order: First clarify routine frequency and duration, then explore symptom progression and systemic features, to get an accurate picture without causing defensiveness.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern shows hesitation and minimization regarding her oral hygiene neglect, suggesting her reporting likely underestimates the full severity and extent of tissue damage. She admits to infrequent brushing and rinsing, chiefly driven by discomfort and busy schedules, with a tendency to skip routines. Her mention of systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue indicates some involvement beyond trivial mucosal irritation, but emotional factors may cause her to exaggerate her concern. The chronicity of neglect is uncertain; the recent symptom exacerbation and systemic signs may reflect a progression of underlying oral disease, likely more severe due to consistent poor hygiene. The guarded communication necessitates corroborating her history with clinical examination to identify ulcer size, distribution, evidence of secondary infection, or tissue necrosis. Additional inquiry into the duration of symptoms, exact hygiene practices, and presence of other systemic or local signs is essential to fully understand her condition.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female. Chief complaint: Oral soreness with ulcers, suspected to be more extensive than patient reports suggest. Present illness: She reports a several-day history of oral ulcers and soreness, with associated bad breath, fever, and fatigue. She states her oral hygiene routine has been inconsistent, averaging brushing once daily or less, and often skipping rinsing, primarily due to discomfort and a busy schedule. She acknowledges that her hygiene has likely declined recently. Associated symptoms: Fever and fatigue are reported but status and severity require clinical evaluation. She does not report other systemic or mucocutaneous symptoms such as skin rashes or bleeding, though her communication biases suggest potential underreporting of neglect. Timeline: Symptoms have been present for multiple days; neglect likely predates current symptoms, potentially extending over weeks or months. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: She currently exhibits oral ulcers, soreness, bad breath, fever, and fatigue. - Medium confidence: Actual extent of oral tissue damage and neglect severity are likely greater than reported, with more extensive ulceration or secondary infection present. - Low confidence: The full duration and depth of neglect owing to guarded reporting. - Missing information: Precise frequency and thoroughness of oral care routines, progression of tissue injury, and any other systemic or local signs.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, minimizing language when describing her oral hygiene routine, externalizing blame on stress, and shows guarded responses. She admits to skipping routines but avoids specifics suggesting embarrassment. Her tone hints at defensiveness and shame, especially concerning her neglect. She is more direct when reporting physical symptoms like fever, which she perceives as more serious. - Bias detected: Moderate \"information withholder\" bias primarily affecting her description of routine habits. She minimizes frequency and possibly neglects the severity of her oral care deficits to avoid judgment or shame. - Confidence level: Medium. The systemic symptoms are likely accurate; routine habits are probably worse than disclosed. - Reasoning: This conclusion stems from her vagueness, external attributions, and defensiveness when discussing oral care; these are typical signs of efforts to conceal or downplay behaviors she perceives as socially undesirable or embarrassing.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Actual neglect may involve more days skipped, less thorough brushing, or higher levels of oral pathology than she admits, given her vague reporting. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed about severe oral problems (e.g., bleeding, pain, bad breath) or about neglect-related concerns beyond her control (psychological stress), leading to underreporting. - Amplified concerns: She appears to report systemic symptoms straightforwardly, but her anxiety about severity might be somewhat amplified, or aligned with actual concern, yet the neglect behind symptoms is likely worse. - Temporal distortions: She may have had ongoing neglect prior to symptom onset, not just recent lapses, but her memory or insight is limited, causing underestimation of duration or severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Given these considerations, the true clinical picture probably involves persistent, possibly severe oral neglect manifested by infrequent or superficial cleaning routines over a longer period, contributing to the development of oral ulcers, infection, or other pathology. Her systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue) likely reflect actual illness possibly worsened by neglect. The neglect is more extensive than she reports, with ongoing emotional stress possibly compounding her behaviors. There is a risk of more advanced oral disease that she is hesitant to fully disclose, compounded by emotional factors like shame.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how many days in a typical week you brush your teeth, and how long you spend?\" (To clarify actual routine and uncover any ongoing neglect) - \"Are there particular times during the day when you find it hardest to do your mouth care? What makes it difficult?\" (To identify stress or practical barriers) - \"Have you noticed any other oral problems like bleeding, bad taste, or worsening ulcers that you haven't mentioned?\" (To uncover omitted symptoms) - \"How do you feel emotionally about maintaining your oral health? Do you feel overwhelmed or guilty about neglect?\" (To understand psychological factors influencing behavior) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental tone, emphasizing understanding and support to reduce shame and encourage honesty. - Priority order: Start with clarifying routine specifics, followed by exploring emotional and stress-related factors, then ask about other oral symptoms. This sequence builds trust and helps unearth hidden details.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication indicates tendencies toward minimizing and reluctant disclosures regarding oral hygiene routines, likely due to shame or embarrassment about neglecting oral care. She admits to infrequent brushing (once daily or less) and skipping days, especially during stressful periods, but her vague language suggests she may be concealing the true extent of neglect or severity. She reports systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue openly, which are probably accurate, but her description of oral symptoms such as soreness and ulcers may underestimate their severity or duration. The mention of increased pain with spicy or acidic foods aligns with ulcerative oral lesions, but the overall neglect of routine care points to a more advanced or persistent oral pathology than initially acknowledged. Additional psychological factors, including stress and possible guilt about neglect, could be influencing her reporting. Therefore, the objective clinical picture likely involves more severe oral disease resulting from inconsistent or superficial oral hygiene practices over an extended period, with systemic symptoms reflecting an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process. More specific inquiry into her day-to-day oral care habits and emotional state is necessary to fully assess the extent of neglect and pathology.\nANSWER: The patient is a woman presenting with oral ulcerations and soreness that began several days prior, associated with difficulty maintaining oral hygiene, which she reports as infrequent brushing (approximately once daily or less) with certain days skipped, particularly when stressed. She reports systemic symptoms including fever and general tiredness. She estimates that her oral care routine has been irregular, likely more neglectful than she admits, especially during stressful periods, contributing to the development of oral ulcers and possible infectious or inflammatory complications. Physical examination findings are expected to include oral ulcers, decreased oral hygiene, and secondary signs such as bad breath; systemic symptoms reinforce the likelihood of an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further assessment is needed to quantify her oral hygiene behavior and explore psychological factors influencing her neglect, as her current self-report may underestimate the true severity and duration of her symptoms.",
