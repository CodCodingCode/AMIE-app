My stomach feels distended, like it\\u2019s swollen up or something, and it\\u2019s really uncomfortable. I started feeling this way a few hours ago after lunch. It just kept getting worse, and I\\u2019ve been vomiting and feeling nauseous. My stomach looks bigger than usual, and I feel this constant ache. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong, but I\\u2019m worried it might be something serious.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: She is cautious and emotionally engaged, volunteers detailed symptoms and timeline without evident deception. Her language indicates concern and mild embarrassment, with no overt withholding but slight minimization or downplaying of less severe symptoms. - Bias detected: Elevated anxiety bias influencing her perception of severity and seriousness of her symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium-high; her detailed account and consistent timeline support a reliable report but her concern enhances perceived severity. - Reasoning: She shows typical signs of health-related anxiety, emphasizing potential worst-case scenarios but maintains openness, suggesting her report is trustworthy with some distortion toward exaggeration of risk.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild, ongoing discomforts or intermittent issues prior to recent onset that she perceives as insignificant but could be relevant. - Withheld information: Possible emotional stressors, past GI issues, or health anxieties\u2014less likely to be openly shared due to embarrassment or concern about seeming overreactive. - Amplified concerns: Her fear of a serious or life-threatening condition may be exaggerated by anxiety; she could perceive normal or benign symptoms as alarming. - Temporal distortions: Her focus on last few hours may overlook subtle, evolving symptoms over days or weeks that contribute to her current state.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would likely describe a patient with mild, possibly chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that recently intensified, prompting significant concern. The primary symptoms include nonspecific discomfort, distension, nausea, and vomiting, with an acute onset at lunch. Her emotional state amplifies perceived danger, although her responses are consistent and detailed. There is likely underlying anxiety influencing her interpretation of symptoms, which could lead her to overestimate severity. She may have prior episodes of mild GI upset that she perceives as unremarkable but are relevant for differential diagnosis.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you experienced similar symptoms before? How often? How severe were they?\" to gauge baseline; \"Do you have any ongoing medical problems or past GI issues?\" to assess history; \"Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or bowel changes?\" to clarify associated symptoms; \"How do you typically cope with health concerns or anxiety?\" to understand emotional context. - Approach strategy: Use a calm, empathetic tone to validate her concern while gently normalizing common GI issues. Encourage her to describe her prior health experiences without judgment, and reassure her that open sharing will help determine if urgent care is needed. - Priority order: First, inquire about her medical history and prior episodes to establish a baseline; second, explore associated symptoms and emotional factors; third, clarify her understanding and fears to address exaggerated concerns sensitively.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient emphasizes recent and severe gastrointestinal symptoms, likely influenced by anxiety and concern, which may lead her to overstate the severity but does not show signs of deception or withholding specific symptoms. Her detailed symptom description suggests genuine discomfort, but her heightened concern and emotional engagement could cause her to perceive her condition as more critical than it objectively is. She may have had milder, intermittent GI issues prior to this acute presentation that she perceives as insignificant, and she may be hesitant to disclose emotional stressors or prior episodes. The recent onset after lunch aligns with possible acute GI disturbance, but her focus on the sudden worsening might amplify perceived severity. Additional information on her medical history and prior episodes is needed to fully contextualize her current presentation.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old, female.  Chief complaint: Recent onset of abdominal distension and discomfort, with nausea and vomiting, post-lunch.  Present illness: The patient reports feeling her abdomen has become swollen and uncomfortable within a few hours after eating, accompanied by nausea and vomiting that started around the same time. She describes a persistent abdominal ache and increased distention, which she perceives as severe. Her account suggests the onset was acute, but she may be exaggerating perceived severity due to anxiety. She does not report fever, diarrhea, constipation, or weight loss. Prior gastrointestinal issues are not specifically reported, but she might have experienced mild or intermittent discomfort previously.  Associated symptoms: No recorded fever, bowel habit changes, or weight changes; certainty is moderate due to her focus on current symptoms and potential underreporting of related issues.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports acute onset of abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting after lunch. - Medium confidence: Her description of symptom severity and concern level, influenced by anxiety, may overstate actual severity. - Low confidence: Exact prior gastrointestinal history, emotional stressors, and previous episodes are unknown and require further inquiry. - Missing information: Details on past GI history, associated symptoms like fever or bowel changes, emotional stressors, and prior episodes of similar symptoms.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with an acute onset of abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting starting a few hours after lunch. She reports her abdomen appears swollen and feels mildly to moderately uncomfortable, with persistent ache. Her concern about severity is influenced by anxiety, which may have led her to overreport the intensity of symptoms. She denies associated fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss based on current report but may underreport including previous mild GI issues or emotional stressors. Further evaluation of her medical history and associated symptoms is needed to determine the underlying cause and assess urgency.",

She reports her abdomen appears swollen and feels mildly to moderately uncomfortable, with persistent ache. Her concern about severity is influenced by anxiety, which may have led her to overreport the intensity of symptoms. She denies associated fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss based on current report but may underreport including previous mild GI issues or emotional stressors. Further evaluation of her medical history and associated symptoms is needed to determine the underlying cause and assess urgency.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Mrs. Grant communicates using cautious, mildly expressive language, tending to understate her emotional distress and physical symptoms. She provides brief, organized answers, and introduces qualifiers that suggest restraint and possibly minimization. Her responses reflect guardedness, with limited elaboration unless prompted explicitly. - Bias detected: The primary bias affecting her reporting is **Minimization bias**, evidenced by her downplaying the severity of her physical discomfort and emotional worry. Her cautious tone and vague descriptions support this. There may also be some amplification of concern driven by anxiety, but overall, her communication is restrained. - Confidence level: Medium. While her physical symptoms seem reasonably reported, her emotional state and overall distress are likely underrepresented due to guarded communication. - Reasoning: Her language choices, brevity, and reluctance to disclose deeper feelings point toward a tendency to minimize or safeguard her vulnerability, common in older adults or culturally influenced communication styles.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might have more intense or persistent discomfort, possibly mild pain or discomfort that she perceives as not serious enough to mention or fears may alarm others. - Withheld information: Emotional reactions such as significant anxiety, fears for health, or previous mild episodes of similar symptoms might be understated due to shame, embarrassment, or cultural norms discouraging emotional vulnerability. She may also be hesitant to reveal prior health or GI issues that could inform her current presentation. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about the seriousness of her symptoms appears prominent, potentially exaggerated by underlying anxiety, which could be causing her to fixate excessively on health fears despite the physical symptoms being mild or moderate. - Temporal distortions: Likely no major recall issues, but she may underreport gradual buildup of symptoms or previous similar experiences that could contextualize her current state.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased presentation probably involves a middle-range severity of symptoms\u2014moderate discomfort, persistent nausea, and swelling that may be more pronounced than she reports. Her emotional distress, including anxiety, is probably more intense and sustained than evident, with possible prior mild GI episodes or chronic worries. She may be experiencing more significant stress or health concerns that she is reluctant to share openly. Her true anxiety level and physical discomfort are likely understated, which could delay recognition of urgent underlying pathology if only surface-level information is relied upon.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your bowel habits or weight in the past few days?\" (to uncover additional symptoms) - \"How have you been feeling emotionally besides today? Do you often feel anxious or worried about your health?\" (to assess underlying anxiety) - \"Have you experienced similar stomach discomfort or swelling before? If so, how often?\" (to evaluate chronicity) - \"Are there other symptoms you haven't mentioned that concern you?\" (to check for total symptom burden) - Approach strategy: - Use a calm, empathetic tone to encourage openness, affirming her courage in sharing and framing questions gently. - Normalize emotional expression to reduce shame or embarrassment, e.g., \"Many people find it hard to talk about anxiety or vulnerability, but sharing helps us understand better.\" - Reassure her that candid discussion is safe and that her experiences are valid regardless of severity. - Priority order: 1. Expand on emotional state and past health history to uncover underlying issues. 2. Clarify previous episodes or mild symptoms for context. 3. Investigate associated physical symptoms more thoroughly. 4. Assess her perception of health and fears about seriousness to gauge anxiety and concerns.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses cautious and restrained language, which suggests a tendency to minimize her symptoms and emotional distress. She reports acute abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting starting a few hours after lunch, with her description indicating moderate physical symptoms. Given her communication pattern, it's likely she underreports the severity of her discomfort and emotional concerns. She may also be withholding or not fully expressing other physical symptoms such as more intense pain, new bowel changes, or additional prior episodes of similar issues. Her indicated concern about severity appears amplified by anxiety, which suggests her perceived threat may be overrepresented relative to objective findings. Consequently, her actual physical symptoms might be more pronounced, and her emotional distress more intense than she admits. More detailed information about bowel habits, prior episodes, and emotional state is necessary to fully assess her condition. Overall, physical symptoms are likely moderate, with underlying anxiety potentially heightening her concern, but her guarded communication obscures the full extent of her clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Acute abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting beginning a few hours after lunch.  Present illness: The patient reports moderate abdominal swelling, discomfort with a persistent ache, nausea, and vomiting. She describes her symptoms as intensifying over several hours but perhaps understates their severity. She may have more intense discomfort and distress than conveyed. She denies fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss based on her report, but these may be underreported. The onset was acute, following lunch, with symptoms persisting since then.  Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms such as fever, changes in bowel movements, or weight loss have been reported, though underreporting cannot be ruled out confidently.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s basic demographic data and the timeline of recent symptom onset. - Medium confidence: The severity of physical symptoms and emotional distress, likely understated due to guarded communication. - Low confidence: The true extent of internal physical and emotional symptoms, which may be more intense than reported. - Missing information: Detailed history of prior gastrointestinal issues, comprehensive review of bowel habits, stress, and emotional health, and a thorough physical exam.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with an acute onset of abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting that began several hours after lunch. She describes her abdomen as swollen and reports persistent moderate discomfort with an ache, although her language suggests these symptoms may be more severe than she indicates. She denies fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss at this time, but these may be underreported. Her emotional state includes anxiety, which may be amplifying her concern about the severity of her symptoms. Additional clinical information, including previous gastrointestinal history, detailed assessment of bowel function, and a full physical examination, are necessary to determine the underlying cause and whether there is an urgent pathology.",

She describes her abdomen as swollen and reports persistent moderate discomfort with an ache, although her language suggests these symptoms may be more severe than she indicates. She denies fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss at this time, but these may be underreported. Her emotional state includes anxiety, which may be amplifying her concern about the severity of her symptoms. Additional clinical information, including previous gastrointestinal history, detailed assessment of bowel function, and a full physical examination, are necessary to determine the underlying cause and whether there is an urgent pathology.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides a detailed account of her physical symptoms but responds minimally and cautiously about her emotional state. Her language is guarded, with vague and minimizing expressions (\"try not to think about it too much\"), suggesting she is intentionally restraining her emotional disclosures. She shows reluctance to elaborate on feelings, indicating discomfort or cultural influence toward stoicism. - Bias detected: Emotional underreporting/minimization bias\u2014she underplays her anxiety and emotional distress, likely to avoid vulnerability or due to embarrassment. - Confidence level: Medium; her physical description appears accurate, but her emotional reporting is likely underestimating the actual severity. - Reasoning: Her guarded responses and language choices support the presence of bias, affecting her emotional self-reporting more than her physical symptoms.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true extent of her anxiety and emotional suffering may be greater; she might be experiencing persistent worry, sleep disturbances, or depressive feelings not conveyed. - Withheld information: She may feel embarrassed or ashamed to disclose psychological issues, such as feelings of hopelessness, tearfulness, or social withdrawal. - Amplified concerns: While she worries about her physical health, her concern may be disproportionate or driven by health-related anxiety, which she suppresses emotionally. - Temporal distortions: Her worries may be ongoing rather than episodic, but she minimizes this, possibly viewing her distress as occasional or mild.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, I infer that her physical symptoms are genuine and acute but may be exacerbated by unacknowledged moderate to severe anxiety. Her emotional distress is likely more persistent and impactful than she admits\u2014possibly including health anxiety, underlying depression, or somatic preoccupation. Her timeline suggests ongoing worry that she minimizes; her physical symptoms may be signs of an acute gastrointestinal issue with potential psychological overlays. Her guarded communication prevents full understanding, which warrants further sensitive exploration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally over the past days or weeks? Do you notice any changes in your mood, sleep, or energy?\" (to uncover underlying depression or anxiety) * \"Are there worries or thoughts that keep coming back, even when you're not focusing on your stomach?\" (to assess rumination or health anxiety) * \"How do these feelings affect your daily life\u2014your activities, sleep, or relationships?\" (to gauge functional impact) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language, emphasizing that many people experience worries or emotional difficulties during health concerns, encouraging openness. - Priority order: First, clarify her emotional state and functional impact to understand the full psychological context, then explore her physical symptoms further\u2014this helps balance her guarded stance and invites trust.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication style suggests that her emotional distress and anxiety are likely underreported and more significant than she acknowledges. Her physical symptoms\u2014acute abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting following lunch\u2014are reliably reported and consistent with an acute gastrointestinal process. However, her minimal emotional disclosures and statements indicating she \"tries not to think about it\" imply she may be experiencing ongoing, possibly severe anxiety or mood disturbances that she is reluctant to openly discuss. Therefore, while her physical symptoms seem genuine and acute, there is a high likelihood that her emotional state is more complex and impactful than conveyed, potentially contributing to her perceived severity or perception of symptoms. Additional exploration is necessary to fully assess her psychological health and its influence on her presentation.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Acute onset of abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting starting several hours after lunch.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing abdominal swelling and persistent ache, with nausea and vomiting beginning a few hours post-meal. Symptom severity appears moderate to severe clinically, but her language suggests potential underestimation. Physical symptoms are objective, consistent with an acute gastrointestinal issue. She denies fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss at this time, though these may be underreported or not yet evident. Her emotional state includes anxiety that she minimizes, indicating a possible underlying psychological distress that might exacerbate her physical symptoms or affect her perception. Her responses suggest ongoing worry that she suppresses, potentially including more severe psychological symptoms such as depression or health anxiety.  Associated symptoms: No reported fever, diarrhea, constipation, or significant weight loss, but these could be absent or unmentioned due to guarded communication.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The physical symptoms of abdominal distension and vomiting are accurately reported and clinically consistent. - Medium confidence: Her emotional distress and anxiety symptoms are likely underreported and more profound than expressed. - Low confidence: The full extent of her psychological symptoms, including possible depression or chronic anxiety, remains uncertain. - Missing information: Details about her gastrointestinal history, full review of systems, mental health history, and further psychological assessment are needed.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with an acute onset of abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting that began several hours after lunch. The physical symptoms are consistent with an acute gastrointestinal process, with objective findings of abdominal swelling and moderate discomfort. She reports no fever, bowel habit changes, or weight loss at this time; however, these symptoms require further assessment to confirm or exclude additional pathology. Her emotional state includes anxiety that appears to be underreported, with guarded responses suggesting possible underlying psychological distress such as health anxiety or mood disorder. Further exploration of her mental health, as well as additional diagnostic evaluations, are recommended to determine the underlying cause of the gastrointestinal symptoms and assess the impact of psychological factors.",

Further exploration of her mental health, as well as additional diagnostic evaluations, are recommended to determine the underlying cause of the gastrointestinal symptoms and assess the impact of psychological factors.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides brief, hedged, and minimally detailed responses when discussing emotional distress, indicating guardedness and reluctance to fully disclose her inner feelings. - Bias detected: Emotional minimization bias, as she downplays her worries and avoids detailed emotional conversation, likely to present a more resilient image. - Confidence level: Medium; the communication patterns suggest underreporting, but some emotional awareness is evident. - Reasoning: The patient\u2019s language choices and response style show an intentional or subconscious effort to minimize the severity of her emotional state, consistent with minimization bias.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her anxiety is probably more pervasive and intense than she reports, possibly affecting her daily life and overall mood. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to share feelings of vulnerability, shame, or fear about emotional or mental health issues. - Amplified concerns: She appears preoccupied with health fears, but these might be intertwined with deeper anxiety or mood conditions not openly acknowledged. - Temporal distortions: Her emotional distress may be more chronic, with recent physical symptoms triggering a stronger but understated emotional response.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a woman experiencing significant, chronic health anxiety and some underlying mood symptoms, with emotional distress that she underreports due to guardedness or stigma. Her physical symptoms are acute and objective but may be compounded by psychological factors that require further assessment, including screening for depression, generalized anxiety, or somatic symptom disorder to fully understand her emotional condition.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about what worries you most about your health?\" and \"When you feel anxious, how does that affect your daily activities?\" to gauge the intensity and persistence. Also, \"Do you often find yourself thinking about health or other worries even when you're not feeling physical symptoms?\" to explore rumination. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental inquiry emphasizing safety and support (\"It\u2019s common to worry sometimes. Can you tell me more about these worries?\") to encourage openness without feeling judged. - Priority order: Start with detailed exploration of her health fears to validate her concerns, then gently probe emotional impact with open-ended questions, and finally assess for mood or anxiety symptoms using standardized tools if appropriate.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication patterns reveal guardedness and minimization of emotional distress, which suggests her reported worries and anxiety are likely underrepresented. While she clearly reports acute gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, her emotional state may be more severe than she admits, potentially affecting her overall health and well-being. Her relatively brief and hedged responses imply she may be hesitant to disclose the full extent of her anxiety or mood issues, indicating possible underlying psychological factors that are not fully captured. Therefore, the clinical picture should consider both her physical symptoms and the probable presence of more significant emotional distress that she is reluctant to openly discuss.

Although she reports feeling anxious, her communication suggests her emotional distress may be more intense and chronic, but it is likely underreported. Further assessment is needed to evaluate her gastrointestinal condition and to explore underlying psychological factors influencing her presentation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in a guarded, minimal manner, frequently qualifying or minimizing her worries and emotional state. She avoids elaboration and responds cautiously, suggesting discomfort and a tendency to hide true feelings. - Bias detected: Emotional distress withholding bias. - Confidence level: Medium. - Reasoning: This conclusion derives from her frequent use of minimizing phrases, vague responses to emotional inquiries, and apparent discomfort with emotional disclosure, consistent with guardedness and social desirability influences.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her actual anxiety levels, which may be more persistent and severe, are underrepresented. She may experience ongoing worry and emotional distress that she chooses not to disclose fully. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or ashamed to acknowledge vulnerability or emotional struggles, leading to suppression of feelings related to helplessness or shame. - Amplified concerns: She is unlikely to be exaggerating her worries; rather, her underreporting suggests her actual distress could be more significant. - Temporal distortions: She may have experienced episodes of higher anxiety intensity in the past that she prefers not to recall or share, especially when physical symptoms are prominent.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased view likely reveals that Mrs. Grant has more pervasive and possibly chronic anxiety that she feels uncomfortable acknowledging openly. Her emotional distress may be significant but underreported, with physical symptoms potentially arising from or exacerbated by this underlying emotional state. The physical symptoms are probably less severe than her anxiety would suggest if she disclosed fully, and her emotional experience might include feelings of helplessness, shame, or fear that she is avoiding discussing.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling emotionally beyond the worries you mention? Are there times when you feel overwhelmed or unable to cope?\" (rationale: encouraging elaboration on emotional state); \"Have you experienced feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or fear that you haven't mentioned?\" (rationale: uncovering overlooked affective symptoms); \"Are there specific thoughts or memories that come up frequently or bother you?\" (rationale: identifying intrusive or persistent worries). - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to create a safe environment for emotional sharing; validate her effort to conceal feelings and reassure her that it's okay to express vulnerability. - Priority order: First, explore emotional experiences to uncover the true severity; second, inquire about functional impact; third, address physical symptoms in context of emotional findings to develop an integrated treatment plan.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with acute gastrointestinal symptoms\u2014abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting\u2014beginning a few hours after lunch. These findings are directly observable and reportable, with physical examination expected to confirm abdominal swelling and tenderness. Although she reports feeling anxious, her communication indicates a guarded and minimizing approach when discussing her emotional state; she is likely experiencing more significant and chronic anxiety than openly acknowledged. She tends to qualify or downplay her worries, which suggests her emotional distress may be underrepresented, and she might be concealing deeper feelings of helplessness or fear. The physical symptoms may be exacerbated by underlying emotional factors, but physical illness remains the primary concern at present. Additional assessment of her emotional state is necessary to elucidate the full scope of her psychological well-being. The timeline of symptoms suggests an acute onset following recent food intake, with possible influence from underlying stress or anxiety contributing to her presentation. Confidence in reporting her physical symptoms is high, whereas confidence regarding her emotional state is medium, due to communication barriers and possible concealment. More information about her broader psychological history and functional impact of her symptoms is needed to guide comprehensive management.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with an acute onset of abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and vomiting occurring several hours after lunch. Physical examination would likely reveal abdominal swelling and tenderness. She denies current fever, altered bowel habits, and weight loss but reports feeling anxious about her symptoms. Her communication style suggests guardedness and minimization of emotional distress, indicating she may experience more pervasive and chronic anxiety that is underreported. Physical symptoms are consistent with her report, but underlying emotional factors potentially contribute to her presentation. Further assessment of her psychological state and functional impact is recommended to fully understand her condition.",
