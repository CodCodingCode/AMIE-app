    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: I\u2019m a 7-year-old boy, and I\u2019ve been having a lot of trouble with my movements. I used to be a little clumsy, but now I fall a lot and my speech isn\u2019t clear anymore. It\u2019s been getting worse over the year, and I feel kind of weird.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how his symptoms have changed over time and how he's been doing day-to-day, including any new behaviors or concerns you've noticed?\\nPATIENT: Well, he used to just be a little unsteady sometimes, but lately, he's been falling more often and seems to have a hard time talking clearly. He also gets really restless and makes strange movements that he didn't do before. It feels like he's not the same as he was a while ago, and it worries me because I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening or if it will get worse.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your son has been doing lately\u2014any new behaviors, changes in mood or personality, or anything else you've noticed that seems different from before?\\nPATIENT: Um, he\u2019s been, uh, like, a bit more moody sometimes. He gets really upset about small things, and he\u2019s been a little more tired or distant. And I think he\u2019s forgetful now \u2014 he can\u2019t remember stuff about his school and sometimes gets confused. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not himself.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your son has been doing overall lately\u2014any new behaviors, emotional changes, or anything else you've noticed that seems different from before?\\nPATIENT: Um, he\u2019s been kind of different lately... more moody sometimes, and he doesn\u2019t wanna play like he used to. He gets really frustrated with small things and gets upset easily. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not himself, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son shown any other symptoms like jaundice, abdominal swelling, or change in eye color (appearance of rings), which might suggest Wilson\u2019s disease?\\nPATIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. He doesn\u2019t seem to have that yellow color or anything like that that I\u2019ve noticed. Nothing like that has shown up.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son experienced any seizures, loss of consciousness, or sensory changes such as numbness or visual disturbances?\\nPATIENT: No, he hasn't had any seizures or passing out, and I don't think he's noticed any numbness or changes with his sight or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son experienced any developmental delays or regressions in skills such as language, motor skills, or social interactions prior to this current period of worsening?\\nPATIENT: Um, he was kinda okay for a while, I think? I mean, he was talking and walking, but maybe not perfectly, but then suddenly now everything\u2019s just so different\u2014he just, I don\u2019t know, can\u2019t catch up with himself anymore.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son been on any new medications or treatments lately, and have you noticed if his symptoms are improving, staying the same, or getting worse despite these efforts?\\nPATIENT: Um, no, we haven't given him anything new lately, and honestly, I don't really know if it\u2019s better or worse. Sometimes he seems like he\u2019s falling more, and other times he just can\u2019t talk right. It\u2019s just all kind of confusing for him.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son experienced any noticeable changes in his mood, sleep patterns, or daily routines recently, such as increased agitation, sadness, difficulty sleeping, or any new behaviors?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, he\u2019s been a bit more fussy than before, and sometimes he gets really restless and can\u2019t sit still, even when he\u2019s supposed to be resting. He\u2019s also waking up during the night more often, crying or calling out, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent changes in your son's behavior, such as increased irritability, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, or episodes of agitation or emotional outbursts?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, he\u2019s been kinda moody sometimes, more than usual I guess, and he's been having trouble sitting still or calming down, like he gets upset really easily now. It's been kind of confusing for us.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son been evaluated for Kayser-Fleischer rings or any signs of liver issues, such as jaundice or abdominal swelling?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, I don't know if I saw anything like that. He hasn't looked yellow or swollen or anything like that, but I haven't really paid attention to his eyes or his tummy much.",
