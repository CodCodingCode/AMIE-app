I also noticed that after I take a warm shower, my skin starts to itch like crazy, and my vision isn\\u2019t as clear as it used to be sometimes, especially later in the day. I\\u2019ve been feeling more tired than usual too, like I just don\\u2019t have any energy, even when I rest.

Responses are concise, and there is a possible reluctance to fully disclose the severity of distress or functional impact.\n- Bias detected: The main bias is \"stoic minimization,\" leading to underreporting of symptom severity and emotional impact.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014it's clear they are downplaying symptoms, but precise severity and emotional distress are likely underestimated.\n- Reasoning: Based on their use of non-specific language, guarded responses, and absence of elaboration, alongside their disclosure of concerning medical history, it's probable that the patient's actual experience is more intense and distressing than conveyed.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n1. \"Can you tell me more about how dizziness affects your daily activities?\" \u2014 to gauge functional impact and severity.\n2. \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like weakness, numbness, or chest discomfort?\" \u2014 to uncover potential omitted neurological or systemic symptoms.\n3. \"How do your symptoms affect your mood or emotional well-being?\" \u2014 to explore emotional distress not expressed verbally.\n4. \"Have the symptoms been worsening or changing recently?\" \u2014 to clarify the progression.\n5. \"Are there times when you feel you can't manage your symptoms on your own?\" \u2014 to assess distress level and need for support.\n- Approach strategy: Frame questions gently, emphasizing understanding rather than judgment, to encourage openness. Use open-ended questions and reflect back concerns to validate feelings, helping the patient feel safe revealing more.\n- Priority order: Start with functional and physical questions (questions 1 and 2) to elicit concrete details about symptoms, then explore emotional impact (question 3), followed by progression (question 4), and finally assess coping and distress (question 5). This sequence allows building rapport and gradually uncovering deeper issues, respecting their stoic tendency while gently encouraging fuller disclosure.",

Based on their responses, I believe their true symptom severity and impact are underestimated, but without additional probing, the full picture remains unclear.\n- Reasoning: Their cautious language, refusal to elaborate, and minimization cues point toward a pattern of under-reporting, which can obscure the true clinical severity.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me more about how fatigue affects your daily activities? Do you find yourself needing more rest or difficulty with routine tasks?\" (to uncover functional impairment)\n- \"Have you experienced any episodes of fainting, weakness, or balance problems?\" (to assess for more serious neurological signs)\n- \"How often do the dizziness and vision issues occur, and do they ever happen suddenly or severely?\" (to evaluate true episodic severity)\n- \"Are there things you're hesitant to share about how you're feeling emotionally or physically? Anything you've been embarrassed or worried about?\" (to identify potential emotional barriers)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use empathetic, non-judgmental language to create a safe environment, encouraging openness.\n- Express understanding that many symptoms can be subtle or difficult to discuss, normalizing their experience.\n- Use specific, behaviorally anchored questions to reduce ambiguity and help them articulate their experiences more fully.\n- Priority order:\n- First, explore the functional impact of their symptoms to get a sense of real-life impairment.\n- Next, probe for more severe or episodic neurological symptoms that might be hidden.\n- Then, address emotional or psychological concerns indirectly, to uncover any suppressed emotional distress.\n- Finally, clarify timeline and progression details to accurately understand symptom evolution.",

Chief complaint: Intermittent dizziness, headaches, and visual disturbances persisting for approximately two weeks.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, cautious language with hedging and minimal elaboration when describing their symptoms. They tend to downplay severity and avoid emotional disclosure, likely as a means of self-protection or to maintain composure.\n- Bias detected: \"Stoic Minimizer\" bias, evidenced by frequent qualifiers, brief responses, and suppression of the full extent of symptoms.\n- Confidence level: Medium, given the consistency of masking behaviors in their responses and the context of their known medical history.\n- Reasoning: These patterns indicate deliberate or subconscious effort to minimize their health issues, which suggests that the true symptom burden is greater than reported, and that their emotional or physical distress may be underrepresented.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me more about how often you experience dizziness and how long it tends to last each time? Are these episodes happening daily or just a few times a week?\" (to clarify frequency and severity)\n- \"Do you notice any other symptoms, like feeling weak, nauseous, or mentally foggy, that you might not have mentioned yet?\" (to identify potential omitted symptoms)\n- \"When your symptoms are worse, how does it affect your daily activities or ability to concentrate?\" (to assess functional impact)\n- \"Have your symptoms changed or become more intense since they first started?\" (to understand progression)\n- \"Are you experiencing any other health concerns or worries about your health?\" (to gauge underlying anxiety)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use empathetic, non-judgmental language\u2014acknowledge their efforts to be honest and reassure them that detailed sharing helps in providing the best care.\n- Frame questions gently, emphasizing that many symptoms can be subtle and that being thorough helps ensure nothing important is missed.\n- Normalize their experience to reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment.\n- Priority order:\n1. Clarify symptom frequency and severity to get a more accurate picture of their current health status.\n2. Explore associated or omitted symptoms that could be relevant for diagnosis.\n3. Investigate functional impact and distress levels to assess the true burden.\n4. Address their concerns and anxieties directly to understand psychological factors influencing their reporting.",

I\\u2019ve been feeling more tired than usual too, like I just don\\u2019t have any energy, even when I rest.
