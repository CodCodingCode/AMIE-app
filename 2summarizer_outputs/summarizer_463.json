I just need to know what\\u2019s going on\\u2014am I gonna be okay?\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: George communicates mainly through straightforward descriptions of physical symptoms and expresses concern about serious illness, but minimizes the severity of bleeding (\"just streaks,\" \"sometimes more\") possibly to avoid alarm. His emotional distress is present but not overtly exaggerated, and he is open overall. - Bias detected: Slight minimization bias affecting blood severity perception; he may understate the clinical significance to manage his anxiety or avoid overwhelming himself. - Confidence level: Medium; while he provides detailed symptom descriptions, the subtle minimization warrants cautious interpretation. - Reasoning: The downward language about blood indicates an intent to downplay severity, common in anxious patients trying to control fears, which could lead to underappreciation of bleeding severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The frequency and volume of blood, or episodes of heavier bleeding, may be more significant than reported. - Withheld information: Emotional impacts such as fear, potential depression, or social withdrawal might be understated due to discomfort or resignation. - Amplified concerns: His fear of cancer and serious illness seems proportionate; no evidence of fear amplification beyond realistic concern. - Temporal distortions: Timeline seems consistent, but emotional or psychological impacts may be understated or rationalized to cope.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves a patient with a two-month history of progressive respiratory symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath, with episodic hemoptysis that may be more severe than described. The bleeding could be more extensive, and emotional distress related to health concerns is present but less openly acknowledged. The physical symptoms probably reflect underlying pulmonary or hematologic pathology, possibly malignancy, considering his fears. The emotional component might be affectively restrained but significant.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly how much blood you've coughed up each time? Have the bleeding episodes increased in frequency or amount?\" (to clarify severity); \"How are these symptoms affecting your daily life and emotional well-being?\" (to uncover emotional impact); \"Are you experiencing any weight loss, night sweats, or fever?\" (to detect systemic symptoms); \"Have you felt anxious or overwhelmed about your health?\" (to assess emotional state). - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language, normalize fears, and gently encourage sharing emotional experiences to reduce shame or denial. - Priority order: First clarify physical symptom details, then explore emotional and social aspects, allowing trust to build and ensuring accurate assessment of severity and impact.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with subjective reports of cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and decreased appetite. However, the patient appears to minimize the severity of bleeding (\"just streaks,\" \"sometimes more\"), which suggests the actual bleeding may be more significant. The patient's emotional concern about serious illness, such as cancer, is evident but not overtly expressed, indicating underlying anxiety that might influence their reporting. The mention of symptoms lasting \"a while now\" and being worse over time suggests a subacute to chronic course, possibly over a two-month period. Communication patterns imply that physical symptoms are reliably reported, but the bleeding severity is likely underestimated, and emotional distress may be understated or rationalized. Additional details about the quantity of blood, systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats), weight loss, and emotional state are needed for comprehensive assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult male (exact age unspecified)  Chief complaint: Progressive cough, hemoptysis, and exertional shortness of breath, with decreased appetite  Present illness: The patient reports a two-month history of worsening respiratory symptoms, including persistent cough and shortness of breath with exertion. He describes experiencing episodes of hemoptysis characterized by streaks of blood, sometimes more substantial, but minimizes the severity. The symptoms have been gradually worsening over time. He reports weight loss and emotional distress but downplays the extent of bleeding, possibly underestimating severity due to anxiety or fear. The timeline suggests a subacute progression of pulmonary symptoms, with some concern about serious underlying pathology, potentially malignancy.  Associated symptoms: Decreased appetite, possible weight loss, emotional concern about health status, but specifics such as fever, night sweats, or systemic symptoms are not confirmed and need further inquiry.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The duration and nature of respiratory symptoms, presence of hemoptysis, exertional dyspnea, and decreased appetite. - Medium confidence: The actual severity of hemoptysis is likely greater than reported due to minimization bias. - Low confidence: The emotional impact and systemic symptoms are potentially understated; more detailed assessment needed. - Missing information: Quantitative details of hemoptysis, presence of systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats), weight changes, emotional impact, and systemic examination findings.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult male presenting with a two-month history of gradually worsening cough, exertional shortness of breath, and episodic hemoptysis described as streaks of blood that he notes as sometimes more significant but tends to minimize. He reports decreased appetite and weight loss but downplays the severity of bleeding, indicating possible underestimation. Emotional concern about serious illness, such as cancer, is present but not openly expressed. The chronicity and progression of his respiratory symptoms suggest a need for further evaluation to determine underlying pulmonary or hematologic pathology, with particular attention to accurately assessing the severity of hemoptysis and systemic symptoms.",

Emotional concern about serious illness, such as cancer, is present but not openly expressed. The chronicity and progression of his respiratory symptoms suggest a need for further evaluation to determine underlying pulmonary or hematologic pathology, with particular attention to accurately assessing the severity of hemoptysis and systemic symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient is open about symptoms but uses emotionally charged language, which likely exaggerates perceived severity. He expresses concern about serious illness, emphasizing fears and distress, with some hesitations when discussing blood, indicating possible embarrassment or shame. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias influences his reporting, leading to overemphasizing severity, especially regarding bleeding and respiratory symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium; the core symptoms are clear, but emotional overlay suggests some overstatement. - Reasoning: The emotional language and expressed fears indicate potential overestimation of danger, while the overall organized responses suggest genuine symptoms but with bias from distress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual severity and persistence of weight loss and respiratory decline might be worse than portrayed, as fear and distress can distort perception. - Withheld information: Detailed description of bleeding (exact amount and frequency), other systemic signs like night sweats or fever, and coping responses might be disclosed if asked directly. - Amplified concerns: The patient\u2019s fears about cancer and prognosis are likely heightened\u2014emotional distress amplifies perceived threat beyond objective clinical risk. - Temporal distortions: The perceived rapid deterioration may be overstated; the actual course could be more gradual and less alarming.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the true clinical situation likely involves a progressive respiratory illness over two months with intermittent hemoptysis that might be more persistent than described. Weight loss is probably moderate but more sustained. Blood loss may be underestimated, and fears regarding cancer are understandable but potentially exaggerated by emotional distress. Systemically, other symptoms like night sweats or malaise may be present but unreported, influencing prognosis and urgency. The emotional overlay may cause the patient to overstate immediacy, but underlying pathology warrants prompt, thorough investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly how much blood you've been coughing up each day? How often does this happen?\" \"When did the weight loss start, and how much weight have you lost?\" \"Have you experienced night sweats, fever, or difficulty sleeping?\" \"How are your symptoms affecting your daily activities and mood?\" \"Are you feeling anxious or overwhelmed about what might be causing your symptoms?\" - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic inquiry emphasizing collaboration rather than fear, validating emotions while seeking detailed, factual responses. Clarify that understanding all details helps determine the best outcome, which can reduce anxiety. - Priority order: Start with detailed symptom quantification (blood, weight loss, breathing difficulty), then address emotional impact and fears, to get an accurate core clinical picture while providing reassurance.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional distress and potential exaggeration of symptoms, particularly regarding the severity of bleeding and respiratory impairment. While he reports persistent cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath, his language suggests he may be overestimating the urgency or severity, especially about the bleeding. Conversely, certain symptoms such as weight loss or systemic signs may be underreported or minimized. Emotional factors may influence his perception, leading to possible overstatement of how quickly symptoms worsened or how serious his condition is. Objective assessment requires cautious interpretation, considering that physical findings and additional systemic symptoms have not been detailed yet. Detailed quantification of hemoptysis, weight changes, and other associated features are necessary for accurate diagnosis. The communication pattern indicates that some findings could be more severe than stated, and inquiry should aim to clarify specifics while providing reassurance and gathering comprehensive data.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult male, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Persistent cough with hemoptysis, shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight loss; perceived as worsening symptoms.  Present illness: The patient reports a two-month history of gradually worsening cough, intermittent hemoptysis described as streaks of blood, and increasing exertional dyspnea. He notes weight loss and decreased appetite. Symptom severity might be overrepresented due to emotional distress; actual hemoptysis could be more frequent or voluminous than reported. Systemic symptoms such as night sweats or fever have not been described but may be present, given the context of weight loss and systemic concern. The timeline suggests gradual progression over at least two months, but emotional overlay may cause him to perceive the course as more rapid or severe.  Associated symptoms: Fatigue, potential systemic symptoms like malaise, but these are not explicitly detailed and may be underreported.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss over approximately two months. - Medium confidence: The severity of bleeding and concerns may be exaggerated; actual blood loss could be underestimated. - Low confidence: Exact quantity and frequency of hemoptysis, presence of systemic symptoms like night sweats or fever, and degree of weight loss remain uncertain. - Missing information: Precise amount of blood coughed up daily, detailed weight change, additional systemic symptoms, and emotional impact are needed for comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult male presenting with a two-month history of progressively worsening cough, exertional shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight loss, with reports of intermittent hemoptysis described as streaks of blood that may be more significant than conveyed. He reports feelings of tiredness and decreased appetite, but the subjective emphasis and emotional distress suggest these symptoms might be more severe. Physical findings and further diagnostic evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying cause, with a focus on quantifying hemoptysis, assessing weight trend, and screening for additional systemic symptoms. The patient's emotional state could influence symptom perception, highlighting the importance of detailed, objective inquiry to direct appropriate management.",

The patient's emotional state could influence symptom perception, highlighting the importance of detailed, objective inquiry to direct appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates primarily through brief, emotionally charged statements emphasizing fear and distress, while minimizing the physical severity of symptoms. Responses avoid elaboration on emotional or psychological aspects. - Bias detected: Anxiety amplification bias, with emotional reactions exaggerated yet physical symptoms underreported or minimized. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014based on consistent emotive language and minimization behaviors, though hesitancy to fully disclose details indicates some withholding. - Reasoning: The patient's language indicates authentic distress but also suggests a tendency to amplify emotional responses and downplay physical findings, likely influenced by fear of serious illness.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual extent of bleeding and fatigue may be more severe, potentially involving larger volume hemoptysis and more profound exhaustion. - Withheld information: Fears of lung cancer or terminal illness, which the patient might find shameful or frightening to fully articulate. - Amplified concerns: The emotional impact (e.g., fear of dying or a serious diagnosis) may be overrepresented relative to clinical findings. - Temporal distortions: The symptom progression over weeks might be more rapid or episodic than conveyed, possibly hiding earlier onset or fluctuations.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes: - Significant, possibly increasing volume of hemoptysis, not fully captured by \"streaks\" - Persistent or worsening fatigue greater than perceived - Weight loss and appetite reduction as more prominent systemic symptoms - Emotional distress rooted in concern over serious pulmonary diagnoses - Symptom timeline possibly more accelerated, with recent worsening motivating the urgent presentation These adjustments account for minimization and emotional bias, yielding a clearer picture of potentially severe underlying pathology requiring thorough investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me exactly how much blood you've been coughing up? Have you noticed any blood clots or large amounts?\" to quantify hemoptysis. \"How much weight have you lost? Over what period?\" to assess systemic decline. \"Are you experiencing any fevers, night sweats, or chest pain?\" to identify additional systemic signs. - Approach strategy: Ask with empathy, validating fears (\"It's understandable to be worried; let's find out what's going on together.\") to encourage openness. Use open-ended prompts to explore emotional fears without judgment. - Priority order: First, quantify physical symptoms (hemoptysis, weight loss) for clinical assessment; second, explore emotional and psychological concerns to address underlying anxiety; third, clarify timeline to understand progression and urgency.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient emphasizes significant distress, fear, and emotional responses, which may lead to exaggeration of feelings of fatigue and blood loss. While they mention coughing up streaks of blood that are increasing, the descriptions suggest the potential for more substantial hemoptysis than acknowledged. The patient's minimization of symptom severity, combined with emotional distress, indicates a tendency to underreport physical findings and overstate concerns, possibly to garner reassurance. The communication pattern suggests that objective findings such as the volume of blood, actual weight loss, and associated systemic symptoms are likely more severe than described. Critical details regarding symptom quantification and recent progression remain unclear, and further probing is necessary to ascertain the true extent of symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult male presenting with symptoms suggestive of significant pulmonary pathology.

He reports persistent cough with episodes of hemoptysis that he describes as streaks of blood, with an apparent increase in bleeding over recent days. He also experiences exertional shortness of breath, persistent fatigue, and decreased appetite, with an associated concern for worsening weight loss. The patient\u2019s communication indicates psychological distress, which may influence the report's accuracy, likely leading to underestimation of hemoptysis volume and severity of systemic symptoms. Further objective assessment is required to quantify the extent of blood loss, weight change, and any additional systemic features such as fever or chest pain, to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient's responses are brief, use vague descriptors, and tend to downplay the severity of her symptoms, especially regarding the amount of bleeding and associated respiratory issues. He avoids specifics and emphasizes that the bleeding has remained \"about the same,\" despite indications of possible worsening. - Bias detected: Minimization bias, leading to likely under-reporting of bleeding volume and other systemic symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014while the language clearly shows minimization, some symptoms like fatigue and breathlessness are acknowledged, suggesting awareness but underestimation. - Reasoning: The patient\u2019s guarded tone, vague quantifiers, and tendency to temper reports of severity point toward intentional or subconscious downplaying of the true extent of symptoms and distress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual volume and severity of bleeding may be greater, potentially involving more significant hemorrhage than streaks. Respiratory discomfort may be worse, possibly limiting activity more severely. - Withheld information: Systemic symptoms such as chest pain, fever, night sweats, or weight loss could be present but unreported due to embarrassment, fear, or minimization. - Amplified concerns: The patient's obvious distress and worry suggest underlying anxiety, perhaps heightened fears of serious illness like cancer or severe bleeding, which he may not fully voice. - Temporal distortions: The statement \"about the same\" over days may conceal fluctuating or worsening episodes, with possible periods of increased hemorrhage or respiratory distress that the patient chooses not to disclose.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would indicate that the patient likely has ongoing significant pulmonary pathology, with episodes of more substantial hemoptysis than admitted, possibly increasing in severity. His respiratory symptoms\u2014including worse-than-reported breathlessness\u2014and systemic signs such as weight loss might be present but underreported. The bleeding may involve intermittent or worsening hemorrhage, and systemic factors like fever or chest pain should be considered. Overall, the clinical picture is probably more severe than the patient is willing to acknowledge, necessitating thorough objective assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you estimate how much blood you are coughing up each time? Do you notice any blood in the mornings or after certain activities?\" \"Have you experienced any chest pain, fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?\" \"Has your cough or breathing worsened suddenly or gradually?\" \"Do you feel dizzy or lightheaded sometimes?\"\u2014these target quantification and associated symptoms. - Approach strategy: Ask questions gently and non-judgmentally, emphasizing concern for his well-being, to reduce embarrassment and encourage openness. - Priority order: First, clarify the extent and frequency of bleeding to gauge severity; then, probe for systemic symptoms and associated features; finally, discuss any recent changes or episodes of worsening to identify trends and risks.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication pattern suggests minimization and vagueness regarding symptom severity, especially concerning the amount of hemoptysis and systemic symptoms. He reports persistent cough, episodes of streaks of blood with occasional increases, and worsening shortness of breath, but consistently states that bleeding remains \"about the same,\" indicating possible underestimation of severity. His focus on feelings of fatigue and breathlessness aligns with significant respiratory compromise, but his reluctance to specify quantities or mention additional symptoms like chest pain, fever, or weight loss could mean such symptoms are else unreported or underappreciated. The patient's contradictory tone and tendency to avoid details point to potential unrecognized severity and occult systemic features. Therefore, objective findings are likely more serious than communicated, and further assessment is necessary to elucidate true extent and systemic involvement.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult male (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Persistent cough with hemoptysis, shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Present illness: The patient reports ongoing cough with streaks of blood, noting that the volume of bleeding has remained roughly the same over days, though he sometimes perceives more bleeding. He experiences exertional shortness of breath and fatigue, with no explicit mention of chest pain, fever, or night sweats. He indicates a decline in general well-being, with increased perceptual distress about his health, but his reports may understate the actual severity of symptoms due to minimization and guarded communication. The timeline suggests a persistent condition with possible recent fluctuations or worsening episodes of bleeding and respiratory symptoms that he is hesitant to fully disclose. Associated symptoms: Fatigue and breathlessness are acknowledged; other systemic symptoms such as chest pain, fever, night sweats, or weight loss are not reported but may be present and underreported. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The patient's report of cough, streaks of blood in sputum, breathlessness, fatigue, and decreased appetite. - Medium confidence: The stability of bleeding (\"about the same\") and absence of reported additional systemic symptoms, which may be minimized or withheld. - Low confidence: Exact severity and volume of hemoptysis, presence of systemic symptoms such as chest pain or fever, and true extent of respiratory impairment. - Missing information: Objective quantification of blood loss, weight change, additional systemic symptoms, and recent acute changes or worsening episodes.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult male presenting with a persistent cough accompanied by streaks of blood in sputum, which he perceives as remaining consistent over several days but may be underestimating actual bleeding volume.

There is hesitation and a tendency to minimize blood loss and systemic symptoms, perhaps to avoid worry or shame. - Bias detected: The predominant bias is minimization bias, evidenced by descriptors such as \"small amount,\" \"just streaks,\" and reluctance to confirm worsening or systemic involvement. - Confidence level: Medium \u2014 while the patient discloses some key concerns, their language indicates underreporting of severity, warranting cautious interpretation. - Reasoning: The guarded, minimizing language throughout the conversation implies the patient is likely underestimating the true extent of their hemorrhage and respiratory compromise, which could be more severe than they explicitly report.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Actual blood loss may be more substantial, with amounts exceeding what the patient admits, and pulmonary compromise may be more pronounced. - Withheld information: The patient might be embarrassed or afraid to disclose systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, or fever, or worse respiratory status. - Amplified concerns: The patient\u2019s anxiety is evident in the language (\"scary,\" \"worried\"), but actual severity may be less than perceived, or vice versa. - Temporal distortions: The phrase \"more lately\" is vague, and the true progression of symptoms may be more rapid, potentially delaying urgent intervention.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes: - Significant hemoptysis possibly amounts that are clinically concerning, not just streaks or small volumes, possibly indicating active bleeding or vascular involvement. - More severe respiratory impairment, perhaps hypoxia or compromised ventilation, correlating with the described \"feeling pretty bad\" when coughing. - Systemic symptoms may be present or developing, such as weight loss or low-grade fever, that the patient is hesitant to mention, pointing to potential underlying pathology like infection, malignancy, or vascular disease. - The progression of symptoms may be more rapid or severe than the patient perceives, emphasizing the need for immediate diagnostic workup.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how much blood you think you've been coughing up each day\u2014like, do you see enough to stain tissue or cloth? Are you noticing larger amounts at times?\" (to quantify bleeding) - \"Have you experienced any weight loss, night sweats, or fever recently?\" (to uncover systemic signs) - \"How difficult is it for you to breathe now compared to when your symptoms first started?\" (to assess severity) - \"Have you noticed any chest pain, dizziness, or feelings of faintness?\" (possible clues to systemic or hypoxic issues) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, non-judgmental language to normalize their symptoms, encouraging honesty. - Frame questions in an open-ended but specific manner to reduce discomfort and elicit more accurate responses. - Priority order: - First, quantify bleeding volume and assess current respiratory status. - Second, explore systemic symptoms like weight change or night sweats. - Third, inquire about the progression and current functional impact to gauge urgency. This order ensures immediate attention to life-threatening symptoms while gradually uncovering additional details.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient communications reveal a tendency to understate symptom severity, particularly regarding the amount of hemoptysis and systemic features such as weight loss or fever. Phrases like \"small amount,\" \"just streaks,\" and vague descriptions of increased blood over time suggest possible minimization, which could mean that actual bleeding is more significant and respiratory impairment more severe. The patient also seems anxious, possibly influencing their reporting to be more cautious or guarded. They do not explicitly report additional systemic symptoms, but their hesitation and concern indicate these may be present or developing. Therefore, clinical interpretation must account for potential underreporting, emphasizing the need for detailed quantification and comprehensive systemic evaluation. Objective facts suggest ongoing hemoptysis with possible increased volume, significant respiratory compromise, and a risk for underlying serious pathology. More precise history of bleeding volume, systemic symptoms, and current respiratory status are essential for accurate assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult male (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Persistent cough with hemoptysis, described as streaks that may have increased in frequency, along with worsening shortness of breath and fatigue.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing cough producing blood in sputum, which he perceives as small streaks, but indicates that the amount may have increased recently and occurs almost daily. He reports significant shortness of breath and fatigue, with worsening cough-related chest discomfort. He denies current fever but is concerned about the blood and breathing difficulty. The timeline suggests symptoms have been progressively worsening over days, with possible escalation in bleeding volume and respiratory distress, but these perceptions may be conservative given his communication style. He does not report systemic symptoms like night sweats or weight loss explicitly but may be hesitant to disclose such details.  Associated symptoms: Shortness of breath and fatigue are acknowledged; systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats are not explicitly reported but should be further assessed as they may be underreported.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient has hemoptysis with streaks and increased frequency, along with worsening breathlessness and fatigue. - Medium confidence: The actual volume of bleeding and severity of respiratory compromise are potentially underestimated due to guarded reporting. - Low confidence: Systemic symptoms like weight loss and fever may be present but are not clearly disclosed. - Missing information: Precise quantification of blood loss, detailed assessment of systemic symptoms, current oxygenation and vital signs, and the presence of other systemic features are needed for comprehensive evaluation.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
