And finally, how has his overall activity level and behavior changed recently\u2014has he become more withdrawn, more focused on certain objects, or shown any new behaviors?\\nPATIENT: I think he started really having a harder time seeing in the dark maybe a couple of years ago, and it feels like it\u2019s gotten worse sometimes. He doesn\u2019t say anything hurts his eyes, but he seems more bothered when it\u2019s dim or at night. I haven\u2019t really done any recent blood tests myself, I don\u2019t really know about that stuff, but I know he had some tests for his eyes. As for his behavior, he\u2019s been more into certain objects\u2014like, he\u2019s obsessed with shiny things\u2014and he doesn\u2019t play outside as much. Sometimes he seems more quiet or distracted, and he doesn\u2019t talk as much as he used to.\\nDOCTOR: Has the difficulty seeing in low light been present since early childhood, or did it develop or worsen gradually over time? Additionally, have you noticed any recent changes in his visual behavior, such as increased bumping into objects, or complaints of eye discomfort, light sensitivity, or pain?\\nPATIENT: Well, he\u2019s kind of been having trouble seeing in the dark for a long time, but lately it feels like it\u2019s gotten a little worse, and he\u2019s bumping into things more. He doesn\u2019t really complain about pain or being bothered by lights or anything, but I just feel like he\u2019s not noticing things the way he used to.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new behavioral changes, developmental milestones being missed, or additional physical features that have become more apparent recently?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been having a harder time paying attention and remembering stuff, and things that didn\u2019t seem as obvious before now stand out more, like my eyes feeling... weird, like I can't see in the dark as well anymore. And I think my hands look different sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child's difficulty seeing in low light been present since early childhood, or did it develop or worsen gradually over time? Additionally, have you noticed any recent changes in his visual behavior, such as increased bumping into objects or new complaints of eye discomfort or light sensitivity?\\nPATIENT: It\u2019s been like that for a while, I guess \u2014 not always, but lately he\u2019s been bumping into stuff more and seems a lot more upset when it\u2019s dim or at night. Sometimes he complains about his eyes feeling weird or like they\u2019re sensitive or something, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or if that\u2019s just how it\u2019s been.",
