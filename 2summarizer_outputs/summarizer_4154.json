Sometimes I just suddenly feel worse without anything obvious, and other times I think stress or stuff like that makes it worse. I also notice it happens more if I stand up quickly or if I\u2019m nervous, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you ever noticed if these episodes tend to occur at specific times of the day, or do they seem to follow particular patterns or cycles?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't know... I mean, they don't really happen the same time every day, usually just suddenly, and I can't really tell if there's a pattern, but I do notice they get worse when I feel stressed or anxious.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if certain activities, stress levels, or changes in your body position\u2014like standing up quickly\u2014seem to trigger or worsen these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes when I get up quickly, I feel a little dizzy or my head feels funny, and then the sweating or the palpitations seem worse. But I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always it or if something else happens.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes happen suddenly without any clear trigger, or do they tend to be brought on or worsened by stress, physical activity, or positional changes?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I think they kinda happen suddenly, like out of nowhere, but sometimes I feel like they get worse when I\u2019m stressed or maybe when I move in a certain way. It\u2019s all kinda confusing.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation confirmed existing details about symptoms and triggers, and added specifics regarding the timing, variability, and nature of triggers such as stress, positional changes, and sometimes no clear trigger. No new clinical diagnoses or lab results were mentioned; thus, the summary consolidates all confirmed facts into an evolving, complete vignette.\n\nANSWER: The patient has episodes characterized by spikes in blood pressure, severe headaches, shakiness, sweating, sensations of a rush or spike inside, facial flushing, and a pounding or racing heart. These episodes last from a few minutes to longer and sometimes occur without obvious triggers. They are often associated with stress, nervousness, or standing up quickly, which can worsen or initiate the episodes. The patient also reports feeling anxious and like they can't breathe properly during episodes, as well as feeling overwhelmed and confused. Sometimes, they notice a warning sensation in their head or chest before episodes begin. These symptoms have been ongoing for quite some time."

    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess I\u2019ve been having these weird spikes in my blood pressure \u2014 they come and go, and I don\u2019t really understand why. Sometimes I get these really bad headaches and I feel all shaky and sweaty, especially when I\u2019m stressed or just doing normal stuff. It\u2019s been going on for quite a while now, and I\u2019m pretty confused about what\u2019s going on.\\nDOCTOR: Can you describe what you feel or notice during these episodes\u2014such as any changes in your sensations, emotions, or activities\u2014that might help me understand what\u2019s happening?\\nPATIENT: Well, I kinda feel like a rush or spike inside, like everything is rushing really fast, and I get these weird sweaty and hot feelings, like I can\u2019t control it much. Sometimes my heart feels like it\u2019s pounding or racing, and I notice my face gets flush. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t stop it sometimes, and I don\u2019t really know why it happens or what I\u2019m supposed to do.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what your episodes are like\u2014what happens before, during, and after\u2014they are triggered by certain situations or activities, and how they affect you overall?\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess, sometimes I suddenly start feeling really hot and sweaty, like I can\u2019t get comfortable, even if I\u2019m just sitting there. My heart races a lot during those times, and I get these pounding headaches. I notice they sometimes happen when I\u2019m stressed or upset, but other times they just come on without warning, and I can\u2019t really stop them. Afterward, I feel kind of drained and worn out, and I worry about what\u2019s happening to me. It\u2019s pretty scary not knowing exactly why or when it will happen again.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what your episodes feel like for you\u2014how long they last, what seems to trigger them, and what goes through your mind during these times?\\nPATIENT: They come on suddenly, and I just feel really anxious or like I can\u2019t breathe right, kind of shaky maybe. It\u2019s hard to tell how long they last \u2014 sometimes a few minutes, sometimes longer. Sometimes I notice my face gets hot and I sweat a lot, especially when I\u2019m stressed or upset. During these times, I just feel overwhelmed and kinda confused, like I don\u2019t have control over it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any warning signs or feelings\u2014such as dizziness, lightheadedness, or a particular sensation\u2014that occur just before your episodes start?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes I feel like... a weird kind of feeling in my head or chest, like something's about to happen, but I can\u2019t really explain it. It\u2019s kind of sudden and makes me nervous.\\nDOCTOR: Do you notice any specific triggers such as certain foods, medications, or positions (like standing up quickly) that seem to bring on your episodes?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I don\u2019t really know for sure. Sometimes I just suddenly feel worse without anything obvious, and other times I think stress or stuff like that makes it worse. I also notice it happens more if I stand up quickly or if I\u2019m nervous, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you ever noticed if these episodes tend to occur at specific times of the day, or do they seem to follow particular patterns or cycles?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't know... I mean, they don't really happen the same time every day, usually just suddenly, and I can't really tell if there's a pattern, but I do notice they get worse when I feel stressed or anxious.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if certain activities, stress levels, or changes in your body position\u2014like standing up quickly\u2014seem to trigger or worsen these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes when I get up quickly, I feel a little dizzy or my head feels funny, and then the sweating or the palpitations seem worse. But I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s always it or if something else happens.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes happen suddenly without any clear trigger, or do they tend to be brought on or worsened by stress, physical activity, or positional changes?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I think they kinda happen suddenly, like out of nowhere, but sometimes I feel like they get worse when I\u2019m stressed or maybe when I move in a certain way. It\u2019s all kinda confusing.\\nDOCTOR: Do your episodes include other symptoms like rapid heartbeat, sweating, or feelings of anxiety that seem to come on suddenly and then subside?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Sometimes I feel like my heart\u2019s pounding really fast, and I start to sweat a lot, even when I'm just sitting there. And I get kinda jittery, like I\u2019m anxious but I don\u2019t really know why. It sort of just happens out of nowhere and then it goes away after a little while.",
