LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true duration and perhaps frequency of hallucinations and visual disturbances, which are likely more persistent or severe than reported, given the cognitive disorganization. - Withheld information: Possible details about the context or triggers for hallucinations, their impact on daily functioning, and associated other symptoms such as agitation or paranoia, which he might find shameful or difficult to articulate. - Amplified concerns: While his perceived severity is high, the emotional distress may lead to an exaggerated sense of crisis, but actual severity could be less if cognitive confusion is limiting accurate reporting. - Temporal distortions: The actual onset likely predates his vague \"last week or longer\" statement, possibly beginning weeks ago, with progressive worsening that he cannot precisely date.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture is likely: - The patient has a prolonged history of auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions, possibly beginning weeks earlier than currently reported. - He experiences significant emotional distress related to these symptoms. Cognitive disorganization impairs precise recall, leading to vague timelines and scattered reporting. - His functional impairment might be more severe, with ongoing sleep disturbances and disorientation being more profound than his description suggests. - Emotional distress is genuine; however, the severity and scope of symptoms are probably understated due to cognitive and emotional factors.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me about the last time you saw or heard something that others didn\u2019t? How often does this happen?\" to clarify frequency and context. - Approach strategy: Gently encourage concrete examples and reassure him that honest sharing helps find better support, reducing shame or avoidance. - Priority order: First, assess the exact nature, frequency, and impact of hallucinations; next, explore functional impairment, sleep, and mood; finally, evaluate cognitive clarity and memory to distinguish between psychiatric and cognitive causes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's vague and emotionally charged language, along with difficulty recalling specifics, suggests cognitive disorganization and emotional distress impacting accurate reporting. This indicates that he may be minimizing or obscuring the severity, frequency, and exact timeline of his hallucinations and visual perceptions. His descriptions imply that symptoms such as auditory and visual hallucinations are likely more persistent and severe than indicated. There is a possibility that other symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, mood alterations, or paranoia, are also present but underreported due to shame, confusion, or avoidance. The communication pattern points to an underestimation of symptom severity and potential cognitive impairment, warranting further detailed inquiry. The overall clinical picture likely involves ongoing hallucinations, significant emotional distress, and cognitive difficulties, with more severe functional impairment than patient narrative suggests. Confidence in the presence of hallucinations and distress is high, but the exact symptom details and duration are uncertain without further probing.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified. Chief complaint: Perceived auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions, with emotional distress. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing loud voices and shadowy figures, with difficulty recalling recent events and sleep patterns. Based on communication analysis, these symptoms are likely ongoing and more persistent than the patient indicates. Well-established symptoms include auditory hallucinations, visual disturbances, and a sense of being watched. Likely, hallucinations and visual misperceptions have been present for several weeks or longer, with symptoms possibly worsening over time. Minimized or withheld symptoms may include broader perceptual disturbances, sleep issues, or paranoia. The patient's description of symptoms' onset is vague and probably underestimates duration and severity. Associated symptoms: Emotional distress related to hallucinations, possible cognitive confusion, sleep disturbances, and disorientation, with high confidence that these are present but unquantified.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Hallucinations, visual and auditory symptoms, emotional distress. - Medium confidence: Severity and exact duration of symptoms, functional impact. - Low confidence: Complete accuracy of timeline, additional symptoms such as paranoia or agitation; these are likely present but not clearly reported. - Missing information: Specific details about symptom frequency, impact on daily functioning, presence of other psychiatric or cognitive symptoms, and precise timeline of symptom onset.\nANSWER: The patient is experiencing ongoing auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions, which have likely been present for several weeks or longer, with the possibility of increasing severity. He reports loud voices and shadowy figures, along with cognitive difficulties such as poor recall of recent events and sleep disturbances. Emotional distress related to these symptoms appears significant. Due to the patient's vague and emotionally laden communication, the actual severity and breadth of symptoms may be underestimated, and additional symptoms such as paranoia or agitation may be present but are not explicitly disclosed. Further structured assessment is needed to clarify the frequency, impact, and full spectrum of symptoms, as well as to differentiate between psychiatric and cognitive contributions.",

Further structured assessment is needed to clarify the frequency, impact, and full spectrum of symptoms, as well as to differentiate between psychiatric and cognitive contributions.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with hesitancy, qualifying language, emotional intensity, scattered responses, and vague timelines, suggesting high distress but difficulty articulating details. - Bias detected: The primary bias is response and memory bias fueled by anxiety and confusion, causing underreporting or unreliable recounting of symptoms, along with emotional amplification that may exaggerate distress. - Confidence level: Medium; the patterns clearly suggest bias affecting reporting, but exact details remain uncertain due to the patient's response style. - Reasoning: The patient\u2019s frequent qualifiers, scattered narrative, and emotional language indicate both an internal struggle with accurate reporting and possible hiding of symptom severity; memory issues and discomfort further impair objectivity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true severity of hallucinations and paranoia may be greater; the patient\u2019s words suggest they are underestimating how disruptive or intense their experiences are. - Withheld information: Feelings of shame, fear of judgment, or distrust may lead to omission of details such as suicidal thoughts, aggressive impulses, or specific triggers. - Amplified concerns: Their expressions of \"messing with my head\" and \"everywhere\" could be exaggerated by heightened anxiety or paranoia, making symptoms seem more pervasive than they are. - Temporal distortions: The actual onset of symptoms might be earlier than reported; recall is fuzzy, especially regarding the beginning and fluctuations of symptoms, leading to a potentially inaccurate timeline.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes persistent auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions, starting earlier than the patient reports\u2014possibly weeks before\u2014likely fluctuating in intensity. The patient probably experiences significant distress, cognitive disorganization, and sleep disturbances. The severity is probably greater than described formally, with potential associated symptoms like paranoia, emotional dysregulation, and functional impairment that are underreported due to embarrassment or difficulty articulating. The overall picture suggests a serious psychotic process with high anxiety overlay, requiring comprehensive assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly when these voices and shadows started? How often do they happen now? Do they affect your ability to work or sleep? Have you experienced any thoughts of harming yourself or others?\" [to clarify severity and risk] - Approach strategy: Use a gentle, non-judgmental tone, emphasizing confidentiality and support, to encourage honesty and reduce shame. - Priority order: First, explore the timeline and frequency of hallucinations and paranoia to establish severity; next, inquire about functional impact and safety concerns, then delve into associated symptoms and past psychiatric history, to build a comprehensive picture while addressing potential biases and fears.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication indicates high distress and possible cognitive disorganization, with hesitant language, emotional qualifiers, and vague timelines suggesting response biases, memory impairment, and emotional amplification. While the patient reports symptoms starting approximately one to two weeks prior, the fuzzy recall and emotionally charged descriptions imply that symptoms like auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions have likely been present for longer, possibly weeks to a month. The severity may be underestimated by the patient, who may omit or minimize the full extent of hallucinations, paranoia, or agitation due to shame or fear. The likelihood of significant functional impairment, paranoia, and associated symptoms such as sleep disturbances is high, but these remain underreported and require further exploration. Confidence in the timeline and severity is medium due to the communication pattern, and additional structured assessment is necessary to determine the full symptom spectrum and risk factors.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified in the conversation. Chief complaint: Experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations with increasing intensity over the recent weeks. Present illness: The patient reports hearing loud voices and seeing shadowy figures, which have intensified in frequency over approximately the past one to two weeks. The patient describes feelings of confusion, poor recent memory, and disrupted sleep, indicating cognitive and sleep disturbances. Given the communication biases, these symptoms are probably more persistent and severe than reported, with hallucinations and paranoid perceptions likely ongoing for longer than the patient states. The patient\u2019s emotional distress during the interview may reflect an underlying high level of agitation or paranoia. Other symptoms such as feelings of being watched or threatened might exist but are not explicitly detailed and might be withheld or unrecognized by the patient due to fear or shame.  Associated symptoms: Cognitive disorganization, sleep disturbance, emotional distress. Higher likelihood of paranoia and agitation exists, but these are not explicitly confirmed and require further inquiry. Confidence in the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations is high, while severity and impact on functioning are probably underestimated.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of hallucinations (auditory and visual) and sleep disturbance. - Medium confidence: Exact onset, duration, and severity of hallucinations and paranoia. - Low confidence: Full extent of associated symptoms such as danger to self or others, and specific functional impairment. - Missing information: Detailed timeline, frequency and severity of symptoms, safety assessment, and additional psychiatric history.\nANSWER: The patient is experiencing persistent auditory hallucinations and visual misperceptions that likely began several weeks prior to the current presentation, with increased frequency and severity over the past one to two weeks. The patient describes loud voices and shadowy figures causing significant distress, confusion, and sleep disruption. While the patient reports a recent onset, the communication pattern suggests these symptoms may be more longstanding and severe than indicated, potentially involving paranoia and cognitive disorganization.

Emotional distress is evident, but the description of symptoms is clouded by uncertainty. - Bias detected: Response and memory/chronology confusion bias. Evidence includes inconsistent timing, vague descriptions, and hesitations that suggest underreporting and difficulty recalling details accurately. - Confidence level: Medium. I believe core symptoms are present and more severe than reported, but the precise history is obscured by communication biases. - Reasoning: The patient's inconsistent timeline, avoidance of details, and emotional distress point toward significant information distortion, primarily through response bias and memory confusion.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The severity and frequency of hallucinations likely exceed what the patient reports, possibly with additional paranoid content. - Withheld information: Depth of paranoia, associated mood symptoms like depression or anxiety, and any risk behaviors may be underdisclosed due to shame or fear. - Amplified concerns: The patient's fears about losing control or being dangerous could be exaggerated by paranoia but may also be rooted in real distress. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms likely started earlier than the patient perceives, with progression over months rather than weeks, clouded by memory lapses.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the underlying clinical picture probably involves a longer, more severe history of auditory and visual hallucinations, with escalating paranoia and cognitive disorganization. Symptoms may have begun several months ago with a gradual increase, and current distress levels are high. Underreporting due to shame and confusion masks the full extent, but core features suggest an active psychotic process impacting functioning significantly, with possible comorbid emotional disturbances.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Ask detailed, structured questions about onset, frequency, and content of hallucinations and delusions to clarify hidden severity. - Inquire sensitively about safety, suicidal or homicidal thoughts, and functional impairment. - Explore mood, sleep patterns, substance use, and trauma history to identify comorbidities. - Use open-ended questions and empathetic reassurance to reduce shame and facilitate disclosure. - Prioritize questions about the impact on daily life first, then specifics of symptom chronology, to build rapport and gather accurate history.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication includes hesitations, vague timelines, and minimal elaboration, which suggest internal conflict, shame, or cognitive disorganization. Such patterns often lead to underreporting of symptom severity and duration, especially in psychotic presentations. The patient's description of hallucinations as recent, with increased frequency, may be an underestimation of their true onset and pervasiveness. Additionally, the emotional distress and confusion point toward a longstanding underlying psychotic disorder, possibly with paranoia, that has been exacerbated recently. Because of these communication biases, it is likely that the patient is minimizing the severity and impact of the hallucinations and delusions, and may be withholding details about associated symptoms like mood disturbances or risk factors. The confidence in the reported timeline and symptom severity is medium; the core phenomenology of auditory and visual hallucinations is evident but probably more severe and longstanding than the patient indicates. More detailed assessment is necessary to clarify the full scope of symptoms, their onset, and functional impact.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: adult individual (specific age and gender unspecified).  Chief complaint: Reports experiencing loud voices and shadowy visual phenomena, with a recent increase in frequency and severity.  Present illness: The patient describes hearing voices and seeing shadows, with onset approximately one to two weeks prior to consultation, although communication biases suggest these symptoms may have been present for a longer period. The patient perceives an escalation in these experiences, which interfere with daily functioning and cause distress. The description indicates a possible underlying chronic psychotic process that has worsened recently but may be underreported in terms of duration and severity. The patient's narrative shows confusion about exact timelines, indicating possible cognitive disorganization and memory issues. The emotional distress related to these symptoms is evident, although the patient might be minimizing prior or concurrent symptoms, such as paranoia, mood disturbances, or sleep disruption. There is a high likelihood that the hallucinations are more frequent and severe than the patient reports and that there may be additional paranoid ideation or associated emotional symptoms not disclosed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of hallucinations (auditory and visual) and related distress. - Medium confidence: Timeline and severity of symptoms are likely underestimated; hallucinations possibly ongoing for months. - Low confidence: Exact content of delusions, full impact on functioning, and associated behavioral risks. - Missing information: Specific duration of symptoms, presence of paranoia or delusional beliefs, mood symptoms, safety concerns, history of substance use or trauma, and other psychiatric comorbidities.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient responds with vague, hesitant, and rambling statements, indicating difficulty in recalling exact details and a tendency to be emotionally overwhelmed during the recounting of symptoms. - Bias detected: Confusion/memory bias dominates, with evidence of inconsistent timelines and disorganized responses; mild minimization may also be present. - Confidence level: Medium to low, due to evident cognitive confusion impairing accurate self-reporting. - Reasoning: The patient's scattered, uncertain answers and repeated phrases suggest significant cognitive disorganization affecting their capacity to provide reliable history.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true onset, frequency, and severity of hallucinations and paranoia may be worse than reported, as they understate or are unsure about specifics. - Withheld information: They might feel embarrassed, ashamed, or fearful about admitting the full extent or severity of their symptoms, or are confused about their experiences. - Amplified concerns: They may be emphasizing their distress to elicit concern but could be exaggerating subjective discomfort due to emotional overload. - Temporal distortions: The actual start date of symptoms likely predates their vague reference point. Progression has probably been gradual and more severe than indicated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the patient's symptoms likely began weeks ago with subtle hallucinations and paranoia that gradually worsened. Currently, they are experiencing persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, pervasive paranoid delusions, and significant emotional distress. Confusion about timelines and cognitive disorganization hinder accurate self-report. The severity of hallucinations and paranoia may be more intense, with a substantial impact on daily functioning, although the patient\u2019s vague descriptions obscure the full picture.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you tell me exactly when you first noticed hearing voices or seeing shadows? Were they happening every day? How often, and how long do they last? Can you describe a typical experience?\" \u2014 to clarify onset and frequency. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions with reassurance: \"Many people find it hard to remember exact dates when they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s okay; let\u2019s try to think about how things have been over the last few weeks.\"\u2014 to reduce anxiety and promote detailed sharing. - Priority order: Start with concrete, time-anchored questions about symptom onset and frequency, then explore the content of hallucinations and paranoia. Follow with emotional impact and functional effects to fully understand severity.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits significant difficulties in providing a clear and consistent timeline, with responses characterized by hesitation, vagueness, and emotional overwhelm. These communication patterns suggest cognitive disorganization and possible emotional distress, which may lead to underreporting or overemphasis of symptoms. The described hallucinations\u2014auditory voices and visual shadows\u2014are likely more frequent, intense, and persistent than the patient self-reports, considering the tendency toward minimization and uncertain recall. There may also be underlying paranoia and distress impacting daily functioning that the patient is either reluctant to fully disclose or is unable to accurately articulate. To obtain an accurate clinical picture, further targeted questioning with reassurance is necessary to clarify onset, duration, frequency, and impact of symptoms amid potential cognitive and emotional barriers.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified in the conversation. Chief complaint: Presence of auditory and visual hallucinations. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing frequent, persistent auditory hallucinations (voices) and visual hallucinations (shadowy figures) that have reportedly worsened over the past one to two weeks, though exact timing is uncertain. Symptoms include loud voices giving negative or threatening messages and seeing shadows moving out of the corner of the eye, described as pervasive and distressing. The patient mentions difficulty distinguishing reality from hallucinations and perceives an impact on mental state, but communication impairments suggest these symptoms are likely more severe and frequent than reported. Associated symptoms: Confusion, memory difficulties (e.g., trouble recalling recent events), emotional distress; confidence in reporting severity and impact is moderate to low due to communication biases. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Hallucinations are present (auditory and visual). - Medium confidence: The reported onset, frequency, and severity are likely underestimations; actual symptom burden may be greater. - Low confidence: Precise timeline, full extent, and severity of symptoms due to communication barriers and emotional overload. - Missing information: Exact duration and onset, specific frequency and content of hallucinations, impact on functional abilities, history of previous psychiatric conditions or substance use.\nANSWER: The patient presents with persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, including seeing shadowy figures and hearing loud voices that convey threatening messages. These symptoms have reportedly increased over the past one to two weeks, though the patient\u2019s uncertain recollections and hesitation make precise timing unclear. Cognitive and emotional factors impair detailed self-reporting, suggesting the hallucinations and associated distress may be more severe and frequent than described. The patient's overall presentation indicates significant psychotic symptoms with probable underlying psychiatric illness, though further structured inquiry is needed to clarify onset, duration, and functional impact.",

I see shadows moving\\u2014like people, but I don\\u2019t really see them clearly, just out of the corner of my eye. I don\\u2019t remember exactly what I did yesterday, everything feels all jumbled. I keep hearing stuff, seeing stuff, but I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s real or not, and I feel so empty, like I don\\u2019t care anymore. Why are you asking so many questions? Do you think I\\u2019m lying?\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient presents with persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, including seeing shadowy figures and hearing loud voices that convey threatening messages. These symptoms have reportedly increased over the past one to two weeks, though the patient\u2019s uncertain recollections and hesitation make precise timing unclear. Cognitive and emotional factors impair detailed self-reporting, suggesting the hallucinations and associated distress may be more severe and frequent than described. The patient's overall presentation indicates significant psychotic symptoms with probable underlying psychiatric illness, though further structured inquiry is needed to clarify onset, duration, and functional impact.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with scattered, vague, and emotionally charged responses, often showing hesitation, doubt, and emotional distress. His responses are inconsistent and accompanied by signs of anxiety and shame, indicating both cognitive disorganization and emotional amplification. - Bias detected: The primary bias is *response disorganization with emotional amplification*, influenced by paranoia, shame, and distress. There is also evidence of minimization and possible withholding of critical information. - Confidence level: Medium to low, due to response inconsistency and cognitive overload. - Reasoning: These patterns point to significant distortion in self-report; emotional factors lead him to exaggerate some symptoms while hiding others, and cognitive confusion affects timeline accuracy.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true severity and frequency of hallucinations, possible suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and paranoid delusions may be more intense than reported due to shame. - Withheld information: He might be reluctant to disclose past episodes, treatment history, or risks related to self-harm or violence owing to embarrassment or fear of judgment. - Amplified concerns: His expressed fears and feelings of emptiness could be exaggerated under distress states, possibly driven by paranoia. - Temporal distortions: The onset of symptoms is likely earlier and insidiously progressive, but memory issues obscure this, leading to underestimation of duration.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette suggests: The patient exhibits ongoing, severe psychotic features, including persistent visual and auditory hallucinations with paranoid content\u2014seeing shadow figures and hearing threatening voices\u2014likely starting weeks prior to presentation. The hallucinations are more frequent and intense than described, significantly impairing daily functioning. There are strong indications of emotional dysregulation, paranoia, and possible suicidal ideation or self-harm risk, all underreported due to shame and fear. Cognitive confusion complicates reporting of timeline and severity, suggesting a need for careful collateral information and mental status assessment to fully understand the scope of his psychosis and associated risks.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you describe the hallucinations you've been having, in detail? When do they usually happen, and how intense are they?\" (to clarify severity and frequency) - \"Have you ever thought about hurting yourself or others during these experiences?\" (to assess risk) - \"Can you tell me about your mood during these episodes? Do you feel fear, panic, or anything else besides emptiness?\" (to detect mood symptoms) - \"When did you first notice these experiences beginning, and have they been gradually getting worse?\" (to get clearer timeline) - \"Have you experienced similar episodes before? How did they resolve or change over time?\" (for history) - Approach strategy: - Use a calm, non-judgmental tone, emphasizing confidentiality and support. - Break questions into simple, concrete parts to reduce cognitive load. - Reassure him that many people experience these symptoms and that help is available. - Priority order: First, clarify the nature and frequency of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts to gauge severity. Then assess risk factors like self-harm. Follow with mood and past episodes to contextualize the current state. This sequencing ensures safety assessment before exploring historical details thoroughly.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's scattered and emotionally charged communication, with hesitation and signs of anxiety, suggests that his self-report may understate or distort the true severity and frequency of his symptoms. He displays avoidance and shame, likely leading to minimization of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts, while emotional distress and cognitive confusion\u2014indicated by his inconsistent responses and memory issues\u2014may amplify perceived severity or cause him to overgeneralize. The reported timeline is uncertain; symptoms have reportedly worsened over the past one to two weeks, but cognitive disorganization suggests they may have started earlier and insidiously. His reluctance to provide detailed information or to fully disclose past episodes indicates possible withholding of relevant history, especially concerning risks related to self-harm or violent thoughts. Overall, symptoms such as persistent visual and auditory hallucinations with paranoid content are present, but their true intensity and impact are likely underestimated by the patient. Additional structured inquiry and collateral information are necessary to clarify the full scope of his psychopathology.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult male (specific age not provided).  Chief complaint: Reports experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations, including hearing loud voices and seeing shadowy figures, with increasing severity over the past one to two weeks.  Present illness: The patient reports persistent hallucinations characterized by loud voices that convey threatening messages and visual perceptions of shadow figures, primarily out of the corner of his eye. He indicates these symptoms started approximately one to two weeks prior, but his inconsistent timeline and memory difficulties suggest an insidious onset possibly earlier. The hallucinations are described as frequent and distressing, significantly impairing his perception of reality. He reports feelings of emptiness and emotional distress, with some paranoid beliefs that voices threaten his safety or suggest he is dangerous. There is evidence of cognitive disorganization, with difficulty recalling specific details like daily events, implying possible past or ongoing psychosis of greater severity than current self-report indicates.  Associated symptoms: Possible paranoid ideation, feelings of emptiness, emotional distress, and cognitive confusion. The patient may also experience or have experienced suicidal thoughts or self-harm urges, though underreported due to shame.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of visual hallucinations (shadow figures), auditory hallucinations (loud voices), and paranoia. - Medium confidence: The severity, frequency, and full impact of hallucinations are likely underestimated, given communication difficulties. - Low confidence: Precise onset, duration, and detailed mood or risk assessments due to response irregularities. - Missing information: Complete psychiatric history, previous episodes, history of self-harm or violence, behavioral observations, and collateral reports needed for comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
