I\u2019ve been okay otherwise, I think.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your growth, hair development, or any other physical features that might seem unusual?\\nPATIENT: Umm, well, I guess I\u2019ve grown taller like everyone else, but I don\u2019t really have a lot of hair in certain places, and I haven't really gotten my period or anything, so I think some of my body is just not changing like it\u2019s supposed to? It\u2019s kinda confusing.\\nDOCTOR: \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding any changes or concerns you've noticed with your body, mood, or other symptoms?\"\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019ve been feeling kind of weird, like I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s supposed to happen or if something\u2019s wrong. Sometimes I get a little sad or nervous but I don\u2019t really understand why, and I notice my body looks different but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling overall, including any other changes you've noticed in your body, mood, or daily life that you think might be related to what\u2019s going on?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I feel kinda okay most of the time, but sometimes I get a little sad or just weird, I guess. Like, I don\u2019t really notice much else besides the parts that seem different and that I don\u2019t get my period. It\u2019s kind of confusing trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong.\\nDOCTOR: Has she undergone any genetic testing or karyotype analysis? Additionally, are there any other physical features or anomalies\u2014such as webbed neck, low-set ears, or cardiac defects\u2014that have been noted?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't done any genetic testing myself, and I don't really know about any other features. I haven't noticed anything like that, but I guess I haven't really paid much attention or asked about it.\\nDOCTOR: Has the patient undergone a pelvic ultrasound to assess the presence and structure of her ovaries and uterus?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think I've had an ultrasound yet. I haven't really seen much about what it shows, to be honest. I guess I just assumed... I don't know, maybe I should have?\\nDOCTOR: Has she had any prior evaluations of thyroid function, adrenal function, or autoimmune screening?\\nPATIENT: Uh, no, I haven't had any of those tests done before. I'm not really sure what they\u2019re for, but I guess I\u2019m a little worried about what might be wrong.\\nDOCTOR: Do you notice any differences in your sense of smell or any difficulties detecting odors?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I haven't noticed anything weird about smells or odors or anything. Everything seems normal to me.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any hot flashes, breast development, or episodes of vaginal bleeding?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't had any hot flashes or bleeding at all. My breasts are still pretty small, and I don\u2019t really feel anything different like that. It all just feels kind of strange.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any difficulties with your sense of smell, such as trouble detecting odors or a decreased ability to smell?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think I've noticed anything weird with my sense of smell. I guess I haven't really paid attention to that kind of thing.\\nDOCTOR: Have you undergone any hormonal evaluations, such as FSH, LH, or estradiol levels, or had a pelvic ultrasound to assess for ovarian tissue?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think they did some blood tests or something, but I\u2019m not really sure what all they checked. The ultrasound, I remember that, but I don\u2019t really understand what it meant either.",
