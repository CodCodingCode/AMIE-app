Also, has she experienced any new neck or limb weakness, such as difficulty lifting objects or keeping her head up?\\nPATIENT: Um, she sometimes makes this funny gagging sound when she\u2019s eating, and I think she\u2019s having a little trouble with certain foods\u2014like she coughs or sputters a bit. She\u2019s also been a bit more tired when holding her head up or lifting things, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s new or if it\u2019s always been like that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any drooping of your child's eyelids, double vision, or problems keeping her eyes open, especially towards the end of the day?\\nPATIENT: Um, she sometimes seems like her eyes get kind of tired or slow, especially when she's been playing a lot. I haven't really seen her droop or anything, but her eyes do look a bit funny sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Has your daughter noticed any double vision, trouble moving her eyes, or that her eyelids tend to get heavy or droop, especially towards the end of the day?\\nPATIENT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen her having double vision or trouble moving her eyes, but sometimes her eyelids seem a little heavy or droopy, especially when she\u2019s tired, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your daughter's muscle weakness and eyelid drooping tend to get worse towards the end of the day or after playing?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think sometimes she looks a little more tired or floppy after she\u2019s been playing, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worse at the end of the day or not really\u2014it\u2019s hard to tell.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your daughter's muscle weakness and eyelid drooping tend to worsen after playing or being active and then get better with rest?\\nPATIENT: Um, I haven't really noticed if her muscles or eyelids get worse after she plays or anything. Sometimes she looks more tired, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she\u2019s tired in general or something else. It just makes me nervous to see her like this.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if her muscle weakness or eyelid drooping gets worse after playing, running, or being active, and then improves with rest?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes, she seems more tired after playing or running around, and she gets kind of floppy or her face looks a little different. But then after she rests, she seems okay again, or at least she doesn't say she's worse. It's all kinda confusing.",
