We just try to give her what she needs, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s been on anything special or strong like steroids.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any purple stretch marks, areas where your skin bruises easily, or muscle weakness that you haven't mentioned yet?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know about stretch marks, but sometimes I feel really tired and my muscles feel kinda weak, like I don\u2019t have enough strength to do things. I haven\u2019t noticed any bruises, though.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other changes like purple stretch marks, easy bruising, or increased hair growth that might suggest excess cortisol?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen anything like purple marks or bruises that come easily, and I haven\u2019t noticed more hair or anything like that. I guess I\u2019ve just been feeling kind of tired or maybe a little more mood swings, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related.\\nDOCTOR: Has she noticed any purple streaks on her skin, particularly on her abdomen or thighs, or any increased skin fragility or easy bruising?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really noticed anything like that, like purple lines or anything. My skin just feels kind of normal most of the time, but I might not have looked carefully enough.",
