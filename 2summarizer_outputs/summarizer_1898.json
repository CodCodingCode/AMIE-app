These details should be added to the ongoing vignette.\n\nANSWER: The patient reports concern about someone (implied to be a subject under care) who has been acting differently lately. The person appears more tired than before, has experienced more of certain spells which may be seizures or similar episodes, although it is unclear if they are the same or worse. Additionally, the person is not talking much and has become more clumsy, struggling more with walking and holding things."
