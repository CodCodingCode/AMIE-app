I haven't seen her have any seizures or anything new like that, but I just worry because she\u2019s been more sleepy overall.\\nDOCTOR: Has she exhibited any new neurological signs such as seizures, weakness, or changes in her level of consciousness that have developed since our last discussion?\\nPATIENT: Um, no, she hasn't really had any new seizures or anything like that. She just seems the same to me, but sometimes I worry if she's a little different or not acting right, I don't know.\\nDOCTOR: Has she shown any signs of worsening neurological function, such as increased irritability, difficulty awakening, seizures, or changes in her level of consciousness since our last discussion?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think she's been a little more fussy sometimes, but I don't know if it's anything serious. She still sleeps okay, I guess. I haven't really noticed her being more difficult to wake up or anything like that.",

No additional systemic or neurological symptoms have been reported.\nANSWER: The patient is a young girl who has been fussier than usual, with poor appetite, vomits after feeding, sleeps more and is more tired during the day, is irritable, makes abnormal sounds, and her caregivers are worried as her condition does not seem to be improving. She has not had recent illnesses, exposures, rashes, fevers, cough, ear pain, or neurological symptoms such as seizures or difficulty awakening."
