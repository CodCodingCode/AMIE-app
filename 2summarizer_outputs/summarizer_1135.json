I just know I\u2019ve been feeling pretty out of sorts lately.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any recent headaches, vision changes, or episodes of weakness that might suggest a mass effect or neurological involvement?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any really bad headaches or vision problems, but sometimes I do feel kind of foggy or like I get tired out more easily than before. It\u2019s hard to say if that\u2019s connected or just me being tired.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any episodes of sudden weakness, dizziness, or fainting, or have you noticed any specific times when your symptoms worsen or improve?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think sometimes I feel kind of dizzy or like I might faint, especially if I\u2019m busy or if I stand up too fast, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s sudden or what exactly triggers it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent new or worsening skin pigmentation, especially in areas such as the scars, skin folds, or other parts of your body?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven't really noticed anything new. Sometimes I think my skin looks a little darker, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just in my head or if it\u2019s gotten worse.\\nDOCTOR: Have you been experiencing any frequent or severe episodes of high blood pressure, dizziness, or fainting that might indicate fluctuations in your condition or complications needing immediate attention?\\nPATIENT: Uh, yeah, I think I remember feeling really dizzy a couple of times, like everything kinda spun around and I felt like I was gonna pass out, but it didn\u2019t last very long. It\u2019s been pretty unpredictable.",
