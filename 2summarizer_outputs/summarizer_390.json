Also, do you experience any difficulty or irregularities with bowel movements, like straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation, or changes in stool consistency?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven't really noticed much about my appetite or weight, but sometimes I do feel like I might be bloated or something, and my bowel movements are kinda irregular\u2014I don\u2019t know, like sometimes I feel constipated, and then other times it\u2019s like I go more often than usual, but it\u2019s not really predictable.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any urinary symptoms, such as increased frequency, urgency, or difficulty starting or stopping your stream? Additionally, have you experienced any abnormal vaginal bleeding, spotting, or changes in your menstrual cycle?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really notice anything like that with urinating, no. And about the bleeding, I mean, my periods are kinda different lately, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s strange or not.\\nDOCTOR: Are there any reports of abnormal vaginal bleeding, spotting, or other changes in menstrual patterns that the patient hasn't yet described?\\nPATIENT: Hmm, no, I don't think so. I mean, I haven't really paid attention to it or anything... I just noticed the other stuff, but maybe I should look more for that?\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any urinary incontinence, urgency, or difficulty with urination, or have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements, like straining or a sensation of incomplete evacuation?\\nPATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't really noticed any changes with my bathroom habits or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any bulging, dragging sensation, or a feeling of something slipping down into your vagina or outside the vaginal opening?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't know exactly, but I have felt kind of like there's something a little heavy or like it's pushing down sometimes, but I didn't really think much about it.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new or worsening urinary symptoms, like difficulty starting urination, a sense of incomplete bladder emptying, or increased urinary leakage when you cough or strain?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I haven't really noticed much with my bladder or anything, like I don\u2019t feel like I can\u2019t go or anything, but sometimes I feel a little strange around that area, I guess. It\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s worse or not.",
