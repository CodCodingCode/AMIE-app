She responds briefly and relies on non-specific timeframes, indicating guardedness. - Bias detected: Primarily minimization bias, with possible subtle withholding of full symptom extent to avoid stigma or judgment. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014based on cautious language and vague timelines, plausible she underreports severity but is genuinely distressed. - Reasoning: Her use of mild descriptors (\"whispers,\" \"not really there\") and vague temporal references suggest she is filtering information. This pattern indicates she might be experiencing more severe symptoms than reported; she is aware of distress but downplays it.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The hallucinations may be more frequent or intense, possibly involving visual or tactile experiences not disclosed. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to share full details of disorganized thoughts, cognitive deficits, or functional impairments such as social withdrawal. - Amplified concerns: Her focus on relapse and losing control suggests real anxiety, but it could lead her to overstate vulnerability or catastrophize about her prognosis. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms may have started earlier or worsened over time but are understated in her brief mention, possibly because of difficulty recalling precise timelines.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely includes: - More frequent and pronounced auditory hallucinations, possibly with other sensory modalities involved. - Significant disorganized thinking and cognitive confusion, impairing daily functioning. - Possibly related negative symptoms such as social withdrawal, apathy, or flat affect. - An insidious or gradually worsening course over a longer period than the patient explicitly reports. - Anxiety about future episodes, possibly leading to elevated distress levels disproportionate to actual symptom severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how often you hear these whispers or noises? Do they happen daily or less frequently?\" \"Have you experienced any visual or other sensory hallucinations?\" \"How are your thoughts outside of these hallucinations\u2014do they feel scrambled or disorganized throughout the day?\" \"Have you noticed changes in your mood, motivation, or social interactions?\" These questions target frequency, intensity, and additional symptom domains that she might be underreporting. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-confrontational language; normalize her experiences to reduce shame; emphasize confidentiality and support to encourage openness. - Priority order: Begin by clarifying the frequency and impact of hallucinations, then assess disorganized thinking and negative symptoms, followed by mood and functional impact\u2014this structure ensures a comprehensive understanding while fostering trust.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s cautious and vague communication style suggests possible underreporting of symptom severity. She describes auditory hallucinations (\"whispers\" and \"loud noises\") that she perceives as not being \"really there,\" implying that these may be more frequent or intense than she admits. Her mention of disorganized thoughts that feel scrambled or echoing indicates likely cognitive disorganization, but she may minimize their impact or frequency. The brevity and hedging in her responses suggest she might be withholding details about other sensory hallucinations, negative symptoms such as social withdrawal or flat affect, or functional impairments. Her focus on concerns about losing control and relapse hints at underlying anxiety, which could amplify her distress. The timeline she provides appears vague and possibly shortened, with actual symptom duration and severity likely underestimated. Additional probing is needed to clarify the frequency, intensity, and full scope of her hallucinations and disorganized thinking, as well as mood and functional impact.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown, present from conversation.  Chief complaint: Auditory hallucinations and disorganized thinking, with concern about their severity and potential impact.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing auditory hallucinations characterized as whispers and occasional loud noises, which she perceives as not being \"really there.\" She describes her thoughts as feeling scrambled or echoing, indicating possible disorganized cognition. She reports these symptoms as ongoing for some time but provides vague temporal details, suggesting possible underestimation of duration and severity. She appears cautious in her description, potentially minimizing symptom frequency and intensity. There is no mention of visual or other sensory hallucinations, mood disturbances, or negative symptoms, though these may be withheld. She expresses anxiety about losing control and relapse, which could heighten her emotional distress. The actual severity, frequency, and full symptomatology are likely greater than reported, given communication patterns.  Associated symptoms: No additional symptoms clearly reported; possible undisclosed negative symptoms or mood issues.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient experiences auditory hallucinations and disorganized thoughts. - Medium confidence: The exact frequency, intensity, and full scope of hallucinations; presence of other sensory hallucinations; and functional impact are likely underestimated. - Low confidence: Precise duration and severity of symptoms due to guarded communication. - Missing information: Details on the frequency and variation of hallucinations, presence of visual or tactile hallucinations, mood state, negative symptoms, and impact on daily functioning.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient openly describes auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization but presents her visual symptoms as minor, vague, and less significant, with hesitations suggesting self-monitoring or reluctance. - Bias detected: Minimizaton of her visual symptoms, possibly due to discomfort or uncertainty. - Confidence level: Medium; the evidence suggests an underreporting tendency, but some acknowledgment of visual issues exists. - Reasoning: Her cautious language and vague descriptions of visual disturbances, contrasted with open mention of auditory hallucinations, indicate a tendency to understate visual problems while being more comfortable discussing auditory and thought-related issues.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her visual disturbances may be more persistent, disruptive, or distressing than she admits, potentially affecting her functioning subtly. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed or uncertain about the severity of her visual symptoms or worried about appearing impaired, leading to undersharing. - Amplified concerns: She might over-focus on auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization, which she perceives as more urgent, thus downplaying visual issues. - Temporal distortions: She may not recall the onset or progression accurately, perhaps perceiving the symptoms as more transient or less significant than they are.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Taking into account her minimization, the objective picture likely includes ongoing visual disturbances\u2014perhaps more frequent or severe than reported\u2014alongside her audiovisual hallucinations and thought disorganization. Her visual symptoms may include intermittent blurriness, fuzzy vision, or shakiness affecting daily activities but are underreported due to discomfort, embarrassment, or uncertainty. The timeline may involve insidious onset and mild progression. Her global psychosis symptoms appear robust, but the visual component might be an underappreciated aspect of her presentation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Can you describe in more detail what you see or feel when your vision feels fuzzy or shaky? Do these episodes occur at certain times or situations?\" \"Have you noticed any flashes, floaters, or pain in your eyes? How often do these occur?\" \"How do these visual changes affect your daily activities or mood?\" \"Are you experiencing any other ocular symptoms, like dryness, tearing, or discomfort?\" - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language to encourage openness. Validating her concerns can reduce defensiveness and promote fuller disclosure. Frame questions as collaborative rather than interrogative. - Priority order: First, probe more thoroughly about visual symptoms to gauge severity and impact. Then, explore their temporal pattern and any associated ocular symptoms. Follow up with questions about emotional or functional impacts to understand how these symptoms influence her life.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient openly reports auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization, indicating significant psychotic symptoms. Conversely, her visual complaints are described as vague, minor, and hesitant, suggesting possible underreporting or minimization due to discomfort, embarrassment, or uncertainty. The language used indicates she might perceive her visual symptoms as less serious, but communication patterns imply they could be more persistent or disruptive than she admits. There is a likelihood that visual disturbances such as intermittent blurriness, shakiness, or difficulty seeing clearly are more significant clinically but are underreported. Additional probing would be needed to assess the severity, frequency, and impact of her visual symptoms, as well as other ocular signs she might be omitting. The primary concern remains her psychotic features, which are clearly documented, but the visual component warrants further investigation given the communication cues.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Not specified. Chief complaint: Auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization, with vague visual disturbances. Present illness: The patient reports hearing whispers and loud noises not present to others, and experiences scrambled or echoing thoughts. She describes occasional blurry vision and feeling that her visual perception is \"off\"\u2014fuzzy or shaky\u2014but presents these as minor and infrequent. She reports symptoms have persisted over a period of uncertain duration. - Well-established symptoms: Auditory hallucinations, thought disorganization, intermittent visual disturbances. - Likely minimized symptoms: The severity, frequency, and impact of visual disturbances are probably greater than reported; they may cause more ongoing disturbance or functional impairment. - Possibly withheld symptoms: She may be reluctant to fully disclose severity or specific ocular symptoms like pain, floaters, or specific visual phenomena. - Timeline: Onset of auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization appears insidious, potentially longstanding; visual symptoms may be more persistent or severe than she admits, with an uncertain onset.  Associated symptoms: No additional ocular symptoms such as pain, floaters, or tearing explicitly reported; however, given vague visual descriptions, subtler symptoms may exist with medium confidence.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of auditory hallucinations and thought disorganization. - Medium confidence: The subjective description of visual symptoms, which are likely more severe than expressed. - Low confidence: Exact severity, frequency, and functional impact of visual disturbances, due to communication hesitations. - Missing information: Specific ocular symptoms, detailed visual disturbance characteristics, and their impact on daily functioning.\nANSWER: The patient presents with auditory hallucinations characterized as hearing whispers and loud noises not verifiable externally, along with disorganized or echoing thoughts. She also reports intermittent visual disturbances, including blurry and shaky vision, which she describes as minor and infrequent. Based on communication patterns, her visual symptoms are likely underreported and may be more persistent or severe than indicated, potentially affecting her function.

A thorough assessment of her ocular symptoms and their impact is recommended to clarify their true severity and progression.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs tentative, non-specific language and minimization, reflecting a cautious and guarded communication style. She responds with hedging, likely to reduce perceived severity or stigmatization. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias affects her reporting, as evidenced by her downplaying symptoms and vague timelines. - Confidence level: Medium; while her responses suggest underreporting, it is unlikely she is intentionally deceitful\u2014that is, her bias stems from discomfort, shame, or uncertainty. - Reasoning: Her cautious language, frequent qualifiers, and vague descriptions align with internal biases toward minimizing symptom severity, possibly influenced by emotional factors or stigma.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The actual frequency or vividness of visual hallucinations may be higher, possibly occurring daily or with more intensity. She might also experience other perceptual distortions or delusions unmentioned. - Withheld information: Emotional distress, fears about mental health, or related anxiety are likely understated. She may feel embarrassed or ashamed about perceptual disturbances, prompting her to withhold full details. - Amplified concerns: Her expressed worry about normalcy and seriousness may be genuine but possibly exaggerated due to underlying anxiety, making her concerns seem larger than their clinical severity. - Temporal distortions: She might not accurately recall the onset or fluctuations of her symptoms, underestimating their duration or severity, especially if they've been gradually worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased view suggests she has more frequent, possibly more severe, auditory and visual perceptual disturbances than reported. These symptoms may be affecting her daily functioning and emotional well-being more significantly, with potential associated anxiety or mood symptoms that she has not openly disclosed. Her guarded communication obscures the true extent, requiring a nuanced, careful probing approach to clarify the full clinical picture.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"How often do you experience these visual phenomena\u2014are they daily, multiple times a day? Can you describe how they impact your daily activities?\" To gauge frequency and functional impact. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental language (\"Many people experience varying degrees of perceptual changes; it\u2019s okay to tell me more about what you're experiencing\") to encourage openness. - Priority order: First, explore the severity and frequency of perceptual symptoms, then emotional responses, safety concerns, and impact on functioning. This enables building trust and gaining detailed information progressively.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's cautious, non-specific, and minimization-prone communication suggests that her reported symptoms may be underrepresented in frequency and severity. She minimizes visual disturbances, indicating they could be more frequent and impactful than she admits. Her description of auditory hallucinations aligns with ongoing perceptual disturbances, which, considering her guarded communication, may be more persistent or severe. Emotional factors such as anxiety or shame might be influencing her reporting, leading to under disclosure of the full symptom burden. Therefore, objective clinical facts should account for possible underreporting, and further probing is necessary to clarify the true extent of her perceptual and psychological symptoms.

Chief complaint: Perceived auditory hallucinations and visual perceptual disturbances, potentially more severe and frequent than initially reported. Present illness: The patient reports hearing whispers, loud noises, and experiencing scrambled or echoing thoughts. She also reports intermittent blurry or shaky vision, describing these visual phenomena as occurring a few times weekly, with some concern about their normalcy. Given her communication style, these symptoms may be more persistent, frequent, and impactful than indicated.

She also reports intermittent visual phenomena including blurry vision, shadows, flashes, and shakiness, occurring approximately a few times per week. Due to her cautious and minimizing communication style, these symptoms may be more frequent, severe, and impactful than she openly acknowledges. Further assessment is necessary to determine the true severity, frequency, and functional effects of her perceptual disturbances, as well as to explore associated emotional or psychiatric concerns.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, cautious terms, using qualifiers and emotional hedging to soften descriptions of perceptual disturbances. Her responses are brief, organized, but guarded, indicating discomfort with full disclosure and possible internal conflict about her symptoms. - Bias detected: A combination of minimization\u2014downplaying the severity and frequency of visual disturbances\u2014and emotional amplification\u2014her expressed worry and fear\u2014may lead to both underreporting real symptoms and overemphasizing her emotional state. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her language reveals clear biases, but her sincerity and concern are evident, making her internal distress and possible symptom severity likely underestimated. - Reasoning: The pattern of guarded language, qualifiers, and emotional expressions supports the conclusion of minimization and anxiety-driven bias affecting her reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She probably experiences visual disturbances more frequently and with greater impact on her daily life than reported, possibly daily or with more intensity, but minimizes due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose more severe perceptual distortions, hallucinations, or functional impairments, perhaps fearing stigma, misinterpretation, or additional concern from the clinician. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of relapse and worries about her mental health may be exaggerated emotionally, which could distort her perception and reporting of the actual severity of symptoms. - Temporal distortions: She might be underestimating ongoing or worsening symptoms, describing episodic or less severe experiences to avoid escalation or alarm.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, she likely endures frequent, persistent visual disturbances\u2014more than she admits\u2014with episodes possibly occurring daily or multiple times a week, significantly affecting her functioning. Her emotional distress indicates underlying anxiety, which may intensify her perception of symptoms. There might also be additional symptoms she is unwilling to detail fully, such as auditory hallucinations or disorganized thoughts, which could be more severe. The true symptom burden is probably greater than her guarded self-report suggests, with potential underlying mood or psychotic features influencing her perceptions and communication.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: *\"Can you tell me exactly how many times a day you notice these shadows or flashes? Are there days when you don\u2019t notice them at all?\"* (to gauge true frequency) *\"When these symptoms happen, do they sometimes last longer or become more intense? How does that affect what you\u2019re able to do during the day?\"* (to assess severity) *\"Have you ever seen anything that you couldn\u2019t explain or that others also noticed?\"* (to explore hallucinations) *\"Do these visual changes interfere with your work, driving, or daily responsibilities?\"* (to evaluate functional impact) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions emphasizing normalcy and safety to reduce defensiveness. Express understanding of her worry to promote trust. Avoid medical jargon or abrupt inquiries that might cause her to shut down. - Priority order: 1. Clarify the actual frequency and duration of symptoms\u2014most essential to understand true severity. 2. Explore functional impact and specific episodes\u2014helps determine clinical significance. 3. Address emotional concerns and anxieties explicitly\u2014these may contribute to symptom perception and reporting bias.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's cautious and guarded communication suggests she may underreport the frequency and severity of her perceptual disturbances, such as visual shadows, flashes, and shakiness. Her emotional distress and worry could magnify her perception of symptoms, leading her to express concern even if the symptoms are mild or infrequent. There is a likelihood that she experiences these visual phenomena more often and with greater impact than she admits. She also reports auditory hallucinations initially but performs a more superficial description of visual changes, indicating possible withholding of more severe or persistent symptoms. Her responses imply that her symptoms may be happening daily or multiple times weekly, potentially with increased severity during tiredness or anxiety episodes, but her brief and cautious responses limit full understanding. Further probing should focus on exact frequency, duration, and functional impact to clarify the true severity and habitual nature of her symptoms while recognizing her emotional state may exaggerate her perception of distress.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (specific age not provided).  Chief complaint: Visual disturbances characterized by shadows, flashes, blurry vision, and shakiness, with associated auditory hallucinations, adjusted for potential underreporting.  Present illness: The patient experiences intermittent visual phenomena\u2014shadows, flashes, and blurry vision\u2014occurring approximately multiple times per week, with uncertain true frequency and severity due to guarded reporting.

She also reports auditory hallucinations, including hearing whispers and noises, and exhibits signs of emotional distress. Although she minimizes the severity and frequency of her symptoms, there is a high likelihood that these perceptual disturbances are more frequent and impactful than she acknowledges, possibly occurring daily or more severely during episodes of fatigue and anxiety. Her guarded communication style indicates a tendency to underreport or withhold the full extent of her symptoms, which should be further explored to assess severity, functional impact, and any additional psychiatric or neurological features.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient presents with cautious, qualifiers-laden language, emphasizing mildness and infrequency, while hesitating to disclose the full extent of her symptoms. Her responses contain hesitations and vagueness, indicating possible discomfort or ambiguity about her experiences. - Bias detected: Minimization bias compounded with cautious withholding. The patient underreports the severity, frequency, and impact of her hallucinations, potentially due to anxiety, stigma, or fear of judgment. - Confidence level: Medium. There's strong evidence of minimization behaviors, but some details are reasonably conveyed. - Reasoning: The consistent softening of language, hesitations, and vagueness point to an intentional or subconscious downplaying of symptoms, which affects the accuracy of her report.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing hallucinations (visual and auditory) more frequently\u2014possibly daily\u2014and with greater intensity or disruptive impact than she indicates. She might also have episodes of disorientation, cognitive fog, or mood disturbance she is reluctant to admit. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or fearful of being judged, leading her to understate symptoms. She might also be concealing associated features such as paranoia, agitation, or functional impairments impacting her daily life. - Amplified concerns: Her expressed worry about \"not knowing if it\u2019s normal\" and concern about \"worry\" could be exaggerated due to underlying anxiety but may also reflect genuine fears she cannot fully articulate or accept. - Temporal distortions: The actual pattern might be more constant or escalating; her vague timeline suggests she might not remember or acknowledge how persistent or severe these episodes are, possibly underestimating their frequency or severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves more frequent and severe perceptual disturbances\u2014visual and auditory hallucinations occurring daily or multiple times per day\u2014especially during periods of stress or exhaustion. She may also have secondary cognitive or emotional symptoms (disorientation, mood instability) that she is hesitant to disclose. The impact on her functioning could be significant, with potential safety concerns, but her current reporting understates this burden due to anxiety or shame. Her underlying condition may be more serious and persistent than her guarded narrative suggests.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me how often you have these visual or auditory experiences each day? Do they happen every day or only sometimes?\" (to clarify actual frequency) - \"When you notice these symptoms, do they last for a few seconds, minutes, or longer? Do they interfere with your ability to focus or do daily tasks?\" (to gauge severity and impact) - \"Have you experienced any feelings of paranoia, disorientation, or mood changes along with these symptoms?\" (to uncover associated psychiatric features) - \"Are there certain activities, places, or times of day when these symptoms tend to happen more often?\" (to identify triggers or patterns) - \"How are these symptoms affecting your ability to work, sleep, or interact with others?\" (to assess functional impairment) - Approach strategy: Ask in a gentle, nonjudgmental manner, emphasizing understanding rather than judgment, to encourage openness. Frame questions as curiosity about how symptoms impact her life, reducing shame or fear of stigma. - Priority order: 1. Clarify the actual frequency and severity of hallucinations to correct possible underreporting. 2. Explore associated symptoms and functional impact for a comprehensive understanding. 3. Investigate triggers, patterns, and any secondary features to inform diagnosis and treatment planning.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates cautious and vague communication, indicating potential underreporting or minimization of her symptoms. She reports visual disturbances\u2014shadows, flashes, blurry vision, and shakiness\u2014occurring a few times per week, but her language suggests these may be more frequent and severe, possibly daily or multiple times daily, particularly during stress or fatigue. Her auditory hallucinations (whispers and noises) and feelings of being shaken up are acknowledged, but her descriptions imply she may not fully disclose the extent of these experiences. Her mention of symptom onset and impact may underestimate the true severity due to anxiety, stigma, or difficulty accepting her experiences. Evidence suggests her perceptual disturbances likely occur more consistently and impact daily functioning more substantially than her narrative indicates. Additional exploration is needed to clarify the frequency, duration, and associated psychiatric or neurological symptoms to obtain a comprehensive clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female.  Chief complaint: Intermittent visual disturbances and auditory hallucinations, with concern about their severity and frequency.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing shadows, flashes, blurry vision, and shakiness approximately a few times weekly, with possible escalation during periods of stress or fatigue. She also perceives hearing whispers and noises, which she describes as variable and infrequent. She mentions feeling shaken or dizzy during these episodes, but reports no consistent triggering factors apart from tiredness and stress. The language used suggests these symptoms may be more frequent and severe\u2014involving possibly daily episodes\u2014and more disruptive than she admits, potentially affecting her daily functioning significantly. Her reporting indicates hesitance to fully disclose the extent of perceptual disturbances, likely owing to anxiety, stigma, or discomfort. She does not report associated symptoms such as headache or mood changes explicitly, though these could be present but unacknowledged.  Associated symptoms: Dizziness, a sense of fuzziness or head \"fog,\" and increased visual or auditory disturbances during stress. The patient does not explicitly report paranoia, disorientation, or mood alterations, but these possibilities cannot be excluded given her guarded communication style.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Visual disturbances (shadows, flashes, blurry vision, shakiness), auditory hallucinations (whispers, noises), and their association with fatigue/stress. - Medium confidence: The true frequency and severity of symptoms (likely more frequent/daily than reported), and the presence of secondary cognitive or emotional symptoms. - Low confidence: Exact impact on daily life, functional impairment, and full psychiatric or neurological context due to guarded responses. - Missing information: Precise quantification of symptom frequency, duration, associated psychiatric features (paranoia, disorientation), and impact on sleep, work, and interpersonal interactions.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with perceptual disturbances including visual symptoms\u2014shadows, flashes, blurry vision, and shakiness\u2014that occur with suspected higher frequency than initially reported, potentially daily or multiple times per day, often during stress or fatigue. She also experiences auditory hallucinations such as whispers and noises, which appear variable in occurrence. She reports feeling dizzy and experiencing head \"fuzziness\" during episodes. Communication patterns suggest her symptoms may be underreported in terms of frequency, severity, and impact, possibly due to anxiety or stigma. These disturbances are likely more disruptive and persistent than her narrative indicates, warranting detailed further assessment to clarify their true nature and severity.",
