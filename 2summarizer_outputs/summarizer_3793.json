I haven\u2019t taken any special medicines on purpose, I guess. As for eating, I\u2019ve been a bit more tired but don\u2019t notice any big changes in my appetite or weight. Nothing else really stands out to me, I think.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any problems with your coordination, balance, or difficulty performing fine motor tasks, such as writing or manipulating small objects?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, um, sometimes I notice I drop things more often than I used to, and my hands feel all weird when I try to do small stuff, like buttoning my shirt or writing. It kind of makes me nervous because I feel like I\u2019m getting worse or something.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms, such as weakness or tingling, become worse when you are hot or after physical activity?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think maybe sometimes when I get really warm or after I\u2019ve been moving around a lot, I notice that things feel a bit worse, like my hands or legs get even more numb or weak. But I\u2019m not totally sure if that's just in my head or if it really happens.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms, such as weakness or numbness, tend to get worse when you\u2019re exposed to heat, after physical activity, or during hot weather?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I guess sometimes when I\u2019ve been moving around a lot or it\u2019s really hot outside, I feel like things get a little worse\u2026 like my hands and feet feel more weird or numb, but I\u2019m not totally sure if it\u2019s just in my head or if it\u2019s really different.",
