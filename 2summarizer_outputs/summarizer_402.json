And I\u2019ve been noticing that I feel cold a lot more now, even when others aren\u2019t cold. Sometimes my skin feels really dry too. Nothing really new, but it\u2019s been strange.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any swelling or enlargement around your neck, like a goiter, or have you experienced any changes in your voice or difficulty swallowing?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I guess my neck feels a little different sometimes, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s bigger or anything. My voice hasn\u2019t changed that I notice, and I don\u2019t really have trouble swallowing or anything.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other symptoms such as constipation, hoarseness, or a slower heartbeat that might help us understand your condition better?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed anything like that. Sometimes I feel tired, but I guess that\u2019s normal? I don\u2019t really know what I should be paying attention to.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any symptoms such as constipation, hoarseness, a slower heartbeat, or other changes that might further support a diagnosis of hypothyroidism?\\nPATIENT: Umm, I do sometimes feel like my throat is a little hoarse or weird, and I\u2019ve been feeling really tired lately, more than usual. I haven\u2019t really noticed anything about my heartbeat being slow, though.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, such as constipation, or any changes in your heart rate, like a slower pulse or feeling unusually tired even at rest?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I don\u2019t go to the bathroom very often, and I feel kind of tired even when I\u2019m just sitting around. I don\u2019t really know if my heart beats slow or fast, but I do feel kinda worn out.",
