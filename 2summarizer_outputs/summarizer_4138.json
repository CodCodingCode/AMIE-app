Also, have you ever experienced similar episodes accompanied by headaches before, or have you noticed any sensations like tingling, visual disturbances, or loss of consciousness during these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I don\u2019t think I have high blood pressure or anything like that. I don\u2019t really take meds or anything. About the headaches, I\u2019ve had them off and on for a while, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re the same. Sometimes I feel a bit foggy or dizzy, but I\u2019m not exactly sure if that\u2019s what you mean. I haven\u2019t noticed tingling or blackouts or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes feel similar each time, or if they are preceded by any specific sensations or warning signs (like tingling, visual changes, or smells)? Also, do you ever experience similar episodes during or after sleep, or notice any sleep disturbances such as snoring or stopping breathing at night?\\nPATIENT: Um, honestly, they kinda feel the same most times, but I can\u2019t really tell if there\u2019s a warning or anything before it happens. Sometimes I get a little fuzzy or maybe dizzy, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s before or after. And sleep? Well, I do feel tired a lot, and I sometimes wake up feeling like I haven\u2019t slept much, but I don\u2019t remember snoring or stopping breathing or anything like that. It\u2019s all pretty foggy.\\nDOCTOR: Has the patient experienced any chest pain, palpitations, recent infections, or harbor risk factors like smoking, family history of stroke or heart disease?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really get chest pain or palpitations or anything like that. I do smoke a little, but I haven\u2019t had any infections recently. I don\u2019t think anyone in my family has had strokes or heart issues, at least not that I know of.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes are triggered or preceded by any particular sensations, such as visual changes, ringing in your ears, or feeling lightheaded, and are they related to any specific activities or times of day?\\nPATIENT: I don\u2019t really notice anything specific that triggers these episodes. Sometimes they just come on out of nowhere, and I don\u2019t see a pattern or anything in particular that I do before they start.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes tend to occur more often during sleep or upon waking, or if they are related to any sleep disturbances such as snoring, pauses in breathing, or excessive daytime sleepiness?\\nPATIENT: I don't really know if it happens more when I wake up or during sleep. Sometimes I feel kinda tired during the day, but I haven't noticed any snoring or pauses or anything like that. I just get these weird moments, I guess.",
