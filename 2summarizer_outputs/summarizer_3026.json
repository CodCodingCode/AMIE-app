I haven\u2019t noticed much with other parts of my body, but I\u2019ve been losing weight, though I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from not eating much or what. I haven\u2019t had fevers or night sweats or anything like that. My ears still seem okay, no ringing or anything. I\u2019ve never had migraines or any big neurological problems before, and I haven\u2019t had any recent sicknesses, I think.\\nDOCTOR: Do you have any history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or other vascular risk factors? Also, have you experienced any recent infections, fevers, or systemic symptoms like chest pain or skin changes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't really have those things like high blood pressure or diabetes, and I haven't been smoking or anything. I did have that bad sinus infection not long ago, but no fevers or anything else that I can think of. Honestly, I've just been feeling all weird in my head and face, and I don\u2019t know if it's connected or not.\\nDOCTOR: Has the patient experienced any pain around the eye or sinuses, particularly localized to the cavernous sinus region?\\nPATIENT: Honestly, I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s pain exactly, but I sometimes feel kind of like a dull ache or pressure around my eye or maybe my forehead. It\u2019s not sharp or anything, just kind of there, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really in that spot or somewhere else.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any worsening of your eye movements, increased facial numbness, or new symptoms such as weakness, changes in consciousness, or other neurological deficits since your initial symptoms began?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think the eye problems are a little worse sometimes, like I feel more dizzy or floaty, and I kinda can't move my face as easily as before. But I haven\u2019t really noticed anything totally different or any new weird stuff happen, at least I don't think so.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new neurological changes, such as worsening double vision, new facial weakness, or additional nerve symptoms since your symptoms began?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven't noticed anything completely new, but sometimes the double vision feels a little worse or different, and I\u2019m a bit more worried about my face and how it feels. Honestly, I don't really know if anything's changed a lot, it just all feels kind of the same but a little worse to me.",
