Sometimes my legs feel really stiff, like they won\u2019t move right, especially after I\u2019ve been walking for a while. And lately, I\u2019ve also had trouble with my speech \u2014 like words don\u2019t come out right \u2014 and swallowing can be weird sometimes. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all kinda been building up, and I just feel confused about what\u2019s going on with me.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about when your symptoms first started, how they have changed over time, and if there are any particular activities or situations that seem to make them better or worse?\\nPATIENT: Well, I think it started maybe a few years ago, but I don\u2019t really remember the exact time. It\u2019s like, I started feeling more unsteady and then the other stuff, like the stiffness, just kind of got worse, I guess. Sometimes walking longer makes it worse, and I feel a bit better if I rest, but it doesn\u2019t last very long. Sorry, I\u2019m not sure if that helps.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your vision, such as blurred or double vision, or episodes where your vision temporarily worsened?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I guess my vision sometimes feels a little blurry or like things aren\u2019t quite clear, but it\u2019s not all the time, just here and there. I haven\u2019t really had any sudden losses or double vision that I can remember.\\nDOCTOR: Have your speech and swallowing difficulties developed gradually over time, or did they start suddenly? Are they constant, or do they fluctuate?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it started pretty slow, you know? Like I didn't really notice at first, but then it just kept getting worse over months or maybe years. Sometimes it's really noticeable, and other times, I feel like it's not so bad, like it comes and goes a little.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any sensory changes, such as numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations, in your limbs or body?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? Sometimes I feel like my legs just get really stiff or heavy, but I haven\u2019t really noticed any numbness or tingling or anything like that.\\nDOCTOR: Do you also experience any urinary or bowel problems, like urgency, incontinence, or difficulty controlling these functions?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I feel like I need to go more often than usual, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really a problem or just in my head. I haven\u2019t had any accidents or anything, though.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any symptoms like dizziness, fainting, or problems with your blood pressure when standing up, which could suggest autonomic nervous system involvement?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes I feel a bit light-headed or like the room spins when I stand up too fast, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you mean. I guess my blood pressure feels kind of weird sometimes, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s normal or not.",
