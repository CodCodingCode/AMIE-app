I also have this sharp pain on my chest, like a heavy weight pressing on me, and sometimes I cough up a little blood. I almost fainted yesterday, and today I feel dizzy all the time.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her symptoms with vivid, emotionally charged language, emphasizing distress and perceived severity. She favors detailed descriptions but appears influenced by anxiety, which likely amplifies her perceived threat. - Bias detected: Amplification bias driven by anxiety and fear, leading her to overstate her symptoms' severity. - Confidence level: Medium; her explicit complaints are reliable but likely exaggerated in intensity due to emotional factors. - Reasoning: Her use of descriptive, intense language suggests emotional amplification. No signs of withholding or minimization are evident, but her focus on danger and alarm indicates she perceives her symptoms as more severe than they might be objectively.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Emotional distress and internal fears about her health may be more intense than she reports; she might not fully recognize or disclose her internal anxiety levels. - Withheld information: She may hesitate to share fears about mortality or specific anxieties about her health condition, which could influence her perceptions. - Amplified concerns: Her perceived threat level is likely exaggerated; fears of severe outcomes may be heightened beyond clinical reality. - Temporal distortions: The rapid progression sounds plausible, but emotional influence could make her perceive the timeline as more urgent or severe than the objective course.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette probably involves moderate breathlessness that has worsened recently, with episodes of chest discomfort that may be sharp but not necessarily severe or persistent, accompanied by occasional mild hemoptysis and dizziness. Her emotional state likely amplifies her perception of danger, making her symptom report seem more urgent. The actual physical findings might be less severe, but underlying anxiety and distress are significant factors influencing her subjective experience.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about how often you experience these symptoms and whether they come and go?\" to clarify symptom patterns. \"How are you feeling emotionally\u2014do you feel anxious or worried outside of these physical symptoms?\" to assess underlying anxiety. \"Have you experienced similar symptoms before?\" to understand baseline perception. \"What do you think might cause these symptoms?\" to explore her understanding and fears. - Approach strategy: Use calm, validating language to acknowledge her distress while gently exploring the emotional context. Encourage her to describe her experiences without judgment, emphasizing safety and support. - Priority order: First, clarify the physical symptom timeline and severity to understand the objective picture. Second, explore her emotional and psychological state, including fears and anxiety. Third, inquire about her background with similar symptoms or health issues, which may influence her current perception.  **END**",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a detailed and emotionally charged description of symptoms, which indicates possible amplification due to anxiety. She emphasizes severe shortness of breath, chest pain described as heavy, some hemoptysis, dizziness, and near-syncope, suggesting significant distress. However, the subjective nature and emotional tone suggest her perception of severity may be exaggerated. Objective facts likely include moderate dyspnea that has worsened recently, episodes of sharp chest pain that could be variable, and mild hemoptysis that she reports. More severe or persistent symptoms might be underreported or minimized due to emotional distress or difficulty recognizing their significance. There may also be additional symptoms not openly disclosed, such as fear or internal anxiety, which influence symptom perception. Clarification is needed regarding symptom frequency, specific character of chest pain, and her psychological state. Confidence levels vary: physical symptoms are likely real but their perceived severity is amplified, while psychological influences are highly probable but not directly measurable from her report alone.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old woman. Chief complaint: Shortness of breath and chest discomfort, perceived as severe. Present illness: The patient reports worsening shortness of breath over the past day, experiencing episodes of chest pain described as sharp and heavy. She also reports occasional hemoptysis and episodes of dizziness, including a near-fainting event. Physical symptoms are likely moderate in intensity; her perception of severity may be heightened by underlying anxiety. Symptoms may be more frequent or intense than she openly acknowledges. The timeline indicates rapid symptom progression, but the emotional context may influence her narrative. She also perceives her condition as urgent but might underreport additional or related symptoms such as internal anxiety or fears. Associated symptoms: Mild hemoptysis, dizziness, feelings of faintness, chest pain, shortness of breath. Confidence in symptom details: moderate for physical findings, high for the presence of distress, but actual severity is uncertain. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: Symptoms reported (dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, dizziness) are present. - Medium confidence: The severity and urgency of symptoms may be overestimated due to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Exact intensity, frequency, and underlying emotional factors, including anxiety level. - Missing information: Detailed symptom chronology, impact on daily activity, baseline health status, and psychological assessment.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old woman reports a recent onset and worsening of shortness of breath, chest discomfort described as sharp and oppressive, occasional hemoptysis, and dizziness with a near-fainting episode. Her subjective report suggests significant severity, but her emotional expression indicates potential amplification of distress. Physical symptoms are likely of moderate severity, with the possibility of greater underlying anxiety influencing her perception. Further assessment is needed to determine actual symptom severity, underlying causes, and psychological state.",

Her subjective report suggests significant severity, but her emotional expression indicates potential amplification of distress. Physical symptoms are likely of moderate severity, with the possibility of greater underlying anxiety influencing her perception. Further assessment is needed to determine actual symptom severity, underlying causes, and psychological state.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient openly describes significant symptoms with emotional phrasing, showing distress and concern. Her language includes some vague descriptors, hinting at possible mild minimization. She is organized and forthcoming but may be emotionally overwhelmed. - Bias detected: Anxiety-driven amplification. Her distress likely causes her to perceive and report her symptoms as more severe and urgent than they might be objectively. - Confidence level: Medium to high\u2014she provides detailed, consistent symptom descriptions, but her emotional state influences her perception. - Reasoning: Her detailed symptom account indicates honesty, but her emotional tone and emphasis on worst-case scenarios suggest her perception is biased upward by anxiety.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Subtle signs of underlying risk, such as limb swelling or recent immobilization details, might be understated. She may not fully appreciate or report subtle clues indicating her risk level. - Withheld information: She does not show signs of embarrassment or shame, so unlikely to withhold out of shame. However, she might be reluctant to discuss activity levels or minor symptoms that could inform her risk. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of blood clots and serious illness are probably exaggerated, heightening her perception of threat. - Temporal distortions: The acquisition of a specific sudden onset is likely accurate but possibly emotionally inflated, with her focusing on the abruptness somewhat beyond reality.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought, the unbiased assessment suggests she has experienced acute, significant symptoms consistent with a possible pulmonary or cardiovascular event, but her perception of severity is heightened by anxiety. Her physical findings are likely moderate in severity, but her emotional distress magnifies her sense of urgency. There may be minor or subtle risk factors that she is not fully aware of or reporting, and her concerns might overestimate the actual threat.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: Ask about activity levels during immobilization, prior minor symptoms (e.g., leg swelling, pain), recent travel or prolonged sitting, and medication use. Rationale: to identify risk factors for thromboembolism. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, reassuring inquiry to reduce anxiety while emphasizing the importance of risk assessment. Rationale: to gather accurate info without increasing alarm. - Priority order: First, clarify recent activity and risk factors; second, explore subtle symptoms she may have overlooked; third, address her fears directly to gauge her understanding and provide reassurance. Rationale: to safely gather comprehensive information and address emotional distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes acute onset of significant respiratory and chest symptoms with emotional distress, which tends to amplify the perceived severity. Her detailed account supports the presence of severe symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dizziness, but her emotional tone suggests her perception may overstate their true physical severity. There may also be underreported or subtle risk factors such as prior minor symptoms, recent immobilization, or activity levels, which she might minimize or not mention. Overall, physical symptoms are likely moderate in severity, but her anxiety influences her reporting, requiring objective assessment to determine true clinical risk.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old woman  Chief complaint: Recent onset and worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, and dizziness.  Present illness: The patient reports that symptoms began suddenly yesterday afternoon, with progressive shortness of breath, sharp chest pain localized to the left side, and occasional hemoptysis. She experienced dizziness and a near-fainting episode. She describes the chest pain as heavy and pressing but provides no specific physical examination data at this time. Based on her communication, physical symptoms are likely moderate in severity, though her emotional distress may inflate her perception of urgency. There may be unreported or understated risk factors such as recent activity, previous minor symptoms, or immobilization history. The timeline indicates a symptom onset within approximately 24 hours, with rapid progression.  Associated symptoms: Dizziness and near-fainting episodes, coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Confidence in this symptom report is high, but physical examination findings are absent, and some symptoms may be underreported or unrecognized.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient experienced acute respiratory and chest symptoms with a clear timeline. - Medium confidence: Symptom severity assessment is influenced by her emotional distress; actual physical findings need verification. - Low confidence: The extent of underlying risk factors or subtle symptoms such as limb swelling or recent immobilization is unknown due to limited history. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, vital signs, recent activity and immobilization history, and further assessment of risk factors are needed for a complete picture.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally intense language, describes rapid worsening of symptoms, and emphasizes fears of severe outcomes, demonstrating emotional amplification. Her narrative is organized but heavily influenced by distress. - Bias detected: Amplification bias affecting her symptom reporting, driven by anxiety and fear. - Confidence level: Medium. While she provides coherent details, her emotional state likely inflates symptom severity. - Reasoning: The persistent emphasis on worst-case scenarios and intense language confirms amplification bias. Her openness suggests little withholding but high emotional input distorts objective appraisal.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may not be reporting any minor or normal symptoms\u2014such as mild breathlessness or cough\u2014that could suggest a less alarming cause. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to mention any reassuring signs, lack of other symptoms, or previous health baseline stability. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of death or severe damage are probably exaggerated compared to clinical reality. - Temporal distortions: She perceives symptoms as starting suddenly and worsening swiftly\u2014this may be accurate but also possibly magnified by emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased view likely indicates: - She experienced a sudden onset of mild to moderate respiratory discomfort and chest symptoms, which may be consistent with benign causes such as musculoskeletal strain or mild infection. - The reported coughing up blood and near fainting require thorough investigation but might not be as alarming as perceived, especially given her high anxiety. - Her fears are disproportionate to some clinical indicators; she may not have severe underlying pathology but perceives herself to be in grave danger. - Her emotional amplification skews her perception of the severity and speed of symptom progression.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * Have you experienced similar symptoms before, and if so, what was the cause? (to contextualize severity) * Are there any other associated symptoms like fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss? (to assess for infection or other causes) * Did the coughing up blood happen only once or repeatedly? How much blood was there? (to gauge seriousness) * Have you had any prior lung or heart issues? (to understand baseline health) * What do you think caused these symptoms? (to explore her understanding and fears) - Approach strategy: Ask in a calm, nonjudgmental manner emphasizing reassurance and the aim to understand rather than criticize. Use open-ended questions to reduce anxiety and encourage sharing of normal patterns. - Priority order: Begin with baseline health and history, then move to specific symptoms, then explore her perceptions and fears. This helps build rapport, reduce emotional amplification, and gather more objective data.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain described as a heavy sensation, cough with occasional blood, dizziness, and near fainting. Her narrative emphasizes rapid worsening and severe fears, which suggests emotional amplification. This bias may lead her to overestimate symptom severity and minimize less alarming aspects of her condition. She reports onset as sudden and symptoms worsening over a day, but based on communication patterns, the true initial symptoms may have been milder and gradually escalated or perceived as more severe due to anxiety. She may be withholding or downplaying prior, less severe symptoms such as mild breathlessness or cough, which could suggest a less critical process. The presence of hemoptysis and syncope-like symptoms warrants urgent evaluation, but their severity might not be as dire as her fears suggest. Additional objective information, including past medical history, the quantity and timing of blood in cough, and associated symptoms such as fever, is lacking and needed for full assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old woman.  Chief complaint: Sudden-onset shortness of breath with chest heaviness and occasional hemoptysis, with rapid worsening over one day, accompanied by dizziness and near fainting episodes.  Present illness: The patient reports feeling unable to breathe adequately and experiencing chest heaviness since yesterday afternoon, with symptoms worsening over the course of a day. She reports coughing up a small amount of blood and feeling dizzy to the point of nearly fainting. Based on communication bias, her initial symptoms may have been milder and gradually worsened or perceived as more severe due to anxiety. She expresses significant fears of a serious event such as a blood clot or cardiac catastrophe, which may inflate her perception of symptom severity. Additional symptoms such as fever, chills, or prior similar episodes are not reported; prior health history is unknown.  Associated symptoms: No information provided about fever, weight loss, or other systemic signs.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Present symptoms\u2014shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, dizziness\u2014are as reported. - Medium confidence: The degree of symptom severity and urgency\u2014likely exaggerated\u2014requires cautious interpretation. - Low confidence: Exact onset, initial symptom intensity, and associated systemic signs are uncertain due to communication bias. - Missing information: Past medical history, physical exam findings, vital signs, investigation results, history of similar episodes, and details about the quantity and frequency of hemoptysis.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old woman presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and hemoptysis occurring over the past day. She reports dizziness and a near fainting episode concurrent with respiratory symptoms. While these symptoms are objective findings warranting urgent evaluation, her emotional distress and fear likely amplify her perception of severity. She may have experienced milder respiratory discomfort prior to this episode, which she perceives as more intense due to anxiety. Further assessment, including detailed history, physical examination, and investigations, is essential to determine the actual severity and cause of her symptoms.",

She reports dizziness and a near fainting episode concurrent with respiratory symptoms. While these symptoms are objective findings warranting urgent evaluation, her emotional distress and fear likely amplify her perception of severity. She may have experienced milder respiratory discomfort prior to this episode, which she perceives as more intense due to anxiety. Further assessment, including detailed history, physical examination, and investigations, is essential to determine the actual severity and cause of her symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Margaret responds with softening language, minimizes initial symptom severity, and admits to a sudden onset but with vague descriptions. Her responses show a sincere emotional distress but also a tendency to downplay or understate her symptoms. - Bias detected: Mild to moderate minimization bias, evidenced by her use of understatement words and her possible unawareness of ongoing mild symptoms prior to the acute event. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014While her distress and main symptoms are likely accurate, the details about symptom onset and early signs are probably understated. - Reasoning: The soft language, reluctance to provide detailed history upfront, and her self-protective responses indicate she is partly minimizing her initial and perhaps lesser symptoms, possibly due to anxiety, embarrassment, or a natural tendency to downplay health issues.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may have experienced mild breathlessness, fatigue, or coughs before the episode that she considers insignificant and thus did not mention explicitly. - Withheld information: She might be uncomfortable revealing past minor episodes related to respiratory issues or previous health fears. - Amplified concerns: Her current worries about blood clots and severe outcomes are real and likely amplified by anxiety, but her description of severity may be exaggerated. - Temporal distortions: She perceives the onset as \u201ckinda sudden\u201d but possibly had subtle symptoms beforehand that she did not recognize, leading to underestimation of early warning signs.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves a patient who experienced mild symptoms\u2014such as slight breathlessness, fatigue, or minor discomfort\u2014that she regarded as insignificant until an acute exacerbation occurred. Her emotional distress and anxiety about serious conditions are genuine and may heighten her perception of severity. The current severe symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis) are real, but her initial assessment underplays preceding warning signs. The timeline suggests a possibly gradual progression with an abrupt worsening, but soft language obscures early warning recognition.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \u201cDid you notice any mild symptoms like fatigue, slight cough, or minor chest discomfort before the sudden onset yesterday?\u201d - \u201cHave you had similar episodes or mild respiratory issues in the past even if they seemed insignificant?\u201d - \u201cCan you tell me more about what you felt in the hours or days before the event?\u201d - \u201cHave you experienced any other unusual symptoms recently, such as swollen legs, persistent cough, or fever?\u201d - Approach strategy: - Use open, gentle questioning emphasizing normalcy (\u201cMany people notice minor symptoms they don\u2019t think much of initially\u2026\u201d), to reduce defensiveness. - Reassure her that identifying all symptoms helps us understand the situation fully. - Clarify that mild symptoms can be important clues, encouraging honesty without judgment. - Priority order: - First, explore early or mild symptoms to uncover potential premonitory signs. - Then, delve into her prior health history, including any previous respiratory or cardiovascular issues. - Follow up on her emotional state, so her anxiety does not distort her reporting further.  This approach enhances assessment accuracy and helps uncover the true progression of her symptoms for appropriate intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's subjective reports indicate severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, dizziness, and near fainting. However, her communication pattern\u2014using soft, understated language and possibly minimizing initial symptom severity\u2014suggests she may have experienced prior mild symptoms like minor cough, fatigue, or slight breathlessness that she did not consider significant. Her emotional distress and fear likely amplify her perception of symptom severity, but objective findings require cautious interpretation. While current severe symptoms are likely accurate, earlier warning signs might be understated or undisclosed. The timeline indicates an abrupt worsening on the day prior, but early symptoms could have been subtle and overlooked. Additional probing is necessary to uncover potential premonitory symptoms and past respiratory or cardiovascular issues. Confidence in the current severe symptoms is high, but the understanding of the full early course is limited by communication biases, leading to medium confidence about the initial presentation and probable underreporting of minor symptoms that could be clinically relevant.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old woman  Chief complaint: Acute severe shortness of breath and chest pain with hemoptysis occurring over the past day  Present illness: The patient reports an abrupt onset of dyspnea, chest heaviness, and minor hemoptysis that worsened over the last 24 hours. She also experienced dizziness and a near fainting episode during this period. Prior to this acute presentation, there may have been mild respiratory symptoms\u2014such as fatigue, slight cough, or minimal discomfort\u2014that she considered inconsequential and did not report explicitly. The initial symptoms likely started subtly, with her perception of suddenness possibly influenced by emotional distress and anxiety. No previous episodes of similar chest discomfort or breathlessness are noted, but her reporting suggests she may have minimized earlier warning signs. The severity of current symptoms is objective, but the progression may have involved prior mild symptoms that are underreported.  Associated symptoms: Dizziness, mild cough, possible fatigue; confidence level varies, but current symptoms are likely accurate  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Present symptoms of severe dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, dizziness, and near fainting - Medium confidence: Presence and nature of initial milder symptoms prior to acute onset (potentially understated) - Low confidence: Details regarding previous episodes, past respiratory or cardiac issues, and the timeline of early symptoms due to communication bias - Missing information: Detailed history of prior mild symptoms, past health issues, and any recent activities or risk factors\nANSWER: A 62-year-old woman presents with an acute onset of severe shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and hemoptysis that have intensified over the past day.

Her language and tone amplify her distress, likely reflecting her anxiety rather than solely objective symptoms.

While she is providing detailed info, emotional amplification suggests the need to interpret her severity reports cautiously. - Reasoning: Her expressive language and emphasis on worst-case scenarios indicate her anxiety playing a significant role in her symptom perception and reporting. Her detailed timeline suggests honesty but should be contextualized with possible insidious symptom progression.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Minor symptoms such as fatigue, slight cough, or mild discomfort prior to her perception of sudden onset may be unreported, as her focus is on the intense, distressing sensations she now experiences. - Withheld information: She does not appear embarrassed or conceal symptoms; openness suggests full disclosure. - Amplified concerns: She might be overstating her physical symptoms' severity, perceiving them as catastrophic. Her fears of death or permanent damage could be magnified by her anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The rapid onset \"yesterday\" might obscure a more gradual progression, as her emotional response has intensified her perception of suddenness.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased picture suggests that her symptoms likely began more insidiously, with minor or nonspecific sensations (mild fatigue, slight cough) present earlier and unnoticed. The recent severe shortness of breath and heaviness are real but may be somewhat less intense or abrupt than she reports. Her current distress is greatly amplified by anxiety, which colors her perception of severity and progression. There may also be underlying symptoms not immediately apparent, such as subtle chest discomfort or fatigue, that she is not emphasizing.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Did you notice any mild symptoms like tiredness, slight cough, or minor discomfort before the severe symptoms started?\" (to uncover earlier symptoms that may have been overlooked) 2. \"Can you describe how your symptoms have changed over the past few days\u2014were there moments when they were milder?\" (to better understand the real progression) 3. \"Are there any other symptoms you've experienced, like palpitations, dizziness, or unusual sensations?\" (to identify other relevant signs) 4. \"How anxious do you feel about these symptoms, and do you have a history of anxiety or panic?\" (to assess the role of emotional factors in perception)  - Approach strategy: Ask questions empathetically, validating her distress while gently encouraging her to provide a full picture. Use open-ended, non-judgmental language to reduce emotional amplification and gather more precise information. - Priority order: Start with clarifying the timeline and milder symptoms first, then explore associated symptoms, followed by her emotional state and worries, to build a comprehensive and balanced clinical understanding.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes severe, sudden onset shortness of breath and chest heaviness with hemoptysis, dizziness, and near-fainting, which she reports as beginning abruptly the previous day. However, her emotional distress and high anxiety levels likely influence her perception and reporting, amplifying the perceived severity and rapid onset. Communication patterns suggest she may have experienced milder, less noticeable symptoms such as fatigue, slight cough, or minor chest discomfort prior to her awareness of the severe symptoms. She emphasizes the current distress, but objective clinical assessment should consider that her initial symptom timeline could be more insidious, with early warning signs underreported or unnoticed. Her description of the heaviness and shortness of breath is real, but the intensity and suddenness may be overstated due to anxiety-driven amplification. Further inquiry into prior subtle symptoms and emotional state is needed for a complete picture.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old woman presents with acute onset of severe shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and hemoptysis, with symptoms reportedly beginning suddenly the previous day. She reports associated dizziness and a near-fainting episode at that time. Communication suggests her current distress may amplify perceived severity; she likely experienced earlier, milder symptoms such as fatigue, slight cough, or mild chest discomfort before the initial sharp symptoms became severe. Her current presentation indicates a potentially serious cardiopulmonary condition requiring urgent evaluation, but her subjective report of rapid, catastrophic onset may be influenced by anxiety and emotional distress. Further assessment should explore prior subtle symptoms, associated signs, and her emotional state to establish an accurate clinical picture.",
