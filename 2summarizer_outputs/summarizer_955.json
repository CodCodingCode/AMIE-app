Her responses are detailed and openly expressive, with little indication of withholding or minimization, but her language suggests amplification influenced by distress. - Bias detected: Amplification bias. - Confidence level: High. - Reasoning: Her strongly emotional, dramatic language and focus on worst-case scenarios point towards anxiety-driven exaggeration, which likely inflates her perception of symptom severity but does not obscure factual details entirely.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting symptoms of anemia such as dizziness, fatigue, or fainting, which can be less alarming but are important for clinical assessment. - Withheld information: She appears open, but she might be reluctant to share for example, her coping strategies or impact on her daily function, or she might understate her social support system. - Amplified concerns: Her worries about worsening bleeding and health could be overemphasized due to her anxiety, leading her to perceive her condition as more dangerous. - Temporal distortions: Her emotional distress may make her perceive symptoms as happening more rapidly or severely than they are in reality.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should likely include: - Significant bleeding episodes centered on nosebleeds, heavy menses, and possible ongoing bleeding from cuts, with some physical signs indicative of blood loss (e.g., pallor, fatigue). Her blood in stool and urine suggests a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy but may be less immediately alarming than perceived. - Symptoms of anemia (fatigue, weakness) might be present but downplayed or unrecognized by her. - Her timeline likely reflects actual episodes with some emotional exaggeration; she perceives worsening, but objective assessment may reveal more stable or manageable symptoms. - Her anxiety is contributing to overestimating urgency, but she is likely experiencing genuine physical symptoms that require medical investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any dizziness, fainting, or weakness?\" to identify anemia effects. - \"Can you tell me more about how often you are bleeding and how much each time?\" to clarify severity. - \"How do you feel during and between episodes\u2014any fatigue or other symptoms?\" to assess physical impact. - \"What do you do to manage these symptoms, and how are you coping emotionally?\" to understand support systems. - \"Have you discussed your bleeding history with your family or other healthcare providers?\" for context. - Approach strategy: - Use calm, empathetic inquiry to help her express concerns without increasing anxiety. - Gently probe for physical symptoms she might be avoiding or minimizing. - Validate her distress but also clarify objective facts to balance perception. - Priority order: - First, ask about physical symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and fainting to evaluate anemia. - Next, clarify the bleeding episodes' frequency and severity. - Then, explore her emotional state and coping mechanisms. - Finally, review past medical evaluations and family history for comprehensive understanding.  This structured approach helps mitigate amplification bias and gathers essential data for accurate clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports multiple bleeding episodes\u2014persistent nosebleeds, heavy menses, and bleeding from a recent cut\u2014and mentions seeing blood in stool and urine. Her language suggests high emotional distress, which may amplify perceived severity, potentially leading her to overstate ongoing bleeding episodes. However, the objective clinical facts are that she is experiencing active bleeding episodes involving mucous membranes and possible internal bleeding, and signs of anemia such as pallor and fatigue, although these are not explicitly reported and require assessment. She may be minimizing symptoms of anemia like dizziness or weakness, and could be withholding details about the impact on her daily function or additional symptoms. Her concerns might be exaggerated due to anxiety, but the physical findings likely involve significant bleeding requiring medical evaluation. Further assessment should focus on physical signs of anemia, quantifying bleeding severity, and exploring associated symptoms objectively.\nANSWER: Patient is a [age] year-old [gender] presenting with reports of persistent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, and bleeding from a recent cut. The patient also reports observing blood in stool and urine. Physical examination would be indicated to assess for pallor, signs of anemia such as fatigue or dizziness, and ongoing bleeding. The reported mucocutaneous bleeding episodes suggest a possible bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. While the patient describes these symptoms with significant emotional emphasis, objective findings are necessary to determine their severity and impact. Additional details regarding associated symptoms\u2014such as dizziness, weakness, or fainting\u2014and the frequency and volume of bleeding episodes are needed for comprehensive evaluation. There is a likelihood that some symptoms or associated signs are underreported or minimized, and emotional distress may influence symptom perception. Further investigation should include physical examination, laboratory testing of blood counts and coagulation parameters, and detailed history of bleeding episodes to inform diagnosis and management.",

Further investigation should include physical examination, laboratory testing of blood counts and coagulation parameters, and detailed history of bleeding episodes to inform diagnosis and management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Linda is openly expressive, providing detailed accounts of her symptoms with emotional intensity. She emphasizes severity and urgency, possibly to garner attention or prompt prompt action, but her overall responses suggest honesty. Her speech reflects distress, with rapidity when upset, but she maintains coherence and consistency. - Bias detected: An amplification bias influenced by her anxiety appears to be affecting her perception of severity\u2014the language reflects genuine fear, leading to overestimation of danger without apparent intentional exaggeration. - Confidence level: High, as her detailed and organized reporting supports reliability, but her emotional state warrants cautious interpretation of perceived threat levels. - Reasoning: Her openness, specificity, and emotional charge point to authentic concern, though anxiety heightens her perception of danger. Her willingness to disclose details suggests reliability, but her distress may inflate her assessment of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may underreport or overlook milder symptoms like fatigue, mild pallor, or controllable bleeding episodes, as her focus is on extreme signs and her fears. - Withheld information: She doesn't seem embarrassed to share physical symptoms; however, she might not mention adherence to treatments or prior bleeding history unless specifically asked. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about severity and danger is likely exaggerated due to anxiety, leading her to perceive her condition as more life-threatening than it may be. - Temporal distortions: The perceived rapid worsening may be slightly exaggerated; bleeding events may have been more gradual, but her anxiety could distort the timeline to suggest urgency.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a patient experiencing ongoing abnormal bleeding\u2014prolonged nosebleeds, heavy menses, blood in stool and urine\u2014all of which are concerning for a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. Her recent worsening and bleeding severity are genuine, though perhaps slightly overestimated due to anxiety. She may also have mild anemia symptoms (fatigue, pallor) that she considers insignificant or hasn't emphasized but are clinically relevant. The progression is probably more gradual than perceived, with her anxiety amplifying her sense of crisis. This overall scenario warrants thorough examination and laboratory evaluation to determine the specific etiology of bleeding and assess her physical status.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any dizziness, fainting, or feeling unusually weak during or between bleeding episodes?\" (to assess anemia and severity) - \"How often do these nosebleeds and other bleeding episodes occur now, and have they changed recently?\" (to clarify frequency and progression) - \"Are you taking any medications, including blood thinners or herbal supplements?\" (to evaluate contributing factors) - \"Have you followed your previous treatments or seen any specialists for bleeding issues before?\" (to gather history) - Approach strategy: - Use a calm, empathetic tone to reduce anxiety and encourage honest sharing. - Normalize their concern but gently explore facts without dismissing fears, to build trust and elicit complete information. - Probe gently about associated symptoms, emphasizing care for her overall wellbeing, to identify possible mild symptoms she might not mention spontaneously. - Priority order: 1. Assess for symptoms of anemia and general physical wellbeing to determine how active her bleeding has affected her overall health. 2. Clarify the timeline and severity of episodes to distinguish between genuine progression and perceptions influenced by anxiety. 3. Explore past medical history and treatments to understand the background and guide diagnostic testing.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient communicates with emotional intensity, emphasizing the severity of her bleeding symptoms, which suggests anxiety may amplify her perception of danger. She reports recent onset or worsening of nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, and bleeding in stool and urine, but her detailed description indicates these are likely genuine symptoms, although their perceived severity might be exaggerated. She may underreport milder accompanying symptoms such as fatigue or pallor or withhold relevant history (e.g., prior bleeding episodes, medication use) unless specifically asked. Her focus on acute, dramatic symptoms suggests her overall clinical picture involves ongoing bleeding episodes that warrant further objective assessment. The timeline indicates a recent escalation, but this may be slightly distorted by her distress. Laboratory evaluation would be necessary to confirm ongoing bleeding and to evaluate for underlying coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, age unspecified. Chief complaint: Persistent and recent onset of heavy bleeding episodes, including nosebleeds, menstrual bleeding, and bleeding from other sites. Present illness: The patient reports that nosebleeds began yesterday morning with worsening severity overnight, and she experienced abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. She also observed blood in stool and urine. She reports bleeding from a recent cut that was heavier than usual. Subjective reports suggest these symptoms are severe, though emotional distress may have exaggerated their impact. Associated symptoms: No explicit mention of dizziness, faintness, or weakness; these symptoms should be specifically assessed. Physical examination findings are pending but should include signs of anemia (e.g., pallor, fatigue), ongoing bleeding, and systemic examination to locate bleeding sources. Confidence_assessment: - High confidence: The presence of bleeding related to nose, menstrual cycle, stool, urine, and recent cut. - Medium confidence: The severity and progression of symptoms, potentially amplified by anxiety. - Low confidence: Exact symptom frequency, volume of bleeding, associated systemic symptoms, and prior medical history. - Missing information: Objective examination findings, laboratory results (CBC, coagulation profile), detailed bleeding history, medication use, and previous evaluations or treatments.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with ongoing bleeding complaints, including recent onset of nosebleeds that worsened overnight, heavy menstrual bleeding, and blood observed in stool and urine. She also reports bleeding from a recent cut, which was heavier than usual. These symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, although her emotional distress may have heightened her perception of severity. No systemic symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or pallor have been specified, but physical examination is necessary to assess for anemia, ongoing bleeding, and other physical signs. Laboratory assessment to evaluate hematologic and coagulation parameters is indicated to determine the underlying cause and guide management.",

Laboratory assessment to evaluate hematologic and coagulation parameters is indicated to determine the underlying cause and guide management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional elaboration, emphasizing severity and recent worsening, but offers vague details about triggers and prior history. - Bias detected: Amplification bias influenced by anxiety, leading her to perceive and describe her symptoms as more severe and urgent than they might objectively be. - Confidence level: Medium; her emotional state suggests her perception of severity is heightened, but factual details necessitate corroboration. - Reasoning: Her use of emotionally charged language and vague timelines, along with selective disclosure, supports the presence of anxiety-driven amplification and some withholding of baseline or management information.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting less severe or more chronic symptoms, such as mild bleeding episodes or her overall health resilience, due to focusing on current distress. - Withheld information: Details about previous bleeding episodes, adherence to treatments, or systemic symptoms like dizziness or pallor may be omitted out of discomfort or unawareness. - Amplified concerns: Her perception of rapid deterioration and severity may be exaggerated, driven by her anxiety and fear of serious illness. - Temporal distortions: She could be overestimating how quickly symptoms worsened or the overall duration, perhaps viewing chronic mild symptoms as acutely severe due to emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: A patient with a history of bleeding tendencies presenting with recent-onset heavy bleeding episodes, including nasal, menstrual, and mucocutaneous bleeding, which may have been ongoing but mild previously. The recent increase in bleeding severity and frequency, possibly associated with increased anxiety, is perceived as alarming. She reports no systemic symptoms like dizziness or fatigue, but physical exam and laboratory tests are critical to assess for anemia, clotting abnormalities, or underlying bleeding disorders. Her emotional state may bias her perception towards overestimating the clinical danger, so objective measures are necessary.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Have you had similar bleeding episodes before, and if so, how often and how severe?\" (to establish baseline) 2. \"Are you currently taking any medications or supplements that could affect bleeding?\" (to identify confounders) 3. \"Do you feel dizzy, weak, or tired? Have you experienced any fainting?\" (to assess systemic effects) 4. \"Have you noticed if your bleeding gets better with any treatment or rest?\" (to gauge management response) 5. \"How is your diet and overall health status generally?\" (to understand broader health context) - Approach strategy: Use calm, empathetic questioning to reduce anxiety and encourage openness. Frame questions in a non-judgmental way to explore past patterns without making her feel judged. - Priority order: Start with establishing her baseline bleeding pattern to differentiate background issues from acute worsening, then move to systemic symptoms, treatment adherence, and psychosocial factors, ensuring a comprehensive assessment while minimizing anxiety escalation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional amplification, emphasizing the severity and recent worsening of bleeding symptoms, likely driven by anxiety. She describes nosebleeds starting yesterday and worsening overnight, heavy bleeding from a cut, menstrual bleeding, and blood in stool and urine, but details on baseline bleeding patterns and systemic symptoms are vague or absent. Her perception of progression and severity may be exaggerated, so objective data is essential. Some symptoms may be minimized or withheld, such as past bleeding episodes, overall health, and response to previous treatments. The communication pattern suggests overestimating threat, necessitating cautious interpretation and further investigations to confirm clinical findings. Collateral history and laboratory assessments are needed to determine the underlying bleeding disorder and rule out systemic causes, acknowledging her emotional state as a potential bias.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female.  Chief complaint: Recent onset of severe nasal bleeding and complaints of heavy menstrual, gastrointestinal, and urinary bleeding, perceived as worsened recently.  Present illness: The patient reports having nosebleeds starting yesterday morning, with worsening overnight, and ongoing heavy bleeding from a recent cut that was heavier than usual. She also reports heavy menstrual bleeding and blood visible in stool and urine. No systemic symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, or fainting are mentioned. The timeline suggests recent worsening of bleeding symptoms, but prior baseline bleeding patterns are not detailed. It is possible that her perception of recent severity surpasses her actual baseline bleeding frequency or severity, and some symptoms may be underreported or unrecognized.  Associated symptoms: No systemic symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, or pallor have been described; presence of bleeding across multiple sites suggests a potential bleeding tendency, but confirmation requires physical and laboratory evaluation.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Patient reports recent nasal bleeding starting and worsening overnight, bleeding from a cut, heavy menstrual bleeding, and bleeding in stool and urine. - Medium confidence: The perception of recent worsening and severity may be biased; prior baseline bleeding patterns are unknown. - Low confidence: Exact severity, duration, and frequency of past bleeding episodes are uncertain; systemic symptoms are not reported but need to be specifically inquired. - Missing information: Details on past bleeding history, medication use, systemic symptoms, overall health status, and physical examination findings are needed for a comprehensive assessment.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional intensity, presenting her symptoms through a lens of anxiety and uncertainty. She combines vague, non-specific details with exaggerated fears, and her responses reveal both minimization and amplification. Her responses lack precise timelines and detailed symptom descriptions, indicative of emotional distress and possible confusion. - Bias detected: The primary bias is emotional amplification coupled with some minimization\u2014she overstates her fears about danger and severity while downplaying or avoiding detailed descriptions of ongoing bleeding. This bias impacts the clarity and reliability of her report. - Confidence level: Medium; her distress and emotional language clearly influence her reporting, but her genuine symptoms (bleeding and fatigue) are corroborated by physical signs, supporting some reliability. - Reasoning: Her emotional distress seems to inflate her perceived severity of symptoms, leading to overestimation of danger and underreporting of minor or ongoing issues. The vagueness and inconsistencies reflect her difficulty in processing and relaying multiple overlapping symptoms amid anxiety.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Ongoing minor bleeding, fatigue, pallor, or systemic signs that she underreports due to focus on the most alarming aspects. - Withheld information: Possibly her level of functional impairment, previous blood work, or management efforts; she may feel shame or fear about her overall health status. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about needing transfusions or imminent danger are likely exaggerated, driven by anxiety\u2014actual clinical risk may be lower than perceived. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms likely began earlier than two days ago, with episodic worsening not clearly recalled; her perception of sudden onset is influenced by emotional distress.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the true clinical scenario probably involves ongoing bleeding episodes since at least early to mid-last week, with intermittent worsening which she perceives as sudden. Significant fatigue and pallor may be present but unacknowledged or underreported. Her current fears are emotionally driven but rooted in real symptoms, indicating need for objective assessment to validate physical findings and laboratory data.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: - \"Can you tell me how often you notice bleeding each day, and how long it lasts?\" (to quantify frequency) - \"Have you experienced feelings of dizziness, weakness, or increased fatigue?\" (to identify systemic signs) - \"Have you noticed any bruises, paleness, or other unusual symptoms?\" (to assess blood loss signs) - \"What have you done so far to manage these episodes?\" (to understand current approach) - \"Have you had any recent blood tests or treatments for this problem?\" (to get objective data) - Approach strategy: - Use calm, empathetic language to help reduce anxiety and encourage honest sharing. - Reassure her that discussing all symptoms, even minor ones, is important for her safety. - Validate her fears without dismissing them, guiding her to focus on observable facts. - Priority order: - First, gather concrete symptom data\u2014frequency, duration, associated symptoms\u2014to establish a baseline. - Next, explore systemic signs of blood loss (dizziness, weakness). - Finally, clarify previous medical management and objective findings to form an accurate clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication shows emotional distress, with tendencies to amplify fears about severity and danger, and possibly underreport ongoing minor bleeding or systemic signs such as fatigue or pallor. The vague and inconsistent details suggest she may be minimizing some symptoms or withholding information due to fear or shame, while her anxiety-driven language inflates the perceived urgency. Therefore, objective facts should focus on the reported bleeding episodes, recognizing that these episodes likely began earlier than she reports, possibly last week or longer, with intermittent worsening. Her fears about needing transfusions and passing out are probably exaggerated in perception, but her physical symptoms\u2014such as bleeding and fatigue\u2014are real and warrant thorough investigation.

She reports episodic and variable bleeding severity but may be underestimating associated systemic effects such as fatigue or pallor, which are common with ongoing blood loss. Her emotional distress and anxiety-related communication patterns suggest she perceives her symptoms as more severe than objectivity might indicate, but the bleeding and blood presence across multiple sites are confirmed. The timeline indicates bleeding has been ongoing for at least a few days, with recent worsening, necessitating further investigation including physical examination and laboratory studies to assess for bleeding disorders or systemic causes.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional, vague language, emphasizing fear and distress, while providing limited concrete details about her bleeding episodes and triggers. Her responses demonstrate scattered narratives, hesitation, and occasional minimization, likely influenced by anxiety. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification coupled with some minimization influences her reporting, making her seem more distressed yet underestimating or ambiguously describing severity. There is also potential withholding of detailed symptom or trigger information. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her emotional cues strongly suggest bias, but her physical complaints (heavy bleeding, blood in stool/urine) are confirmed and warrant careful assessment. - Reasoning: The emotional distress and vagueness suggest her perception of symptoms may be exaggerated by anxiety, but her reports of systemic bleeding are factual and significant. Her minimization may lead her to understate baseline severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be downplaying ongoing fatigue, pallor, or systemic effects that typically accompany significant blood loss, possibly because they are less salient or because of difficulty connecting symptoms. - Withheld information: She might be hesitant to fully disclose the extent of her bleeding or past episodes, possibly out of embarrassment or fear of alarming herself or family. She may also be reluctant to share details about previous management or understanding of her condition. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about passing out and danger, while justified to some extent, may be exaggerated relative to objective clinical risk, driven by emotional distress. - Temporal distortions: She might perceive her symptoms as worsening suddenly when in fact there may be a gradual worsening over days to weeks. Her emotional state might color her perception of the timeline, making her think deterioration is more rapid than it objectively is.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the true clinical situation likely involves ongoing, possibly heavy menstrual bleeding, systemic effects such as fatigue and dizziness that she is underreporting, and recent severe bleeding episodes (nosebleed exceeding usual duration) suggestive of an underlying bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. The progression may be gradual but perceived as sudden deterioration due to her heightened anxiety and emotional amplification. Accurate diagnosis requires objective measures, including lab tests and physical exam, beyond her current perception.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly how many days you've been having heavy bleeding? How much blood do you think you're losing each day? Are you experiencing pallor, chest pain, or shortness of breath? Have your energy levels changed over time?\" - Approach strategy: Ask gently, validating her distress while encouraging detailed responses, e.g., \"That sounds really concerning; I want to understand exactly what you're experiencing so we can help. Can you tell me more about how your fatigue or dizziness has been?\" - Priority order: First focus on systemic symptoms and timeline (to gauge severity and progression), then explore triggers and past management, followed by emotional state to address anxiety contributing to her perception. This ensures gathering essential objective data while maintaining rapport.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication is characterized by emotional distress, vague and scattered descriptions, and possible minimization of systemic symptoms like fatigue and pallor. Her emphasis on fear and recent severe bleeding may amplify her perception of their severity, while she might underreport ongoing systemic effects or previous episodes. She appears to be experiencing ongoing heavy bleeding, including recent severe nosebleeds, and reports blood in stool and urine, which are objective facts. However, her perception of the bleeding severity and potential danger seems exaggerated, influenced by anxiety. She may be withholding details about the extent and frequency of her bleeding, as well as physical symptoms like pallor or dizziness, which are common with significant blood loss. Timeline suggests bleeding has persisted for several days with recent worsening. More objective data from physical exam and labs are needed to confirm severity and underlying causes, such as coagulopathies or platelet dysfunction. Communicative patterns suggest a need for careful probing regarding systemic symptoms and bleeding volume while providing reassurance to address anxiety.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female. Chief complaint: Recent heavy and persistent bleeding episodes, including severe nosebleed, abnormal bleeding from cuts, and blood in stool and urine. Present illness: She reports ongoing heavy menstrual bleeding over several days, with recent escalation characterized by a nosebleed that has lasted over a day and worsened overnight. She also notes blood in stool and urine but minimizes descriptions of systemic symptoms such as fatigue or pallor, though physical effects are likely more severe than reported. She describes the bleeding as occurring unpredictably without clear triggers, but her emotional state indicates possible underrecognition of severity. The timeline indicates bleeding has been persistent for multiple days, with recent intensification. Associated symptoms: She reports feeling fatigued, dizzy, and tired, especially following bleeding episodes; actual severity of these symptoms may be underestimated. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: Presence of ongoing heavy menstrual bleeding, current severe nosebleed, blood in stool and urine. - Medium confidence: Reported fatigue, dizziness, and tiredness, which may be underreported or underestimated. - Low confidence: The true extent of systemic effects like pallor and anemia; emotional distress impacting perception and reporting. - Missing information: Objective physical examination findings, complete blood counts, coagulation profile, and specific quantification of bleeding volumes and impact on daily functioning.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
