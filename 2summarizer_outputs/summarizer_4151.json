Diarrhea occurs separately from flushing episodes, without other gastrointestinal symptoms. No recent medication changes, skin conditions, or surgeries are reported. These details will be added to the previous vignette to produce an updated, comprehensive profile.\n\nANSWER: The patient is a 65-year-old man who reports feeling weak and tired for several months. He has experienced unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds, nausea, and a persistent feeling of fullness. He reports episodes of facial flushing characterized by sudden onset of warmth and redness of the face that last a few minutes, sometimes with dizziness, sweating, and rapid heartbeat; these episodes happen unpredictably and without known triggers, and are not associated with chest pain, rashes, or allergies. He also has frequent diarrhea that occurs separately from these flushing episodes. He denies recent medication changes, skin conditions, allergies, surgeries, or other symptoms such as wheezing or abdominal cramps. Overall, he feels generally off."
