I\u2019m kind of scared about all of this.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any worsening skin changes, such as increased redness, thickening, or new skin dimpling, or any worsening of your nipple inversion or other features since you first observed these symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, it feels like it's kind of changing a little, like the redness is a bit more or something. The skin still looks the same, but I just keep feeling like it's getting more tight and heavy, and the nipple still seems a little more pulled in. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or if it\u2019s worse than before.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new or worsening skin changes, such as increased redness, thickening, or dimpling, or any new lumps or firmness in your breast since your symptoms began?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, it\u2019s gotten a bit worse, I think. The skin feels more tight and red in some parts, and I do notice it\u2019s a little more firm and heavier than before, like it\u2019s all swollen and sort of bumpy, but I can't really tell if it\u2019s more than before.",
