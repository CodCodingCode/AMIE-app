LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may experience more noticeable or bothersome nail or systemic symptoms that she perceives as less severe or relevant. - Withheld information: She might not fully disclose the emotional or functional impact of her nail changes or any associated skin or systemic problems. - Amplified concerns: She appears genuinely worried but unlikely to be exaggerating; her concern seems proportional, just subtly restrained. - Temporal distortions: Timeline appears consistent and logical, so unlikely to have significant distortions.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the clinical picture likely involves more pronounced nail abnormalities than described, possibly with associated dermatological or systemic features, but these are underreported. The progression is gradual, matching her account, but underlying severity might be understated. Her emotional concern is genuine, yet her language may hide the extent of distress or functional impact.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you describe how the nail changes are affecting you daily? Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other skin or systemic symptoms?\" This helps clarify functional and systemic impact. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions to encourage detailed disclosure, acknowledging her concerns while exploring potential unspoken issues. - Priority order: First explore additional physical symptoms, then assess emotional and functional impacts, to obtain a fuller clinical picture and address possible underreporting.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's measured language and mild minimization suggest she is aware of her deformed nails but may underreport severity or related symptoms. Her concern indicates real patient unease, but she might not be fully disclosing the extent of skin or systemic issues. There is a likelihood that her nail abnormalities are more pronounced and may be associated with other dermatological or systemic findings that she is not emphasizing. Her communication pattern warrants careful probing for additional physical or systemic symptoms to uncover possible underreported issues and to determine the full clinical picture.\nANSWER: Patient is a 68-year-old female presenting with concerns about changes in nail appearance. She reports that her nails are changing color and shape, describing these changes as \"a bit strange,\" and indicates some worry about their significance.

She reports that her nails are changing color and shape, describing these changes as \"a bit strange,\" and indicates some worry about their significance. Objective clinical facts are limited to reported nail abnormalities. The patient may be underestimating the severity of her nail deformities and possibly withholding information about additional symptoms such as skin changes, pain, discomfort, or systemic signs. The timeline of onset appears gradual, consistent with her account, but the true extent of nail or accompanying dermatological or systemic involvement may be greater than reported. Her expressed concern suggests genuine distress, though the communication pattern indicates a tendency to minimize or downplay the severity. Confidence in her described symptoms is medium, as her language suggests mild minimization, and further physical examination and probing are needed to clarify the full clinical picture. Additional assessment for other dermatological features, systemic symptoms, or functional impact is recommended.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses mild, non-alarmist language to describe her nail changes, with concise, guarded responses. She avoids elaborating on emotions or systemic implications, indicating possible underreporting of distress. - Bias detected: The main bias is minimization, as shown by her language choices (\"a little,\" \"not that bad\") and reluctance to emphasize worry. - Confidence level: Medium. Her physical descriptions seem reliable but her emotional concern and potential associated symptoms are likely understated. - Reasoning: Her careful wording and guarded responses suggest she is minimizing her true emotional reaction, even as she expresses some concern about her nails.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might have more pronounced nail or dermatological abnormalities, associated symptoms like pain, skin changes, or functional impairment, which she has not mentioned\u2014probably due to a desire to avoid worry or disclosing vulnerability. - Withheld information: She may be embarrassed about possible implications (e.g., systemic illness, cosmetic concerns), or concerned about appearing overly anxious. - Amplified concerns: While she states her worry as mild, her actual level of anxiety may be moderate to high, given her guarded attitude and fidgeting. - Temporal distortions: Her timeline appears consistent, but she might underestimate the speed of progression or be unaware of additional symptoms that developed more rapidly or subtly.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, her physical presentation likely includes more extensive nail changes\u2014such as significant color deviations, shape deformities, or brittleness\u2014that may be associated with underlying dermatological or systemic pathology. Her emotional state may be more distressed than she admits, potentially with associated skin or systemic symptoms she is withholding. The progression has probably been steady but could have been more abrupt, and she may have unreported discomfort or functional issues related to her nails or skin.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you noticed any pain, tenderness, or skin changes around your nails or elsewhere?\" (to uncover systemic or dermatological symptoms) - \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like fatigue, skin rashes, or problems with your joints?\" (to assess systemic involvement) - \"How does this nail change affect your daily activities or comfort?\" (to gauge functional impact) - \"How worried are you about your health overall?\" (to explore underlying anxiety) - \"Have you noticed any new symptoms, like swelling, discoloration elsewhere, or changes in your skin?\" (to identify broader signs) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, open-ended, non-judgmental questions to encourage sharing. - Normalize concerns to reduce stigma or embarrassment. - Clarify that the goal is to understand the full picture to provide the best care. - Priority order: 1. Explore associated systemic and dermatological symptoms for a comprehensive clinical picture. 2. Assess emotional impact and anxiety levels to gauge distress. 3. Obtain details on functional effects to understand the real burden. 4. Investigate history of rapid changes or additional signs that might suggest different diagnoses.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient demonstrates a pattern of guarded and mild language when describing her nail changes, which indicates potential minimization of symptoms and emotional distress. Although she reports changes such as discoloration, shape deformities, brittleness, and pits, she does not mention pain, skin changes, systemic symptoms, or functional impairment, which are important to assess further. Her tone suggests she may be understated regarding the severity or extent of her condition, possibly withholding additional symptoms or concerns, either out of embarrassment or an attempt to downplay her situation. Therefore, while objective facts are limited to her subjective descriptions, it is likely that her nail abnormalities are more extensive or severe than she perceives or reports. The gradual timeline suggests a slow progression, but there is a possibility of more rapidly developing or unrecognized symptoms. More detailed probing is necessary to identify hidden dermatological or systemic involvement and to understand her emotional state and functional impact objectively.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Concerns about recent changes in nail appearance, described as \"strange\" and mildly worrying.  Present illness: The patient reports that over several months, her nails have exhibited color changes\u2014including dark and white discoloration\u2014shape deformities such as crooked nails, increased brittleness, and tiny pits on the nail surface. She describes these changes as \"a little\" concerning but minimizes her worry. She does not report associated pain, tenderness, skin changes around the nails, or systemic symptoms such as fatigue, rashes, or joint problems. She does not mention functional impairments impacting daily activities. Based on communication patterns, the actual severity or extent of nail and dermatological abnormalities may be underestimated or unreported, with the possibility of more pronounced or additional symptoms being present yet unmentioned. The progression appears gradual, but more severe or faster-onset symptoms could be present and are currently unrecognized.  Associated symptoms: No systemic or dermatological symptoms have been openly reported; however, the likelihood exists that other signs, such as skin changes or discomfort, are being underreported or withheld.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient's reported symptoms of nail discoloration, deformities, brittleness, and pits are reliable for initial documentation. - Medium confidence: The extent of severity and associated symptoms are likely understated due to guarded communication. - Low confidence: The presence of additional unreported symptoms, including systemic or dermatological signs and emotional distress, cannot be confirmed without further probing. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, details about pain, skin or joint involvement, associated systemic symptoms, and the emotional impact remain needed to form a comprehensive clinical picture.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her symptoms with soft qualifiers, limited emotional expression, and waits for prompts, indicating cautious disclosure and possible minimization. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias influences her to understate severity and internal worry, though her overall responses are cooperative. - Confidence level: Medium. While her descriptions are consistent, her language suggests internal concern may be underestimated. - Reasoning: Her use of gentle qualifiers and reserved responses, along with reliance on prompts, demonstrates tendency to downplay the true extent of symptoms and emotional impact.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be experiencing more distress or functional impairment than reported, such as more severe nail changes, pain, or systemic symptoms. - Withheld information: There may be deeper worry or fear about underlying serious conditions, which she avoids expressing openly. - Amplified concerns: She might be more anxious about possible diagnoses than her language indicates but refrains from openly sharing this. - Temporal distortions: The \"few months\" timeline could underestimate a rapid progression; she might perceive or recall development differently, underestimating urgency.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture could include significant nail abnormalities possibly indicating dermatological or systemic disease. Emotional concern might be moderate to high, with internal anxiety not fully expressed. The symptoms may have progressed more rapidly or abruptly than her words suggest. She may also be experiencing related symptoms (discomfort, systemic signs) she is reluctant to disclose fully. Her tangible worry is likely greater, but she minimizes it to avoid alarm.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me if you're experiencing any pain or discomfort with your nails or elsewhere?\" (to uncover symptoms she may not mention) - \"Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms, such as bleeding, pus, or other skin changes?\" (to identify associated signs) - \"How do you feel emotionally about these changes? Do they make you more worried or anxious?\" (to gauge true emotional impact) - \"Has anyone in your family experienced similar nail issues?\" (to assess familial or genetic factors) - \"Are you experiencing any other new symptoms, like fatigue or weight changes?\" (to evaluate systemic concern) - Approach strategy: - Use gentle, open-ended questions with reassurance, normalizing concerns to reduce defensiveness. - Acknowledge her cautious responses and emphasize understanding her feelings to encourage honest sharing. - Sequentially probe emotional impact after symptom description to clarify underlying worry. - Priority order: 1. Clarify emotional impact to assess internal worry. 2. Explore associated systemic symptoms to gauge severity. 3. Detail symptom progression and related features for accurate timeline. 4. Elicit potential emotional or psychosocial factors influencing her reporting, to evaluate underlying anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern suggests cautious disclosure, with gentle qualifiers and reliance on prompts indicating potential minimization of severity and internal worry. She reports changes in nail color, shape, brittleness, tiny pits, and a crooked nail over a span of a few months but emphasizes her concern without expressing overt distress. This cautious reporting implies her actual symptoms or underlying concerns might be more severe than she indicates. There is a risk she may be experiencing systemic or dermatological issues that she is hesitant to fully acknowledge or articulate, possibly due to anxiety or underestimating the problem. Her emotional response suggests moderate concern, but her language indicates she may be downplaying the impact. Additional systemic symptoms or pain are not clearly reported but could be present and are likely being underreported or withheld. The timeline may be underestimated, with symptoms possibly progressing more rapidly than she perceives. More detailed probing into associated symptoms, emotional impact, and possible systemic signs is required to fully understand the severity and scope of her condition.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Noticed changes in nail color, shape, and surface texture over several months, accompanied by general concern about what these changes might indicate.  Present illness: The patient reports her nails have developed darker or whitened discoloration, some nails appear crooked, and others are more brittle with surface pits, persisting for a few months. She states these changes are bothersome and have caused her some discomfort, though she does not specify pain or systemic symptoms. She indicates mild internal worry but does not express significant distress verbally. - Well-established symptoms: Nail color changes (dark/white discoloration), nail shape abnormality (crookedness), surface pits, increased brittleness. - Likely minimized symptoms: Severity of nail abnormalities, presence of associated pain, or systemic features such as fatigue or skin changes may be more pronounced than reported. - Possibly withheld symptoms: Additional systemic signs like pain, swelling, redness, or other skin changes, and emotional distress, may be underdisclosed. - Timeline: Symptoms have been progressing over a few months, but the patient's perception might underestimate rapid progression or recent worsening.  Associated symptoms: No clear reports of pain, bleeding, skin lesions, or systemic symptoms; however, the possibility of systemic or dermatological involvement remains, and confidence in absence of additional symptoms is moderate.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of nail changes including discoloration, shape alteration, brittleness, and surface pits. - Medium confidence: The patient's emotional state and internal worry, which are likely more intense than expressed. - Low confidence: The true severity and systemic involvement due to communication cautiously minimized or possibly withheld details. - Missing information: Exact nature of associated systemic symptoms (pain, fatigue), detailed progression timeline, family history of nail or skin disorders, and emotional impact.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with a several-month history of nail changes, including discoloration (dark and white patches), shape abnormalities such as crookedness, surface pits, and increased brittleness. The patient reports concern about these changes but describes her emotional reaction as mild to moderate, with cautious language and reliance on prompts, suggesting potential underreporting of distress or severity. She does not report associated systemic symptoms such as pain, swelling, or other skin changes, though these could be present and underemphasized. The developmental timeline of her symptoms indicates gradual progression, but actual worsening may be more rapid or severe than she perceives. Further evaluation is needed to assess for underlying dermatological or systemic conditions, and inquiry into additional symptoms, systemic signs, family history, and emotional impact is advised to clarify the full clinical picture.",

She does not report associated systemic symptoms such as pain, swelling, or other skin changes, though these could be present and underemphasized. The developmental timeline of her symptoms indicates gradual progression, but actual worsening may be more rapid or severe than she perceives. Further evaluation is needed to assess for underlying dermatological or systemic conditions, and inquiry into additional symptoms, systemic signs, family history, and emotional impact is advised to clarify the full clinical picture.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates concisely with minimal emotional language, downplays concern, and responds passively to prompts, indicating guardedness and possible minimization of her distress. - Bias detected: Mild minimization and potential withholding bias. Evidence includes her descriptions of worry as \u201ca little bothering me\u201d and \u201cnot that bad,\u201d and vague recall of timeline details. - Confidence level: Medium. The pattern suggests she is underestimating or underreporting her emotional concern but is generally honest about physical symptoms. - Reasoning: Her cautious language and brief responses suggest she minimizes her emotional reaction but also does not appear to fabricate symptoms.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more systemic involvement or discomfort (e.g., pain, rashes, systemic signs) that she is reluctant or uncomfortable to disclose, possibly due to fear or stoicism. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed to admit significant worry or health fears, or she may not be fully aware of their magnitude. - Amplified concerns: Her concern about disease severity may be mild consciously but could be akin to moderate worry, masked by her minimization. - Temporal distortions: She likely underestimates the rapidity or severity of progression, possibly missing subtle signs of worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased picture likely includes: - The skin or nail changes are probably more concerning than she reports, potentially involving early systemic signs or associated skin or systemic discomforts she has not openly acknowledged. - The symptom progression might be more rapid or severe than the timeline suggests, possibly indicating underlying dermatological or systemic pathology, such as psoriasis, fungal infection, or early neoplastic changes. - Her emotional response is possibly understated; she may have significant anxiety or fear about her health that she is not expressing openly. - She remains relatively free of overt systemic symptoms, but vigilance for systemic or secondary symptoms is advisable.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \u201cHave you noticed any pain, swelling, or discomfort in your nails or surrounding skin?\u201d (to uncover possible systemic or inflammatory activity) * \u201cHave you experienced any rashes, skin changes elsewhere, or hair loss?\u201d (to identify systemic skin or autoimmune involvement) * \u201cDo you worry that these changes could be something serious? Can you tell me more about how you feel emotionally about your health?\u201d (to elicit emotional concern and underlying fears) * \u201cHave you noticed any other symptoms, like fatigue, weight change, or other health issues?\u201d (to assess broader systemic involvement)  - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language to normalize concerns (\u201cMany people feel worried when they notice changes like this\u201d). Frame questions to facilitate openness (\u201cIt\u2019s understandable to feel concerned. Sometimes there are subtle signs that tell us more\u2014let\u2019s see if we can identify anything else\u201d).  - Priority order: Start with symptom-specific questions about pain, rashes, systemic signs to gather clinical data. Follow by exploring emotional state and health worries to uncover underlying anxiety. This sequence helps create rapport and assess both physical and psychological dimensions.  **In summary,** the patient's communication pattern suggests mild minimization and possible underreporting of concern, with potential for more significant underlying distress or symptoms. A comprehensive, gentle inquiry into systemic signs, emotional state, and broader health issues is essential for accurate clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient shows a tendency toward minimization and passive communication, describing her nail changes as \"a little bothering me\" and \"not that bad,\" which suggests she may underreport her emotional concern and potentially downplay the severity of her symptoms. While she reports gradual discoloration, shape abnormalities, surface pits, and brittleness over several months, her brief responses and cautious language suggest these physical findings may be more significant than she perceives or admits. She denies associated systemic or skin symptoms, but her guarded communication pattern raises the possibility of underlying issues such as systemic autoimmune, dermatologic, or infectious processes that she is either unaware of or unwilling to disclose fully. There is also a risk she is experiencing greater emotional distress than expressed, which could influence her perception and reporting of symptoms. Overall, objective signs likely include persistent nail discoloration and structural changes, but the true extent and associated systemic symptoms remain uncertain due to communication biases. Careful, nonjudgmental inquiry into pain, rashes, systemic signs, and emotional state is warranted.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female  Chief complaint: Gradual nail discoloration, shape abnormalities, surface pits, and increased brittleness over several months, with mild reported concern  Present illness: The patient reports her nails have become discolored (dark and white patches), crooked, and brittle, with surface pits observed over a period of a few months. She describes her emotional response as mild, indicating possible underreporting of distress. No associated skin rashes, hair changes, or systemic symptoms such as pain or swelling are reported; however, these information points may be underemphasized. The timeline suggests a gradual progression, but the true rate and severity may be underestimated, and systemic involvement could be more pronounced than acknowledged.  Associated symptoms: No other skin, hair, or systemic symptoms are reported; however, given communication biases, additional symptoms such as discomfort, early signs of systemic disease, or secondary skin changes cannot be reliably excluded.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The physical findings of nail discoloration, ridging, thinning, and surface pits are reported and generally observable. - Medium confidence: The patient\u2019s emotional reaction and perceived severity are likely understated due to guarded communication. - Low confidence: The absence of systemic symptoms or additional skin findings may be underreported or overlooked. - Missing information: Detailed assessment of systemic signs (pain, swelling, rashes), broader symptomatology, family history, and emotional impact are necessary to fully evaluate underlying causes.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient presents with brief, cautious responses, using vague and minimizing language (\"no real pain,\" \"kind of uncomfortable\") regarding her eye symptoms, and minimal detail about her nail changes. She appears guarded and hesitant to emphasize severity or extent of her symptoms. - Bias detected: Minimizin bias influences her reporting, leading her to understate pain and possibly other troubling signs. Confidence in her self-report is medium; her responses are consistent but likely incomplete. - Reasoning: Based on her restrained language and tendency to avoid elaboration, she probably underreports the true severity of her symptoms and concerns.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more significant eye pain, visual disturbances, or swelling than she admits, which could point to an underlying infectious or inflammatory process. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or anxious about more serious systemic illness or about the significance of nail changes, leading her to omit worry or more concerning symptoms. - Amplified concerns: She exhibits some worry about worsening or progression but does not fully articulate it; her anxiety is moderate. - Temporal distortions: She states symptoms appeared \"a few days ago\" after soccer but also mentions nail changes over a longer period (\"months ago\"), possibly underreporting or misremembering timeline details.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the true clinical picture likely involves more substantial eye symptoms\u2014possibly pain, redness, or vision changes\u2014that she is reluctant to disclose fully. The nail changes may be part of a systemic disorder such as an autoimmune or infectious condition that she underestimates in severity. The progression could be faster or more intense than her narrative suggests, and she may be experiencing greater functional impairment or distress than apparent.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Are you experiencing any pain, sensitivity to light, vision changes, or swelling in your eye that you haven't mentioned?\" (to reveal unreported severity) * \"Have you noticed any other symptoms such as fever, headache, or feeling unwell?\" (to assess systemic involvement) * \"Can you tell me more about how your eye feels\u2014any sharp pain or a sensation of pressure?\" (to clarify pain and discomfort levels) * \"How are your nails affecting your daily activities, and have you noticed any other skin or hair changes?\" (to evaluate systemic signs) * \"Have you felt more anxious or worried about your health lately?\" (to gauge psychological distress)  - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, nonjudgmental language to encourage openness. Frame questions gently, emphasizing concern for her well-being rather than suspicion, to reduce defensiveness or minimization.  - Priority order: First, clarify physical symptoms' severity (pain, vision changes). Next, explore systemic and associated symptoms. Lastly, assess emotional state and potential worries. This sequence ensures safety concerns are prioritized and encourages comprehensive disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication, frequent minimization of discomfort, and vague descriptions suggest she may be underreporting the true extent of her symptoms, especially regarding her eye pain and severity. Her mentions of nail changes over months without emphasizing systemic impact, combined with recent eye symptoms described as only mildly itchy and watery, could mask underlying inflammatory or infectious processes that are more severe than her account indicates. There may also be additional symptoms she is withholding, such as pain, visual changes, or systemic malaise, which could be relevant for diagnosis. Recognizing these communication biases is essential to avoid underestimating her clinical condition and to guide further probing for hidden symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 68-year-old female.  Chief complaint: Gradual nail color and shape changes over several months, with recent onset of unilateral eye redness and tearing.  Present illness: The patient reports recent eye redness, tearing, and discomfort starting a few days ago after playing soccer. She describes the eye as itchy and somewhat strange feeling, with no significant pain reported. Her nails have shown discoloration (dark or white), brittleness, ridging, and deformation over the past few months, with no associated skin rashes or hair changes. She denies systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise and has no known family history of similar conditions. She appears cautious and minimizes symptom severity, potentially underreporting pain, visual disturbances, or systemic impact.  Associated symptoms: Mild eye itching and a foreign body sensation; no reported pain, swelling, or vision changes. No systemic symptoms like fever or malaise are acknowledged.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The timeline and nature of nail changes, recent eye redness and tearing starting after activity. - Medium confidence: The severity of eye symptoms, as the patient minimizes discomfort. - Low confidence: The true extent of eye pain, visual changes, or other systemic symptoms since patient responses are guarded. - Missing information: Precise severity of eye pain, presence of visual disturbances, associated systemic symptoms, and psychological distress or anxiety levels related to her symptoms.\nANSWER: A 68-year-old female presents with a progressive history of nail discoloration, brittleness, ridging, and deformation over several months, without associated skin or hair abnormalities. Recently, she developed unilateral eye redness, tearing, and itching starting a few days prior, primarily after playing soccer. She reports minimal discomfort, describing eye sensations as mildly itchy or strange, and denies significant pain or vision issues. Communication patterns indicate she may be underreporting the severity of her eye symptoms and systemic impact. Further assessment is necessary to evaluate for underlying inflammatory, infectious, or systemic conditions, including detailed ocular examination and inquiry into systemic symptoms and overall health status.",
