I feel weak and kind of all over the place, and I\\u2019m worried I might get dehydrated or something.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with emotional intensity, emphasizing severity of her diarrhea and dehydration concerns, employing vivid language to stress her distress. She responds openly and elaborately, showing concern but no apparent withholding or minimization. - Bias detected: Amplification bias driven by anxiety, causing her to overstate symptom severity and worry. - Confidence level: high, as her language consistently suggests emotional amplification without signs of withholding or confusion. - Reasoning: Her emotionally charged descriptors and detailed focus on dehydration indicate her concern influences her perception, leading to possible overestimation of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild fatigue, early decompensation signs (lightheadedness, dizziness), or slight appetite loss might be understated, since her focus is solely on diarrhea severity. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to mention minor symptoms that she perceives as inconsequential or embarrassing, such as nausea or weakness, especially if she believes not directly relevant. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about dehydration and illness may be exaggerated emotionally; her concern could be influenced by anxiety rather than actual clinical danger. - Temporal distortions: While her timeline seems consistent, her emotional response might distort her perception of duration or severity.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, her actual clinical presentation likely includes severe diarrhea with dehydration signs, but perhaps mild to moderate in clinical intensity rather than as catastrophic as described. She probably has early dehydration signs like dizziness or dry mouth that she has not explicitly mentioned. Her symptoms may have developed rapidly, but her emotional amplification inflates her perception of threat. Her underlying anxiety influences her reporting, emphasizing severity while possibly underreporting minor but relevant symptoms.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Are you experiencing any dizziness or lightheadedness when standing?\" \"Have you noticed any dry mouth or decreased urination?\" \"Is your fatigue mild or more pronounced?\" These focus on dehydration signs and subtle symptoms often overlooked when anxious. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, reassuring language, emphasizing concern for her well-being. Frame questions to normalize mild symptoms and encourage honest disclosure. \"Many people experience some mild fatigue\u2014can you tell me how tired you feel compared to usual?\" - Priority order: Start with hydration and physical symptoms to assess objective severity, then explore the progression and associated symptoms, ensuring her worries are acknowledged but contextualized. This way, she feels heard and less anxious to overstate her condition.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication demonstrates emotional intensity and vivid descriptions, suggesting her perception of symptom severity may be exaggerated due to anxiety. She emphasizes watery diarrhea and dehydration concerns, but may be underreporting or not fully recognizing milder associated symptoms such as mild fatigue, dizziness, or dry mouth. Her focus on the severity indicates a likelihood of amplification bias, potentially inflating her concern about dehydration. More subtle or early signs of dehydration might be overlooked by her; therefore, objective assessment is necessary to verify her reported severity and uncover additional symptoms she might not have mentioned or minimized.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: unspecified age and gender.  Chief complaint: Severe watery diarrhea with concern for dehydration.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing watery diarrhea for multiple days, describing it as \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cso bad I just can't stop going.\u201d She expresses concern about dehydration and feeling weak or all over the place. Objective clinical facts suggest the diarrhea is active and persistent. Likely, the severity of diarrhea is high based on her report, but actual clinical severity may be moderate given her tendency to emotionally amplify symptoms. She may be experiencing early signs of dehydration such as dizziness, dry mouth, or decreased urination, though these have not been explicitly reported. There may be additional symptoms such as mild fatigue or lightheadedness that she is not explicitly acknowledging or may be minimizing. The timeline appears consistent, but her emotional response may distort her perception of symptom progression and severity.  Associated symptoms: Possible early dehydration signs such as dizziness or dry mouth are suspected but unreported; these need to be actively assessed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s report of watery diarrhea lasting days and concern about dehydration. - Medium confidence: The actual severity of diarrhea and dehydration signs, which may be less advanced than perceived. - Low confidence: The extent of associated symptoms like fatigue or other dehydration signs, due to possible underreporting or minimization. - Missing information: Physical examination findings, hydration status, vital signs, and specific assessment of dehydration markers are needed to confirm clinical severity.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally intense language to describe her diarrhea and weakness, focusing on severity and distress. She responds reactively, sharing symptoms when prompted but avoids proactive elaboration on potential causes, associated symptoms, or exposure details. Her language indicates vulnerability but also a tendency to amplify her distress. - Bias detected: Amplification bias, influenced by her emotional distress, leading her to overstate the severity of her symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium to high for the bias detection regarding symptom severity; moderate confidence in the completeness of her exposure and associated symptom reporting. - Reasoning: Her use of emotionally charged words and focus on severity confirm amplification bias; her reluctance to specify details suggests some withholding, but overall her symptom descriptions are credible yet possibly exaggerated in perceived impact.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting related issues such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in urination, which could inform dehydration status. - Withheld information: She might be hesitant to disclose potential exposure sources, recent travel, food consumption, or contact with sick individuals, due to discomfort or concern about judgment. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about dehydration or disease may be overblown relative to actual clinical risk, influenced by anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The vague \"for days\" timeline may mask fluctuations or severity peaks, but no major timeline distortions identified.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the likely accurate picture is that she has had significant, possibly severe episodes of watery diarrhea over the past few days, with accompanying weakness and dehydration risk. She might be experiencing additional symptoms such as fever or abdominal discomfort that she has not reported. Her anxiety-driven amplification suggests her perceived severity may be slightly inflated. She could be withholding potential exposure or related symptoms, which are important for diagnosis and management. Her overall presentation warrants clinical caution with detailed probing to uncover omitted details and assess dehydration objectively.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how many times you've been to the bathroom each day and how many episodes you've had?\" - \"Have you noticed any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting?\" - \"What have you been drinking and eating? Have there been any recent changes?\" - \"Did you have any contact with anyone sick or recent travel or food that might have caused this?\" - Approach strategy: - Ask in a calm, nonjudgmental manner to reduce anxiety-related withholding. - Use open-ended questions initially, then gently probe for specifics. - Normalize concerns to lessen embarrassment or fear of judgment. - Priority order: - First, quantify the diarrhea episodes and hydration status. - Then, explore associated symptoms that impact dehydration and illness severity. - Follow with exposure/history questions to identify potential infectious sources. - Always monitor emotional cues to assess anxiety levels that may influence reporting accuracy.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes experiencing watery diarrhea for several days, emphasizing severity and associated weakness, with emotional language suggesting distress. However, her reactive responses and focus on severity may inflate her perception of symptom impact, indicating amplification bias. She avoids providing details on other symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in urination, which may be minimized or withheld due to discomfort or concern about judgment. Her report does not specify potential exposure sources or specific timelines within the \"several days\" period, which could affect assessment of dehydration risk and infection etiology. Overall, objective clinical facts include diarrhea and weakness; however, there may be additional symptoms (fever, nausea, abdominal pain) that she has not reported. The communication pattern suggests possible underreporting of certain symptoms and overstatement of severity, requiring targeted questioning to uncover a more complete clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: not specified; presumed adult presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms.  Chief complaint: Severe watery diarrhea persisting for multiple days, with related weakness.  Present illness: The patient reports a several-day history of watery diarrhea with significant impact on daily function and feelings of weakness. Objective assessment may reveal dehydration signs such as dry mucous membranes, orthostatic hypotension, or tachycardia, though these have not been assessed yet. She likely has additional gastrointestinal symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting that she has not disclosed, possibly due to emotional distress or discomfort in reporting. She may have experienced fluctuations in symptom severity within the reported timeframe.  Associated symptoms: Potentially fever, abdominal discomfort, nausea, or vomiting, although these are not confirmed and could be underreported. No information is available regarding recent food intake, exposure history, or travel.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports diarrhea and weakness over several days. - Medium confidence: The actual severity of symptoms (such as dehydration status) and associated symptoms like fever or abdominal pain may be underestimated due to communication bias. - Low confidence: Details about possible exposure, exact number of diarrhea episodes per day, and additional symptoms are incomplete and likely affected by withholding or minimization. - Missing information: Need to evaluate clinical signs of dehydration, obtain detailed history about symptom pattern, associated symptoms, dietary changes, recent exposures, and onset timeline to guide management.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her eye symptoms with emotional emphasis and some hesitancy about dates and severity. She elaborates on discomfort but shows uncertainty in timing (\"started yesterday, I think\"), indicating possible mild confusion or guardedness. Her language is emotionally charged but generally honest, with no overt minimization, yet the vague timeline hints at some underreporting or recall bias. - Bias detected: The main bias is mild emotional amplification with some mild minimization regarding the precise timeline. Her distress heightens perceived severity, and uncertainty about onset may obscure the actual progression. - Confidence level: Medium - plausible but with some ambiguity regarding the exact timing and extent of symptoms. - Reasoning: The pattern of emotional language coupled with vague timeline references suggests she is experiencing genuine distress but may not be fully precise about the symptom onset, possibly leading to under- or overestimation of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be downplaying the true extent of inflammation, discomfort, or vision disturbance, especially if she perceives the injury as minor or fears overreacting. - Withheld information: She may be hesitant to admit any eye trauma or exposure to potential infectious sources, or may omit details about associated pain or visual changes she perceives as insignificant. - Amplified concerns: Her exaggerated focus on discomfort and worry about worsening or dehydration indicates her fears may be emotionally magnified beyond the true clinical urgency. - Temporal distortions: The symptom onset might have occurred earlier than reported (\"started yesterday,\" but possibly earlier), and she might be uncertain about the duration of symptoms, affecting assessment of acuity and progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should include: An acute onset of eye redness, swelling, and tearing occurring approximately 24-48 hours ago, likely following minor ocular trauma during soccer. Symptoms are probably more extensive and painful than reported, with potential associated issues like light sensitivity or blurred vision. The initial timing may be slightly earlier, with the current severity likely underestimated due to emotional distress and hesitance. There might be some mild confusion about the duration, and associated symptoms such as pain or discharge might be more prominent. Emotional concern suggests real discomfort but perhaps also heightened worry that influences reporting.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you describe exactly when you first noticed your eye redness and swelling\u2014was it yesterday, or perhaps earlier?\" (to clarify timing) - \"Are you experiencing any pain, sensitivity to light, or changes in your vision?\" (to identify additional symptoms) - \"How much tearing or discharge have you noticed? Is it constant?\" (to understand severity) - \"Did you experience any injury or trauma to your eye during playing soccer? If so, can you tell me about it?\" (to assess possible cause) - \"Have you noticed any other symptoms like blurred vision or headaches?\" (to uncover related issues) - Approach strategy: Use open-ended, nonjudgmental questions to encourage detailed description, validate her distress to build trust, and gently probe for specifics with clarifying questions. Emphasize that all symptoms are important regardless of perceived severity. - Priority order: Start with clarifying the timeline and associated symptoms to establish the clinical acuity, then explore injury specifics and subjective discomfort levels, to guide appropriate diagnosis and management.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports watery diarrhea and weakness, expressing concern about dehydration but emphasizes their distress and impact on daily life. Patient comments indicate emotional distress, which may amplify their perception of severity, but they do not appear to minimize symptoms overtly. The reporting pattern suggests they might not be fully precise about symptom duration or severity, possibly overestimating their discomfort to elicit concern. Because they focus on the day-to-day impact and expressed fears, objective facts include the presence of diarrhea and associated weakness. However, the exact onset and severity could be greater than conveyed, as somatic symptoms often have an emotional component influencing reporting. Additional objective assessment and history are required to determine dehydration severity, any associated symptoms such as nausea or fever, and lab investigations to confirm etiology.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult patient presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. Chief complaint: Watery diarrhea for multiple days with concern about dehydration. Present illness: Patient reports experiencing watery diarrhea that has persisted for several days, accompanied by feelings of weakness and fatigue. The patient describes the diarrhea as severe and ongoing, impacting daily activities, and expresses worry about potential dehydration. The patient indicates uncertainties about the duration, suggesting possible slight recall bias, but acknowledges the symptoms started several days ago. Objective severity may be underestimated due to emotional distress and concern. No specific mention of associated symptoms such as fever, nausea, or abdominal pain is provided, but these need assessment. Associated symptoms: Not explicitly reported; further inquiry needed regarding nausea, fever, abdominal pain, or other systemic symptoms. Tearing, eye redness, or trauma are not part of this presentation. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient has diarrhea lasting several days with associated weakness. - Medium confidence: The severity and exact duration of diarrhea and dehydration risk may be overestimated or uncertain due to emotional distress. - Low confidence: The precise cause of diarrhea, presence of associated symptoms, and hydration status are uncertain without further evaluation. - Missing information: Laboratory results, hydration assessment, symptom progression, presence of fever or nausea, detailed history of possible exposure or illness.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with a several-day history of watery diarrhea accompanied by weakness and fatigue. The patient reports significant impact on daily activities and expresses concern about dehydration. Objective findings at this stage are limited to reported symptoms; physical examination and diagnostic testing are needed to assess hydration status, identify potential infectious etiology, and evaluate for any additional systemic symptoms.

The patient's emotional distress may influence the perception of severity, but the persistence and nature of diarrhea warrant further investigation to determine appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides vague timing (\"a little after the weekend,\" \"maybe Saturday\") and downplays initial severity with qualifiers (\"not that bad,\" \"maybe\"). They express significant distress emotionally but hesitate when recalling details, suggesting discomfort or uncertainty. Their responses are cautious, providing just enough information unless prompted, which indicates some withholding and possible minimization. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias, particularly regarding the onset and initial severity of symptoms. Slight hesitations and vague timelines point to underreporting of early mild symptoms or confusion about exact dates. - Confidence level: Medium, as the pattern indicates intentional or unconscious minimization and recall issues, but overall information is not entirely unreliable. - Reasoning: The mixture of hedging language and emotional distress suggests the patient is experiencing real concerns but may be underestimating or not fully recalling earlier or milder symptoms, possibly due to stress or discomfort discussing sensitive details.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Early, mild diarrhea, or subtle dehydration signs such as dizziness or dry mouth that the patient perceives as unimportant or irrelevant, leading to underreporting. - Withheld information: Additional systemic symptoms like low-grade fever, blood in stool, or mild abdominal discomfort that might be embarrassing or seem insignificant; the patient might avoid elaborating to maintain privacy or due to uncertainty. - Amplified concerns: The current severity and distress may be exaggerated emotionally, possibly driven by fear or anxiety, leading to overemphasis on weakness and fear of worsening. - Temporal distortions: The actual onset may be earlier than described; the progression likely started subtly and gradually, but the patient recalls vaguely and with uncertainty, possibly underestimating the duration.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture probably involves an initial gradual onset of watery diarrhea starting approximately 2-3 days before presentation, beginning with mild symptoms that the patient dismissed or did not note, and progressing to more severe diarrhea and systemic symptoms like weakness and possible dehydration. The progression may have been insidious, with early signs underrecognized. The patient\u2019s current emotional distress reflects a genuine concern but may amplify perceived severity, whereas actual early symptoms could have been milder and less alarming than indicated.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the diarrhea, even if it was mild?\" (to clarify timing) - \"Did you notice any early signs of dehydration, like dizziness or on-standing weakness?\" (to detect obscured symptoms) - \"Have you experienced any blood in your stool, or noticed any other unusual changes?\" (to uncover potential omitted symptoms) - \"How much weight have you lost, and over what period?\" (to assess true severity) - \"Have you had any fever earlier, or chills?\" (to clarify systemic signs) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions emphasizing confidentiality and reassurance to reduce shame or embarrassment. Affirm the normalcy of early mild symptoms to encourage full disclosure. - Priority order: First verify the true duration and onset of symptoms; then explore associated systemic signs (dehydration, fever, blood); finally, assess actual weight change and other subtle symptoms\u2014this approach prioritizes establishing an accurate timeline and symptom severity for targeted management.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports multiple systemic symptoms associated with diarrhea, including weakness, fatigue, and concern about dehydration, with a subjective timeline that suggests the diarrhea began a few days prior, around the weekend, with initial mild symptoms potentially occurring earlier. The communication pattern shows hesitations, vague timing, and qualifiers that indicate possible minimization of early or mild symptoms and some withholding of details about systemic signs like early dehydration, fever, or blood in stool. The emotional distress described may amplify perceived severity, but objective symptoms like ongoing diarrhea, weakness, and recent weight loss are likely accurate. Because the patient may be underreporting minor early symptoms and possibly exaggerating current symptoms, the true onset of diarrhea might have been earlier and milder than the patient admits. Additional systemic signs, such as weight loss, dehydration, or blood in stool, are not confirmed but should be explored further, given communication biases.

Objective clinical facts include ongoing diarrhea, recent weight loss, and systemic symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. The patient indicates the diarrhea started around the weekend, with initial mild symptoms possibly beginning earlier, but exact timing is uncertain due to vague recall. The patient reports associated symptoms of fever and stomach pain, though specifics about early dehydration signs, blood in stool, or additional systemic symptoms are not confirmed. Given communication patterns, early mild diarrhea and subtle dehydration signs may have been underreported, and current symptom severity might be amplified by emotional distress. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the initial onset, early systemic signs, and any additional symptoms like blood in stool or subtle dehydration markers, to guide appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, minimization language and responds hesitantly. She avoids directly stating the severity of her dehydration and provides only partial details about her timeline and symptoms. - Bias detected: Symptom minimization bias affects her reporting, likely to avoid worry or shame. She may also have some recall bias regarding onset. - Confidence level: Medium, as her responses are somewhat cautious but contain key symptoms. - Reasoning: The selective language and vague recall suggest she is downplaying her dehydration severity but also hesitant to fully admit her systemic compromise, which may lead to underestimation of urgency.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more significant dehydration signs, such as marked dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, or decreased urination, which she is reluctant to fully acknowledge. - Withheld information: Possibly feeling embarrassed about her weakness or concern about appearing overly sick, we might be missing details about her actual physical status. - Amplified concerns: Her anxiety about catching something is prominent, but her focus may distract from recognizing the severity of dehydration. - Temporal distortions: She might not recall the earliest mild symptoms accurately, underestimating how long she\u2019s been symptomatic and how quickly deterioration occurred.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: A patient with a several-day history of worsening watery diarrhea, likely starting around the weekend, with initial mild symptoms potentially unnoticed or understated. She exhibits objective signs of significant dehydration\u2014dry mouth, dizziness, general weakness, possibly decreased urination\u2014that she's downplaying. Systemic signs such as weight loss and fever suggest an ongoing infectious process, and the progression may have been more rapid than her recall indicates. The early mild symptoms may have been more insidious, with her focus on discomfort and worry overshadowing the severity of dehydration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed if you are passing less urine than usual?\" and \"Do you feel lightheaded or faint when standing?\" to assess dehydration objectively. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, validating language emphasizing the importance of honesty for effective treatment, e.g., \"It's common to feel worse with dehydration, and sharing all symptoms helps us get you better faster.\" - Priority order: Start with targeted questions about urination and symptoms of dehydration, then explore for any signs of systemic illness or additional symptoms like weakness or pallor. This helps to clarify the physical status accurately.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient employs vague and minimization language when describing her symptoms, which suggests she may underreport the severity of her dehydration and systemic illness. She hesitates and provides uncertain recall regarding the onset and progression, indicating possible recall bias or emotional discomfort. She reports frequent diarrhea, weight loss, fever, and stomach pain, but minimizes dehydration signs like dizziness and dry mouth, which she acknowledges but may not fully appreciate. Based on communication cues, her dehydration might be more significant than she admits, and early mild symptoms could have been overlooked or understated. Therefore, objective findings might include more severe dehydration and systemic decompensation than explicitly acknowledged, necessitating careful probing to confirm the physical status. More detailed inquiry is needed into urine output, orthostatic symptoms, and other systemic signs to accurately assess her hydration status and illness severity.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female patient. Chief complaint: Several-day history of worsening watery diarrhea, with an impression that symptoms might be more severe than reported. Present illness: The patient reports ongoing watery diarrhea that started around the weekend, with progressive worsening over several days. She admits to weight loss, fever, and abdominal pain, but describes her dehydration symptoms\u2014dizziness and dry mouth\u2014as less severe or may understate their true extent. Her timeline suggests initial mild symptoms possibly overlooked or minimized, with significant deterioration likely occurring within the past few days. Communication patterns indicate she may be downplaying the degree of dehydration and systemic illness, which could be more severe objectively than indicated. Associated symptoms: Fever, abdominal cramping, weight loss, dizziness, dry mouth; confidence in reporting dehydration signs is medium, as she minimizes these symptoms during discussion. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: She has had diarrhea for several days, with associated weight loss, fever, and abdominal pain. - Medium confidence: She reports dehydration signs like dizziness and dry mouth but may be underestimating their severity. - Low confidence: Exact severity of dehydration, initial symptom onset, and the true extent of systemic involvement are uncertain due to communication biases. - Missing information: Detailed assessment of urine output, orthostatic blood pressure, and other hydration markers needed to evaluate dehydration objectively.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with a several-day history of worsening watery diarrhea that began around the weekend, with reports of associated weight loss, fever, and abdominal pain. She describes feeling weak and has noticed symptoms such as dizziness and dry mouth, but appears to understate the severity of dehydration signs, which may be more significant than her reported symptoms suggest. The timeline suggests initial mild symptoms that may have been overlooked or minimized, with recent deterioration likely involving more systemic compromise. Her communication indicates possible bias towards symptom minimization, emphasizing the need for targeted assessment of hydration status, including inquiry about urination, orthostatic symptoms, and other objective dehydration markers.",
