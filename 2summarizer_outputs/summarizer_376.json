She reports that her menstrual cycle is somewhat irregular, with variable bleeding intensity, and she feels more tired and bloated around her period. She also notices increased vaginal discharge and pressure or frequent urination, which may be related to the lump or pelvic sensation. She reports her symptoms have been ongoing for about six months, affecting her daily activities and causing anxiety."
