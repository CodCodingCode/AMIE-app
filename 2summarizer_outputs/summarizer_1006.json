I\\u2019ve noticed I\\u2019ve lost about 10 pounds over the last month without changing anything I eat. I keep waking up soaked in sweat during the night, and sometimes I get these low-grade fevers that come and go. I also have this dull ache in my arms and legs, kind of in the bones, and it\\u2019s there most of the time. I guess I just wanted to get checked out because I\\u2019m worried it might be something serious.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs modest, cautious language, providing detailed symptom descriptions but qualifiers that suggest downplaying severity. Responses are organized and cooperative but tend to withhold or minimize background information unless specifically asked. - Bias detected: Primarily minimization bias, as reflected in cautious descriptors (\"low-grade,\" \"most of the time,\" \"dull ache,\" \"really exhausted\") indicating a desire to present symptoms as less severe than they might be. No evidence of exaggeration or active withholding beyond treatment of symptom presentation. - Confidence level: Medium. The communication indicates genuine concern but a tendency to understate symptom severity and relevant background details. - Reasoning: The language qualifiers and structured responses suggest genuine reporting with an intent to avoid sounding alarmist, thus likely modestly underestimating symptom severity and not fully disclosing all relevant contextual information.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More intense fatigue, severe bone or joint pain, or systemic symptoms like profound night sweats or bleeding episodes that he might perceive as too serious or upsetting to emphasize. - Withheld information: Additional environmental exposures, details about other family members with hematologic or cancer diagnoses, or minor symptoms he considers unimportant but are clinically relevant. - Amplified concerns: The degree of concern about a serious illness appears genuine, but his cautious language may mask the true urgency or severity of the symptoms. - Temporal distortions: Likely accurate in timeline reporting but possibly understated in severity; no obvious sequence problems but potential underreporting of symptom intensity in earlier stages.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture probably includes significant fatigue, unintentional weight loss, persistent or more intense night sweats, and systemic symptoms suggestive of a serious underlying condition such as hematologic malignancy or infection. Symptoms are likely more intense or systemic than explicitly communicated. Some relevant background details\u2014such as environmental exposures or additional family health issues\u2014may be underreported, further clarifying risk factors for systemic disease.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me more about how tired you feel? Is it worse than just feeling 'exhausted'?\" * \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like weakness, dizziness, or bleeding?\" * \"How often do you wake up sweating heavily, and how does that affect your sleep?\" * \"Have you noticed any other changes, such as swollen glands or unusual bruising?\" * \"Can you think of any recent exposures to chemicals or toxins, or any additional family health issues?\" - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-judgmental, open-ended questions to encourage full disclosure, emphasizing understanding rather than suspicion. For example, \"Many people underestimate their symptoms; can you help me understand how these are affecting you daily?\" This approach reduces defensiveness. - Priority order: 1. Quantify and qualify severity of fatigue, pain, and systemic symptoms. 2. Explore associated symptoms like bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other systemic features. 3. Investigate environmental and family history in detail. 4. Clarify any recent health changes or exposures. This sequence targets the most critical unknowns, ensuring that symptom severity and risk factors are thoroughly assessed to guide further diagnostics.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient uses cautious, modest language, with descriptors like \"really exhausted,\" \"low-grade fevers,\" and \"dull ache,\" suggesting that the severity of symptoms may be underreported. There is a tendency to minimize or qualify symptoms, which indicates that the actual symptom burden could be more severe, including more intense fatigue, systemic symptoms, or additional features such as bleeding or lymphadenopathy that the patient is hesitant to emphasize. The patient\u2019s concern appears genuine, but communication bias likely masks the full clinical picture. Some relevant background information, such as environmental exposures or family history, may also be underdisclosed. Therefore, the objective clinical picture should be considered more serious than the reported symptoms imply, warranting thorough follow-up questioning to uncover the full extent of systemic involvement.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult, gender unspecified.  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue with unintentional weight loss and systemic symptoms possibly indicative of a serious underlying condition.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue described as \"really exhausted\" despite adequate sleep, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over one month, night sweats that wake him in the night, and intermittent low-grade fevers. The patient also notes a dull aching sensation in both arms and legs, most of the time, which he attributes to bone pain but downplays in severity.  Associated symptoms: The patient does not explicitly mention bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other systemic symptoms; however, given the context, these should be investigated further as they are potentially underreported. There may be additional symptoms such as pronounced night sweats, possible weakness, or lymph node enlargement that are not explicitly disclosed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s reported symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fevers, and limb aching. - Medium confidence: The severity and systemic impact of these symptoms may be underestimated due to cautious reporting. - Low confidence: The full extent of associated systemic or hematologic symptoms, environmental exposures, and family history remains unclear due to possible withholding or minimization. - Missing information: Detailed symptom history, including severity and frequency of night sweats and fevers; additional systemic or lymphatic symptoms; environmental, occupational, or familial risk factors.\nANSWER: An adult patient presents with persistent fatigue, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over one month, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and a dull aching in the limbs. While the patient's description suggests moderate symptoms, communication biases imply that the actual severity of systemic illness could be greater, possibly indicating underlying hematologic or infectious pathology. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate for additional symptoms such as bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other constitutional features, as well as environmental and family history to improve diagnostic clarity.",

While the patient's description suggests moderate symptoms, communication biases imply that the actual severity of systemic illness could be greater, possibly indicating underlying hematologic or infectious pathology. Further detailed assessment is necessary to evaluate for additional symptoms such as bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other constitutional features, as well as environmental and family history to improve diagnostic clarity.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes significant constitutional symptoms but employs soft, hesitant language (\"kind of,\" \"I guess,\" \"a little\"), suggesting an attempt to minimize their reported severity. Responses are somewhat organized but guarded, indicating cautious sharing. - Bias detected: Minimizaton bias is predominant, as evidenced by cautious language and reluctance to fully emphasize symptom severity. Their tone suggests they may be downplaying how ill they feel, possibly to avoid alarm or due to modesty. - Confidence level: Medium. The core symptoms are clearly acknowledged, but the modifiers indicate their perceived severity may be underestimated. - Reasoning: The language clues and pattern of hesitance point towards an underreporting bias, even though the factual content is largely accurate.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Actual fatigue and systemic impact may be more profound; they might be experiencing worse exhaustion or more frequent fevers than they disclose. - Withheld information: They may be embarrassed about or unsure how to report issues such as bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or more severe weight loss. - Amplified concerns: They do not seem to overstate their worries, but their cautious language suggests they may be trying not to alarm either themselves or the clinician. - Temporal distortions: The timeline \"getting worse over last couple of months\" may disguise rapid deterioration or episodic severity spikes that they are reluctant to specify.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves significant systemic symptoms\u2014perhaps more intense fatigue, potentially higher fevers, and greater weight loss. Additional features such as lymphadenopathy, bleeding tendencies, or other constitutional signs may be present but underreported. The progression might be more accelerated than the patient indicates. They may harbor fears or shame about specific symptoms, leading to undercommunication, or simply lack full insight into their severity.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed increased bleeding or bruising?\" \"Are there any other symptoms you haven't mentioned, like enlarged lymph nodes or rashes?\" \"How severe is your fatigue compared to when you first started feeling tired?\" \"Have you experienced higher fevers or night sweats that interfere with your daily life?\" Rationale: To uncover potentially hidden or underreported symptoms and gauge severity more accurately. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, nonjudgmental language to encourage openness, reframing questions to normalize symptoms and reduce fear of judgment. For example, \"Many people experience additional symptoms they might not mention right away; can you tell me if you've noticed anything else unusual?\" - Priority order: Start by validating their experience to encourage trust (\"It sounds like you're really exhausted\"), then systematically explore related symptoms\u2014bleeding, lymph node changes, severity of fevers\u2014before assessing the impact on daily functioning. This approach can help reveal more comprehensive information while maintaining rapport.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication indicates a tendency to understate the severity of their symptoms, employing cautious language and hesitation. Although they report fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and intermittent fevers, these descriptions suggest the symptoms may be more severe or have progressed more rapidly than conveyed. They also describe limb aches as \"dull\" and \"most of the time,\" which may underrepresent the actual intensity or impact. There may be additional symptoms such as bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other constitutional signs that are either not mentioned or deliberately minimized. Their perceived timeline indicates symptoms worsening over months but could be more aggressive. Considering potential biases, the actual systemic illness severity might be higher, and associated features may include more profound fatigue, higher fevers, or signs not verbally reported. Further detailed inquiry is needed to uncover hidden or underreported symptoms.\nANSWER: patient is a likely adult presenting with systemic symptoms indicative of a possible underlying hematologic or infectious process. She reports persistent fatigue, unintentional weight loss (approximately 10 pounds over one month), nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aching in the arms and legs, which are likely understated. Based on communication patterns, her actual symptom severity may be greater, with possible additional signs such as increased fatigue, higher fevers, or lymphadenopathy that have not been fully disclosed. The current timeline suggests gradual symptom worsening over the past couple of months, but the true progression may be more rapid or episodic.

She reports persistent fatigue, unintentional weight loss (approximately 10 pounds over one month), nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aching in the arms and legs, which are likely understated. Based on communication patterns, her actual symptom severity may be greater, with possible additional signs such as increased fatigue, higher fevers, or lymphadenopathy that have not been fully disclosed. The current timeline suggests gradual symptom worsening over the past couple of months, but the true progression may be more rapid or episodic. Further assessment for signs of bleeding, lymphadenopathy, or other constitutional symptoms is warranted to clarify the clinical picture.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates detailed physical symptoms with emotional engagement but tends to focus heavily on how symptoms affect his life, possibly amplifying his concern. His responses are thorough and consistent, indicating honest reporting, but emotional distress appears to influence his perception of severity. - Bias detected: Moderate emotional amplification bias influences his perception, leading him to possibly overstate dangers related to his symptoms. No significant minimization or withholding is evident. - Confidence level: Medium-high\u2014physical symptom descriptions are reliable, but emotional factors could slightly overinflate severity. - Reasoning: The detailed symptom report remains consistent, but his emotional language and emphasis on being \"worried\" suggest some bias toward perceiving his condition as more severe than it might objectively be.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possible more severe fevers, more profound fatigue, lymphadenopathy, night sweats beyond sweating, or additional constitutional symptoms that he perceives as less important or is unaware of. - Withheld information: Social history, exposure risks, family medical history, or psychosocial stressors, possibly omitted due to embarrassment, lack of awareness, or to avoid seeming overly worried. - Amplified concerns: His emotional state might lead him to believe that his illness is more dangerous or rapidly worsening than actual, heightening his anxiety. - Temporal distortions: He may overgeneralize or exaggerate the progression (\"getting worse\" over months), but current communication suggests mostly accurate timeline reporting, though subtle episodic worsening may not be fully disclosed.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely includes: The patient experiences a systemic illness characterized by persistent fatigue, about 10 pounds unintentional weight loss over approximately a month, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull bone aches, suggestive of possible hematologic or infectious pathology. His emotional distress might lead him to perceive these symptoms as more threatening, but physical descriptions are valid. He may also harbor additional symptoms like lymph node swelling, higher fevers, or bleeding that he has not disclosed. The illness seems to have a gradual but possibly episodic progression over recent months, warranting thorough examination for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and other signs of systemic disease.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any swollen glands or lumps anywhere else? Do you have any night sweats beyond just sweating at night? Have you experienced any bleeding, bruising, or unusual infections? Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, cough, or chest discomfort? Do you have any family history of blood disorders or cancers?\" Reasoning: These questions could reveal symptoms or history not currently disclosed, providing clarity on disease severity and differential diagnosis. - Approach strategy: Ask with empathy, emphasizing confidentiality and support, to reduce anxiety or embarrassment. Use open-ended questions to encourage honest disclosure; acknowledge his worries while gently exploring details. - Priority order: First, confirm physical signs like lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, then explore systemic symptoms like bleeding or infection, followed by family and social history\u2014these areas have the greatest impact on diagnostic clarity and are likely areas of functional omission or uncertainty.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes systemic symptoms such as persistent fatigue, weight loss, night sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and bone aches, which are consistent with underlying hematologic or infectious conditions. However, her emotional distress and focus on the impact of symptoms on daily life suggest potential amplification of perceived severity. The detailed account of physical symptoms appears honest but may be influenced by her concern, possibly leading to overstatement of symptom severity. Conversely, she may be minimizing other associated signs such as lymphadenopathy, more profound fevers, or additional constitutional symptoms. The timeline indicates gradual worsening over months, but episodic or more rapid deterioration cannot be excluded due to communication bias. Physical signs like lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or bleeding were not reported but should be assessed. Additional symptoms like unexplained bleeding, easy bruising, or enlarged lymph nodes are likely unreported or minimized. Gathering further information about systemic signs, physical examination findings, and exposure history is needed for a comprehensive assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult (exact age unspecified), female.  Chief complaint: Persistent systemic symptoms including fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue despite adequate sleep, approximately 10-pound weight loss over roughly one month, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aches in the arms and legs. These symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past two months. She emphasizes the impact on her daily functioning. Physical examination findings have not been described but should include assessment for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and any signs of bleeding.  Associated symptoms: Possible additional systemic features such as lymphadenopathy, more severe fevers, or bleeding are likely present but not disclosed; these should be evaluated clinically.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s reported symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fevers, bone aches). - Medium confidence: Symptom severity and progression may be somewhat exaggerated due to emotional distress influencing perception. - Low confidence: Details regarding physical signs (enlarged lymph nodes, organomegaly, bleeding or bruising) are unknown and need clinical examination. - Missing information: Physical exam findings, detailed exposure history, family history of hematologic or infectious diseases, presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or other constitutional symptoms.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with a constellation of systemic symptoms including persistent fatigue, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past month, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aching in the arms and legs, which may be understated given her emotional state and concern. The timeline suggests gradual symptom progression over the last two months, with possible episodic worsening. She reports significant influence of these symptoms on her daily activities and well-being.

Responses are organized but guarded, with subtle hesitations and qualifiers that suggest guardedness and mild withholding. - Bias detected: The primary bias is moderate minimization of the severity of symptoms and incomplete disclosure of background risk factors\u2014possibly influenced by privacy concerns or uncertainty about relevance. - Confidence level: Medium - Reasoning: Based on her use of qualifiers, her reluctance to share exposural and familial details proactively, and the understated descriptions of symptoms, it appears she is somewhat guarded, which affects full transparency, especially regarding background risk factors.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Degree of fatigue and bone pain may be more intense than reported; she could be experiencing significant functional impairment but hesitates to elaborate. - Withheld information: Exact details of chemical, occupational, or environmental exposures; family history specifics like other illnesses or genetic conditions; possibly recent medical evaluations or abnormal findings. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about the \"seriousness\" of symptoms may be proportionate, but she might be overestimating the gravity due to her anxiety, leading to heightened concern. - Temporal distortions: Slight tendency to frame the timeline as gradual and worsening, but actual fluctuations or episodic symptom intensities may be underrepresented.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her guarded communication and biases, the clinical picture likely involves more severe systemic symptoms\u2014especially fatigue and pain\u2014perhaps with unquantified functional impact. Background exposure and family illness could be more significant contributors than currently disclosed, raising suspicion for hematologic or infectious processes. The gradual worsening over two months aligns with possible underlying chronic or subacute pathology like hematologic malignancy or infectious disease, but background risk factors require further elucidation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about any work or hobbies that involve chemicals, fumes, or hazardous materials?\" and \"Has anyone in your family had illnesses like leukemia, lymphoma, or other blood disorders?\" These targets address the potential hidden exposure and family history. - Approach strategy: Frame questions gently, emphasizing curiosity rather than suspicion\u2014e.g., \"Sometimes, details like work exposures or family health can help us understand what's going on. Please feel free to share whatever you feel comfortable with.\" This reduces defensiveness and promotes openness. - Priority order: First, explore exposure history and family health to uncover hidden risk factors, followed by more detailed symptom assessment, ensuring the patient feels respected and safe during disclosure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication style, use of hedging language, and understatement of symptom severity suggest she may be experiencing more intense or extensive symptoms than she is openly acknowledging. She minimizes aspects such as the degree of fatigue and bone pain and hesitates to fully disclose background factors like environmental exposures or family medical history. Consequently, her reported symptoms likely represent only a partial picture; the true severity of fatigue and discomfort could be greater. Her timeline of gradual worsening over two months aligns with possible underlying systemic illnesses, but the intensity and impact might be underestimated.

The symptoms have been gradually worsening over approximately two months and significantly affect her daily activities. The patient\u2019s reports likely understate the true severity of her symptoms, and further inquiry is needed to explore potential environmental or occupational exposures and family medical history. A comprehensive physical examination and relevant investigations are indicated to determine the underlying cause of her presentation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides organized, straightforward information but employs hedging language and modest descriptions, indicating cautious disclosure. She seems to understate symptom severity and shows uncertainty regarding potential exposures. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias and cautious uncertainty bias. - Confidence level: Medium; based on subtle language cues and responses that suggest underreporting but no overt deception. - Reasoning: The patient's reserved demeanor and hedging indicate a tendency to downplay symptoms and avoid alarm, which could lead to underestimation of her actual clinical state.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Fatigue and pain may be more intense or impairing than described, given her hesitant language. - Withheld information: Possible emotional distress, concerns about serious illness, or additional systemic symptoms (e.g., swelling, skin changes) might be unmentioned due to discomfort or fear. - Amplified concerns: She shows realistic worry about serious causes like weight loss and night sweats, but her cautiousness may prevent fully conveying the extent of her distress. - Temporal distortions: She might be unaware of earlier, transient episodes of symptoms or underestimate initial symptom onset.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely entails: - The patient has persistent systemic symptoms including significant fatigue, unintentional weight loss (~10 pounds over one month), nocturnal sweating, low-grade fevers, and dull aching in her limbs. Her functional capacity is notably impaired. - These symptoms have been gradually worsening over approximately two months, with the pain worse at night and not responding to usual measures. - She has some occupational exposure history to chemicals, yet remains uncertain about its relevance. - She may be underreporting the severity of fatigue and pain, as well as emotional or psychological impact. - The timeline appears consistent but could involve earlier, milder symptoms that she has minimized. - Her genuine concern suggests a potentially serious underlying condition such as infection, inflammatory process, or malignancy, but her cautious reporting may delay recognition.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about how your fatigue affects your daily activities? Are there times when it feels worse or better?\" (to gauge true impairment) - \"Have you noticed any swelling, rashes, or changes to your skin?\" (to identify missed physical symptoms) - \"How do you feel emotionally? Do you often feel worried, anxious, or overwhelmed about your health?\" (to assess emotional distress) - \"Can you tell me more about your work with chemicals? Were you using any protective gear? Did symptoms start immediately after exposure?\" (to clarify occupational risks) - Approach strategy: Use open, empathetic questions to encourage full disclosure, emphasizing that honest answers help in finding the best care. - Priority order: Begin with general questions about daily functioning and emotional well-being to build trust, followed by targeted questions about physical symptoms and exposures, ensuring she feels heard and safe to share all relevant information.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication pattern suggests cautious disclosure, with language that minimizes the severity of symptoms and expressions of uncertainty about exposures. This likely leads to underestimation of symptom intensity, particularly fatigue and pain. The reporting may not fully reflect the true impact on her daily functioning or emotional state. There is a possibility that more severe or additional symptoms exist but are underreported due to concern or discomfort. Her history of chemical exposure is uncertain whether it correlates with her symptoms, and she shows worry about serious underlying conditions. The information provided indicates persistent systemic symptoms over approximately two months, but severity and associated features may be understated, requiring thorough, open-ended questioning to uncover full clinical detail.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Middle-aged female.  Chief complaint: Persistent systemic symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fevers, and limb pain, with likely underreported severity.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue that does not improve with sleep, approximate unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over one month, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aching in her arms and legs, predominantly worse at night. These symptoms have been gradually worsening over approximately two months and significantly impair her daily activities. She mentions working with chemicals in her occupation but remains uncertain about its relevance.  Associated symptoms: Dull limb aches mostly worse at night, with possible unmentioned symptoms such as swelling or skin changes; emotional distress or additional systemic symptoms are suspected but not clearly articulated.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, low-grade fevers, and limb aches. - Medium confidence: The exact severity of symptoms, as the patient appears to understate or minimize their impact. - Low confidence: The full extent of possible additional symptoms or emotional distress, due to communication cautiousness. - Missing information: Specific details about physical examination findings (e.g., lymphadenopathy, skin changes), laboratory or diagnostic results, and clarifications regarding occupational exposure and emotional well-being.\nANSWER: A middle-aged female presents with a two-month history of persistent systemic symptoms, including fatigue, approximately 10 pounds of unintentional weight loss, nocturnal sweating, intermittent low-grade fevers, and dull aching in her arms and legs that worsens at night. Her functional capacity is notably affected. She reports working with chemicals in her occupation but remains uncertain about its relevance. The severity of her symptoms may be underestimated due to cautious reporting, and additional physical or systemic features may be present but unarticulated. Further clinical evaluation and investigations are indicated to determine the underlying cause.",
