Are there any physical features you or your family have observed, such as a webbed neck, low posterior hairline, or heart murmurs?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really started growing or anything like that. My breasts still look small, and I haven\u2019t seen any new changes. As for other stuff, I don\u2019t really know about a webbed neck or anything like that, and I don\u2019t think my family has heart murmurs or anything\u2014at least, I haven\u2019t noticed.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me how you are feeling emotionally about your condition and what you already know about it, so we can discuss the best way to support you physically and emotionally?\\nPATIENT: I guess I feel kind of just... confused and maybe a little scared about all of this. I don\u2019t really know what it all means, but I worry sometimes about how I look and if things will get better.\\nDOCTOR: Would you feel comfortable discussing the possibility of further testing to identify any underlying genetic or syndromic cause, and together we can develop a plan for managing your growth, development, and emotional well-being?\\nPATIENT: Um... I guess I don\u2019t really understand all of it, but I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m missing something or that I\u2019m alone in this. Yeah, maybe we can do more tests. I just wanna know why I feel strange sometimes and if everything\u2019s okay.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed whether you have started developing any secondary sexual characteristics, like breast growth or pubic hair, and if not, when you first realized this?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think I've seen anything different... I mean, my boobs haven't like, gotten bigger or anything, and I haven't noticed any hair down there. I guess I just kinda realized I didn't have those things yet, but I didn't think much about it until now.",
