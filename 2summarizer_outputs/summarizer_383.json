And no, I haven't had any fever or chills or anything like that, just the problems I mentioned.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any associated symptoms such as blood in your urine or semen, pain during ejaculation, or bone pain, which might suggest more advanced disease?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don't think I've noticed blood, really, or anything like that, but sometimes I do have, like, some uncomfortable sensations, I guess, down there. And I haven't really had bone pain or anything, but it all kind of feels a bit off or different than before.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other symptoms such as symptoms of urinary tract infection (like burning or stinging during urination), pain in the lower back or pelvis, or any recent changes in your bowel habits?\\nPATIENT: Uh, well, I guess I\u2019ve felt like I had to pee all the time, and sometimes it\u2019s kind of hard to start or finish, but I don\u2019t really notice burning or stinging. As for pain, yeah, I do get this dull ache down there and sometimes in my lower back, but I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s new or worse lately. Bowel habits? I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve been a bit more constipated than usual, but I\u2019m not sure if that matters.\\nDOCTOR: Would you be willing to undergo a prostate examination and some blood tests, such as a PSA level, to help us better understand what might be causing these symptoms and determine the most appropriate next steps?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. I\u2019m a little nervous about all that, but if it helps figure out what\u2019s going on, I guess I\u2019ll do it. Just\u2026 I don\u2019t really understand all these things they want to check.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your urinary symptoms have been gradually worsening or suddenly appeared, and could you describe whether the pressure or discomfort you're experiencing is constant or comes and goes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it\u2019s been kind of coming and going, but lately, it feels worse when I try to pee, like there\u2019s more pressure or something. Sometimes it\u2019s there, and other times it\u2019s not so bad, but overall, I feel like everything\u2019s just been more difficult.",
