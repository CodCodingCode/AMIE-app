Like, walking around or even holding things steady. Sometimes I get really frustrated because my hands shake, and I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019m slower than I should be, like I can\u2019t keep up. And I guess I\u2019ve been a little more tired or spacey, like I don\u2019t always notice things right away or get distracted easily. But I haven\u2019t really noticed any new feelings or anything weird in my body, just the stuff I already mentioned.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other symptoms such as tremors at rest, stiffness in other parts of your body, changes in your voice or swallowing difficulties, fainting episodes, or problems with your sense of smell or sleep patterns?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I guess I do notice some tremors sometimes, especially when I\u2019m trying to keep my hands steady. My voice feels kind of funny and slow, and I\u2019ve had a few moments where I felt a bit dizzy or like I could faint, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related or not. I haven't noticed anything about my smell or actually thinking about my sleep.\\nDOCTOR: Do you experience symptoms such as orthostatic dizziness or fainting when standing up, or have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel habits, like increased urgency or incontinence?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I sometimes feel a bit dizzy when I stand up, like the room spins for a second, but I haven't fainted or anything. As for my bladder or bowels, I haven't noticed much change there, really.\\nDOCTOR: Do you experience any autonomic symptoms like changes in your blood pressure when standing, urinary urgency or incontinence, constipation, or fainting episodes? Additionally, have you noticed any difficulty moving your eyes, especially downward gaze? Are there any specific features of your tremors, such as whether they occur at rest or during movement? Lastly, have you noticed any odd sensations or deficits in your limb coordination, sensation, or ability to perform complex movements?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I sometimes feel like my blood pressure gets weird when I stand up too fast, and I\u2019ve had a couple of times where I had to go to the bathroom like all of a sudden. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s incontinence, but I can\u2019t always control it. I\u2019ve also noticed that my eyes sometimes move weird, especially when I try to look down, it feels slow or like my eyes won\u2019t follow right. The tremors I have are kind of there all the time, mostly when I\u2019m sitting still or trying to hold something, but I get shaky sometimes when I try to move. As for my limbs, it\u2019s hard to do certain movements smoothly, and sometimes I feel weird or off when I try to do things quickly or precisely.\\nDOCTOR: Are your tremors most noticeable when your muscles are at rest and you're not intentionally moving, or do they occur mainly when you're trying to hold a position or perform an action?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think it's mostly when I\u2019m trying to hold still or do something, like if I try to keep my hands steady, they start shaking more. Sometimes I notice a little bit when I\u2019m just sitting, but it feels worse when I\u2019m trying to do something precise.\\nDOCTOR: Are you comfortable proceeding with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and starting appropriate treatment, such as dopaminergic therapy, while also discussing lifestyle modifications and support options to help manage your symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Um, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly what I have, but I guess if it helps me feel a bit better, maybe I could try it? I just don\u2019t want to jump into anything if I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s going on. And I\u2019d like to hear more about what I should do day to day too.",
