I think my left eye has a shadow or maybe it\\u2019s a little darker, and I keep seeing spots. Sometimes it\\u2019s hard to see the blackboard at school, especially when the lights are bright.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Lily presents her symptoms as specific and organized, with mild emotional wording and nervous behaviors. She provides truthful symptom details but displays anxious restraint, indicating underlying worry that influences her perception. - Bias detected: Mild anxiety-driven response bias, with emotional amplification of her fears about losing her sight, possibly overestimating severity due to anxiety. - Confidence level: Medium-high; her physical symptom description is reliable, but emotional concerns are likely magnified. - Reasoning: Her clear, direct responses without exaggerations suggest honesty, but her nervousness and concern about permanence point to emotional amplification affecting her perception of severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Potentially, she may be experiencing more emotional distress or physical symptoms like headaches or ocular discomfort she hasn't shared due to nervousness or not recognizing their significance. - Withheld information: She might be hesitant to disclose fears of blindness or feelings of helplessness, perhaps feeling shame or embarrassment about her anxiety. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about \"losing sight forever\" suggests catastrophizing and may be an overstatement linked to her anxiety, possibly exaggerating the threat to her vision. - Temporal distortions: Timeline appears consistent, so likely no major distortions here, but her perception of worsening may be influenced by her emotional state, making her feel her symptoms are more severe now.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, Lily likely experiences mild visual disturbances, such as shadowing and spots, with some difficulty seeing under bright light. These symptoms are possibly related to benign ocular or neurological factors. Her emotional response, driven by anxiety, might lead her to overestimate the seriousness or permanence of her symptoms. She is cognitively organized and honest about her symptoms but emotionally magnifies her fears, which can influence her distress levels. Deeper emotional issues or health anxiety may be present, although her physical complaints appear genuine.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about how your eyes feel during the day? Do you notice any headaches, eye pain, or other sensations?\" \"How often do these visual changes occur, and have they changed over time?\" \"How do you feel emotionally about your eyesight and future?\" \"Are you worried about anything besides your eyes?\" - Approach strategy: Use empathetic and non-judgmental language to validate her feelings, then gently explore her emotional state, emphasizing safety and reassurance. Encourage her to express fears openly, making it clear that her worries are understandable but manageable. - Priority order: First, clarify her physical symptoms and their progression, then explore her emotional concerns to understand the impact on her well-being. This order helps establish a factual base before addressing emotional amplification and anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description of visual symptoms as a shadow or spots and difficulty seeing under bright lights suggests mild visual disturbances. Her communication depicts her as organized and honest but also nervous, which could lead to emotional amplification of her symptoms and concerns about severity. There is a likelihood that her symptoms are benign and perhaps more subtle or ongoing than she perceives. She may also be experiencing additional symptoms such as headaches or ocular discomfort that she hasn't shared, possibly due to nervousness or not recognizing their significance. Her expressed fears of losing sight could be an exaggeration driven by anxiety, so the severity of her complaints may be overestimated. More detailed exploration of her ocular history, symptom progression, and emotional state is necessary to clarify the clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adolescent female student Chief complaint: Visual disturbances characterized by shadowing and seeing spots, with reported difficulty reading blackboards in bright environments, adjusted for emotional influence. Present illness: The patient reports the onset of visual shadowing and spots, with intermittent difficulty seeing, particularly in well-lit settings. The symptoms are described as mild but cause concern. She does not report associated eye pain, headaches, or other ocular discomfort but may have minimized such symptoms due to nervousness. The timeline suggests a recent or ongoing presence of these visual phenomena, though emotional factors may influence her perception of their severity. Associated symptoms: No reported headaches, eye pain, or other neurological symptoms, though these may be underreported; confidence in symptom description is medium. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Patient's specific visual complaints and general description - Medium confidence: Emotional impact and severity of symptoms influenced by anxiety - Low confidence: Full extent of additional symptoms like ocular discomfort or neurological signs due to potential underreporting - Missing information: Details regarding symptom duration, progression, associated ocular or systemic symptoms, and emotional state\nANSWER: The patient is an adolescent female presenting with visual disturbances including shadowing and seeing spots, with intermittent difficulty in reading in bright light conditions. She reports no associated eye pain or headaches. Her description indicates mild symptoms, but her nervousness and expressed fears suggest her perceived severity may be inflated. Further examination and history are needed to assess physical ocular health, rule out neurological causes, and explore emotional factors that may contribute to her perception of her symptoms.",

It makes it hard to see the blackboard or sometimes my toys or whatever I\\u2019m looking at, and I feel kinda worried about it.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is an adolescent female presenting with visual disturbances including shadowing and seeing spots, with intermittent difficulty in reading in bright light conditions. She reports no associated eye pain or headaches. Her description indicates mild symptoms, but her nervousness and expressed fears suggest her perceived severity may be inflated. Further examination and history are needed to assess physical ocular health, rule out neurological causes, and explore emotional factors that may contribute to her perception of her symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates her visual symptoms in a cautious, hedged manner, using vague descriptors like \"kind of darker\" and \"a little blurry,\" which suggest she\u2019s minimizing their severity. Her responses are concise and measured, with subtle expressions of worry but no overt distress, indicating guardedness and possible emotional suppression. She appears influenced by her mother\u2019s perceptions, and her hesitance implies discomfort discussing emotional vulnerabilities or fears. - Bias detected: The main bias impacting her reporting is **minimization/underreporting**. Evidence includes her use of qualifiers (\"kind of,\" \"a little\") and her tendency to provide vague descriptions rather than detailed accounts of her symptoms. - Confidence level: **Medium** \u2014 While her communication pattern clearly points to minimization, some details (like her concern and symptom descriptions) are genuine. The bias seems balanced with actual symptoms but likely results in underestimation. - Reasoning: The hedging language and guarded responses strongly support the presence of minimization bias, which affects the accuracy of her symptom severity and emotional disclosure.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her visual disturbances may be more severe or persistent than reported; she might experience more frequent floaters, shadowing, or visual difficulty affecting her daily functioning more significantly. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to share fears of worsening or fears about serious underlying pathology, possibly due to discomfort or shame. Emotional distress or anxiety about her health could be underdisclosed, limiting full understanding. - Amplified concerns: Her worry, while genuine, could be exaggerated psychologically, coloring her perception and potentially leading her to believe her condition is more dire than it clinically is, which could amplify anxiety. - Temporal distortions: The vague descriptions (\"sometimes,\" \"kind of\") suggest she might not accurately remember or perceive the progression timeline, obscuring the urgency or severity of symptom evolution.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering these biases, the objective picture should reflect that her visual disturbances are likely moderate in intensity, with intermittent worsening, and are affecting her daily activities. She may not fully recognize or admit the severity or persistence of symptoms, possibly underreporting associated signs such as pain or acuity loss. Emotional and psychological factors\u2014such as anxiety or fear\u2014may also be magnifying her perceived severity, although she outwardly appears reserved. The timeline may be more rapid or pronounced than she indicates, emphasizing the need for thorough clinical evaluation and sensitive inquiry into her emotional state.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: - \"Can you tell me if your vision problems have been getting worse fast or slowly over time?\" (to clarify the progression rate) - \"Are there any other symptoms like eye pain, headaches, or seeing flashes that you haven't mentioned?\" (to uncover omitted signs) - \"How do you feel about the vision changes\u2014are they frightening or just annoying?\" (to assess emotional impact) - \"Do you worry that your eyesight might get worse or that something serious is happening?\" (to understand fears and emotional concerns) - \"Would you feel comfortable talking about how this has made you feel emotionally?\" (to explore emotional disclosure)  - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language with open-ended questions that normalize her experience. Affirm her feelings to reduce shame and encourage honest sharing. Be attentive to non-verbal cues and emotional undercurrents to pick up on unspoken fears or distress.  - Priority order: First, clarify her perceptions of been worsening timeline and daily impact, then gently explore emotional reactions and fears. This sequencing builds rapport and provides context for her subjective experience, helping to differentiate between actual severity and perceived severity influenced by anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded communication and use of vague descriptors suggest she is possibly minimizing the severity or frequency of her visual disturbances. She reports intermittent shadowing and floaters that interfere with her vision during daily activities, but her language indicates she may not fully acknowledge or recognize the persistence or seriousness of these symptoms. There is a potential for underlying issues to be more severe or frequent than described, and emotional factors like anxiety could be amplifying her perception of her symptoms. Additionally, she might be withholding or hesitant to disclose additional symptoms or fears about her eye health, which warrants cautious, open-ended inquiry. Her current report suggests moderate visual disturbances, but objective evaluation may reveal more significant or ongoing visual impairment, with possible emotional or psychological influences affecting her perception.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adolescent female (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Visual disturbances characterized by shadowing and seeing spots, with intermittent difficulty reading in bright light. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing visual symptoms such as shadowing or darker patches in her left eye and floating spots, which intermittently interfere with visual clarity and reading ability. She describes the sensations using hedged language (\"kind of darker,\" \"a little blurry\") which suggest the symptoms may be more persistent or severe than she admits. The reporting indicates that symptoms are intermittent, but the true frequency and impact may be underestimated due to discomfort in discussing their full extent. She reports no associated eye pain or headaches but expresses some worry about her symptoms. Associated symptoms: No explicit reports of eye pain, headaches, flashes, or other neurological signs, though these have not been directly inquired about or confirmed. The actual presence of additional symptoms cannot be assured without further assessment. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: The patient is experiencing visual disturbances involving shadowing and floaters. - Medium confidence: The severity, frequency, and impact of these symptoms are likely underreported due to guarded communication and hedging language. - Low confidence: The emotional or psychological factors influencing her perception are not directly established but are suspected. - Missing information: Further detailed history regarding symptom progression, associated phenomena (e.g., flashes, pain), and emotional responses are needed. Clinical examination and investigations are indicated to determine cause and severity.\nANSWER: An adolescent female presents with intermittent visual disturbances including shadowing and floaters, which she reports as mildly impactful on reading and daily activities. Her descriptions suggest the symptoms may be more persistent and severe than indicated, with possible underreporting due to guarded communication style. No associated eye pain or headaches were noted on history. Given her cautious reporting, further clinical evaluation and investigation are required to accurately assess the severity, identify underlying causes, and explore any emotional factors influencing her perception of her visual symptoms.",

LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Emotional distress or anxiety about her visual condition, possibly severity of impact on her emotional state due to shyness preventing full disclosure. - Withheld information: Fears about potential blindness or loss of independence that she might not be comfortable expressing directly. - Amplified concerns: She shows appropriate concern but seems to manage worry in a subdued way; no evidence of over-worrying. - Temporal distortions: No clear timeline distortions, but her cautious speech might mask any rapid changes or worsening that she doesn\u2019t feel ready to mention.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely includes: - The visual disturbances (floaters and shadowing) are objectively ongoing and possibly more persistent than she reports, possibly affecting her daily functioning to an extent that she underplays due to shyness or emotional reticence. - The symptom timeline appears steady, but emotional impact may be underrepresented; she might harbor fears about worsening vision that she does not articulate fully. - No overt associated symptoms like pain or headache are reported, but subtle emotional or psychological concerns related to her vision may be present and warrant gentle exploration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Sometimes people feel worried or scared about their eyesight\u2014are you feeling anything like that?\" (to gently elicit emotional reactions) - \"Have you noticed if these spots or shadows are changing or getting worse?\" (to clarify progression) - \"How do you feel about your vision overall?

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication indicates that her visual disturbances are persistent and ongoing, with specific descriptions of floaters and shadowing that affect her vision during activities like reading and seeing the blackboard. Her responses appear honest and coherent, suggesting high confidence in reported symptoms; however, her reserved tone and mild hesitance may lead her to underreport emotional distress or underestimate the severity of impact. Given these communication patterns, it's likely that her symptoms are at least as severe as described, possibly more so, and she might harbor unspoken fears about worsening vision or emotional concerns related to her eyesight. She reports no associated eye pain or headaches, though subtle emotional or psychological issues could be present but underreported. More detailed probing into emotional well-being and possible rapid changes is needed to fully understand the clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adolescent female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Persistent visual disturbances characterized by floaters and shadowing affecting visual clarity during daily activities.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing shadowing and floaters in her vision over the past few months, with symptoms remaining steady but reportedly worsening recently. These symptoms interfere with her ability to see clearly in school settings, particularly under bright lighting. Objective assessment suggests that visual disturbances are ongoing and may be more severe than the patient acknowledges due to mild hesitance; her detailed descriptions support symptom reliability, yet her reserved communication style indicates she may be underreporting emotional impacts or fears.  Associated symptoms: No reports of eye pain, headaches, flashes, or other neurological symptoms; confidence in these negatives is high.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence and nature of visual disturbances as described, symptom duration, and lack of associated ocular pain or headache. - Medium confidence: The severity and emotional impact may be understated due to patient\u2019s reserved communication. - Low confidence: The precise severity and psychological concerns related to her vision, as she may be withholding or minimizing such information. - Missing information: Detailed ophthalmological examination findings, assessment of visual acuity, intraocular pressure, fundoscopy, and evaluation for potential causes like vitreous floaters, retinal conditions, or other ocular pathology. Further exploration of emotional or psychological sequelae is also warranted.\nANSWER: An adolescent female presents with persistent visual disturbances including floaters and shadowing, first noticed several months prior and currently affecting her ability to see clearly in various settings. The symptoms have been steady but reportedly worsened recently; however, her communication style suggests these symptoms may be more severe than she indicates, and emotional concerns related to her vision might be understated.

A comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation is recommended to identify underlying causes such as vitreous changes or retinal pathology, and to address potential emotional factors influencing her perception of her symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs brief, measured responses with minimizing language (\"just floaters,\" \"not that bad\") and tends to answer directly but avoids elaboration unless prompted. Her tone indicates mild anxiety but no overt alarm, though she shows some uncertainty about the timeline. - Bias detected: Minimization bias significantly influences her reporting, leading her to understate the severity of her symptoms and potential risks. - Confidence level: Medium. The communication suggests honest intent but a tendency to downplay or misunderstand the seriousness, affecting accuracy. - Reasoning: The consistent use of qualifiers like \"just\" and \"not that bad,\" combined with lack of detailed symptom description and the vague timeline, point toward deliberate or unconscious minimization, masking possible more serious underlying issues.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more frequent or bothersome floaters, transient flashes, or shadowing that she perceives as normal or insignificant, underreported due to minimization. - Withheld information: She might be hesitant to discuss more alarming symptoms like sudden flashes, light sensitivity, or episodes of curtain-like shadow, perhaps fearing they imply severe eye disease or feeling embarrassed about her limited understanding. - Amplified concerns: She is genuinely worried (\"a little scared\"), but her indication of worry may be an honest emotional distress rather than exaggerated fears; however, her concern may be disproportionate to her understanding, causing unnecessary anxiety. - Temporal distortions: She may not accurately recall when symptoms worsened or started, possibly misestimating the course or missing recent acute changes.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Taking minimization bias into account, her actual symptoms are probably more severe or complex\u2014fundoscopic changes, more frequent or new flashes, and subtle progression, possibly involving retinal or vitreous pathology. Her understanding of the timeline is likely imprecise, with recent worsening potentially more significant than she reports. Emotional factors like anxiety might be heightening her perception of threat, despite her attempts to normalize the symptoms. A comprehensive eye exam is crucial to clarify actual severity and underlying cause.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed if the floaters increase suddenly or suddenly get worse?\" and \"Have you seen any brief flashes or shadows that come and go?\" to identify more urgent signs. \"Do you ever feel like your vision is loss or that there's a curtain coming down?\" to detect threatening visual events. - Approach strategy: Use empathetic, non-threatening language to encourage openness. Normalize common visual phenomena but emphasize the importance of any sudden or new symptoms. Frame questions to gently explore potential omissions, e.g., \"Sometimes people notice small flashes but think they're normal\u2014have you experienced anything like that?\" - Priority order: First, probe about any sudden or recent changes like flashes or shadows, as these are red flags; then inquire about fluctuations or increases in floaters; finally, assess emotional response and understanding to tailor education and reduce anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient employs measured responses, often minimizing or qualifying her symptoms with language like \"just floaters\" or \"not that bad,\" suggesting she may underreport the severity or frequency of her visual disturbances. Her denial of flashes and lack of report of more acute changes could mean these symptoms are more prominent or recent than she acknowledges. There is potential emotional distress, which might influence her perception and reporting, and she may be hesitant to disclose more alarming symptoms such as sudden flashes or a curtain-like shadow. Her timeline suggests gradual worsening, but given her communication style, deterioration might be underestimated or recent changes more significant.

Chief complaint: visual disturbances including floaters and shadowing, reported as mild and steady over several months with recent perceived worsening. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing floating spots and shadows in her vision for approximately three months, with a gradual increase in severity. She describes the floaters as \"little spots\" that are typically present daily and sometimes interfere with her ability to see clearly, such as when viewing the blackboard or her toys. She denies recent flashes of light, eye pain, redness, or abrupt changes. The timeline suggests a slow progression, but her communication indicates she may be underreporting or minimizing symptom severity, potentially masking more frequent floaters, subtle flashes, or other signs of retinal or vitreous pathology. Associated symptoms are not reported, but her emotional state may influence her perception and reporting accuracy. Further detailed questioning and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended to establish the true extent and cause of these visual symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient shows cautious, reserved communication, minimizing symptom severity and frequency, with brief, factual responses. She is reluctant to elaborate or disclose all possible symptoms, suggesting guardedness and possible underreporting. - Bias detected: Minimizaton bias influenced by her anxiety and limited understanding, leading to potential underestimation of symptom severity and frequency. - Confidence level: Medium. The responses suggest genuine concern, but communication biases may obscure the full picture. - Reasoning: Her language choices (\"not that bad,\" \"just floaters\") and limited mention of flashes or episodes point toward underreporting. Her hesitance and minimal elaboration support the idea of guarded disclosure, influenced by worry or embarrassment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing more frequent or severe flashes or transient visual disturbances that she perceives as insignificant or not worth mentioning, especially if they are minor or infrequent. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or afraid to report symptoms that seem alarming, like sudden flashes or worsening vision, especially if she fears causing concern or not understanding their importance. - Amplified concerns: She is rightly worried about vision loss but may overestimate how imminent or severe it is due to her anxiety, possibly leading to disproportionate worry. - Temporal distortions: She perceives the progression as slow and steady, but episodic worsening or transient symptoms may have gone unnoticed or unreported, skewing the timeline.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering her guarded communication and potential biases, the true clinical scenario likely involves more frequent floating lesions, intermittent flashes of light, and possibly unnoticed transient episodes of visual distortion. Her mild self-reporting suggests she underestimates or is unaware of the severity or frequency of these phenomena. The progression is probably episodic, with intermittent worsening that she perceives as gradual but may be more abrupt or variable upon closer examination. Her anxiety heightens concern but should not distort the need for thorough assessment.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you noticed any quick flashes of light that last a second or two? Do these happen often or just once? Have you experienced sudden dimming or distortion that you didn't mention?\" Rationale: to uncover unreported flashes or transient signs. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language\u2014\"Many people notice small flashes or floaters that seem minor, but sometimes these can be more significant. Can you tell me if any visual changes have surprised or alarmed you?\" Rationale: to encourage disclosure without increasing anxiety. - Priority order: First, clarify the frequency and impact of flashes and transient symptoms; second, ask about episodes of sudden vision loss or distortion; third, explore emotional response to symptoms to gauge anxiety's role. Rationale: identifying hidden or unreported symptoms, while creating a safe environment, helps ensure an accurate clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's guarded and brief communication pattern suggests she may be underreporting or minimizing the severity and frequency of her visual symptoms. Although she reports daily floaters and a gradual worsening over several months, she denies flashes or pain, which could be accurate, but her description of \"little flashes once\" indicates possible episodic transient phenomena that she might not fully recognize or recall in detail. The absence of recent flashes or pain does not exclude intermittent or subtle symptoms that she may not have perceived as significant. Her concern about her vision deteriorating may heighten anxiety, leading her to focus on certain symptoms and overlook others. Therefore, while her subjective report points to a steady, mild visual disturbance, objective findings may reveal more frequent floaters, unnoticed transient flashes, or other signs of vitreoretinal pathology. Her symptom timeline appears slow and steady, but episodic exacerbations could be underestimated initially. Additional probing is necessary to clarify any hidden transient symptoms or episodes she considers insignificant. Anxiety or concern may influence her reporting, so a thorough ophthalmic evaluation is essential to establish an accurate clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: adolescent female.  Chief complaint: Visual disturbances characterized by floaters and shadowing, reported as mild and steady over several months, with perceived recent worsening.  Present illness: The patient reports experiencing persistent floaters described as \"little spots\" present daily, with a gradual increase in severity over approximately three months. She indicates difficulty seeing the blackboard and objects, especially in bright lighting. She denies recent flashes of light, eye pain, redness, or sudden changes. She reports a single instance of seeing a brief flash when looking out the window, which she does not recall recurring. Her communication suggests she may underreport transient visual phenomena.  Associated symptoms: No reports of eye pain, redness, or other symptoms; awareness of occasional brief flashes is limited to a single incident. Confidence that her symptoms are primarily steady and mild, although communication bias suggests actual transient episodes might be more frequent or severe.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient reports consistent floaters and a slow, steady worsening over several months. - Medium confidence: The absence of reported flashes or pain may underestimate intermittent or subtle transient phenomena; her guarded communication style could mask more significant symptoms. - Low confidence: The true frequency and severity of transient flashes, or additional signs of retinal pathology, remain uncertain without further detailed inquiry. - Missing information: Clarification on the frequency of flashes, any episodes of sudden vision loss or distortion, and assessment of her emotional impact and anxiety.\nANSWER: The clinical presentation involves an adolescent female presenting with a three-month history of persistent floaters and shadows in her visual field, with a self-reported gradual worsening. She denies recent flashes, eye pain, or redness, although she has a history of a brief, single flash occurrence. Her communication style suggests potential underreporting of transient visual phenomena or other symptoms. Objective findings require ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for vitreoretinal pathology, including retinal detachment or vitreous floaters. Further probing into episodic flashes or transient visual changes is recommended to uncover any unreported or unnoticed symptoms, ensuring an accurate assessment and appropriate management.",
