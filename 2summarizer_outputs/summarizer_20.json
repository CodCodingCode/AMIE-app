Or a little more. I started feeling dizzy sometimes, especially in the evenings. At first, I didn't think much of it, but now it\\u2019s pretty constant. I guess it's gotten worse lately. I\\u2019ve been drinking a lot more after work, so I wonder if that\\u2019s related. But I don\\u2019t really remember exactly when it all started, just that it\\u2019s been a while.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Do you notice any other symptoms besides fatigue, dizziness, and headaches, such as vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty concentrating?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, well, I do sometimes see things a little blurry or a bit fuzzy, especially when I\\u2019m really tired. And I guess I feel kind of weak sometimes, like I can\\u2019t really lift things easily or I get tired quickly. Numbness? Not really, but I do feel a little strange in my limbs sometimes, especially after drinking. Concentrating is hard now and then, I get distracted easily. Honestly, I haven\\u2019t paid too much attention to other stuff, but I thought I should tell you about the dizziness and headaches.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have your symptoms been constant since they started, or have they come and gone over time? How have they changed in intensity or frequency?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, I\\u2026 I think it\\u2019s kinda been the same most of the time? Like, I feel tired all the time, and the headaches don\\u2019t really go away, and I get dizzy now and then. Sometimes, maybe I feel a little better for a short while, but then it comes back. It\\u2019s not like I have days when I feel okay and days when I don\\u2019t\\u2014it\\u2019s pretty much constant. I guess it\\u2019s worse now and then, but I don\\u2019t really notice a big change that way. It just feels like I\\u2019m always tired and out of sorts.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you ever had your thyroid function tested or been diagnosed with a thyroid condition in the past?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, I, uh, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve had my thyroid checked before. I honestly don\\u2019t remember being told anything about it.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me if your symptoms tend to get worse at certain times of the day, after specific activities, or in relation to anything like eating or drinking alcohol?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, I guess I do feel worse sometimes in the mornings, especially after I\\u2019ve had a few drinks the night before. Like, I wake up feeling kind of dizzy and tired, and the headaches are sometimes worse then. It\\u2019s been like that for a while\\u2014maybe a few months. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s because of eating or drinking or what, but yeah, I notice some of my symptoms seem to come after I\\u2019ve been drinking or when I\\u2019m really stressed out. Sometimes I feel like it\\u2019s worse when I haven\\u2019t slept well or if I\\u2019ve been drinking alcohol the night before.

They describe the dizziness primarily occurring in the evenings and as having increased in frequency. They state the fatigue and headaches are persistent and have worsened over time. The patient mentions feeling dizzy \"sometimes,\" and feeling \"kind of weak\" at times, with difficulty lifting objects and feeling tired quickly. They report seeing things \"a little blurry or fuzzy,\" especially when very tired, and feeling \"a little strange in [their] limbs sometimes,\" particularly after drinking alcohol. They also say that concentrating is \"hard now and then,\" and they are easily distracted. The symptoms have been described as pretty much constant over the period, with no significant change in severity, and sometimes feeling slightly better for short periods. The patient explicitly denies numbness. No previous thyroid testing or diagnosis is known according to the patient. No other associated symptoms are mentioned. Missing information includes exact symptom onset timing, severity and progression details, other neurological or systemic symptoms, past medical history, medication use, and factors affecting symptoms.",
    "thinking": "The conversation involves a patient presenting with multiple symptoms over a certain period. The summarizer should focus solely on facts explicitly stated, avoiding interpretation. The extracted facts include the patient's exact words, which I will translate into clinical language for clarity: symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, headaches, blurry vision, weakness, limb sensations, and concentration issues. I will organize these chronologically, noting when symptoms started and their progression, as described by the patient. For example, symptoms began approximately three months ago, with some worse in the mornings and after alcohol. The symptom details are organized into categories: neurological (dizziness, blurred vision, limb sensations), general (tiredness, headaches), timing, and circumstances affecting symptoms.
