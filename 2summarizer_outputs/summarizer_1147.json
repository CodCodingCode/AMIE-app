It\u2019s been like this for about a month, and now the skin looks funny, kind of shiny and lumpy. I\u2019ve been feeling pretty tired and I lost a little weight too, so I thought I should come see what\u2019s going on.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any recent trauma, injury, or surgeries to your breast? Additionally, have you experienced fevers, chills, or skin changes beyond redness and soreness?\\nPATIENT: No, I didn\u2019t really have any injuries or anything like that\u2026 I mean, nothing I can remember. As for the other stuff, I didn\u2019t have fever or chills, but my skin\u2019s been very red and tender, like it\u2019s tight and kind of shiny, and it\u2019s been painful.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your breast feels overall\u2014any changes you've noticed in size, shape, or texture\u2014and whether you\u2019ve experienced any new or unusual symptoms elsewhere in your body?\\nPATIENT: Uh, yeah, it\u2019s like it\u2019s gotten way bigger or something, and it feels really tight and hot, like it\u2019s swollen all over. It\u2019s been sore and kind of sore all the time now, and I noticed the skin\u2019s all weird and bumpy\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just different than before. I also feel kinda tired, and I\u2019ve lost some weight without really trying.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other changes in your skin, such as scaling or crusting, or any new symptoms like nipple changes, new lumps elsewhere, or any sensations of tingling or itching in the affected area?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess the skin\u2019s felt a bit funny, like it\u2019s tight and maybe shiny? I haven\u2019t really noticed any crusting or something like peeling or anything like that. The nipple\u2019s kind of flattened now, and I feel some tingling, but it\u2019s like weird and not really painful.

Lastly, do you experience any night sweats, fever, or worsening fatigue?\\nPATIENT: I haven't really noticed any discharge at all, not blood or anything clear that I can tell. The nipple seems a bit flat lately, like it\u2019s pulled in or inverted sometimes. I do feel more tired than usual and a little sweaty at night, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or because I\u2019m just stressing about all this.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any nipple discharge, such as bloody or clear fluid, or noticed any nipple retraction or inversion?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven\u2019t really seen or felt anything coming from my nipple. It\u2019s just the way it looks and feels now, kind of flat and different, but I haven\u2019t noticed anything like fluid or stuff like that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any skin ulcers, open sores, or persistent infections in or around your breast area?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't seen any open sores or ulcers, but the skin is really tight and shiny, and it feels kinda warm all the time.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any fever, chills, or general feelings of being unwell besides the breast symptoms?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really had a fever or chills or anything like that. I just feel kind of tired and, I don\u2019t know, just not right, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Are you comfortable with further imaging, like an ultrasound or MRI of your breast, and a biopsy, to confirm whether this is inflammatory breast cancer or another condition, so we can proceed with the appropriate treatment promptly?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I\u2019m okay with doing whatever tests you think are best. I just want to know what\u2019s going on and to get this fixed, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any fever, chills, or other signs of infection besides the breast symptoms, or do you feel generally unwell in a way that seems more systemic?\\nPATIENT: No, I haven't really had a fever or chills, but I just feel really tired all the time, like I don\u2019t have any energy.
