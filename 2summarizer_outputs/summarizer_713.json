I feel like everyone is watching me and trying to hurt me, and I just can\\u2019t think straight, doctor.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly with emotionally charged, detailed descriptions of hallucinations and paranoia, reflecting genuine distress. His responses are elaborative and without signs of minimization or deflection. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias influences his symptom severity reports, likely inflating perceived distress and paranoia severity. - Confidence level: Medium to high\u2014trustworthy about symptom presence but slightly overestimating severity due to emotional arousal. - Reasoning: The combination of vivid descriptions with high emotional activation indicates real symptoms, but current distress likely magnifies their gravity in his reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Possibly subtle negative symptoms like social withdrawal, or prior mild psychotic features that he does not recognize or mention. - Withheld information: He may be reluctant to disclose past psychiatric history, previous episodes, or underlying vulnerabilities due to stigma or lack of insight. - Amplified concerns: His fears of danger and control may be exaggerated by current paranoia, but they reflect genuine perceptual distortions. - Temporal distortions: The timeline of symptom onset is primarily acute post-binge; chronic or prior episodes may be underreported or unrecognized.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely includes: - Acute meth-induced psychosis characterized by paranoid delusions and hallucinations, consistent with his substance use history. - The severity of hallucinations and paranoia is probably moderate but feels more intense due to acute emotional distress. - Underlying mental health issues (e.g., predisposition to psychosis) remain uncertain; no clear evidence of longstanding psychosis. - He likely does not have significant negative or cognitive symptoms outside this acute episode. - The perceptual disturbances are time-limited and linked to recent substance intake, with potential for resolution as intoxication subsides.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: 1. \"Have you experienced similar episodes before when not using substances?\" (to assess baseline mental health) 2. \"Do you have any history of mental health treatment or diagnoses?\" (to identify underlying vulnerabilities) 3. \"How long have these hallucinations and paranoia lasted?\" (to determine episode duration and progression) 4. \"Are there any other symptoms you've noticed, like mood changes, sleep issues, or withdrawal?\u201d (to explore broader psychiatric context) - Approach strategy: - Ask questions gently and without judgment to reduce defensiveness. - Frame questions to clarify rather than challenge, emphasizing understanding his history. - Priority order: - Start with past history questions to establish baseline functioning. - Proceed to symptom timeline and duration. - Follow with questions about prior similar episodes and treatment. This approach helps differentiate substance-induced phenomena from potential primary psychotic disorders.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports recent hallucinations and paranoia driven by substance use, with emotionally charged descriptions indicating genuine distress. His openness suggests he is not intentionally minimizing symptoms, but the intensity and emotional amplification bias likely inflate the perceived severity. There may be underlying or prior mental health issues that he is reluctant to disclose, or symptoms that he is unaware of or chooses not to mention, such as negative symptoms or past episodes. Since his communication is detailed and emotionally engaged, the core psychotic symptoms are likely present but moderate in severity, linked to recent methamphetamine use, and possibly transient. Additional information about past similar episodes, any prior psychiatric history, and broader symptoms is needed to differentiate substance-induced psychosis from primary psychotic disorders.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 28-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Acute paranoid thoughts and visual and auditory hallucinations, reported as distressing and threatening.  Present illness: The patient describes experiencing hallucinations\u2014seeing things that aren\u2019t there and hearing voices\u2014without current insight into their origin, occurring in the context of recent heavy methamphetamine use. He perceives himself as being watched and threatened. Objective assessment suggests these symptoms are consistent with meth-induced psychosis; severity appears moderate but is likely magnified by high emotional arousal. There is no reported prior history of similar episodes outside substance use, though the patient may be reluctant to disclose past psychiatric episodes or diagnoses. The timeline indicates recent onset aligned with recent methamphetamine binge, with the persistence of symptoms uncertain\u2014these may resolve as intoxication subsides.  Associated symptoms: No explicit reports of mood changes, sleep disturbances, or withdrawal symptoms, but further inquiry is needed to clarify the broader psychiatric context. Negative symptoms, cognitive impairments, or long-standing psychosis appear unlikely based on current reports, though unrecognized or minimized history cannot be ruled out.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of recent hallucinations and paranoia in the context of methamphetamine use. - Medium confidence: The severity and impact of symptoms may be overestimated due to emotional amplification bias. - Low confidence: Underlying or prior psychiatric history and the duration of current symptoms are uncertain. - Missing information: Past psychiatric history, prior episodes of psychosis or treatment, and symptom timeline.\nANSWER: The patient is a 28-year-old male presenting with acute paranoid delusions and visual and auditory hallucinations occurring following recent heavy methamphetamine use. His descriptions indicate significant distress, but emotional intensity suggests the symptoms may be slightly overreported. It is probable that these psychotic features are substance-induced and transient, with the severity potentially less than perceived. No clear evidence of a longstanding psychiatric disorder is provided, though further history is necessary. The current episode's duration and prior mental health history remain unclear, requiring additional inquiry to determine baseline functioning and the need for further psychiatric evaluation.",

His descriptions indicate significant distress, but emotional intensity suggests the symptoms may be slightly overreported. It is probable that these psychotic features are substance-induced and transient, with the severity potentially less than perceived. No clear evidence of a longstanding psychiatric disorder is provided, though further history is necessary. The current episode's duration and prior mental health history remain unclear, requiring additional inquiry to determine baseline functioning and the need for further psychiatric evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Michael presents with heightened emotional language, brief responses, and emphasis on recent severe symptoms, indicating distress and possible exaggeration. His language suggests urgent concern but minimal elaboration. - Bias detected: There is clear evidence of minimization regarding prior mental health history (\"never felt like this before\") combined with amplification of current symptoms driven by emotional arousal. This biases the overall picture toward perceiving this as a new and severe episode, possibly overshadowing chronic vulnerabilities. - Confidence level: Medium, since his distress and substance use significantly influence his self-report, but some details about prior mental state are likely underreported. - Reasoning: Consistent with patterns of substance-induced psychosis, patient\u2019s emotional intensity, and responses point to an overemphasis on current acute symptoms and underrepresentation of the historical baseline.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Prior mild paranoia, anxiety episodes, or subtle hallucinations that went unnoticed or unacknowledged, potentially underreported due to lack of insight or stigma. - Withheld information: Past mental health issues, family history, or episodes of mood disturbance that the patient may feel ashamed of or fear judgment for. - Amplified concerns: Current paranoid and hallucinatory symptoms, possibly heightened by intoxication but not necessarily reflective of a chronic condition. - Temporal distortions: The assertion that he \"never felt like this before\" likely neglects previous mild symptoms or prodromal phases. His memory may be affected by intoxication and distress, leading to simplified timelines.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: - Recent onset of paranoid delusions and visual/auditory hallucinations following meth binge. - Emotional distress that appears disproportionate, possibly exaggerated due to intoxication. - No clear evidence of persistent or prior psychotic episodes; mild, possibly unnoticed, symptoms may have existed pre-morbidly. - The current episode is likely substance-induced, transient, and responsive to detoxification, but there may be underlying vulnerability (e.g., prior anxiety or subtle paranoia) that remains unaddressed. - The patient\u2019s perception of complete novelty might be an oversimplification, potentially missing a chronic baseline of mild symptoms.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you ever experienced any feelings of paranoia, hearing voices, or seeing things before, even if mild?\" to uncover prior subtle symptoms. \"Did these feelings or experiences happen at any other time in your life?\" to clarify history. - Approach strategy: Use open, non-judgmental questions to foster honesty\u2014e.g., \"Many people have experienced worries or odd thoughts at times; have you noticed anything like that before or after your last episode?\" Ensure a safe space to discuss past vulnerabilities. - Priority order: First, explore past mental health and substance use history to contextualize this episode, then probe into any mild symptoms previously unrecognized, before discussing current symptoms in relation to substance effects.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication exhibits emotional exaggeration of current psychotic symptoms, with minimal detail about prior mental health experiences, suggesting that he may be overreporting the severity of his current episode while potentially underreporting previous mild or transient symptoms. His assertion that this is his first experience with such symptoms likely minimizes any baseline paranoia, anxiety, or subtle hallucinations that could have existed previously. The language indicates significant distress, but the intensity may be influenced by intoxication and emotional arousal. Additional history is needed to clarify past mental health status and previous episodes, as current presentation appears to be substance-induced, with transient psychotic features. Communication patterns suggest the possibility of unacknowledged prior vulnerabilities, making it essential to explore his mental health history more comprehensively and objectively.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 28-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Experiencing hallucinations and paranoia following recent heavy methamphetamine use, with significant emotional distress reported.  Present illness: The patient reports visual and auditory hallucinations, including seeing things that are not there and hearing voices that he perceives as threatening. He states that he feels watched and believes he is in danger. He indicates that these symptoms are worse than any he has experienced before and describes his current state as unprecedented. It is likely that his perception of symptom severity is exaggerated due to current distress and intoxication. The patient denies having had similar episodes in the past, suggesting this may be an acute substance-induced psychotic episode, although subtle or mild prior symptoms cannot be ruled out and require further inquiry. The timeline suggests recent onset of symptoms coinciding with heavy meth use, but the duration and history of previous mental health symptoms remain unclear.  Associated symptoms: Emotional distress, confusion, lack of insight during the episode. Confidence levels: The hallucinations and paranoia are well-documented during the episode, but the overall severity and chronicity are uncertain. Prior mood or psychotic episodes and baseline mental health status are likely underreported or unrecognized, indicating the need for a more detailed history. Areas requiring further assessment include past mental health issues, previous similar experiences, and the full scope of substance use history.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Recent heavy methamphetamine use coinciding with the onset of psychotic symptoms. - Medium confidence: The current episode representing substance-induced psychosis, with a possibility of underlying vulnerability. - Low confidence: Extent of prior mental health symptoms and baseline functioning, due to patient\u2019s minimization and communication biases. - Missing information: Detailed past psychiatric history, prior similar episodes, family history, and previous subtle symptoms that may have gone unnoticed or unacknowledged.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs vague, emotionally charged language, minimizes prior paranoia, and reports intense current distress. Responses are brief, scattered, and guarded, indicating discomfort sharing full information and potential shame. The language suggests emotional amplification for current symptoms but minimization of past experiences. - Bias detected: The main bias is a combination of **minimization** of previous mental health issues and **amplification** of current distress\u2014possibly influenced by anxiety or substance effects\u2014and **withholding** of detailed history. - Confidence level: medium. The inconsistencies and guarded responses suggest biases are influencing reporting, but the presence of genuine distress is evident. - Reasoning: The patient's reluctance to disclose past episodes fully and the exaggerated language about current symptoms indicate biases affecting reliability, requiring careful, systematic investigation.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Past paranoia and emotional instability may be more frequent or severe than acknowledged; he may have experienced persistent or recurring paranoid thoughts or emotional dysregulation. - Withheld information: Details about previous episodes of mental health issues, treatment, or ongoing emotional struggles are likely omitted due to shame or stigma. - Amplified concerns: Current distress and fear may be slightly exaggerated under the influence of substances or anxiety but are credible. - Temporal distortions: The patient's history suggests some confusion or distortion of timeline; episodes might have been ongoing or more subtle before the current crisis.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on the analysis, the patient likely has a history of intermittent paranoia and emotional dysregulation that has been underreported. The recent episode appears as an acute psychotic reaction, probably exacerbated by methamphetamine use. The baseline mental health issues may involve chronic paranoia, mild emotional instability, and perhaps underlying anxiety disorders. The current distress is genuine but possibly amplified by substance effects and anxiety. The timing indicates a potential vulnerability to psychosis, with substances acting as a trigger.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: Ask about past episodes of paranoia or emotional distress, even if mild; inquire about the duration and frequency of paranoid thoughts; discuss previous mental health diagnoses and treatments; explore the patient's emotional baseline and coping patterns. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing confidentiality; normalize some common experiences to reduce shame; frame questions around everyday experiences (\"Have you ever noticed feeling paranoid or overly anxious during normal times?\") to encourage openness. - Priority order: Start by exploring past mental health history to understand baseline functioning, then address recent symptoms in context, followed by substance use patterns to evaluate their role. This sequence helps build trust and gathers comprehensive background for accurate clinical assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals a tendency to minimize prior mental health issues, such as paranoid thoughts, and to amplify current distress, likely influenced by substance effects or anxiety. His guarded and brief responses suggest reluctance to disclose full history, leading to potential underreporting of earlier episodes of paranoia or emotional instability. The recent presentation of vivid hallucinations and paranoid delusions appears severe, but these may be exacerbated by recent methamphetamine use, which can induce psychotic symptoms. Overall, objective facts point to a history of intermittent paranoia and emotional dysregulation that is possibly more chronic than the patient admits. There is a need to explore past mental health episodes, baseline functioning, and substance use patterns more thoroughly, as current reporting may not fully capture the severity or chronicity of underlying issues.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 28-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Acute psychotic episode characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and feelings of personal threat.  Present illness: The patient reports recent onset of visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there), auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), and paranoid delusions (believing others intend to hurt him). He describes feeling watched by others and unable to think clearly. These symptoms began approximately during a period of heavy methamphetamine use. While he states he has never experienced such symptoms before, he admits to occasional episodes of paranoia and feeling edgy in the past, though he describes these as infrequent and less intense. Current symptoms are likely intensified by recent substance use, but the underlying tendency toward paranoia and emotional dysregulation may be more persistent than he reports.  Associated symptoms: Anxiety, emotional agitation, difficulty concentrating. Confidence levels: hallucinations and delusions are observed, and these are credible given the recent context; prior paranoia and emotional instability are likely ongoing but underreported; the full extent of previous episodes remains uncertain.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Recent hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and description of intoxication with methamphetamine. - Medium confidence: The patient's history of past paranoia and emotional irregularities, likely more frequent or severe than reported. - Low confidence: The exact duration, frequency, and severity of prior episodes, due to guarded responses and possible withholding. - Missing information: Previous mental health diagnoses, treatment history, baseline emotional state, and detailed substance use history.\nANSWER: A 28-year-old male presents with an acute episode of psychosis characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions involving beliefs that others intend to harm him, and sensations of being watched. He reports that these symptoms began during a period of recent heavy methamphetamine use. The patient denies prior similar episodes, but he acknowledges occasional past feelings of paranoia and emotional disturbance, which he characterizes as infrequent and less intense. Given communication tendencies, these past experiences may have been more persistent or severe than he discloses. The current presentation appears significantly influenced by recent substance use, which is known to induce or exacerbate psychotic symptoms, but underlying tendencies toward paranoia and emotional dysregulation are possibly ongoing and underrecognized.

While open about drug use and symptoms, his responses lean toward emotional amplification, possibly overstating the crisis. - Bias detected: Amplification bias influences his report, making current symptoms seem more severe than might be objectively the case. There is also evidence of some mild minimization of pre-existing or past symptoms, but overall the focus is on current distress. - Confidence level: Medium; he is generally truthful but likely overstates severity due to emotional overstimulation, and some baseline symptoms may be underreported. - Reasoning: The language clues\u2014expressiveness and exaggeration\u2014combined with his narrative about sudden onset linked to drug use, suggest he is emotionally overwhelmed, leading to an amplified perception of his crisis. Vague descriptions and potential confusion also indicate possible some memory fuzziness or distress.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Past paranoia episodes or emotional vulnerabilities prior to this acute event, which might have been more chronic or frequent but are not emphasized; he describes them as brief or rare. - Withheld information: Possible longstanding mental health issues, prior mild psychosis, or family mental health history not fully disclosed; embarrassment or shame might inhibit full sharing. - Amplified concerns: The current fears of losing control and being in danger are likely exaggerated by high anxiety, possibly inflating the actual risk or severity. - Temporal distortions: The current crisis may overshadow a more protracted course of subtle or milder symptoms; he might not recall or choose to omit earlier episodes that contributed to current vulnerability.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette is that this patient has a history of occasional, possibly subtle paranoid and emotional disturbances, which may be underrecognized. His current episode is clearly precipitated by heavy methamphetamine use, resulting in acute psychosis characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and a sense of being watched or threatened. The severity of his current symptoms is significant but likely amplified by emotional distress. Some baseline vulnerabilities may have been present but are underreported, and his fears may be exaggerated by heightened anxiety. His cognition shows some confusion, possibly related to intoxication or psychosis, but no evidence of persistent cognitive deficits beyond distress.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how you felt before any drug use? Do you experience paranoid thoughts or emotional ups and downs when you're sober?\" to clarify baseline mental health. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic questioning to encourage honest disclosure of past symptoms, and normalize the idea that many people have occasional paranoia or emotional struggles. - Priority order: First explore prior mental health history and baseline functioning, then clarify the nature, duration, and frequency of past paranoid episodes, and finally assess current thoughts and feelings to determine if current symptoms are purely substance-induced or part of a chronic pattern.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication suggests emotional exaggeration regarding current severity, likely amplifying his reporting of hallucinations and paranoid delusions. His mention of no prior similar episodes infers that the current psychosis is recent and substance-triggered, but his acknowledgment of past paranoid feelings indicates possible baseline vulnerabilities that he underreports or perceives as minimal. The overall presentation includes clear evidence of visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and a sense of being watched, all associated with recent heavy methamphetamine use. Given the communication pattern, the severity of current symptoms may be overstated, and some baseline paranoid tendencies or emotional disturbances might be underreported. There is a possibility that earlier, subtle paranoid or mood symptoms exist but were not emphasized by the patient. Further history regarding past mental health issues, duration of paranoid or emotional symptoms, and baseline functioning is necessary.

He responds reactively, with tendencies to minimize past symptoms and amplify present ones, especially under distress. His language indicates difficulty articulating concrete experiences, and there\u2019s evidence of cognitive disorganization. - Bias detected: The main bias involves exaggerating current symptom severity while minimizing historical paranoid or psychotic episodes. There is also possible withholding of mild past symptoms, influenced by shame or denial, and some temporal distortion in his recollection of symptom progression. - Confidence level: Medium. I am fairly certain of the bias toward overstatement of current symptoms and minimization of past symptoms, but some uncertainties remain regarding the full scope of his baseline mental health. - Reasoning: The pattern of responses\u2014denying prior episodes, yet referencing early paranoid feelings\u2014along with emotional amplification during distress, supports this conclusion. His vague timelines and reactive answers further suggest bias in his reporting.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild paranoid beliefs and emotional disturbances that were present but perceived as insignificant or normal by the patient, possibly including subtle hallucinations or anxiety episodes. - Withheld information: Past paranoid or psychotic episodes when sober, which he chooses not to acknowledge fully, perhaps due to shame, stigma, or lack of insight. - Amplified concerns: His current fears of losing control and hallucinations are likely exaggerated by the acute distress and substance effects, making the episode seem more severe than his baseline state. - Temporal distortions: He may conflate or forget past episodes' severity and timing, underestimating their frequency and impact, leading to an incomplete historical picture.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Considering these biases, the patient probably has a background of mild paranoid tendencies and emotional instability that was previously unrecognized or dismissed. The current psychotic features\u2014visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions\u2014are acute and heavily precipitated by recent methamphetamine intoxication. His perception of severity is inflated by distress, and his recounting of past symptoms is limited, likely underreporting baseline paranoia. There may be a predisposition toward psychosis or an underlying schizotypal or paranoid personality trait that has been exacerbated by substance use. The timeline suggests gradual development of symptoms with recent episodes representing an escalation influenced by drugs and acute stressors, with some underlying vulnerability that is previously unacknowledged.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: - \"Have you experienced any paranoid feelings or hallucinations when you were not using drugs, even if they were mild or infrequent?\" (to uncover hidden baseline symptoms) - \"Can you recall any times in your life when you felt anxious, suspicious, or saw/heard things that others didn\u2019t?\" (to explore past emotional stability) - \"Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for mental health issues before?\" (to clarify psychiatric history) - \"How long after stopping drug use did your symptoms begin to improve or worsen?\" (to assess relation to substance use) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental questioning emphasizing curiosity rather than accusation, validating his distress to encourage honest sharing. - Priority order: Start with sober history questions to understand baseline mental state, then explore past experiences, and finally discuss current symptoms in detail. This sequence helps to build trust and gradually uncover hidden or minimized information.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication reveals emotional intensity and possible exaggeration of current symptoms, likely influenced by distress and substance effects. He minimizes prior paranoid or psychotic episodes, indicating a bias toward perceiving the current episode as entirely new and severe, potentially masking underlying vulnerabilities. His vague recounting of past paranoid feelings and emotional disturbances suggests he may have experienced mild or subclinical symptoms previously but did not recognize or disclose them fully. The timing indicates an acute psychotic episode precipitated by methamphetamine intoxication, with possible pre-existing traits like paranoia or emotional dysregulation that are underreported. Recognizing communication biases is crucial to accurately assessing baseline mental health and guiding appropriate interventions.\nANSWER: OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 28-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Acute psychotic episode characterized by visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions, with an emphasis on feeling watched and threatened, likely triggered by recent methamphetamine use.  Present illness: The patient reports seeing and hearing things that aren't present and feeling paranoid, with beliefs that others are monitoring or intending harm toward him; these symptoms are described as new and worsening after heavy methamphetamine use. Although he denies previous similar episodes, he admits to occasional feelings of paranoia and emotional distress, which he reports as infrequent and mild, but these may be underreported. The timeline suggests that symptoms escalated following recent substance intoxication, with current psychotic features influenced heavily by recent drug use and emotional distress. There is a probable underlying tendency toward paranoid thinking and emotional instability that has been hidden or minimized, possibly present in a mild form prior to the current episode. Cognitive disorganization is observed, likely related to intoxication and psychosis.  Associated symptoms: Feelings of being in danger, misperceptions of others watching, with auditory and visual hallucinations confirmed during examination; confidence levels are moderate given potential underreporting of past symptoms.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Current psychotic symptoms are present and temporally related to recent methamphetamine use. - Medium confidence: The existence of underlying paranoid tendencies and emotional instability prior to substance use, based on patient history but possibly underestimated. - Low confidence: The full extent and severity of baseline psychiatric history, due to patient\u2019s minimization of past symptoms and possible biases. - Missing information: Detailed sober psychiatric history, previous mental health diagnoses, and the duration and progression of current symptoms.",
