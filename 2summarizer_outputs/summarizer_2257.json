    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: Well, I guess it's been a while, but lately, I just feel more all over the place with my hands and feet. They've been getting worse slowly, and I keep falling more than before, so I thought maybe I should check if there's something I should do about it.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how these symptoms have been affecting your daily activities and whether you've noticed any other changes in your thinking, mood, or other parts of your health?\\nPATIENT: Uh, yeah, it\u2019s been pretty tough. I mostly just feel kind of exhausted with everything, and sometimes I get really frustrated because I can\u2019t do things I used to do easily anymore. I also feel a bit down sometimes, like I\u2019m worried about falling or messing up at work, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s caused by my body or just feeling overwhelmed. Nothing else really stands out, I guess\u2014just all these weird feelings and the muscles feeling weaker and numb sometimes.\\nDOCTOR: Can you describe in more detail how these symptoms have changed over time and how they're affecting your daily life and your ability to do things you used to do?\\nPATIENT: Well, it's like, things that I used to do without thinking now feel harder, um, like gripping or holding small things. I\u2019ve started dropping stuff a lot more, and I get really tired and shaky sometimes. Walking has gotten a bit more unsteady, especially when I\u2019m tired or on uneven surfaces. It\u2019s frustrating because I can't do some of the little things I used to do easily anymore.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how these symptoms have impacted your daily life and how you've been coping with them so far?\\nPATIENT: It\u2019s been really hard sometimes, honestly. I feel like my hands and feet just don\u2019t do what they used to, especially when I try to do simple things like buttoning or walking steadily. I get really frustrated, and I\u2019ve fallen a few times, which makes me nervous. I guess I\u2019ve just been trying to push through it, but it\u2019s starting to bother me more and more.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any specific patterns in your symptoms, such as a distinct tremor, stiffness, or episodes of vision change? Additionally, do you experience any weakness or numbness that comes and goes or is persistent?\\nPATIENT: Well, I don\u2019t really get tremors or stiff feelings, and my vision stuff, if there is any, kind of just feels blurry sometimes but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s new or related. The weakness and numbness, it\u2019s always there, I think, but it\u2019s kind of the same most of the time, not really coming and going.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as difficulty with balance or coordination, light sensitivity, or any history of autoimmune conditions, recent infections, or gastrointestinal issues that could affect vitamin absorption?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I mean, I do feel kind of unsteady sometimes, like I might fall if I don\u2019t watch myself, but I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s everything or if I should be worried about other stuff. I haven\u2019t had any problems with my eyes or anything, and I don\u2019t remember ever being sick with anything recent.\\nDOCTOR: Can you describe your physical exam findings, specifically regarding muscle strength in your arms and legs, reflexes, and any signs of muscle wasting or spasticity?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think my arms and legs feel kind of weak, especially when I try to do things like grip or walk sometimes. My muscles look smaller in my legs, and I don\u2019t really have those reflex kicks back like before. There\u2019s also some muscle loss that I can see and feel. Spasticity? I\u2019m not sure what that is, but I don\u2019t really notice anything like tightness or stiffness that I\u2019d call spastic.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new numbness, tingling, or burning sensations that come and go, or has your sensory experience remained consistently the same since your symptoms started?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think... sometimes I feel a little more numb or tingly in certain spots, but I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019s worse or better. It kind of just stays kind of the same most of the time.\\nDOCTOR: Based on what we've discussed, would you feel comfortable proceeding with supportive care and regular follow-up to monitor your symptoms, or would you like to discuss potential therapies or referrals to specialists such as neurology or physical therapy to help manage your condition more effectively?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I\u2019d like to just keep it simple for now and see how things go. I\u2019m a bit nervous about all the visits and stuff, but maybe I should talk to someone who knows more about this? I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s best.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any increased muscle tone, spasticity, or brisk reflexes in addition to your weakness, which would suggest involvement of the upper motor neurons?\\nPATIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t really notice any stiff or tight feelings or that my reflexes are fast or anything, just the weakness and numbness I\u2019ve been feeling for a long time.",
