    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: I\u2019m 34, and I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve been bleeding a lot today, and it\u2019s really heavy, like I can\u2019t control it. I also don\u2019t feel right \u2014 I feel kind of tired and dizzy, and I\u2019ve had some nausea and headaches lately, but I didn\u2019t think much of it until now.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have been affecting your daily activities, and have you noticed anything else unusual or concerning?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess it\u2019s been pretty hard to do normal stuff, like I get tired really easily and sometimes I feel numb or weak, and I just don\u2019t feel like myself. Sometimes I get these really bad headaches, and I\u2019ve been feeling kind of sick and lost weight even though I haven\u2019t been trying. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s been changing fast and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s wrong.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your symptoms have changed over time and if you've noticed anything else unusual or concerning besides the heavy bleeding?\\nPATIENT: Well, at first, I just thought it was normal after having the baby, but then the bleeding got heavier and didn't stop. I've been feeling kinda sick and weak, and I keep getting headaches that won't go away. Sometimes I feel like I can't really focus or think clearly either. It's all been really overwhelming and scary.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me if you've noticed any fever, chills, foul-smelling discharge, or pain in your pelvis or lower abdomen? Also, have you experienced any other new or unusual symptoms that haven't been discussed yet?\\nPATIENT: No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any fever or chills, and I haven\u2019t noticed any smell or anything coming from down there. It\u2019s all just kind of a heavy feeling, and I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s pain or just discomfort. I\u2019ve been feeling really tired and kind of out of it, but I didn\u2019t think it was anything serious.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any abnormal bleeding or spotting since your delivery that hasn't been explained or has been unusually heavy?\\nPATIENT: Umm, yeah, I guess maybe I\u2019ve had some bleeding on and off, but it\u2019s been pretty irregular. It\u2019s been heavier than usual sometimes, I think, but I didn\u2019t really know what\u2019s normal anymore.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any unusual bruising, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool? Or any new or worsening joint pains or swellings?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really notice any bruises or bleeding gums or blood in my pee or stool, but sometimes I do get these weird, kind of sharp pains in my joints, and they kinda swell up, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s normal or not.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising on other parts of your body outside of your postpartum episodes\u2014and if so, how frequently do these occur?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I might have seen a few spots of bruising on my arms, like sometimes when I bump into things or I don't remember hitting myself, but it's not often. As for bleeding, only the heavy stuff I already told you about, never outside of that.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any new or increased episodes of bleeding, such as spontaneous bruising, bleeding into your joints, or bleeding after minor injuries, since your last visit?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I might have noticed a little more bleeding than usual, like sometimes it's on my clothes or I see spots, but I didn't really think much of it. I haven't had any big bruises or anything that hurts when I bleed, at least not that I remember.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new or worsening bleeding episodes, such as spontaneous bruising, bleeding into your joints, or bleeding after minor injuries, and how severe are these bleeding events?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I guess I\u2019ve noticed some bleeding that\u2019s kind of random, like after I bump myself or sometimes even without any reason. It\u2019s been a bit heavier than usual, and I get scared because it feels worse than before.\\nDOCTOR: Have you experienced any episodes of spontaneous bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or unexplained bruising, outside of your postpartum bleeding episodes, and if so, how often do these episodes occur?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I think I have noticed some bleeding sometimes when I brush my teeth or bump myself, but I don\u2019t really know how often. It\u2019s just here and there, I guess.",
