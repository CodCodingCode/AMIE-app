Just the cough and all that chest stuff, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any new or worsening symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, fever, or worsening cough that might indicate disease progression or superimposed infection?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I\u2019ve just felt a bit more out of breath sometimes, and I don\u2019t know, maybe my cough has gotten a little stronger or something? It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s worse, but I just feel more tired, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have you ever had any known exposure to someone with tuberculosis or traveled to areas where TB is common?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been around anyone with tuberculosis, and I haven\u2019t really traveled to any places I know are risky, I guess. I\u2019ve just been having this cough and all this weird stuff going on.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, fever, or a change in your cough that might suggest disease progression or superimposed infection?\\nPATIENT: Um, well, my cough has kind of stayed the same, but sometimes I feel a bit more tired and my chest feels heavier, especially at night. I haven't had a fever or anything, but I guess I just feel more anxious about it all.",
