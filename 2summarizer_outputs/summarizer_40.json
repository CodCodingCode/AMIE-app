Or maybe a little more? It\\u2019s kind of all blended together, but I\\u2019ve just been feeling more tired than usual and more out of breath when I do things, even mild stuff. It\\u2019s kind of gotten worse over time, I guess. I hadn\\u2019t really thought about the exact day or anything, just that it\\u2019s been a while now.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me how your symptoms have changed or varied from when they first started, and how severe they are now during daily activities?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, well, I guess my symptoms haven't exactly gone away, but they do change a little. I started feeling really tired, and sometimes I get short of breath just walking around. There are days when I feel okayish, but other times I feel really weak, and my heart kind of races, especially if I try to do anything more than sit. It\\u2019s been about two months now. I think sometimes it feels worse in the mornings, but then it gets a bit better later, I\\u2019m not sure. So, I guess it\\u2019s pretty constant, but it varies a bit.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Can you tell me how these symptoms are affecting your daily activities\\u2014are there things you used to do easily that you're now unable to do or find Difficult?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, well, I guess it\\u2019s kind of hard to do some things now that I used to do easily. Like, I get really tired just walking around or climbing stairs, and sometimes I feel like my heart races even if I\\u2019m just sitting or doing nothing much. I\\u2019ve been feeling pretty weak and sometimes dizzy, especially if I stand up quickly. It\\u2019s made some daily stuff harder, I guess. Like, I don\\u2019t really feel like going out or even doing chores because I get so tired or out of breath.
