It just came on all at once, out of nowhere, and it\\u2019s spreading up into my groin now. It\\u2019s like a tearing, burning feeling, and it\\u2019s not letting up. I\\u2019ve been sweating a lot and feeling sick, and my heart\\u2019s pounding pretty hard. I tried to walk but the pain just got worse. I\\u2019m really worried, is this serious? Am I going to be okay?\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates openly with vivid, emotional language, emphasizing the severity and suddenness of symptoms, likely driven by anxiety and fear. Their responses are detailed and expressive, aiming to convey urgency. - Bias detected: Emotional amplification bias, as symptoms are described with heightened emotional language and concern, possibly exaggerating true threat levels. - Confidence level: High regarding current symptoms being real; moderate regarding the potential for overestimation of severity. - Reasoning: The description aligns with an acute vascular issue (such as arterial occlusion), but the emotional tone suggests the patient\u2019s perception of threat is heightened by anxiety, potentially exaggerating the crisis.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Neurological deficits (weakness, numbness), systemic symptoms (dizziness, pallor), or prior similar episodes may be understated or unreported due to focus on current pain and fear. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment or stigma around medical history, past vascular issues, or lifestyle factors that could influence assessment. - Amplified concerns: The patient seems to overemphasize the danger\u2014possibly fearing limb loss or death\u2014driven by intense emotional response. - Timeline distortions: The rapid appearance of symptoms may be slightly overstated; some gradual progression might be underreported due to emotional distress magnifying the suddenness.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely indicates an acute vascular or neurological event, with symptoms including sudden-onset severe leg pain that possibly radiates or spreads, accompanied by systemic signs like sweating and nausea. The actual severity may be slightly less catastrophic than described, but the symptoms are genuine. Neurological deficits or additional systemic symptoms may be present but are not yet articulated, and emotional distress has amplified perceived danger. The timeline is consistent with an urgent vascular event, but emotional bias inflates perceived threat.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your leg or foot?\" \"Do you feel any tingling or pins-and-needles?\" \"Have you experienced any dizziness, fainting, or vision changes?\" \"Have you had similar episodes before or any vascular problems?\" \"Are there any skin changes like discoloration or warmth?\" These aim to uncover neurological deficits, prior history, or additional systemic signs. - Approach strategy: Use calm, empathetic language, validate their distress, and gently explore symptoms without dismissing their fears\u2014building trust and encouraging detailed responses. - Priority order: First, clarify neurological deficits and associated symptoms; second, inquire about prior episodes or medical history; third, assess for additional systemic signs; finally, explore emotional context to gauge anxiety levels.  ---  **Note:** This structured approach helps ensure key clinical details are uncovered while respecting the patient's emotional state, reducing bias impact, and guiding appropriate assessment and intervention.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s vivid, emotional, and urgent language suggests a high level of anxiety and potential exaggeration of severity, possibly leading to an overestimation of the threat posed by the symptoms. While the described symptoms are consistent with an acute vascular or neurological event, such as arterial ischemia, the emotional tone indicates that the patient might be perceiving the severity as greater than it is, or may be focusing heavily on the most alarming aspects. Additionally, the patient may be underreporting or not aware of other symptoms like weakness, numbness, or systemic signs such as pallor or skin changes, which could be relevant. The timeline indicates a sudden onset, which aligns with an acute event, but the emotional amplification suggests a need for careful, objective assessment. Evidence of systemic symptoms like sweating and nausea are likely accurate, but the subjective description of pain and concern may be amplified.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Sudden onset of severe, sharp pain in the leg, radiating upward toward the groin.  Present illness: The patient reports an abrupt onset of intense, tearing, and burning pain in the lower limb that has been worsening with activity. Associated systemic symptoms include sweating and nausea. The patient also reports a rapid heartbeat and has attempted to walk despite increasing pain. The timeline appears to be within minutes to hours. Due to emotional distress conveyed during the interview, the severity of symptoms may be overrepresented; objective assessment is needed to determine actual neurological deficits, circulation status, and potential tissue ischemia.  Associated symptoms: Patient does not report numbness, weakness, or loss of sensation at this stage; however, these symptoms may be underreported or not yet recognized by the patient. No mention of skin discoloration, warmth, or capillary findings was made. Further physical examination and systemic assessment are required.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Patient\u2019s report of sudden, severe leg pain, presence of systemic symptoms like sweating and nausea, and rapid symptom progression. - Medium confidence: The exact severity of the pain and the extent of neurological deficits due to emotional amplification and possible focus on distress. - Low confidence: Overall threat level and true extent of ischemia or neurological impairment, due to emotional bias and unreported symptoms. - Missing information: Neurological assessment findings, vascular examination results, prior medical history, presence of skin changes, and detailed systemic signs.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old male presents with an objectively sudden onset of intense, tearing, and burning pain localized to the lower extremity, extending toward the groin. He reports accompanying systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and an increased heart rate. Despite reports of worsening pain with activity and initial inability to walk, the degree of underlying tissue or neurological impairment needs to be confirmed through physical examination. Symptoms are consistent with an acute vascular or neurological event, but patient-reported severity and emotional focus may exaggerate perceived risk. Objective assessment is necessary to evaluate for neurological deficits, vascular compromise, and systemic signs to guide urgent management decisions.",

He reports accompanying systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and an increased heart rate. Despite reports of worsening pain with activity and initial inability to walk, the degree of underlying tissue or neurological impairment needs to be confirmed through physical examination. Symptoms are consistent with an acute vascular or neurological event, but patient-reported severity and emotional focus may exaggerate perceived risk. Objective assessment is necessary to evaluate for neurological deficits, vascular compromise, and systemic signs to guide urgent management decisions.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates very vividly about current symptoms, emphasizing severity and urgency, but shows hesitancy and minimal spontaneous disclosure about background, triggers, or previous episodes. His emotional descriptors indicate genuine distress but limited breadth suggests withholding of context. - Bias detected: Predominantly \"information withholder,\" driven by possible discomfort or privacy concerns, with an element of amplification of current symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014current symptom description appears accurate but background information is incomplete, affecting overall assessment certainty. - Reasoning: The vivid, urgent symptom descriptions reflect real distress, but the limited background sharing points to withholding, which limits understanding of chronicity and risk factors. The amplification may be rooted in anxiety or genuine concern rather than intentional exaggeration.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Chronic or previous mild episodes of similar pain or systemic symptoms may be underreported; the patient might downplay ongoing issues or previous health history. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment sharing emotional or psychological stressors, lifestyle factors, or detailed health history. Cultural norms or privacy concerns might inhibit full disclosure. - Amplified concerns: Current pain and systemic symptoms are amplified, possibly driven by anxiety about severity, which may not entirely reflect the objective severity but indicate genuine distress. - Temporal distortions: The patient's focus on recent onset without mention of prior similar episodes suggests possible omission of episodic patterns or slow progression in chronologically complex cases.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the actual clinical picture is likely an acute severe pain episode in a patient with underlying, possibly recurring, vascular or neurological issues that he may have experienced before but has not fully disclosed. His distress level is real, and systemic symptoms support urgency, but some background factors and previous episodes are probably understated. The current acute symptoms are credible but may be part of a broader chronic process that needs thorough exploration.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you experienced similar pain or symptoms before, even if they were milder? Can you tell me about any past episodes?\" (to uncover chronic or recurring issues) \"Do you have any ongoing health conditions, such as circulatory or nerve problems?\" (to assess underlying risk factors) \"Are there certain activities or events that make your symptoms better or worse?\" (to identify triggers) \"How do you usually handle health concerns? Is there anything you feel uncomfortable sharing?\" (to address withholding possible privacy concerns or emotional issues) - Approach strategy: Asking with empathy, emphasizing confidentiality, and normalizing mention of past health to reduce withholding. Use open-ended questions initially, then progressively more specific. - Priority order: Start with general health background to build rapport, then focus on detailed symptom timeline, previous similar episodes, and emotional well-being to gather comprehensive understanding.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient vividly describes sudden, severe leg pain with systemic symptoms, which suggests an urgent clinical scenario such as vascular or neurological pathology. However, his communication indicates a tendency to emphasize current distress and symptom severity, potentially amplifying his experience, while withholding broader context like previous episodes, chronic conditions, or triggers. This suggests that while the current symptoms are credible, they may be part of a recurring or underlying process that has not been fully disclosed. There is also a possibility that he underreports or minimizes prior mild episodes or ongoing health issues, which are important for a comprehensive assessment. The patient's focus on the recent onset and intensity of symptoms, coupled with minimal background information, warrants objective examination to clarify the nature and duration of his symptoms and evaluate for systemic or neurological deficits.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Sudden onset of severe leg pain with systemic symptoms, possibly indicative of an acute vascular or neurological event.  Present illness: The patient reports an abrupt, sharp, tearing, and burning pain localized to the lower extremity, extending towards the groin. He describes associated sweating, nausea, and a rapid heartbeat. He states that walking worsened the pain and reports a lack of relief with activity. Based on communication patterns, the severity may be amplified; background history, frequency, or prior similar episodes are not detailed, which limits full understanding of the chronicity or recurrence. The timeline suggests recent onset, but additional history is needed to confirm whether similar episodes have occurred previously and to assess for underlying chronic conditions.  Associated symptoms: Sweating, nausea, increased heart rate. The checks for neurological deficits or signs of systemic compromise through physical examination would provide further objective data; such examination is pending.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient's report of sudden, severe leg pain with systemic symptoms at presentation. - Medium confidence: The severity of symptoms might be exaggerated due to emotional distress. - Low confidence: Details about prior episodes, ongoing health conditions, or full symptom history are likely underreported or withheld. - Missing information: Complete medical history, prior similar episodes, physical examination findings, and assessments for neurological or vascular deficits.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old male presents with an acute onset of severe, sharp, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity extending toward the groin, accompanied by systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and tachycardia. He reports worsening pain with activity and an inability to walk, suggestive of a potentially urgent vascular or neurological process. Given communication patterns indicating symptom amplification and limited background disclosure, further examination and history are necessary to assess for underlying vascular compromise, neurological deficits, and prior similar episodes. Physical assessment and diagnostics are critical to guide appropriate management.",

Given communication patterns indicating symptom amplification and limited background disclosure, further examination and history are necessary to assess for underlying vascular compromise, neurological deficits, and prior similar episodes. Physical assessment and diagnostics are critical to guide appropriate management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates a vivid, emotionally charged account of a sudden severe pain, emphasizing its intensity and immediacy, but avoids elaborating on past medical history unless prompted. - Bias detected: Withholding bias most prominently influences reporting\u2014he may have experienced previous episodes or underlying health issues that he is hesitant to disclose\u2014likely due to anxiety or embarrassment. There is also some amplification of current symptoms driven by distress. - Confidence level: Medium; current symptom description is credible in severity but incomplete in historical context, which impacts accurate assessment. - Reasoning: His vivid current descriptions suggest genuine distress; however, his reluctance to share prior episodes indicates possible gaps in history that are not readily accessible through initial questioning.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: He might have had minor or intermittent symptoms previously that he considers insignificant, hence omits this information. - Withheld information: Past episodes of similar pain or related health issues, possibly minor or asymptomatic, are unlikely to be disclosed due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Amplified concerns: The current symptoms are emotionally amplified possibly due to anxiety, which can skew perception of severity. - Temporal distortions: He claims \"never felt this before,\" which may be accurate for the most severe episode but may overlook mild prior symptoms, leading to an underestimation of chronic or recurrent issues.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette suggests an acute, severe presentation consistent with a vascular or neurological emergency\u2014likely a thrombotic or embolic event given the sudden, sharp, tearing pain radiating to the groin, accompanied by systemic signs. It\u2019s probable that there are prior episodes of milder or unnoticed symptoms that the patient does not disclose, which could indicate an underlying predisposition to recurrent issues. The current report is credible regarding severity but incomplete regarding history, necessitating sensitive probing of past episodes and risk factors.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you ever experienced similar but milder pain before? If so, when and how often?\" to uncover possible recurrent episodes. - Ask about past health issues related to circulation, neurological symptoms, or other vascular risk factors, phrasing questions gently to reduce discomfort. - Approach strategy: Emphasize understanding the full picture to ensure the best care, reassuring the patient that past health details are important but non-judgmental, to encourage disclosure. - Priority order: First, confirm any history of similar or related symptoms, then explore other systemic or risk factors, and finally address emotional concerns to reduce anxiety and facilitate more open communication.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a vivid report of sudden, severe, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity radiating to the groin, accompanied by systemic signs such as sweating, nausea, and tachycardia. The communication style suggests heightened emotional distress, which may amplify perceived severity, but the patient explicitly states that this is his first experience of such pain, indicating no known prior episodes. However, the reluctance to disclose past medical history or previous similar symptoms suggests potential withholding bias, likely due to discomfort or embarrassment. The current symptoms are credible but may be more severe than the patient indicates, considering the systemic and neurological signs, and there is a possibility of underlying recurrent or unnoticed episodes. The emphasis on the sudden onset and systemic symptoms warrants urgent evaluation for vascular or neurological emergencies, such as arterial occlusion or disc herniation, though historical details are incomplete. More detailed probing regarding prior episodes, risk factors, and systemic health is necessary to fully assess the underlying etiology.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old male. Chief complaint: Acute onset of severe, sharp, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity extending toward the groin. Present illness: The patient reports this pain started suddenly and has worsened over time. Symptom description includes systemic manifestations such as sweating, nausea, and rapid heartbeat. The patient states he has never experienced similar pain before, though this could be an underreport due to discomfort or anxiety. - Well-established symptoms: Sudden, severe, sharp pain in the lower limb, radiating to the groin, associated systemic symptoms (sweating, tachycardia, nausea). - Likely minimized symptoms: Mild prior episodes of similar pain or systemic issues are probably underreported or unnoticed, given the absence of relevant history. - Possibly withheld symptoms: Past vascular or neurological episodes, underlying risk factors such as cardiovascular disease, are not disclosed, possibly due to discomfort or fear of judgment. - Timeline: Onset was immediate with rapid progression; current symptoms persist and are severe. The patient denies prior similar incidents.  Associated symptoms: Systemic signs including sweating, nausea, and tachycardia; no mention of leg numbness or weakness, though neurological deficits are not yet assessed with examination. CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The nature of the current symptoms (sudden, severe pain, systemic signs) and absence of prior similar episodes as stated. - Medium confidence: The severity may be amplified due to distress; the duration and exact progression are based on patient report. - Low confidence: Detailed past medical history, previous episodes, and risk factors remain unknown due to communication biases. - Missing information: Past vascular or neurological history, risk factors for thrombotic events, prior similar episodes, and detailed systemic health background.\nANSWER: A 62-year-old male presents with an acute onset of severe, sharp, tearing, and burning pain in the lower extremity extending toward the groin, accompanied by systemic symptoms including sweating, nausea, and tachycardia.

The current presentation suggests a possible vascular or neurological emergency, such as an arterial occlusion or nerve compression. Further assessment, including detailed history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostics, is necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide urgent management.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient describes severe, alarming pain with vivid descriptors and systemic symptoms, indicating genuine distress. He responds concisely and hedges about past symptoms, minimizing prior minor discomforts and suggesting unawareness or reluctance to disclose earlier episodes. His focus on the current pain's severity and vague recollections point to possible underreporting of a history that may include milder, warning symptoms. - Bias detected: Minimization bias, especially regarding prior episodes; he underreports minor past symptoms, possibly due to forgetfulness, lack of recognition, or perception of their insignificance. - Confidence level: Medium; current symptoms are reliably described, but historical detail is likely incomplete. - Reasoning: The language choices (\"nothing like this,\" \"can't really remember\") and responses suggest he may be unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge subtle prior signs. This bias affects understanding of the full clinical history and disease progression.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Mild discomforts like dull ache, numbness, tingling, or transient sensations in the leg or groin that he dismisses or forgets because they seemed minor. - Withheld information: Anxiety or shame about lacking prior awareness or fear that mentioning intermittent symptoms might imply negligence or worse, leading to underreporting. - Amplified concerns: No evidence of exaggeration here; his focus on the current situation is appropriate, though heightened by fear and severity. - Temporal distortions: The progression probably involved unrecognized mild warning signs before the current acute event, possibly over a longer period than he perceives.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Taking the minimization bias into account, the patient likely experienced intermittent, mild limb discomforts\u2014such as dull aches, numbness, or tingling\u2014that he considered trivial and thus did not report. The current presentation involves an acute, severe, and systemic event, possibly a vascular occlusion, with significant pain and distress. His unawareness or dismissal of prior minor episodes suggests the disease process could have been ongoing with insidious warning signs that went unnoticed. Recognizing this, the true progression probably involved earlier mild symptoms that escalated suddenly, emphasizing the need for thorough history-taking to identify potential underlying vascular or neurological pathology.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Have you ever experienced episodes of numbness, tingling, or a dull ache in your leg or groin, even if they went away quickly?\" (to uncover hidden mild symptoms) - \"Did you notice any changes in skin color, coldness, or swelling before the current pain?\" (to identify other subtle signs) - \"Have you had any episodes of weakness or tremors in the limb that you didn't think much of?\" (to detect unnoticed transient neurological symptoms) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language to reassure him that mild symptoms matter. Frame questions as part of understanding his health story rather than as criticisms. Emphasize that small sensations can sometimes be warning signs. - Priority order: Start with questions about mild, transient sensations to elicit any overlooked episodes, then probe for associated signs like color, temperature changes, or swelling. This approach helps uncover historical clues with minimal resistance.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's description of sudden, severe leg pain with systemic symptoms suggests a serious acute condition. However, his tendency to minimize prior minor sensations such as dull aches or transient numbness indicates potential underreporting of warning signs. His focus on the current distress may lead him to overlook or forget earlier, mild symptoms that could be relevant for diagnosis. The communication pattern reveals possible minimization bias, which means the actual disease process may have been progressing insidiously with unnoticed or unreported mild symptoms. Recognizing this bias is important, as earlier subtle signs might have been present and could influence management and prognosis. Therefore, the clinical vignette should present the objective facts with an understanding that likely, the severity and duration of symptoms are underestimated, and the patient may not be fully aware of or willing to disclose all prior episodes.

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient employs brief, factual responses, strongly denying any previous similar symptoms and minimizing minor sensations, indicating effort to control the narrative and potentially shield himself from concerns or shame. - Bias detected: Minimization bias is prominent; he underrepresents or forgets prior mild symptoms, possibly due to unawareness or deliberate downplaying. - Confidence level: Medium; while current severe pain is likely accurate, the history of prior episodes is probably incomplete or understated. - Reasoning: The pattern of denial and minimal responses suggests hesitance to acknowledge minor or past episodes, consistent with minimization bias, which can obscure true symptom history.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Transient numbness, tingling, or low-grade discomfort that he perceives as unimportant and thus does not report. - Withheld information: Past episodes of mild neurological signs or sensations that occurred before but were dismissed or unremembered. - Amplified concerns: He appears genuinely alarmed about the current pain, but his perception of its uniqueness is influenced by minimal prior history, which may be false. - Temporal distortions: Past minor symptoms are likely underreported or forgotten, giving an incomplete picture of symptom onset and progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should include: the current severe pain as described, likely representing a culmination of subtle, formerly unrecognized or unreported episodes of transient neurological sensations (numbness, tingling, minor discomfort). His history might omit minor episodes that occurred before, which could suggest a more chronic, intermittent underlying process that has recently worsened. The presentation may be less about an entirely new pathology and more about progression of slightly symptomatic episodes that were previously unnoticed or dismissed.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions: \"Have you ever noticed brief episodes of numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or groin, even if they went away quickly?\" and \"Did you ever experience sensations like dull achiness or a pulling feeling in your legs before?\" These target subtle prior episodes. - Approach strategy: Ask these questions gently, emphasizing that even minor or fleeting symptoms are important to ensure accurate diagnosis. Framing them as common and real experiences helps reduce embarrassment. - Priority order: First, inquire about mild sensations and brief neurological episodes to get a complete history\u2014building trust and encouraging openness\u2014then focus on the timeline and any changes over time, maintaining a supportive attitude to minimize defensiveness.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports a sudden, severe leg pain described as tearing and burning, accompanied by sweating and a rapid heartbeat. He denies prior similar episodes or neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling, which suggests a new, acute event. However, given his communication style\u2014brief responses, denial of minor sensations, and possible minimization\u2014the likelihood exists that he has experienced subtle, transient neurological symptoms in the past, such as brief numbness, tingling, or mild discomfort, that he perceives as unimportant or forgets. His current presentation appears to be a progression or escalation of previously unnoticed or unreported Symptoms. The lack of detailed past symptom history may lead to underestimation of underlying chronic or intermittent issues that could be relevant. Confidence in current reported symptoms is high, but information about prior episodes is probably incomplete or understated, requiring further probing.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 62-year-old male. Chief complaint: Sudden, severe leg pain with associated sweating and rapid heartbeat. Present illness: The patient reports experiencing an abrupt onset of intense, tearing, burning pain in the right leg, now spreading into the groin. He describes the pain as unrelenting and worsening with activity. He denies previous episodes of similar pain or neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, or discomfort in the legs or groin, although communication biases suggest that minor or transient sensations may have gone unrecognized or unreported. Current symptoms are notably severe and have led to concern about a serious underlying condition. The timeline indicates this is his first reported episode, but possibly an escalation of subtle, prior neurological symptoms that he either minimized or forgot. Associated symptoms include sweating and a racing heartbeat, with no reported history of prior comparable episodes or longstanding neurological issues.  Confidence assessment: High confidence in the accuracy of current, severe symptoms as reported. Medium confidence that the patient has experienced prior mild neurological sensations, which he minimizes or withholds. Low confidence in the completeness of his past symptom history due to communication pattern biases. Additional probing into past episodes of numbness, tingling, or mild discomfort is needed to clarify the full clinical picture.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
