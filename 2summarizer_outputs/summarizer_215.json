They\\u2019re rough, painful, and I\\u2019m scared they\\u2019re something serious.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Lisa communicates with emotionally vivid language, emphasizing distress and worst-case scenarios; she provides detailed but emotion-driven descriptions. - Bias detected: Amplification bias, with her overstatement of symptoms severity and health risks driven by anxiety. - Confidence level: Medium-High; her narrative is emotionally charged, which suggests bias, but physical descriptions seem accurate enough to warrant clinical verification. - Reasoning: The elaborate nature of her fear-related language indicates her perception is being magnified by anxiety, making her report less objective than it appears.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting minor physical signs such as small bumps that are asymptomatic or not bothersome to her. - Withheld information: She might be reluctant to mention less concerning skin changes or unrelated medical issues or recent benign skin patches. - Amplified concerns: Her fears about cancer and spreading may be exaggerated; actual danger might be lower than perceived. - Temporal distortions: The perceived rapid spreading might be an emotional interpretation, possibly not matching the actual progression timeline, which could be slower or more static.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette may look like: - She has multiple irregular, possibly inflammatory skin bumps distributed on her hands, elbows, and feet. - These lesions may have developed over weeks or months, with some evidence of spreading but not necessarily rapid. - Pain and rough texture are consistent, but systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise are not reported. - Her anxiety has led her to perceive the condition as more severe and threatening than it might be clinically; her fears of serious illness are disproportionate. - No signs of acute systemic illness or classic features of aggressive dermatologic conditions are evident on examination, but her concern warrants careful evaluation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you describe exactly how long you've had these bumps and how they've changed over time?\" (clarifies timeline; reduces perception bias) - \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, fatigue, or night sweats?\" (detect systemic involvement) - \"Can you tell me what the bumps look like \u2014 size, color, texture?\" (assists in objective assessment) - \"Have you noticed any triggers or things that make the bumps better or worse?\" (identifies potential benign causes) - \"Do you have any personal or family history of skin conditions or cancers?\" (specific risk assessment) - Approach strategy: - Use empathetic, reassuring language to validate her distress while gently guiding her towards more objective descriptions. - Frame questions with curiosity rather than suspicion, encouraging honesty. - Priority order: - First, gather detailed description and timeline to contextualize her perception. - Next, assess for systemic symptoms to evaluate severity. - Then, explore possible triggers or previous health history to inform differential diagnosis. - Lastly, subtly address her fears about serious disease, providing reassurance based on clinical findings.  This structured approach helps obtain accurate, comprehensive information, mitigating bias, and establishing trust.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's emotional language and emphasis on distress suggest a tendency toward amplification bias, potentially overstating the severity and rapidity of skin changes. Her report of widespread bumps on hands, elbows, and feet, described as rough and painful, is likely accurate; however, the intensity and perceived rapid spread may be exaggerated. She might be underreporting or withholding minor or less bothersome features, and her fears could influence her perception of the condition's progression. Objective signs are limited in the conversation, so physical examination would be necessary to confirm the extent, appearance, and nature of the lesions. There is no mention of systemic symptoms, but absence of such data leaves room for further inquiry. Confidence in the severity and timeline of symptoms should be moderated, with recognition that her anxiety may color her perceptions.\nANSWER: The patient is a female presenting with multiple irregular skin bumps located on her hands, elbows, and feet. These lesions are described as rough and painful. She reports that the bumps have been present for several weeks or months and perceive them as rapidly spreading; however, this timeline and progression may be influenced by her anxiety. There are no reported systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. The physical examination results are pending, but based on her description, the bumps suggest inflammatory or other dermatologic conditions. Given her distress, further objective assessment is essential to determine the actual nature and severity of the skin changes, while recognizing that her emotional focus may amplify her perception of the condition's urgency.",

It\\u2019s really bothering me because they\\u2019re itchy, painful, and now they\\u2019re everywhere, and I just don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on or if it\\u2019s something serious.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nThe patient is a female presenting with multiple irregular skin bumps located on her hands, elbows, and feet. These lesions are described as rough and painful. She reports that the bumps have been present for several weeks or months and perceive them as rapidly spreading; however, this timeline and progression may be influenced by her anxiety. There are no reported systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. The physical examination results are pending, but based on her description, the bumps suggest inflammatory or other dermatologic conditions. Given her distress, further objective assessment is essential to determine the actual nature and severity of the skin changes, while recognizing that her emotional focus may amplify her perception of the condition's urgency.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient articulates her symptoms with emotional intensity, emphasizing severity and spread while downplaying minor injuries. She shows concern about serious outcomes and describes her symptoms comprehensively but with bias influenced by anxiety. - Bias detected: Predominant health anxiety with exaggeration of risks (\"could I get cancer?\") and potential minimization of benign causes (household injuries). Her narrative suggests amplification of symptoms and fears. - Confidence level: Medium; her reporting is detailed and consistent but likely influenced by emotional distress. - Reasoning: Her language indicates anxiety-driven magnification of severity, but her description of physical sensations and timeline is generally reliable.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She might be underreporting minor but ongoing skin issues or triggers, considering them insignificant (\"minor cuts\"). May also be minimizing her emotional distress or underlying anxiety. - Withheld information: She could be hesitant to disclose feelings of embarrassment, shame about skin appearance, or emotional vulnerability that might reveal deeper concerns. - Amplified concerns: She is possibly exaggerating the seriousness of her skin lesions, especially the risk of cancer, influenced by her anxiety. - Temporal distortions: She perceives rapid progression (\"keeps spreading\") which might actually be more gradual; emotional distress distorts her sense of time and change.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased view suggests a dermatologic condition such as eczema, psoriasis, or dermatitis, presenting as widespread, rough, and painful bumps, likely stable over weeks to months rather than rapidly spreading. The initial minor injuries were benign and common. Her fears about severe illness are understandable emotional reactions but probably exaggerated. Her description does not suggest systemic illness or severe infection at this point.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about how the skin lesions looked when you first noticed them and how they've changed over time?\" (assess timeline accuracy) - \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, fatigue, or malaise?\" (detect systemic signs) - \"How do these skin issues affect your daily activities and mood?\" (understand emotional impact) - \"Have you noticed any triggers, such as new soaps, detergents, foods, stress, or allergies?\" (identify potential causes) - \"Do you feel anxious or worried about your health in general?\" (assess underlying anxiety) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, validating language to encourage honest sharing; normalize common skin issues to reduce shame; explore emotional factors separately to uncover underlying anxiety. - Priority order: Focus first on factual details about the skin changes, then explore emotional concerns; this sequence helps clarify physical issues and emotional overlays effectively.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient reports numerous skin bumps over her hands, elbows, and feet, describing them as rough, painful, and spreading over weeks to months. Her emphasis on rapid progression, widespread distribution, and severity appears amplified due to her anxious communication style; she may also be minimizing minor injuries or prior skin issues, considering them insignificant. The narrative suggests her perceived acuteness might be exaggerated, and her fears\u2014such as potential cancer\u2014are likely influenced by anxiety. Objective assessment should consider these biases, recognizing that the actual physical findings may be more stable or less severe, and symptoms such as systemic illness are unlikely given her report and absence of systemic symptoms. Further detailed physical examination and objective data are essential to clarify lesion characteristics and rule out inflammatory dermatologic conditions like eczema or psoriasis, which typically present as rough, scaly, sometimes painful plaques. Her emotional distress warrants sensitive inquiry, but her current description probably overstates urgency and severity.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female.  Chief complaint: Widespread skin bumps on hands, elbows, and feet, perceived as rapidly spreading, rough, and painful.  Present illness: Multiple irregular, rough, painful skin lesions have been present for several weeks to months. The patient describes an initial appearance of small bumps that have increased in size and number, with some lesions bleeding when scratched. She reports no associated systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise. She notes minor cuts from household chores but does not identify recent injuries directly causing the bumps. The perceived rapid spread is likely an exaggeration influenced by anxiety.  Associated symptoms: Itching, pain. No systemic symptoms reported; confidence level moderate due to emotional influence.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The location and general description of the skin lesions, duration in weeks/months, absence of systemic symptoms. - Medium confidence: The actual severity and spreading rate of lesions, which may be overestimated by patient. - Low confidence: The extent of progression and emotional impact; these may be amplified by anxiety. - Missing information: Detailed physical examination findings, lesion morphology, presence of scaling, inflammation, precise timeline, and any systemic or other dermatologic symptoms.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses emotionally charged language, elaborate descriptions, and exaggeration to communicate her skin issues. She appears highly anxious, with inconsistent emphasis on severity and extent, moving from minimization to amplification. - Bias detected: Amplification bias affecting her perception and reporting of symptoms, leading to overestimation of severity and spread. - Confidence level: Medium; emotional distress influences her portrayal, but factual details are reasonably consistent. - Reasoning: Her language choices\u2014superlatives and emotional descriptors\u2014indicate emotional amplification. The initial description of small bumps transitioned to a focus on widespread severity, consistent with amplification bias. Her responses suggest some withholding of minor details until specifically prompted.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may have underreported minor skin issues or benign conditions earlier, or understated her initial injury severity, focusing instead on current distress. - Withheld information: Possible reluctance to disclose embarrassment-related concerns like cosmetic appearance or past benign skin states; she might be avoiding admitting less severe causes. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of serious disease (like cancer) and rapid spread are likely exaggerated due to her high anxiety level. - Temporal distortions: She might be overemphasizing the speed of spread and progression, potentially exaggerating the timeline or severity of symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the true clinical picture is probably that she experienced minor, localized skin bumps two months ago, likely benign and related to minor trauma or irritations, which have gradually become more noticeable due to her emotional focus. The rapidity and extent of spread are probably slight overestimations caused by her anxiety. Her pain and itchiness are genuine but may be less severe than perceived. Her overall concern about serious illness is understandable but likely disproportionate, driven by heightened emotional upset.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me if you've noticed any other changes, like the color or texture of your skin before it started spreading?\" \"Have you experienced similar skin issues in the past that resolved on their own?\" \"Are there any areas that aren\u2019t as bad or any that you think are less severe but didn't mention?\" \"Do any of your family members have skin conditions?\" \"Have you seen or tried any treatments so far?\" - Approach strategy: Ask these questions with gentle reassurance, emphasizing curiosity rather than judgment, to reduce anxiety and encourage honest disclosure. For example, \"Many people notice minor skin changes; I just want to understand all details to give you the best advice.\" - Priority order: Start by exploring her past skin health and injury history to establish baseline, then clarify current symptoms and spread, followed by her emotional concerns. This sequence helps establish context, reduce anxiety, and gather critical missing details systematically.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication indicates emotional amplification and possible anxiety-driven exaggeration regarding the spread, size, and severity of her skin lesions. She emphasizes widespread involvement and associated discomfort, which could overstate the true extent of symptoms. Conversely, she may be minimizing or withholding details about any prior benign skin conditions or less severe symptoms, and her concern about a serious diagnosis might be disproportionate to her actual clinical findings. These biases suggest that while her symptoms\u2014such as rough, grainy, flesh-colored or pink bumps that bleed upon scratching and have progressively spread over two months\u2014are genuine, their severity and rapid progression are likely somewhat overrepresented. A more detailed history of previous skin issues, trauma, or irritations, and current examination are necessary to accurately delineate the clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Unknown age and gender, based solely on presentation. Chief complaint: Widespread skin bumps on hands, elbows, knees, feet, and other locations, causing itching and pain. Present illness: The patient reports developing small skin bumps approximately two months ago that have progressively increased in number and size, now involving multiple areas including extremities. Lesions are described as rough, grainy, and flesh-colored or pink, with occasional bleeding upon scratching. The pattern of spread appears to be slow but perceived as rapid by the patient, possibly influenced by anxiety. She denies acute injury but mentions minor cuts from performing chores. No specific prior skin conditions or treatments are reported. Symptoms of itching and discomfort are noted, with heightened concern about possible serious underlying disease. Associated symptoms: No systemic or other dermatologic symptoms reported; presence of itching and occasional bleeding.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The description of the lesions\u2019 appearance, location, and duration. - Medium confidence: The extent of spread and severity, affected by bias toward amplification. - Low confidence: The actual pain and discomfort severity and the true timeline of progression. - Missing information: Past skin issues, specific injury history, familial skin conditions, prior treatments, and any other dermatological or systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: The clinical presentation involves multiple flesh-colored or pink, rough, grainy skin bumps located on the hands, elbows, knees, and feet, developing over approximately two months. Lesions have increased in number and size, with some bleeding following scratching. While the patient reports widespread and worsening skin involvement, communication biases suggest the actual progression may be more gradual and less extensive than described. Symptoms include itching and discomfort, but the overall severity appears somewhat exaggerated by the patient's anxiety. Further history and physical examination are needed to clarify the lesion characteristics, rule out common benign dermatoses, and assess for other associated features.",

Further history and physical examination are needed to clarify the lesion characteristics, rule out common benign dermatoses, and assess for other associated features.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, cautious terms, minimizing initial concerns and details, while expressing worry and distress through indirect language. - Bias detected: Primarily moderate minimization bias, as she downplays cause, extent, and severity of her skin lesions, likely to avoid judgment or due to discomfort. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her descriptions are consistent but lack depth, which limits full understanding. - Reasoning: The cautious language, hedging, and brief responses indicate she may be intentionally or unconsciously minimizing the true severity.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Actual pain severity, extent of spread, and possibly systemic discomfort are likely underestimated possibly because she feels embarrassed or anxious about admitting worse symptoms. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to admit to scratching injuries, poor skin care, or psychosocial stressors influencing her condition. - Amplified concerns: Her worry about serious disease like cancer is real and perhaps amplified by her anxiety but her description of lesion appearance and progression might be somewhat overemphasized. - Temporal distortions: The progression may be more rapid or widespread than she reports; she might understate early or less noticeable signs.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the clinical picture likely involves more extensive, possibly more painful and symptomatic dermatitis or skin condition that developed gradually over two months but might be more aggressive or widespread than described. There may be underlying factors like minor unnoticed injuries, persistent itching, or early signs of an inflammatory process. Her anxiety potentially heightens her perception of severity, so her concern about serious illnesses might be disproportionate to the actual findings, but the physical evidence still warrants thorough evaluation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me how painful or itchy these bumps have been on a scale of 1 to 10? Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or feeling unwell?\" (to assess systemic involvement). \"Have you noticed any other symptoms like swelling or pus?\" (to evaluate infection). \"Did any of the lesions look different initially or have any other skin changes?\" (to clarify progression). \"Are you scratching or picking at the bumps? Do you feel anxious or worried about your skin?\" (to understand emotional factors). - Approach strategy: Use a calm, empathetic tone to encourage open sharing, emphasizing non-judgment and support to reduce embarrassment. Normalize her worries, validate her distress, and gently explore areas she might be reluctant about. - Priority order: Start with pain and functional impact questions to gauge severity, then proceed with questions about systemic symptoms, cause, and emotional state\u2014this sequence helps build rapport first before delving into sensitive topics, ensuring comprehensive assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient describes a progressive onset of skin bumps over two months, involving multiple sites including hands, elbows, knees, and feet. She reports the bumps as rough, grainy, flesh-colored or pink, with some bleeding after scratching. However, her cautious and vague communication pattern suggests she may be minimizing the severity, extent, and symptoms such as pain and itching. She expresses significant distress and concern about the possibility of a serious condition, which may amplify perceived severity. There is a likelihood that the actual lesions are more widespread, larger, or more symptomatic than described, and that she may have overlooked or not disclosed additional symptoms such as systemic signs or secondary infection. Her reporting likely underestimates the severity, and further assessment is necessary to clarify lesion characteristics, extent, associated symptoms, and possible systemic involvement.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Widespread, increasingly numerous skin bumps on hands, elbows, knees, and feet.  Present illness: The patient reports that over the past two months, she has developed multiple rough, grainy, flesh-colored or pink skin bumps that are distributed bilaterally on the extremities, including the hands, elbows, knees, and feet. The lesions have enlarged in size and number during this period, with some bleeding following scratching episodes. She describes the bumps as causing itching and discomfort but minimizes their severity and the degree of spread, with communication patterns suggesting the actual presentation may be more extensive and symptomatic than reported. There is no mention of systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise; however, her concern about serious illness indicates psychological distress that may influence her perception. The timeline indicates a gradual progression, but due to possible under-reporting, the actual temporal course may involve a more rapid or widespread development.  Associated symptoms: Itching and localized pain are reported, though their severity may be underestimated; no systemic symptoms are conveyed, and signs of secondary infection or other dermatological features are not specified. Further examination is needed to evaluate for additional features like scaling, crusting, or signs of infection.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The location, nature, and duration of the skin lesions as described. - Medium confidence: The extent and severity of symptoms, given the patient's communication bias. - Low confidence: The actual spread, size, and associated symptom severity are likely underestimated. - Missing information: Precise description of lesion morphology, presence of systemic or secondary symptoms, impact on function, and any prior dermatological episodes or injury history.\nANSWER: The clinical presentation involves an adult female with a two-month history of multiple, rough, grainy skin bumps on the hands, elbows, knees, and feet.

The lesions are described as flesh-colored or pink, with some bleeding following scratching, and have progressively increased in size and number. The patient reports associated itching and discomfort but appears to minimize their severity and extent, suggesting the actual physical findings may be more extensive, symptomatic, and possibly more aggressive than reported. No systemic symptoms are currently noted, but psychological distress related to skin appearance and health concerns is present. Further examination is necessary to characterize the lesions, assess for secondary features, and determine the full extent of the dermatological condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient is highly engaged with her symptoms, providing detailed descriptions with emotional expressions. She emphasizes spreading and discomfort, suggesting health anxiety influencing her perception. Her responses are organized but emotionally charged, indicating anxious engagement rather than denial. - Bias detected: The primary bias is anxiety-driven amplification of symptoms and health fears, leading her to perceive her condition as more severe and widespread than it may be objectively. - Confidence level: Medium-high. Her consistency and detailed descriptions support her credibility, but her emotional involvement suggests her perception of severity may be somewhat exaggerated. - Reasoning: The detailed history and spontaneous elaboration point to generally accurate reporting, but her focus on spreading and discomfort likely amplifies her concern, characteristic of health anxiety.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be underreporting attempts at self-treatment, skin care routines, or relief measures, which could influence lesion progression or comfort. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment about the appearance or shame about seeking help early might be underreported; she appears openly expressive but might avoid admitting to frustrations or unsuccessful self-management. - Amplified concerns: Her fears of serious illness, especially passing conditions to children, are likely heightened by anxiety rather than clinical evidence, potentially overestimating danger. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears consistent, but her emotional focus might lead her to perceive rapid worsening, even if clinical progression is slower or more gradual.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture probably involves a skin condition with a two-month history of widespread, rough, grainy, and possibly scaly lesions that are increasing in size and number. The physical manifestations are likely moderate but perceived as severe due to her anxiety. She may be experiencing more itching, minor bleeding, or secondary changes that she has not fully reported. The progression is gradual but perceived as rapid by her emotional distress; her concern about spread could be partly exaggerated.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you tried any creams, lotions, or treatments? What has helped or not helped?\" (to assess self-treatment and actual symptom severity). \"Do you notice itching, pain, or other sensations besides discomfort? Have you seen any signs of infection or secondary changes?\" (to evaluate secondary complications). \"How are you coping emotionally with these changes? Do you have support or strategies to manage your worries?\" (to understand anxiety levels). \"Are there specific times or situations where the lesions worsen or improve?\" (to identify triggers). \"Have you had similar skin issues before?\" (to understand history). \"Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or systemic signs?\" (to screen for systemic illness).  - Approach strategy: Empathetically acknowledge her distress to build trust, then gently explore details to clarify the progression and severity, avoiding dismissiveness. Using open-ended but specific questions will help uncover less evident symptoms and emotional factors influencing her perception.  - Priority order: Start with her treatment attempts and associated symptoms to gauge actual severity; then explore emotional impact and coping; finally, clarify the progression timeline and any systemic symptoms. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of both physical and psychological aspects.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a vocal, emotionally charged description of widespread skin bumps that have reportedly appeared over two months, emphasizing spreading, roughness, and discomfort. Her detailed reporting and concern about severity suggest an anxiety-driven perception, possibly leading her to overestimate the extent and impact of her skin condition. However, her consistent account of the lesions' appearance\u2014flesh-colored or pink, rough, grainy, sometimes scaly\u2014supports the presence of a dermatological process that has progressed gradually. She also indicates that scratching worsens the lesions and that they have increased in size and number over time. She might be minimizing secondary symptoms such as itching intensity, bleeding, or secondary infections, and may be withholding information about self-treatment efforts or emotional stressors. Overall, her communication pattern suggests her perceived severity might be exaggerated, but the objective findings point toward a chronic, spreading skin condition requiring further assessment.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Widespread, rough, grainy skin bumps on hands, elbows, knees, and feet, with concern about their increasing spread and severity.  Present illness: Over the past two months, the patient has observed multiple skin bumps appearing on various extremities. The lesions are characterized as flesh-colored or pink, rough, and grainy in texture, with some scaly or flaky features. They have progressively increased in size and number, spreading from initial small lesions to extensive involvement across the hands, elbows, knees, and feet. She reports that scratching exacerbates bleeding and discomfort. She describes accompanying itching and discomfort but emphasizes the impact on her daily activities. Given her emotional distress, her perception of rapid progression and severity may be amplified; her actual clinical picture could include additional secondary features such as more significant itching, minor bleeding, or secondary dermatitis that she may not fully report. The timeline suggests a gradual onset with perceived rapid worsening possibly influenced by anxiety. No systemic symptoms are noted at this time.  Associated symptoms: Itching is present; bleeding occurs with scratching; other secondary skin changes (scaling, crusting) are probable but not definitively documented. No recent systemic symptoms such as fever or fatigue reported, though these could be underreported due to anxiety.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The description, distribution, and progression timeline of the skin lesions as reported by the patient. - Medium confidence: The severity and extent of secondary features like bleeding or secondary infection may be exaggerated due to anxiety-related bias. - Low confidence: The actual severity, presence of secondary infections, and precise histological features are uncertain without clinical examination or biopsy. - Missing information: Details about previous skin conditions, self-treatment, physical examination findings, and any systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: An adult female presents with a two-month history of widespread, rough, grainy skin bumps on the hands, elbows, knees, and feet. The lesions are described as flesh-colored or pink, with some flaky or scaly features, and have gradually increased in size and distribution over time. The patient reports that scratching worsens bleeding and discomfort, with associated itching. Her perception of rapid worsening and extensive spread may be influenced by anxiety, possibly leading to overestimation of severity. No systemic symptoms are currently reported, though secondary skin changes such as bleeding or crusting are likely present but not explicitly confirmed. Further examination and diagnostic tests are necessary to characterize the lesions and identify the underlying cause.",
