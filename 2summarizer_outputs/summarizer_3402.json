No confirmed loss of bladder or bowel control was reported, and it remains uncertain whether such episodes include these features. The child's overall presentation continues to suggest episodes involving altered consciousness or responsiveness.\n\nANSWER: The patient is a 6-year-old who reports feeling weird or \"funny\" sometimes, with associated headaches, fatigue, and difficulty moving properly. He experiences episodes lasting a little while, sometimes triggered or worsened by fatigue or upset, and sometimes relieved by resting or closing his eyes. During these episodes, he sometimes suddenly stops and stares, with rapid eye movements, or appears stiff and shaking, possibly unresponsive or not aware of his surroundings, and sometimes seems \"not there.\" The frequency of these episodes has increased, and they sometimes seem longer or different than before. He does not feel like himself during these episodes. There has been no confirmed loss of bladder or bowel control, but it is unclear if he has experienced this."

I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, but I don\u2019t feel good.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what you mean when you say you feel \"weird\" and describe how you\u2019ve been feeling overall, including anything else you've noticed or that bothers you?\\nPATIENT: I just feel kinda funny, like my body doesn\u2019t kind of work right, and sometimes everything feels all mixed up, even my head. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t really feel like myself.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel \"weird\"\u2014how long it lasts, what seems to trigger it, and if anything helps you feel better afterward?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes I feel all strange, like my head or body gets really funny, and it lasts a little while, but I don\u2019t know exactly how long. It can happen when I\u2019m tired or if I see something noisy, I think. Sometimes, resting or closing my eyes helps me feel a bit better, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me what happens when you feel \"weird\"\u2014like what do you notice, how long does it last, and what seems to make it better or worse?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes I feel kind of funny in my head or my tummy, and it lasts a little while, but I don't really know when it starts or stops. Sometimes I feel worse if I get really tired or upset, but I don't think anything makes it better. It just kinda happens and then goes away.\\nDOCTOR: Has anyone observed whether your child loses awareness, stops moving, or has any abnormal movements, like eye blinking or stiffening, during these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes he just suddenly stops what he\u2019s doing and kinda stares, and his eyes move really fast. Other times, he looks like he\u2019s stiff and shaking a little, but I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s aware of what\u2019s happening.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child ever lost control of his bladder or bowels during these episodes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t think so? I mean, I don\u2019t remember him doing that, but maybe I wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention during the seizures. It\u2019s all kind of blurry.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child ever been unresponsive or unaware of his surroundings during these episodes, or have others observed him not responding or seeming \"out of it\"?\\nPATIENT: Sometimes, he just kind of stops what he's doing and looks quiet, but I\u2019m not really sure if he\u2019s really aware of us or if he\u2019s just kind of not there. It\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s unresponsive or just tired.\\nDOCTOR: During these episodes, does your child ever seem completely unaware of what\u2019s happening around him, or does he respond normally?\\nPATIENT: Sometimes he just kind of stares into space and doesn\u2019t really seem to notice anything. Other times, he kind of reacts a little, but it\u2019s different. It\u2019s like he's not really there, I guess.\\nDOCTOR: Have your child's episodes been occurring more frequently or changing in how they look or feel over time?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, I think they happen more often now, and sometimes they seem longer or maybe different? I\u2019m not really sure, but I feel like they\u2019re happening more than before, and he seems to get more tired afterward.\\nDOCTOR: During these episodes, has your child sometimes been completely unaware of his surroundings, not responding, or seeming \"out of it,\" even if he's not visibly shaking or stiff?\\nPATIENT: Sometimes, during the episodes, he just... kind of zones out or doesn\u2019t really look like he\u2019s there, even if he\u2019s not moving or anything. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not really present, but I don\u2019t always know if he\u2019s aware of us.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed whether your child's episodes tend to happen more often after waking up or if they improve with certain medications or lifestyle changes?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess I haven\u2019t really noticed a pattern. Sometimes, it feels like they happen at random times, and I don\u2019t know if anything specific helps or makes them worse. I just try to keep everything normal, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.",
