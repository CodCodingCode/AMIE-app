Systemic symptoms remain absent, and sexual activity has been ongoing with no reported injury or significant change in condom use. These details confirm the initial suspicion of a Bartholin\u2019s cyst or abscess, with no new findings contradicting the prior clinical picture.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 35-year-old woman who noticed a lump in her genital area ten days ago. The lump is painful, especially when sitting or during intimacy, and has become larger, more tender, and more swollen. The discomfort has increased over time, and sitting or walking makes it worse. She reports no systemic symptoms such as fever or chills. She has had recent sexual activity with her boyfriend, with condom use possibly inconsistent. She has not experienced any skin ulceration, vesicles, discharge, or recurrent lesions. She has no history of similar lumps or infections in this area before."
