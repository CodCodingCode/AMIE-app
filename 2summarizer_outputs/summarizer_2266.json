    "input": "DOCTOR: What brings you in today?\\nPATIENT: My son is 2 years old and he\u2019s been not acting right lately. He\u2019s been really tired and sometimes he gets fevers that come and go. We\u2019re worried because he\u2019s been different than before and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your son's symptoms have been evolving\u2014has his energy level changed gradually or suddenly, and are there any other new or concerning symptoms you've noticed, like rashes, swelling, or difficulty eating or sleeping?\\nPATIENT: Um, his energy seems to get worse sometimes, like he\u2019s really tired and just wants to sleep all the time, but then he kinda perks up again for a little while. I don\u2019t think he has rashes or swelling, but he has been struggling more to eat sometimes and wakes up a lot at night. It\u2019s all kind of confusing for us.\\nDOCTOR: Can you tell me more about how your son's symptoms have been affecting his daily routines and behavior\u2014are there any patterns or new changes you've noticed recently?\\nPATIENT: Well, he's been kind of tired a lot and not playing like he used to, and sometimes he just seems really confused or upset for no clear reason. He's also been having more episodes where he seems to lose things or can\u2019t seem to focus, and it\u2019s been harder for him to do things he used to do easily.\\nDOCTOR: Have there been any recent changes in your child's environment, such as exposure to old paint, contaminated soil, or other sources of toxins like lead, or any recent accidents or incidents that might have involved environmental exposures?\\nPATIENT: No, I don\u2019t think so. We haven\u2019t seen him in anything like that or been around anything like old paint or soil. Nothing unusual like that recently.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son traveled recently or been exposed to anyone with contagious illnesses?\\nPATIENT: Um, not really, we haven't traveled anywhere recently, and he hasn\u2019t been around anyone who\u2019s sick that I know of, but I\u2019m not sure\u2026 it\u2019s been a lot of doctor visits lately, so maybe?\\nDOCTOR: Has your son received any recent vaccinations, and if so, can you tell me which ones and when they were administered?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think he got some shots a while ago, but I\u2019m not really sure which ones or exactly when. It was maybe a few months ago?\\nDOCTOR: Has your son had any recent infections or illnesses that you are aware of? Additionally, do you know if he has received any vaccinations in the past few months, and if so, which ones and when?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think he's had some fevers, like, a few times recently? I can't really remember exactly when. And about the shots\u2014he's had some, I guess, but I don't remember which ones recently. It was probably during his check-ups, but I don't know the dates.\\nDOCTOR: Can you confirm which vaccines your son received in the last few months, including the specific vaccines and the dates they were administered?\\nPATIENT: Um, I'm not really sure about the specific vaccines or the exact dates. I think he might have gotten a few shots, but I can't remember all of them or when exactly. Sorry, I don't have the details.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son exhibited any recent respiratory symptoms, rashes, or other signs of infection, or have you noticed any recent illnesses in your family members that might suggest a recent viral infection?\\nPATIENT: Uh, yes, he did have a little cough and stuffy nose a few days ago, but now it\u2019s better.

It kind of just happens sometimes when he\u2019s not feeling well.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son received any recent vaccinations, such as influenza, MMR, or other routine immunizations, and do you know when they were administered?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think he had some shots maybe a little while ago, but I\u2019m not really sure if it was recently or quite some time ago. It\u2019s all a bit blurry in my mind.",
