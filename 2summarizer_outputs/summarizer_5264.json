Specifically, when did he first start to babble or say meaningful words?\\nPATIENT: Uh, I think he started sitting up a little later than most. Crawling was kind of inconsistent, and he's just starting to walk now, so I guess that was around his second birthday? As for talking, he doesn't really babble much or say any words that make sense. It\u2019s like he\u2019s not hitting those words yet, and we\u2019re a bit worried about it.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son shown any recent loss or plateau in language, social skills, or motor abilities that were previously developing normally? If so, at what age did these changes occur?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think he was sort of okay with his talking and playing before, but then like, he stopped saying new words maybe a little while ago\u2014I'm not sure exactly when\u2014and he doesn't really try to play with other kids much anymore, just kind of repeats the same motions over and over.\\nDOCTOR: Would you say that your son's difficulty with talking, playing, or interacting with others has changed or worsened recently, or has it remained consistent since you first noticed concerns?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess... I think sometimes he seems a little more, I don't know, maybe more focused on his own little things, but it about the same as before. It's hard to tell if it's gotten worse or not.\\nDOCTOR: Has your son shown any recent loss, regression, or plateau in his language, social skills, or behaviors that he previously was developing normally?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell, but I think he\u2019s been kind of the same, maybe a little more quiet than before. I don\u2019t really notice him losing stuff or acting differently, but I\u2019m honestly not sure.",
    "output": "THINKING: The conversation did not introduce any new clinical details beyond what was previously summarized. All previously noted facts remain consistent, and no new concerns or changes were mentioned.  \nANSWER: The patient is concerned about her 3-year-old son who is not talking or playing with other children as expected. She observes that he hardly looks at her or other children when around them, tends to do his own thing like playing alone with toys or watching on the tablet, sometimes flaps his hands, and has recently started rocking back and forth more. He does not show interest in playing or talking despite her efforts, and he appears to be in his own world most of the time. He has routines, such as lining up toys and watching the same videos, which he gets upset if changed. He sometimes wakes up at night and does not sleep well. Eating is tricky\u2014he sometimes only wants certain foods and gets upset if they change. She is unsure about toileting difficulties but mentions he does not tell when he needs to go. Developmentally, he started sitting at a slightly later age, crawling inconsistently, and began walking around his second birthday. He does not babble much or say meaningful words. It is unclear if he has experienced recent loss or plateau in language, social skills, or motor abilities that were previously developing normally."
