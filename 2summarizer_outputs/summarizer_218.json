I first saw these purple patches on my thighs and arms about three weeks ago. They started out small, but now they seem to be getting bigger and more noticeable. Sometimes they feel sore or tender, and I also feel a little swelling in my leg. I\\u2019m worried because they\\u2019re spreading, and I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in a clear, factual, detailed, and organized manner, providing specific descriptions and a consistent timeline. They show openness and are not using exaggeration or minimization; their tone remains measured. - Bias detected: Minimal bias overall, with a slight \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 worry/proportional concern regarding symptom progression. - Confidence level: High, as responses are detailed and consistent. - Reasoning: Clear language, organized details, and lack of emotional distortion suggest honesty and reliability. The only bias is a mild concern driven by worry, which appears justified.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Symptoms such as systemic illness (fever, fatigue), pain severity, or signs of vascular compromise may be more significant than reported if emotional distress is unacknowledged. - Withheld information: The patient might be reluctant to share fears of serious conditions like clotting disorders or cancer or to admit feelings of fear or helplessness. - Amplified concerns: Their worry about spreading may reflect realistic concern, but their emotional reaction could be slightly more intense than expressed. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears accurate; no major distortion is apparent, though emotions related to progression may be understated.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette would likely describe persistent purple patches on thighs and arms, starting small three weeks ago with gradual enlargement, mild tenderness, and swelling, without systemic or severe symptoms. Emotional concern is present but proportionate; the physical findings suggest possible dermatological or vascular pathology. Emotional impact may be relevant but is not significantly distorted in their report.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: Invite the patient to describe any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or fatigue; inquire about the severity of soreness; probe for any episodes of bleeding, dizziness, or other unusual sensations. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic questioning to explore fears and emotional reactions, reinforcing safety to promote honest disclosure. Phrase questions to normalize concerns and invite elaboration. - Priority order: First, assess the physical progression and associated systemic symptoms; then, gently explore emotional impact and fears related to diagnosis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of both physical and psychological states.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a detailed description of purple patches on the thighs and arms that have been increasing in size over three weeks, with mild tenderness and swelling. Their communication suggests reliability and straightforwardness, indicating they are likely accurately reporting their symptoms. However, their concern about spread might be proportionate but could also reflect underlying anxiety; they may be minimizing systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or other signs of systemic illness, or withholding emotional distress or fears. The physical findings are mainly skin discoloration and localized swelling; systemic symptoms are unreported and need further probing. Given their organized reporting, the primary physical findings appear objective, though symptom severity could be underestimated.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 58-year-old biological male.  Chief complaint: Progressive purple patches on thighs and arms with associated swelling and tenderness.  Present illness: The patient reports a three-week history of purple skin patches that originated small and have enlarged over time. The patches are occasionally sore or tender. There is mild swelling in the legs. No mention of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, or bleeding episodes. The patient reports concern about spread but does not detail other associated systemic issues.  Associated symptoms: No reported systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, or bleeding tendencies, though these have not been explicitly asked about and may be minimized or withheld.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Physical description of skin discoloration, size and location of lesions, presence of tenderness, swelling. - Medium confidence: Exact severity and systemic symptoms, as these have not been thoroughly explored; patient\u2019s emotional state and fears are potentially understated. - Low confidence: Underlying systemic illness or systemic vascular pathology, due to lack of reported systemic features and possible withholding. - Missing information: Details about systemic symptoms, pain severity, episodes of bleeding or dizziness, laboratory or imaging findings, and emotional impact.\nANSWER: A 58-year-old male presents with a three-week history of progressive purple skin patches on the thighs and arms, initially small and enlarging over time, with associated mild tenderness and swelling in the legs. The patient reports no systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or fatigue but expresses concern about the spreading of skin discoloration. Physical examination reveals multiple, well-defined purple macules or patches on the affected areas, with mild swelling and tenderness noted on palpation. Further assessment is needed to evaluate for potential systemic involvement or vascular pathology, and additional inquiry into systemic symptoms and emotional impact should be conducted.",

The patient reports no systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or fatigue but expresses concern about the spreading of skin discoloration. Physical examination reveals multiple, well-defined purple macules or patches on the affected areas, with mild swelling and tenderness noted on palpation. Further assessment is needed to evaluate for potential systemic involvement or vascular pathology, and additional inquiry into systemic symptoms and emotional impact should be conducted.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides basic, clear descriptions of skin changes and progression, using cautious, mild language regarding pain and swelling, with minimal elaboration on emotional or subjective impact. His responses suggest guarded but cooperative communication. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias affecting perceived severity; evidence includes language like \"not much\" and \"a little\" regarding discomfort, which likely underrepresents true symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium; there is consistent questioning but no overt signs of withholding or exaggeration, yet the tendency to understate raises caution. - Reasoning: The combination of calm tone, vague descriptors, and concise answers indicates a tendency to underreport discomfort, possibly to manage worry or avoid over-dramatization.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Actual physical discomfort and extent of skin lesions may be more severe, possibly involving moderate pain or tenderness not fully acknowledged. - Withheld information: Emotional distress, impact on daily functioning, or systemic symptoms (like fatigue or malaise) may be underreported due to stoic tendencies or normalization. - Amplified concerns: The concern about spreading seems genuine, but the lack of detailed emotional expression suggests cautious worry rather than overwhelming fear. - Temporal distortions: Slight underestimation of progression speed or severity; he perceives the increase as mild but might be experiencing faster or more widespread worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves more significant physical symptoms\u2014possibly moderate soreness and wider skin involvement\u2014and potential systemic effects that the patient is not explicitly acknowledging. The progression over three weeks suggests active underlying pathology, and emotional impact may be understated due to cautious communication style. A thorough exploration of pain severity, functional impact, systemic symptoms, and emotional state is warranted.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me exactly how sore or tender the spots are now? Are they interfering with your daily activities or sleep?\" (to quantify discomfort) \"Have you noticed any other symptoms, like fever, fatigue, or feeling unwell?\" (to assess systemic involvement) \"How do these skin changes affect how you feel emotionally or in your daily life?\" (to explore emotional impact). - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-confrontational, open-ended questions emphasizing curiosity and reassurance. Frame questions to normalize findings (\"Many people find that skin issues can feel worse than they look\"), encouraging more detailed responses without judgment. - Priority order: First, quantify the physical symptoms to gauge severity; then, explore systemic and emotional impacts; finally, clarify any inconsistencies or areas of subtle underreporting. This allows building a comprehensive understanding while maintaining rapport.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits cautious, mild language when describing skin symptoms, which suggests potential underreporting of discomfort or severity. While he reports small, spreading purple patches with minor tenderness and swelling, these symptoms may be more pronounced than conveyed. His emotional tone and brief responses indicate a guarded communication style that might minimize symptom impact, thereby concealing true severity. Likely, physical discomfort and lesion extent could be worse than described, and systemic involvement or additional symptoms such as systemic malaise might not be fully disclosed. It is important to consider that the progression over three weeks suggests active pathology that might be more extensive or severe. More detailed inquiry into pain severity, functional impact, systemic symptoms, and emotional state is necessary for an accurate clinical picture.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 58-year-old male.  Chief complaint: Progressive purple skin patches on thighs and arms with associated swelling.  Present illness: - Well-established symptoms: Multiple purple macules or patches formed over approximately three weeks, increasing in size and number; mild tenderness noted on palpation; leg swelling present. - Likely minimized symptoms: The patient reports discomfort as minimal (\"not much\" pain, \"a little\" tenderness), but actual pain or tenderness may be more significant. - Possibly withheld symptoms: No explicit mention of systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or malaise, but these could be present and understated. - Timeline: Symptoms started about three weeks ago, with lesion size and number increasing over this period.  Associated symptoms: Mild leg swelling; no systemic symptoms reported, but systemic involvement cannot be excluded due to potential underreporting.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of purple skin patches, their progression over three weeks, and associated leg swelling. - Medium confidence: Severity of pain and tenderness, which may be understated. - Low confidence: Extent of systemic symptoms or additional unreported features. - Missing information: Detailed pain severity, systemic symptoms, emotional impact, and any other constitutional complaints.\nANSWER: A 58-year-old male presents with a three-week history of increasing purple skin patches on the thighs and arms, which have enlarged and become more noticeable over time. The patches are well-defined, and the patient reports mild tenderness and swelling of the legs. The patient characterizes discomfort as minor, but the true severity of soreness and systemic impact may be greater than reported. No systemic symptoms such as fever or fatigue are mentioned but cannot be ruled out. The progression suggests active underlying vascular or dermatologic pathology, warranting further assessment of skin lesion characteristics, systemic involvement, and emotional or functional impact.",

No systemic symptoms such as fever or fatigue are mentioned but cannot be ruled out. The progression suggests active underlying vascular or dermatologic pathology, warranting further assessment of skin lesion characteristics, systemic involvement, and emotional or functional impact.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates in vague, mild terms, minimizes symptoms, and responds succinctly with guarded responses, suggesting he's downplaying severity and withholding full emotional impact. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization bias is affecting reporting, with possible some guarded withholding of emotional distress and systemic symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium; the structural description of physical progression is likely accurate, but the subjective severity and emotional factors are probably understated. - Reasoning: Based on the cautious language, limited elaboration, and emphasis on spreading lesions while avoiding strong descriptors of pain or stress, indicating an effort to control the narrative and avoid vulnerability.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true pain level and systemic symptoms like fatigue or malaise may be more intense than reported. - Withheld information: Emotional worries, fears about diagnosis, and potentially significant distress are likely not fully shared. - Amplified concerns: He may be exaggerating the urgency of spreading lesions out of anxiety, but this remains on a conscious level. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears consistent, but he might understate the emotional or systemic impact within that period.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my analysis, the objective picture is that of a patient with active spreading skin lesions (likely vascular or dermatologic pathology), experiencing moderate to severe discomfort and systemic symptoms that are understated. The actual emotional impact is probably more substantial, with underlying anxiety about his health. The progression timeline is accurate but his personal distress may be underrecognized, posing a risk for delayed or insufficient intervention without further probing.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Can you tell me more about the kind of soreness you feel? Does it interfere with your daily activities or sleep?\" to gauge actual pain severity; \"Have you noticed if you feel tired, feverish, or generally unwell?\" to identify systemic symptoms; \"What are your biggest worries about these spots?\" to uncover emotional concerns. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental phrasing to encourage openness, such as \"Many people find these symptoms more bothersome than they sound\u2014can you tell me if there's anything else you're experiencing that you haven't mentioned?\" - Priority order: Start with physical symptom clarification to gauge true severity; then move to emotional impact to understand anxiety levels; finally, ask about systemic symptoms to assess urgency and need for urgent medical evaluation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication demonstrates a pattern of minimization and guarded responses. While he reports mild discomfort and moderate concern about spreading skin patches, his language suggests the actual severity may be greater, potentially involving significant discomfort or systemic symptoms that he is not fully expressing. The focus on lesion spread and appearance may overlook underlying pain intensity, systemic malaise, or emotional distress. Accordingly, objective facts such as lesion progression and mild tenderness are likely accurate, but subjective symptom severity and emotional impact are probably understated. Additional probing is needed to clarify true symptom burden and systemic involvement.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 58-year-old male  Chief complaint: Progressive purple skin patches over three weeks, with concern about spreading and appearance  Present illness: The patient reports noticing purple patches appearing on the thighs and arms about three weeks ago, initially small but enlarging and increasing in number over time. The patches are well-defined, with mild tenderness and swelling of the legs. He describes the discomfort as generally moderate but may be underreporting true pain levels. There is no mention of systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or malaise, though these cannot be ruled out, as he minimizes report of systemic illness.

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient provides concise, somewhat hedged descriptions of physical findings, avoiding emotional elaboration and using vague language indicators. His responses suggest cautious openness, with signs of mild understatement and hesitance when discussing emotional or daily impacts. - Bias detected: Moderate minimization and cautious reporting bias. He is balancing between honesty and an instinct to avoid alarm or embarrassment, leading to understated disclosures of emotional impact and possibly over-simplified descriptions of lesion severity. - Confidence level: Medium \u2014 physical details are consistent and likely accurate, but emotional and functional concerns are likely underreported due to communication hesitance. - Reasoning: The patient's use of hedging, brief responses, and limited elaboration on emotional effects supports the conclusion that he\u2019s downplaying or privately experiencing more distress than he admits.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: He may be experiencing significant emotional distress, anxiety about cancer, or functional discomfort that he is reluctant to voice explicitly. - Withheld information: Possible embarrassment about appearance or fear of bad news, leading to underreporting of fears or severity of impact. - Amplified concerns: He is genuinely worried about the spread and implications but may be masking the intensity of this anxiety with cautious language. - Temporal distortions: There might be understated urgency or progression rate, but overall timeline appears somewhat accurate; however, emotional impacts may be more intense than acknowledged.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: - Physical lesions: Likely larger, more numerous, and more inflamed or tender than explicitly described, with some characteristics (color, flatness, blanching) consistent but possibly more severe in reality. The lesions are progressively enlarging and spreading, with recent soreness, indicating active disease progression. - Emotional state: Underlying anxiety, fears of serious illness such as malignancy, potentially more intense than patient reports, with possible functional and quality-of-life interference that has not been fully disclosed. - Timeline: Lesions appear to be evolving steadily over at least a few days, with recent soreness and spreading suggestive of an active pathological process. - Psychological context: Limited social contact and possible reluctance to discuss emotional impact, meaning the patient's distress might be more profound.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about how these spots are affecting your daily routine or comfort?\" (to elicit functional and emotional impact) - \"Are you feeling worried about what these might be or what they could mean?\" (to explore fears and anxiety levels) - \"Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as new pain, fever, or bleeding?\" (to identify systemic or additional local issues) - \"How do you feel about the possibility of this being more serious, like a skin problem or something else?\" (to assess fears and understanding) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing understanding and support, reassuring the patient that it\u2019s okay to share fears and concerns, encouraging openness without pressure. - Priority order: First, explore emotional and functional impact, then clarify the physical progression and systemic symptoms, ending with gauge of fears and understanding to ensure comprehensive assessment.  # Short Answer",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with skin lesions described as purple patches on the thighs and arms that are progressively enlarging and spreading over a three-week period. He reports that some lesions are flat, purple, and occasionally pinkish with slight color or size changes; pressing on them causes mild blanching. He notes recent soreness and some swelling in the leg, with increased tenderness and discomfort, though he downplays emotional distress and overall impact on daily life. Communication patterns suggest the patient is cautious, with hedged descriptions and limited elaboration, indicating possible underreporting of severity, emotional concern, and functional impairment. He may be experiencing more extensive or active disease than acknowledged. Systemic symptoms appear minimal\u2014no bleeding, fever, or significant fatigue reported\u2014but patient fatigue may be underestimated. Overall, physical findings imply active skin changes that merit further investigation, but emotional and systemic symptoms are likely underrecognized due to communication biases.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 58-year-old biologic male.  Chief complaint: Progressive spreading and enlarging purple skin patches.  Present illness: The patient reports a three-week history of purple, flat skin patches on the thighs and arms, with some pinkish areas, that have increased in size and number. The lesions are occasionally tender, and recent swelling and soreness in the leg have been noted. There is evidence of lesion blanching upon pressure, with slight color and size fluctuations. The patient reports mild discomfort and concern about the spreading nature of the patches but minimizes emotional distress and daily impact. He denies bleeding or systemic symptoms such as fever; fatigue is acknowledged but may be underappreciated.  Associated symptoms: No reported bleeding, systemic fever, or other systemic complaints; fatigue noted but potentially underestimated.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The physical description of skin lesions, their location, and progression timeline. - Medium confidence: The severity and emotional impact might be understated; the lesions may be more inflamed or tender than described. - Low confidence: Underlying systemic or systemic symptomatology, emotional state, and true extent of discomfort may be underestimated. - Missing information: Additional systemic symptoms, laboratory data, biopsy results, and detailed functional and emotional impact.\nANSWER: A 58-year-old male presents with a three-week history of progressively enlarging, flat, purple skin patches on the thighs and arms, some with pinkish areas. The lesions are increasing in size and number over time, with incidental soreness and recent swelling in the leg. Upon examination, the patches are blanchable with slight color and size variations, suggesting active dermatologic changes. The patient reports minimal systemic symptoms apart from fatigue, which may be underestimated. He denies bleeding or systemic illness. Physical findings indicate active skin lesions with progression consistent with a potentially inflammatory or vascular process, warranting further diagnostic evaluation.",

The lesions are increasing in size and number over time, with incidental soreness and recent swelling in the leg. Upon examination, the patches are blanchable with slight color and size variations, suggesting active dermatologic changes. The patient reports minimal systemic symptoms apart from fatigue, which may be underestimated. He denies bleeding or systemic illness. Physical findings indicate active skin lesions with progression consistent with a potentially inflammatory or vascular process, warranting further diagnostic evaluation.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with vague, softened language, tends to minimize symptoms, and answers cautiously, with limited elaboration unless prompted. The responses reflect concern but are tempered with softening words, indicating efforts to avoid alarm or disclose only what is comfortable. - Bias detected: The main biases are minimization and cautious disclosure, possibly compounded by anxiety. There's also some indication of amplification regarding fears of serious illness, influenced by worry about spreading and cancer. - Confidence level: Medium. The pattern of softening and withholding suggests that some critical symptom severity or systemic signs may be underreported, but the patient\u2019s honesty about general concern indicates reliability in overall intent. - Reasoning: This judgment is based on the consistent softening language, hesitance to elaborate, and guarded responses, which are common indicators of minimization bias. The concern about spreading and seriousness suggests anxiety-driven overthinking, adding some amplification bias.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: The true severity of skin lesions is likely greater\u2014larger, perhaps more tender, possibly more inflamed or ulcerated than they acknowledge. Systemic symptoms like fatigue or swelling could be more intense, yet they are understated. - Withheld information: The patient may be hesitant to disclose intense pain, bleeding episodes, or psychological distress, possibly due to embarrassment, fear, or not recognizing these as significant. - Amplified concerns: Worries about malignancy or systemic spread are probably exaggerated in the patient\u2019s mind because of anxiety. They might be overestimating the threat beyond what clinical signs show. - Temporal distortions: The progression may be faster or more aggressive than described; the patient might underestimate the speed of changes or early signs of systemic decline, either because they lack awareness or wish to avoid alarming detail.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette should probably include: - Lesions that are larger, more tender, and possibly more numerous than reported, with more prominent systemic signs such as swelling or fatigue, suggesting that the softening language underrepresents their severity. - The progression may be more rapid or extensive, with early systemic involvement that the patient minimizes. - Anxiety-driven exaggeration about potential malignancy or systemic spread indicates the importance of objective assessment rather than relying solely on patient reports. - Overall, the clinical picture could be more severe, or at least more complex, than the patient\u2019s cautious and minimized descriptions imply.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me exactly how big the lesions are now and if they\u2019ve become more tender or painful over time?\" (to clarify lesion severity) - \"Have you noticed any bleeding, bruising, or sores that don\u2019t heal?\" (to uncover possible systemic signs) - \"Are you feeling more tired or noticing swelling or other symptoms in your legs or elsewhere?\" (to gauge systemic impact) - \"Do you have any other symptoms, like fever, weight loss, or night sweats?\" (to assess systemic illness) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental questions, reassure the patient that it\u2019s safe to tell the full truth, and normalize discussing fears about serious illness to reduce anxiety-driven bias. - Priority order: First, clarify physical symptoms with specific, concrete questions, then explore emotional impact and fears about serious illness. Addressing physical severity early helps calibrate clinical assessment, while understanding emotional concerns guides rapport and further probing.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's cautious and minimized communication patterns suggest that the reported skin lesions and systemic symptoms may be less severe or less extensive than they truly are. The patient appears hesitant to elaborate fully and may be underreporting pain, tenderness, or systemic signs like swelling and fatigue. Their concern about spreading and seriousness indicates anxiety or fear-driven amplification, which could lead them to overestimate risks or exaggerate symptoms mentally. Conversely, their softening language and brevity imply the actual physical findings might be more prominent \u2014 larger, more tender, potentially more inflamed, or systemic symptoms more intense. Therefore, objective assessment needs to consider that the actual lesion severity and associated systemic features may be underestimated by the patient. Additional data from physical examination and targeted questioning will be essential to clarify true lesion characteristics and systemic involvement.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: 58-year-old biological male.  Chief complaint: Progressive appearance and spreading of purple skin patches over three weeks.  Present illness: The patient reports initial small, purple, flat patches on the thighs and arms that have increased in size and number over time. Some patches are pinkish and have changed in color or size. Upon pressing, lesions blanch partially, turning lighter but not completely white. The patches are sometimes tender or sore with gentle pressure. The patient also reports occasional swelling in the legs and overall fatigue, but minimizes their severity. No bleeding or bruising has been observed by the patient. The lesions' progression suggests increasing size and possibly inflammation; systemic involvement such as swelling and fatigue may be more pronounced than reported. The patient appears hesitant to disclose full extent of symptoms, and anxiety about the lesions' seriousness may influence his reporting.  Associated symptoms: Mild leg swelling, fatigue, tenderness in skin patches; systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, or night sweats have not been reported but may be underestimated or underdisclosed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The presence of purple skin patches on the thighs and arms, blanchability, and gentle tenderness. - Medium confidence: The actual size, tenderness, and extent of systemic symptoms, which may be more severe than reported. - Low confidence: Precise severity of systemic impact and full scope of lesion progression due to communication biases. - Missing information: Detailed physical examination findings, exact lesion measurements, laboratory or diagnostic test results, and comprehensive assessment of systemic symptoms and psychological impact.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
