The patient\u2019s symptoms of difficulty with speech, swallowing, and eye movements are progressively worsening, exacerbated by activity and alleviated by rest. The patient also reports getting tired easily, dropping things, feeling off when walking, and experiencing eye flickering more in the evening or after sustained focus. No definitive new autonomic symptoms like dry mouth or dry eyes were confirmed, but the patient reports feeling the need to urinate frequently and having some control issues, which may suggest autonomic involvement. Overall, the clinical picture points toward a slowly progressive neurological disorder affecting multiple domains, likely with ocular, bulbar, limb, and autonomic components.  \n\nANSWER: The patient reports feeling like they cannot swallow or speak properly anymore.
