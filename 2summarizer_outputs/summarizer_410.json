She responds concisely, perhaps to avoid judgment or shame, and her disclosures are selective.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is predominant, with some withholding tendencies. This bias leads her to understate the severity, chronicity, and impact of her symptoms, potentially concealing more serious underlying issues.\n- Confidence level: Medium; while the patterns strongly suggest minimization and withholding, some details remain uncertain due to her vague disclosures and limited history.\n- Reasoning: Her language choices, brief responses, and hesitations all point toward intentional or unconscious minimization of her symptoms, possibly influenced by shame related to substance use or mental health stigma. Her reluctance to elaborate on past episodes or detailed symptoms indicates underreporting, affecting the reliability of her self-report and highlighting the need for careful, sensitive probing.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n\"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling over the past few weeks or months? Have you experienced similar episodes before?\"\nRationale: To uncover possible chronicity or recurrence and gather more context about her mental health history.\n- Approach strategy:\nUse open-ended, nonjudgmental questions that normalize her experiences, such as \"Many people go through similar feelings; would you feel comfortable sharing more about your past experiences?\"\nRationale: To reduce shame and encourage full disclosure.\n- Priority order:\nFirst, explore her mental health history and past episodes to obtain a comprehensive picture, followed by detailed inquiry into her substance use patterns, as these factors are critical for understanding the etiology and severity of her current symptoms.",

She reports increased cannabis consumption over the past week preceding symptom onset. The clinical description suggests acute panic symptoms potentially triggered by substance use, with a possibility of underlying anxiety or other mental health issues that have not been fully disclosed. Further history and assessment are necessary to clarify the severity, recurrence, and underlying factors influencing her current condition.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient presents with guarded, minimal responses, often disclaiming prior episodes and attributing current symptoms solely to recent cannabis use. She uses vague language (\"not that I remember\") and seems to minimize or avoid full disclosure.\n- Bias detected: Minimizaton bias, likely influenced by shame or discomfort regarding mental health history, leading her to underreport past panic episodes and possibly downplay her current symptom severity.\n- Confidence level: Medium; while her responses indicate bias, they also contain truthful elements, and her guardedness suggests that some level of underreporting exists.\n- Reasoning: The consistent use of disclaimers, brief responses, and attribution of symptoms exclusively to substance use point toward her minimizing her true history of panic or anxiety. This could hinder a full understanding of her baseline vulnerability.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you ever experienced similar feelings of panic or anxiety in the past, even if they were mild or infrequent?\" (to uncover undisclosed past episodes)\n- \"Can you describe any physical sensations or thoughts you recall during those times?\" (to get objective details)\n- \"Have you ever felt this way when you weren\u2019t using cannabis?\" (to assess for underlying anxiety independent of substances)\n- Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language, emphasizing that many people experience these feelings and that sharing full history helps tailor the best care. Normalize feelings of panic to reduce shame.\n- Priority order: First, explore past panic or anxiety episodes in a non-judgmental way; then, clarify her substance use history; finally, gently explore her emotional and physical experiences during episodes to build trust and gather fuller information.",

She responds concisely and avoids detailed elaboration, which suggests discomfort discussing broader mental health history or past episodes.\n- Bias detected: The prominent minimization bias affects her reporting, especially regarding her history of panic or anxiety episodes. She appears to understate or deny prior similar episodes, which could conceal underlying chronic issues.\n- Confidence level: Medium-high; based on the consistent minimal responses and denial, it is quite likely she has additional unreported history or underlying vulnerabilities.\n- Reasoning: Her language choices, evasiveness, and denial support the conclusion that she is actively or unconsciously minimizing her past experiences, possibly due to shame or stigma, leading to an incomplete clinical picture.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you ever felt anxious or panicked in situations where you weren\u2019t using substances, even if they didn't feel the same as now?\" (To uncover possible past episodes)\n- \"Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling in general, outside of these recent events?\" (To explore underlying anxiety traits)\n- \"Have you ever experienced similar sensations or feelings before this week, even if they seemed different or less intense?\" (To identify any unnoticed past episodes)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone to create a safe environment where she feels comfortable disclosing sensitive history.\n- Normalize her experiences by explaining that many people have had similar feelings before, which can help reduce shame and promote honesty.\n- Frame questions to emphasize that understanding her full history will help provide better support and treatment options.\n- Priority order:\n1. Ask about any past anxious or panic episodes outside of substance use to clarify her underlying mental health history.\n2. Explore her general feelings and stressors over time to detect possible chronic anxiety traits.\n3. Gently inquire about previous episodes that may have been minor or dismissed, to build a more complete timeline.\nThis approach aims to elicit more detailed information, counteract minimization, and uncover hidden vulnerabilities relevant to her mental health diagnosis and management.",

More detailed history focusing on past episodes outside of substance use is needed to clarify her mental health background.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient describes her episodes as entirely new and associates them solely with recent cannabis use, responding with brief, guarded answers that minimize prior issues. She avoids elaboration and uses vague language, indicating discomfort and possible shame.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is predominant; she underreports past episodes and downplays her overall susceptibility. This affects the completeness of her history and may obscure underlying chronic anxiety.\n- Confidence level: Medium. While clues point to minimization, some of her vague descriptions could also reflect genuine confusion or distress. However, her pattern of denial suggests a conscious or subconscious tendency to downplay her history.\n- Reasoning: The consistent denial of previous similar episodes, coupled with guarded responses and minimization language, indicates that she is likely concealing prior vulnerability. Her reluctance to admit past anxiety or panic experiences suggests these may be more frequent or severe than acknowledged, which has implications for diagnosis and treatment planning.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n*\"Have you ever experienced episodes of feeling really anxious or panicked that might have lasted for a while, even if you didn't think it was serious at the time?\"* (Rationale: To uncover previous less dramatic but similar episodes.)\n*\"Can you think back to times before your recent episodes\u2014any periods when you've felt a lot of stress or worry that might have affected you?\"* (Rationale: To assess for ongoing anxiety that wasn't recognized.)\n*\"Apart from these recent feelings, have you ever had trouble breathing, chest tightness, or feeling 'all over the place' that you didn\u2019t connect to substance use?\"* (Rationale: To identify somatic or cognitive symptoms that might be underreported.)\n*\"Are you embarrassed or uncomfortable discussing your mental health or past feelings?\"* (Rationale: To gauge shame or stigma barriers preventing full disclosure.)\n- Approach strategy:\nEmphasize a nonjudgmental, empathetic attitude to build trust, acknowledging that many people have experienced similar feelings and that discussing them is safe. Normalize the symptoms and reassure confidentiality to reduce shame. Use open-ended questions initially, then gently narrow to specific areas, encouraging more candid responses.\n- Priority order:\nStart with broad questions about past stress or anxiety to establish context; then proceed to specific symptoms like panic, breathing difficulties, or confusion. Ending with questions about feelings of embarrassment helps identify barriers to disclosure. This order helps uncover hidden history while fostering a safe environment for honest sharing.",

She reports these symptoms coinciding with recent increased cannabis use over the previous week. She states she has not experienced similar episodes before but exhibits guarded and brief communication, which suggests possible underreporting of prior panic or anxiety episodes that may have occurred previously but were not recognized or disclosed.

Due to her communication pattern, underlying anxiety disorders or past panic episodes could be present but are likely being underrecognized. Further detailed history is needed to clarify her mental health background and assess for hidden or unreported episodes of panic or anxiety.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient describes her current episode as unique (\"not that bad\" in the past, \"only now,\" \"really panicked\"), minimizing potential previous experiences and responding cautiously with vague language. Her responses suggest she is guarded about disclosing full information, possibly due to shame or stigma.\n- Bias detected: Minimization bias is prominent; she appears to underreport her past episodes of panic or anxiety, perhaps to avoid judgment or because she perceives her previous experiences as less serious.\n- Confidence level: Medium\u2014while her current distress appears genuine, her history is likely incomplete or understated.\n- Reasoning: Her repeated denial of past episodes and guarded language indicate she might have experienced similar episodes that she dismisses or forgets. The emotional intensity she now reports suggests a real crisis, but her history requires further probing to uncover potential underlying anxiety disorder or previous panic episodes.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Have you ever experienced similar feelings of panic or being overwhelmed before, even if they were milder or happened a long time ago?\" (to uncover previous episodes she might consider insignificant)\n- \"Can you tell me about any times in the past when you felt very anxious or scared, even if they didn't seem related to this situation?\" (to explore broader anxiety history)\n- \"Have you ever felt like you were going to lose control or have physical symptoms like chest tightness or sweating before?\" (to identify physical panic symptoms)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use gentle, nonjudgmental questioning emphasizing that many people have past experiences they might not readily recall or consider important; normalize these reactions to reduce shame.\n- Encourage her to reflect on past feelings without pressure, clarifying that she is not being judged.\n- Priority order:\n1. First explore her broader history of anxiety and panic, focusing on mild or unnoticed episodes (to get a fuller picture).\n2. Then, clarify details about the current episode, including physical sensations and emotional states.\nThis approach helps her feel safe to disclose more, while systematically uncovering possible hidden history affecting her overall mental health assessment.",

The current symptoms are described as intense and frightening, but her history may be incomplete due to minimization and reluctance to disclose past experiences.

The clinical picture indicates acute anxiety or panic episodes, with potential underlying disorder that warrants further exploration.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient speaks cautiously, minimizing past episodes by denying any prior similar experiences, while describing current symptoms with emotional intensity. Her responses are brief and guarded, and she admits to feeling embarrassed about her mental health concerns, indicating discomfort with full disclosure.\n- Bias detected: The primary bias affecting her reporting is minimization and embarrassment bias. She is likely understating her previous anxiety or panic episodes due to shame or a desire to present herself as not having experienced such issues before.\n- Confidence level: Medium. This deduction is supported by her inconsistent history and emotional expression, but some details may still be accurate; her current distress is genuine.\n- Reasoning: Her explicit statements deny prior episodes but conflict with her descriptions of feeling overwhelmed and losing control, suggesting she may not recognize or accept earlier mild symptoms. Her hesitation and admission of embarrassment further point to underreporting of past experiences.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you recall if you've ever had moments where you felt your heartbeat racing or felt extremely nervous, even if they didn\u2019t seem as intense as now?\" (to identify subtler past anxiety signs)\n- \"Have you ever felt nervous or worried about situations but didn't think it was a problem at the time?\" (to explore past worries not recognized as episodes)\n- \"Are there times you've felt anxious or upset but didn't tell anyone because you felt embarrassed about it?\" (to gauge concealed history)\n- \"Can you tell me more about what you were feeling or thinking before your last episode and if you notice any similar feelings in the past?\" (to clarify possible past episodes)\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use a gentle, nonjudgmental tone emphasizing curiosity rather than suspicion; normalize that many people experience anxiety sometimes.\n- Frame questions around broad, non-labeling experiences (\"times you've felt overwhelmed\") to reduce shame.\n- Priority order:\n- Start with general questions about past feelings of nervousness or stress to gather information about less severe or unnoticed episodes.\n- Follow with inquiries about feelings that might have been hidden or minimized due to embarrassment.\n- Then, clarify details about the recent episode for context.\nThis approach will help uncover potential earlier symptoms that she might be reluctant to disclose directly, providing a fuller understanding of her anxiety history.",

Like, I keep getting these sudden waves of panic and I can\\u2019t breathe properly sometimes, and everything feels kind of fuzzy and confusing. It all started yesterday after I used cannabis a lot this week, and it\\u2019s been like this since then.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: \\\"Can you tell me if you've experienced episodes like this before, or if this has ever happened even when you weren't using cannabis?\\\"\",\n  \"PATIENT: No, I don\\u2019t think so. It\\u2019s never been like this before, at least not that I remember. I just started feeling really weird after using that stuff a few days ago.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you ever experienced feelings of panic, fear, or confusion like this before, even when you weren\\u2019t using cannabis or any other substance?\",\n  \"PATIENT: No, I haven't really had this happen before, only now when I was using cannabis.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you ever had similar feelings of panic, fear, or confusion in the past before this recent episode, even if you weren\\u2019t using any substances or didn\\u2019t think they were related?\",\n  \"PATIENT: Um, no, I don\\u2019t think so.

It's really scary.\",\n  \"DOCTOR: Have you ever experienced similar episodes of panic, fear, or confusion in the past, even when you weren\\u2019t using cannabis or any other substances, or during times when you weren\\u2019t feeling upset or stressed?\",\n  \"PATIENT: No, I don\\u2019t think so.

Like, I get all shaky and stuff.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\nPatient demographics: 28-year-old woman.\nChief complaint: Recent onset of panic-like symptoms, including sudden waves of panic, breathlessness, and mental confusion, beginning within the past day, possibly related to recent substance use.\nPresent illness: The patient reports experiencing episodes characterized by sudden panic, difficulty breathing, and feeling fuzzy or confused, with an acute onset within the last 24 hours. She associates these symptoms with increased cannabis use over the preceding week. She denies prior episodes of similar symptoms but describes feeling overwhelmed and as if she might lose control, with sensations of panic and breathlessness, suggesting potential past episodes that she does not recognize or recall explicitly. The communication pattern indicates she may be minimizing or unaware of milder or past anxiety episodes that occurred without her fully acknowledging them. Her current symptoms appear intense and frightening, but her history likely includes less severe or unrecognized episodes of anxiety or panic that she is reluctant to disclose, possibly due to embarrassment or minimization bias. Further exploration of past anxiety symptoms, including subtler episodes such as rapid heartbeat or nervousness, is indicated to fully assess her mental health history.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS:\n- Pattern observed: The patient presents her current panic-like symptoms as acute and unprecedented, while her language and vague recall suggest she may be underreporting prior or less severe episodes. She exhibits discomfort in discussing past experiences, possibly due to shame or stigma, leading to minimization and denial patterns. Her response style indicates emotional distress coupled with guarded openness, hinting at unresolved feelings about her mental health history.\n- Bias detected: The primary biases are minimization and denial, affecting her reporting of past panic and anxiety episodes. She may also be amplifying her current distress to seek reassurance, but overall her history appears underrepresented.\n- Confidence level: Medium\n- Reasoning: The combination of her vague memory, minimizing language, emotional hesitations, and admission of embarrassment supports the conclusion that she is not fully aware of her past symptoms or choosing to withhold certain details. These biases impair a complete understanding of her mental health background.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me more about how you've felt during times when you weren't feeling stressed or overwhelmed? For example, have you ever experienced nervousness, rapid heartbeat, or feeling on edge even if it didn't seem serious at the time?\"\n- Rationale: To uncover milder or unnoticed symptoms that she perceives as insignificant.\n- \"Have you ever had episodes where you suddenly felt scared or anxious that you might not have considered panic at the time?\"\n- Rationale: To identify unrecognized panic episodes.\n- \"Are there times you felt anxious, worried, or physical sensations of discomfort that you didn't think were important or didn't mention earlier?\"\n- Rationale: To gently explore potentially concealed history.\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use empathetic language, normalize common anxiety experiences, and reassure confidentiality to reduce shame.\n- Frame questions in a non-judgmental, non-confrontational way, emphasizing the importance of understanding her full experience.\n- Priority order:\n- Begin with broad questions about any feelings of nervousness or physical sensations, to minimize defensiveness.\n- Follow with more specific inquiries about past episodes, emphasizing curiosity rather than diagnosis.\n- Aim to build rapport before discussing sensitive history to encourage honest disclosure.\n# Short Answer\n- Pattern observed: The patient minimizes her past symptoms by denying earlier episodes, despite describing similar sensations; her responses are brief, emotionally charged, and tinged with shame and embarrassment. She shows hesitance and vague recollections, suggesting omission or unawareness of milder or previous episodes. Her current distress appears amplified, possibly as a reaction to her emotional state, and her tone indicates discomfort in full disclosure.\n- Bias detected: Minimization and denial biases dominate, with potential amplification of current symptoms. These biases hinder accurate historical assessment and likely understate her ongoing, possibly recurrent anxiety.\n- Confidence level: Medium\n- Reasoning: Her inconsistent statements, emotional qualifiers, and admission of embarrassment support the conclusion that her history is underreported. She probably experiences earlier episodes but considers them less noteworthy, and her current intense symptoms may be the tip of a longer-standing issue she subconsciously minimizes.\nRECOMMENDED_PROBING:\n- Specific questions to ask:\n- \"Can you tell me about any feelings of nervousness, tightness, or rapid heartbeat you've experienced in the past, even if they weren't very intense?\" Rationale: To uncover milder, possibly unnoticed symptoms.\n- \"Have you ever had times when you felt anxious or worried but didn't think it was a big deal at the time?\" Rationale: To assess unacknowledged episodes.\n- \"Are there past times when you felt shaky, dizzy, or like you might lose control, even if they didn\u2019t last long or seem important?\" Rationale: To identify minor or subconscious symptoms she may have overlooked or dismissed.\n- Approach strategy:\n- Use gentle, validating language to create a safe space, normalizing these experiences to reduce shame.\n- Emphasize curiosity and understanding rather than labeling or diagnosing to encourage honest sharing.\n- Priority order:\n- Start with general questions about subtle physical sensations or worries.\n- Proceed to inquire about past episodes in a non-judgmental manner.\n- Reinforce confidentiality and support to facilitate openness.",
