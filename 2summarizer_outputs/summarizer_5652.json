    "output": "THINKING: The patient has now confirmed the duration (\"a few years\"), the nature of the movements (\"jerks in my hands and arms\"), and conditions that worsen their symptoms (\"when I\u2019m tired or stressed\"). He also reports associated symptoms of feeling \"a little shaky\" and occasional difficulty with fine motor tasks (\"miss small things like writing\"). These details expand on the description of his symptoms and their potential triggers.  \nANSWER: The patient is a 38-year-old man experiencing jerking movements in his hands and arms that have persisted for a few years. The jerks occur more frequently when he is tired or stressed. He also reports feeling somewhat shaky and occasionally missing small details like writing. He is concerned because the symptoms have been ongoing for some time and he does not understand what is causing them."
