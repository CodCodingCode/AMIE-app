Sometimes I feel like I\\u2019m not walking straight or I lose my balance.\"\n]\n\nPREVIOUS VIGNETTE:\n\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: Maria communicates clearly but with hesitations, brief responses, and understated language, indicating possible nervousness and mild minimization of her symptoms. - Bias detected: Mild minimization bias affecting her reporting of fatigue and physical changes, likely driven by discomfort and anxiety. - Confidence level: Medium-high, as her responses align with typical minimization behaviors and emotional reticence. - Reasoning: Her subtle hesitations, soft language, and brief answers suggest she may be underreporting the true severity of symptoms and emotional impact, even if she is not intentionally falsifying information.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: She may be experiencing greater fatigue, more noticeable physical changes, or functional difficulties that she is reluctant to fully disclose or acknowledge. - Withheld information: Possible emotional issues such as feelings of depression, anxiety, or shame regarding her appearance or health status\u2014she might feel uncomfortable sharing these feelings. - Amplified concerns: She appears genuinely worried, but her anxiety could cause her to focus on minor or ambiguous changes, potentially overestimating their significance. - Temporal distortions: She may not fully recall or may understate earlier or mild symptoms that preceded her current concerns, leading to a possibly incomplete understanding of her symptom progression.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a patient with ongoing, possibly more severe fatigue than reported, subtle but progressive physical changes affecting appearance and balance, with underlying emotional distress that she is hesitant to openly express. Her physical decline may have been gradual but more impactful on her daily functioning and mental health than her responses suggest, influenced by nervousness and a desire to downplay her difficulties.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me more about how your fatigue affects your daily activities or mood?\" (to reveal emotional impact) - \"Have you noticed any other changes in your mood, sleep, or social life?\" (to uncover hidden psychological symptoms) - \"When did you first notice these balance problems, and have they worsened over time?\" (to clarify progression) - \"Are there any activities you\u2019re avoiding because of how you feel?\" (to gauge functional impairment) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, empathetic language to create a safe space, reassure her that sharing worries is helpful, and normalize concerns to reduce anxiety about disclosure. - Priority order: Start with open-ended questions about daily life impacts, then explore emotional and social areas, followed by details about symptom timeline, ensuring trust and building rapport first.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication indicates possible underreporting of symptom severity and emotional distress. While she explicitly reports fatigue, facial changes, and balance issues, her hesitant and understated responses suggest these symptoms may be more significant than she conveys. She may be minimizing her fatigue, physical changes, and the impact on her daily functioning. Emotional factors such as worry or shame about physical appearance and health issues could lead her to withhold or downplay certain symptoms or psychological concerns. Therefore, the clinical picture should be adjusted to reflect potentially more severe fatigue, subtle but progressive physical changes, and underlying emotional distress, although these are not fully expressed. Additional probing is necessary to clarify the full scope of her symptoms and their impact.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unknown).  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue, noticeable facial changes, and balance difficulties.  Present illness: The patient reports feeling tired despite adequate sleep, and notes changes in facial features, specifically a more prominent nose and eyes. She also reports occasional gait instability and difficulty maintaining balance. Given her communication style, these symptoms may be underreported. The timeline of symptom onset and progression is unclear but appears to have developed gradually.  Associated symptoms: No other symptoms are explicitly reported; however, emotional distress related to physical appearance and health concerns is suspected but not openly expressed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: The patient\u2019s reporting of fatigue, facial changes, and balance issues. - Medium confidence: Severity and functional impact of these symptoms; possible underestimation. - Low confidence: The emotional and psychological aspects, and the true extent of physical deterioration. - Missing information: Detailed history of symptom progression, impact on daily life, psychological state, and complete physical examination findings necessary for definitive diagnosis.\nANSWER: The clinical presentation involves an adult female patient reporting persistent fatigue unrelieved by sleep, along with noticeable facial changes involving increased prominence of the nose and eyes, and intermittent balance difficulties. These symptoms may be more severe than reported, with a potential underlying emotional or psychological component influencing her communication. The onset appears gradual, but details regarding the progression and impact on daily functioning are incomplete. Further assessment is needed to fully characterize the severity of symptoms and associated psychological factors.",

These symptoms may be more severe than reported, with a potential underlying emotional or psychological component influencing her communication. The onset appears gradual, but details regarding the progression and impact on daily functioning are incomplete. Further assessment is needed to fully characterize the severity of symptoms and associated psychological factors.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient uses vague, hedging language and shows reluctance to fully describe her symptoms\u2019 severity, indicating cautiousness or discomfort. Her responses suggest she is minimizing her experiences, possibly due to anxiety, embarrassment, or difficulty with precise self-assessment. - Bias detected: Symptom minimization bias, with some evidence of withholding information but no clear amplification. - Confidence level: Medium\u2014her responses are consistent but indicate underreporting; without further probing, true severity remains uncertain. - Reasoning: The cautious, uncertain language coupled with modest descriptions and nervous cues suggest she may not be fully acknowledging the true extent of her fatigue and neurological changes, which could be more impactful than she indicates.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her fatigue and balance problems are probably more disabling, interfering significantly with her daily activities, but she doesn't express this fully. - Withheld information: She might be embarrassed or uncomfortable discussing physical appearance changes or emotional impact, leading to underdisclosure of associated concerns. - Amplified concerns: She does not appear to overstate worries; her tone remains reserved. - Temporal distortions: The timeline appears consistent but may be an underestimation; she possibly underrecognizes gradual worsening or additional symptoms developing over time.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture likely involves a patient experiencing substantial, potentially progressive fatigue resistant to sleep, significant facial changes (possibly indicating a hormonal or structural condition), and balance difficulties that impair her daily functioning more than she reports. These symptoms may be accompanied by emotional or psychological stressors, which she is hesitant to openly discuss. The gradual onset over a year suggests a chronic process, but actual severity might be underappreciated due to her cautious communication style.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: * \"Can you tell me more about how these symptoms affect your daily activities and your mood?\" (to assess impact) * \"Are you experiencing any other changes, such as memory issues, mood swings, or difficulty concentrating?\" (to uncover hidden neuropsychological symptoms) * \"On a scale from 1 to 10, how tired do you feel most days?\" (to quantify fatigue severity) * \"Have you noticed any other changes in your body or health that bother you?\" (to explore other possible symptoms) * \"Do you feel worried or uncomfortable talking about your appearance or your health?\" (to address possible emotional barriers) - Approach strategy: * Use gentle, non-judgmental curiosity, validating her feelings to encourage openness. * Frame questions around her concerns and daily life to reduce defensiveness. * Normalize her experiences to help her feel safe disclosing more detailed information. - Priority order: * First, assess functional impairment and emotional impact to understand her lived experience. * Then, clarify symptoms' severity with quantitative questions. * Follow with detailed exploration of other neurological or endocrine symptoms and psychosocial factors. This approach maximizes rapport and minimizes defensiveness, allowing more accurate assessment of her true clinical status.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s cautious and hesitant communication style suggests she may be underreporting the severity of her symptoms, particularly fatigue and neurological changes. Her vague language, use of hedging, and reluctance to specify how much her symptoms impair her daily life indicate the possibility of more significant functional impact and emotional concerns that she is not fully disclosing. While she reports persistent fatigue resistant to sleep, and facial changes perceived as increased prominence of the nose and eyes, these may be more pronounced clinically. Balance issues are described as intermittent wobbly sensations, but her actual neurological function could be more affected. The timeline appears gradual, yet she might not recognize or mention the full progression. Psychological factors, such as anxiety or embarrassment about appearance changes, could influence her reporting. Therefore, objective facts include persistent fatigue, facial changes, and balance difficulties, but these are likely underestimated in severity, with some symptoms possibly being concealed or minimized.\nANSWER: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified). The chief complaint involves persistent fatigue not relieved by sleep, noticeable facial changes characterized by increased prominence of the nose and eyes, and intermittent balance difficulties. The current presentation suggests these symptoms are ongoing for an unspecified period, potentially over several months to a year, with a gradual onset. Objective clinical facts include reports of fatigue resistant to rest, subjective perception of facial structural changes, and episodes of unsteadiness when walking. Communication patterns indicate the patient may be underreporting the extent of her impairments; the true severity of fatigue and neurological disturbance could be more significant. Additional symptoms such as cognitive changes, mood alterations, or other systemic signs were not explicitly discussed but may be present. Further detailed assessment is necessary to determine the full scope of symptoms and psychological factors impacting her reporting.",

Further detailed assessment is necessary to determine the full scope of symptoms and psychological factors impacting her reporting.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient is cautious, uses tentative language, and provides concise responses, indicating discomfort or uncertainty about her symptoms. She may be underreporting severity due to embarrassment or fear. - Bias detected: Mild emotional response bias with slight hesitancy, leading to potential underreporting of true symptom severity, especially regarding fatigue and neurological signs. - Confidence level: Medium; her communication suggests some underestimation but not outright denial. - Reasoning: Her hedging, nervous gestures, and guarded responses point toward mild emotional influence on reporting, which could mask the true extent of her impairment.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: Her fatigue and balance problems may be more debilitating than acknowledged, potentially impacting her daily activities more severely. - Withheld information: Emotional distress related to facial changes and possibly other neurological symptoms (cognitive issues, mood disturbances) may be concealed out of self-consciousness. - Amplified concerns: She exhibits worry about progression, which might be exaggerated due to anxiety, but the core concern about deterioration appears genuine. - Temporal distortions: The vague timeline suggests her symptoms are ongoing longer than she fully articulates\u2014possibly months or more\u2014with gradual worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased vignette likely involves a patient experiencing significant fatigue resistant to restful sleep, more pronounced than her tentative descriptions; notable facial changes (enlargement of nose and eyes) that might be impacting her self-esteem; and episodes of unsteadiness that could reflect underlying neurological impairment. She may also be experiencing emotional distress, anxiety, or cognitive symptoms that are underreported. The progression is probably gradual, over several months, with potential for greater functional impairment than currently conveyed.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: Inquire about the impact of fatigue on daily tasks (e.g., work, self-care), ask about mood, anxiety, or cognitive difficulties, and explore the timeline and progression of facial changes and balance problems. - Approach strategy: Use gentle, non-judgmental language emphasizing understanding and support, to encourage openness about emotional and functional impacts. - Priority order: First assess daily functioning and emotional state to identify underlying distress; then clarify timeline and progression; follow up with detailed neurological and facial assessments to correlate reported symptoms with physical findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient\u2019s communication during the interview indicates tentativeness, hesitance, and possible underreporting of symptom severity, especially regarding fatigue and neurological issues. Her cautious responses and vague language suggest her symptoms could be more severe than she admits. She may also be concealing emotional distress or cognitive difficulties. Considering these factors, her reported fatigue resistant to sleep, facial changes, and balance problems are likely underrepresented in intensity, and the true impact on her daily functioning might be greater. The timeline appears to be several months with insidious progression. To accurately understand her condition, further assessment of emotional state, cognitive function, and detailed physical examination are necessary.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female, age unspecified.  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep, noticeable facial changes characterized by increased prominence of the nose and eyes, and episodes of unsteadiness when walking.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue unrelieved by rest, with a subjective perception of facial features appearing larger but without specific measurement. She describes episodes of feeling unsteady or wobbly while walking. Due to communication hesitance, these symptoms are likely underreported and may be more severe. The timeline suggests symptoms have been progressive over several months, but exact duration remains uncertain. She demonstrates emotional reservation regarding her symptoms, which may mask the true extent of impairment.  Associated symptoms: Possible neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as cognitive or mood disturbances are not explicitly reported but could be present given the symptom profile and communication patterns. Confidence in reported symptoms varies, with physical signs like facial changes and balance issues being objectively observable, yet subjective severity may be underestimated.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of fatigue resistant to sleep, facial changes, balance disturbances. - Medium confidence: Duration and severity of symptoms may be underreported due to communication biases. - Low confidence: Exact symptom impact on daily activity and emotional state; potential other systemic or neurological symptoms. - Missing information: Detailed physical examination findings, neuro-psychological assessment results, and emotional well-being evaluation are needed to fully characterize her condition.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",

Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates with caution and vague language, showing hesitance and tendency to minimize her symptoms. She admits to some visual and balance issues but downplays their severity and has difficulty recalling details about past episodes. - Bias detected: Minimization bias, with possible withholding due to embarrassment or fear. The patient aims to avoid alarming herself or the clinician, leading to underreporting of symptom severity. - Confidence level: Medium; the pattern of vague, hesitant responses suggests she is intentionally or unintentionally minimizing her symptoms, so actual severity may be underestimated. - Reasoning: Her phrases are deliberately cautious, with uncertain descriptors, and she expresses concern without specificity. Her gaps in memory and non-specific terms indicate she might be experiencing more serious issues than she reports.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More severe visual disturbances (such as significant blurred or double vision), neurological symptoms like weakness, gait abnormalities, or facial changes, which she perceives as embarrassing or frightening. - Withheld information: Additional episodes of neurological problems, pain, or other visual changes that she fears could escalate or lead to invasive procedures. - Amplified concerns: Although she claims \"a little blurry\" and \"kind of strange,\" her underlying worry about worsening or serious illness is likely underestimated in her expression. - Temporal distortions: Symptoms may be more persistent or progressive than her vague timeline suggests; she might be experiencing ongoing issues rather than recent or episodic ones.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on my Chain of Thought analysis, the unbiased clinical picture should acknowledge that the patient likely experiences more significant visual and neurological deficits than currently described\u2014possibly including moderate to severe blurring, balance instability, or facial changes that she minimizes. Her symptom progression may have begun earlier or been insidious, and her concerns are genuine but under-communicated. Her hesitancy and vagueness conceal a potentially more serious underlying condition requiring thorough investigation.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: \"Have you noticed any double vision, difficulty seeing objects close or far away, or flashes of lights?\" \"Do you feel unsteady even when holding onto furniture or trying to walk?\" \"Have you experienced weakness, numbness, or feelings of heaviness anywhere else in your body?\" \"Are there any other changes you haven't mentioned, like headaches or difficulty speaking?\" These targeted questions can help uncover additional symptoms that she might be reluctant to generalize. - Approach strategy: Ask in a calm, empathetic manner, emphasizing safety and support. Use open-ended questions initially, then gently probe for details, reassuring her that her symptoms are important and that honest sharing will aid in better care. - Priority order: Start with specific but non-intimidating questions about vision and balance to get clearer data, then move to neurological symptoms. Address her concerns about appearance and worry directly to build trust and reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's hesitant and vague communication, including downplaying her symptoms and difficulty recalling details, suggests she may be minimizing the severity of her visual and neurological issues. Although she reports feeling tired despite sleep, facial changes, and balance problems, these could be more pronounced than indicated. She appears concerned but expresses uncertainty, which indicates that the actual extent of her symptoms might be underrepresented. Additionally, her report of eye redness, swelling, tearing, and blurry vision began only two days ago after playing soccer, which could be accurate or represent an ongoing issue she perceives as less severe. Given her communication style, more serious symptoms such as double vision, significant visual disturbances, or neurological deficits might be present but not fully acknowledged. Therefore, the clinical picture should consider potential underreporting, and further targeted inquiry is warranted to clarify the full severity of her neurological and visual symptoms.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Fatigue persisting despite adequate sleep, facial changes (perceived increase in nose and eye prominence), and balance instability.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue, facial alterations, and gait unsteadiness, describing them as relatively mild and longstanding but expresses concern about worsening or significant underlying pathology. She reports that within the past two days, following playing soccer, she experienced redness, swelling, tearing, and blurry vision in both eyes, with possible asymmetry, but denies pain, discharge, or prior episodes of similar symptoms. She describes feeling wobbly when walking and reports visual blurriness but states these issues are not severe and are difficult to recall in detail. She maintains that sleep quality is okay, but energy levels remain low.  Associated symptoms: Mild visual disturbances (blurred vision), intermittent balance issues, and possible facial appearance changes. No reports of double vision, headache, weakness, numbness, or speech difficulties\u2014though her communication pattern suggests some of these might be underreported.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Presence of visual symptoms (redness, swelling, tearing, blurry vision), recent onset of eye symptoms after physical activity. - Medium confidence: Fatigue and balance problems are definitely present but may be more severe or persistent; facial changes are perceptual and subjective, with possible underestimation. - Low confidence: Exact severity and full extent of neurological deficits, including potential double vision or other neurological signs, due to patient hesitancy and vague reporting. - Missing information: Detailed neurological examination findings, visual acuity and fields testing, history of similar past episodes, and assessment of additional neurological or facial features.\nANSWER: The patient is an adult female presenting with persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep, subjective facial changes including increased prominence of the nose and eyes, and episodic gait instability.

She reports that within the past two days, following an episode of playing soccer, she experienced redness, swelling, tearing, and blurry vision in both eyes, with one eye possibly more affected, but denies pain or discharge. She describes feeling wobbly when walking and notes visual disturbances but minimizes their severity. There are no reported symptoms of double vision, headache, weakness, or sensory changes, though her communication pattern suggests she may be underreporting some neurological symptoms. Her symptom timeline appears to involve insidious onset with recent transient eye findings potentially related to viral conjunctivitis or an inflammatory process, but her overall presentation warrants further investigation for underlying neurological or autoimmune etiologies, considering her tendency to understate or vague her symptoms.\n\nPATIENT COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:\nCOMMUNICATION_ANALYSIS: - Pattern observed: The patient communicates cautiously, with brief, vague responses, often downplaying or minimalizing her symptoms, and exhibits signs of nervousness suggesting discomfort in sharing full details. She uses non-specific language like \"kind of strange\" and \"blurry\" without elaboration and provides limited detail about symptom progression. She responds hesitantly and shifts her gaze, indicating anxiety or shyness. - Bias detected: The primary bias is minimization of symptoms, leading to under-reporting of severity. There is also some withholding behavior, as responses are vague and concise, possibly concealing extent or complexity of symptoms. - Confidence level: Medium. The overall pattern strongly suggests bias towards minimizing and withholding, but some degree of honesty remains evident. - Reasoning: These conclusions stem from her vague descriptors, hesitant speech, brief responses, and the tendency to cast symptoms as mild or occasional, suggesting she perceives symptoms as less concerning than they might be.  LIKELY_HIDDEN_INFORMATION: - Minimized symptoms: More severe visual disturbances (persistent double vision, gradual worsening), neurological deficits (more frequent gait instability, possible limb weakness), or functional impairments are likely present but not fully acknowledged. Her perception might minimize, or she might underappreciate, the impact of her symptoms, especially gait and vision issues. - Withheld information: She may be reluctant to disclose more troubling neurological signs, head pain, or symptoms like double vision, weakness, or sensory changes, possibly due to fear, embarrassment, or lack of awareness. - Amplified concerns: She appears mildly anxious about her health, but there's little evidence she is over-exaggerating. Her primary pattern is underplaying; thus, amplification is less likely. - Temporal distortions: Her vague recall (\"started feeling wobbly a while ago\") suggests she might understate the true timeline or symptom progression, potentially missing the urgency of rapid worsening.  OBJECTIVE_CLINICAL_PICTURE: Based on this analysis, the unbiased picture probably involves significant visual disturbances\u2014possibly persistent or intermittent double vision or visual field issues\u2014that she underreports. Gait instability could be more frequent or severe, impacting her mobility. Facial changes might be subtle but slowly progressive. Her fatigue is likely more disabling than she admits, and there may be additional neurological signs (e.g., limb weakness, sensory deficits) she has not explicitly mentioned but might be experiencing. The recent eye issues appear to be part of a broader, possibly inflammatory or autoimmune process affecting cranial nerves, visual pathways, or facial structures, which she minimizes in her description.  RECOMMENDED_PROBING: - Specific questions to ask: - \"Can you tell me if you experience double vision or see things doubled all the time or only sometimes?\" (to clarify severity and persistence) - \"Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs or difficulty moving certain parts of your face or limbs?\" (to detect unreported neurological signs) - \"Do your visual symptoms\u2014blurred or double vision\u2014worsen with certain activities or at specific times?\" (to understand progression) - \"Have you noticed any head pain, dizziness, or other sensations you haven't mentioned?\" (to uncover associated symptoms) - Approach strategy: Use gentle, open-ended questions, emphasizing normalcy and reassurance to reduce anxiety and encourage full disclosure. Frame inquiries as part of understanding her experience rather than accusations, helping her feel more comfortable revealing sensitive or problematic symptoms. - Priority order: Begin with detailed symptom severity and impact questions, then explore additional neurological signs, as these areas are crucial and might be underestimated or hidden.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's communication patterns indicate a tendency to underreport or minimize symptom severity, response hesitations, and vague descriptions suggest discomfort or anxiety about sharing full details. While she acknowledges feeling fatigued despite adequate sleep and perceives facial changes and gait instability, she seems to downplay these issues\u2014likely underestimating their impact. Her eye symptoms, such as redness, blurry vision, and a sensation of double or foggy vision, have a recent onset after physical activity, which she reports tentatively, possibly overlooking more persistent or severe visual disturbances. There may be additional neurological features, such as more frequent gait instability or subtle weakness, that she is not fully describing. Her symptom timeline suggests insidious onset with recent transient eye findings, but her pattern suggests these may be more persistent or severe than she indicates, and she might be withholding relevant neurological symptoms. The overall picture suggests an inflammatory or autoimmune process affecting cranial nerves, visual pathways, and potentially gait, but communication biases limit a complete assessment of severity and scope.  OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified).  Chief complaint: Persistent fatigue and subjective facial changes, with recent transient eye symptoms and gait instability, likely more severe than reported.  Present illness: The patient reports ongoing fatigue despite adequate sleep, with a subjective appearance of facial features (nose and eyes) being more prominent. She describes occasional gait wobbliness, which may be more frequent or pronounced. Recent eye symptoms began two days prior after physical activity, including redness, swelling, tearing, and blurry vision. She perceives her visual disturbances as double or foggy, with some asymmetry between the eyes, but minimizes the severity and duration of these symptoms. She reports no pain or discharge from the eyes. The timeline suggests a possibly insidious progression with recent transient eye issues, but she may be underestimating their persistence or severity.  Associated symptoms: Possible persistent or more severe visual disturbances (double/foggy vision), ongoing gait instability, facial changes; the full extent of neurological signs such as weakness or sensory deficits remains unclarified and may be underreported. Confidence in the exact severity of visual and neurological symptoms is limited due to communication hesitations.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Fatigue, facial appearance changes, recent eye redness, tearing, blurry vision, gait instability. - Medium confidence: Severity and persistence of visual disturbances and gait issues, as patient tends to minimize or vague. - Low confidence: Complete neurological exam findings, full extent of potential neurological deficits, precise timeline of symptom progression. - Missing information: Detailed assessment of neurological strength, coordination, sensory function, persistence of visual symptoms, presence of double vision, and other associated neurological signs.\nANSWER: Unable to extract answer content properly",
