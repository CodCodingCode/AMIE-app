I haven't noticed anything specific that sets it off, but they sometimes happen when she\u2019s tired or if she skips her usual snack.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child experienced any episodes of vomiting, dehydration, or high fevers around the times of her symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think she sometimes looks a bit more sleepy or tired, but I\u2019m not really sure if she\u2019s vomited or had fevers. It\u2019s hard to tell.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child recently been exposed to new foods, or have you noticed any signs of allergic reactions such as rashes, swelling, vomiting, or breathing difficulty around the times her symptoms worsen?\\nPATIENT: Um, she hasn\u2019t eaten anything new that I can think of, and I haven\u2019t seen her swell or throw up or have trouble breathing. But she has been a little more tired and fussy after meals lately, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related or not.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your child's symptoms tend to get worse after eating certain foods or specific types of meals, and do any particular foods seem to trigger a change in her behavior or symptoms?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t really know if anything in particular makes her worse. Sometimes she seems a bit more tired or fussy after eating, but I can't tell if it's because of the food or just how she's feeling that day.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if these episodes tend to happen more often when your child is tired, hasn\u2019t eaten recently, or is skipping snacks?\\nPATIENT: Uh, sometimes she seems to get more upset or weird when she's been crying or if she hasn't had enough to eat, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s always the same. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly.\\nDOCTOR: Has your child undergone any recent neurodevelopmental assessments or metabolic workups, and would you be comfortable discussing potential investigations or referrals to a neurologist or genetic specialist to better understand her condition?\\nPATIENT: Um, we haven't done anything very recent, but I think maybe we should, uh, look into more tests or someone who knows about those things? I just want to make sure she gets better and that we understand what's going on.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any features during these episodes, such as staring spells, involuntary movements, or periods of unresponsiveness, that seem characteristic of seizures?\\nPATIENT: Sometimes she just stares blankly and doesn\u2019t really react when you call her name, but other times she shakes a little or makes strange sounds. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the same every time or if it\u2019s the seizures.",
