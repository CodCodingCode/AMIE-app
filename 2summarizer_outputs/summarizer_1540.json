It\u2019s sort of hard to tell if she\u2019s sleeping okay though.\\nDOCTOR: Does your baby girl tend to have more noticeable noisy breathing, cyanosis, or feeding difficulties when she is lying flat on her back or when she is upset or agitated?\\nPATIENT: Yeah, I think she sounds worse or more noisy when she\u2019s on her back or when she gets upset. Sometimes she makes a strange sound and has trouble breathing, especially when she's crying or trying to feed, and she does seem a bit choked up or cyanotic sometimes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The latest conversation confirms all previously documented facts and adds specific details such as the baby\u2019s age being a newborn or very young infant, the noisy sounds being particularly noticeable when upset or feeding, and more precise triggers like hunger or activity level. It also clarifies her face scrunches up when struggling to breathe and emphasizes that her symptoms are worse during the day with increased activity. No entirely new symptoms have been introduced beyond these clarifications.  \nANSWER: The patient is a newborn baby girl with a history of trouble breathing and feeding since birth. She makes noisy sounds, especially when upset or lying down, and her face scrunches up when she struggles to breathe. She gets fussy during feeding, with difficulty swallowing and breathing at the same time, worse when lying on her back or when she is upset. She exhibits episodes of bluish discoloration (cyanosis) and pauses in breathing (apneas), particularly during feeds and when lying flat. She seems tired after feeds but otherwise sleeps okay. She does not have a cough or fever, and there are no signs of abnormal movements or neurological issues. Her symptoms tend to worsen during the day, especially when she is more active or hungry."
