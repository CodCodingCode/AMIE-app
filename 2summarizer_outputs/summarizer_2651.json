I don\u2019t want things to get worse or for people to make fun of me.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your symptoms tend to fluctuate during the day, such as getting worse with activity or improving with rest? Also, do you experience any difficulty swallowing, speaking, or nasal speech?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I feel more tired after I do stuff, like climbing stairs or running around, and then I kinda feel better after resting a bit? And, uh, I do notice my voice sounding funny or kinda different sometimes, like I can't speak clearly, but I'm not exactly sure when or why.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, speaking, or changes in your voice or nasal speech?\\nPATIENT: Um, I guess sometimes I feel like my voice sounds kind of funny or I get a little stuck when I try to talk, but I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s what you mean. I don\u2019t really notice swallowing problems, I think.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed any double vision, drooping eyelids, or weakness that affects your ability to keep your eyes open? Also, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or other sensory changes, or had any facial or neck pain that might suggest a different neurological or muscular issue?\\nPATIENT: Um, yeah, my eyelids do kind of droop sometimes, like they get heavy and I have to pull them up more. I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling really, but I do feel tired a lot, especially when I run or do stuff like that. I haven't had any pain in my face or neck, though.\\nDOCTOR: Are you experiencing any double vision, difficulty keeping your eyes open, or drooping eyelids that come and go?\\nPATIENT: Um, sometimes my eyes feel a bit funny, like they kinda get tired or heavy, but I dunno if it's double vision or anything. My eyelids do feel a little droopy sometimes, but not all the time.\\nDOCTOR: Would you be comfortable starting on a medication like pyridostigmine to help improve your muscle strength, and would you like to discuss further testing or a referral to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis and plan your treatment?\\nPATIENT: Um, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I guess I\u2019m kinda scared to try new medicines, and I don\u2019t really get what all the tests or special doctors are for. I just want to feel better, I guess, but I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s gonna happen.\\nDOCTOR: Have you noticed if your muscle weakness gets worse after repeated use of the same muscles or during the day and then improves with rest?\\nPATIENT: Um, I think I do feel kind of more tired in my arms and legs sometimes, especially after I\u2019ve been moving around a lot, but then if I sit for a little, it feels a little better? I dunno if that\u2019s what you mean.",
