Try not to worry so much.\nDoctor: You're probably just staring at screens too much. Take a break from your computer and drink some water.\nDoctor: Everyone gets headaches. This doesn\u2019t sound serious. You just need to relax more.\nDoctor: Like I said, this isn\u2019t anything to worry about. Just take more ibuprofen if it gets bad.\nDoctor: Three coffees a day? That\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re fine. Try yoga or something if you\u2019re stressed.\nDoctor: No, you don\u2019t need a scan. People always think the worst. It\u2019s just a headache. Don\u2019t overthink it.\nDoctor: I don\u2019t know\u2014whatever works for you. Try not to take too much. That\u2019s it."
