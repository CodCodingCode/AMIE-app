    "scenario": "You are a 35-year-old office worker who has been experiencing persistent headaches for 3 days. The pain is throbbing, located in your temples, and rates about 6/10 in intensity. You've tried ibuprofen but it only helps temporarily. You're worried because you've never had headaches this severe before.",

    "doctor_responses": "Doctor: Hello! It\u2019s wonderful to see you today. What brings you in? I'm here to help, so please feel free to share any concerns or questions you may have.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that you've been dealing with such intense headaches; that sounds really uncomfortable and concerning. To better understand what you\u2019re experiencing, could you tell me if the pain is localized to your temples or if it radiates to other areas? Additionally, do you notice anything specific that seems to trigger the headaches or makes them worse, such as certain activities or environmental factors? Your comfort and wellbeing are important to me, and I want to get to the bottom of this.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing such discomfort. To better understand your situation, could you let me know if you've noticed any associated symptoms, such as nausea, changes in your vision, or sensitivity to light or sound? Additionally, have you experienced any recent increases in stress or changes in your sleep patterns that might be contributing to these headaches? Your wellbeing is important to me, and I want to ensure we address all aspects of what you're experiencing.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing your concerns; I can see how distressing this situation must be for you, especially with the combination of sensitivity to light, nausea, and sleep disturbances. To better understand your symptoms, could you please tell me about any past medical history related to headaches or migraines, as well as any current medications you are taking? Additionally, have you experienced any similar episodes in the past, even if they were less intense? Your well-being is important, and we're here to find the best way to help you.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing such severe headaches, and I want to help you find some relief. Can you tell me more about your diet lately\u2014any changes in what you're eating or drinking, particularly caffeine intake? Additionally, have you noticed any other stressors at work or in your personal life that might be contributing to your symptoms? It's important for us to understand all potential triggers for your headaches.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It sounds like the increased caffeine intake, combined with skipped meals and dehydration, could be contributing to your intense headaches. Caffeine withdrawal or overuse, coupled with stress, can lead to such symptoms. It's important to ensure you stay hydrated, eat regular meals, and manage your caffeine consumption. \n\nPlease monitor your headaches\u2014if they worsen, are accompanied by nausea, vision changes, or neurological symptoms, seek urgent care immediately. Let's also schedule a follow-up to discuss your symptoms further; how does later this week sound? In the meantime, how are you managing your stress levels at work?\nDoctor: I'm glad you found our discussion helpful. Based on your symptoms and history, the most likely conditions contributing to your headaches include tension-type headaches, possible migraine triggers due to caffeine, and dehydration. For immediate relief, I recommend over-the-counter analgesics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, along with ensuring adequate hydration and adjusting your caffeine intake. In terms of follow-up care, please keep your scheduled appointment later this week, and note any changes in headache frequency or intensity. Watch for warning signs such as sudden changes in headache pattern, visual disturbances, or neurological symptoms like weakness or numbness, as these may signal a need for urgent evaluation."
