Diagnosis: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)\nJustification: Chronic joint pain and decreased mobility in a young male strongly suggest an inflammatory arthritis, especially given the involvement of multiple joints (elbow and knee). The skin bumps could represent subcutaneous nodules or secondary skin manifestations. JIA is common in this age group and often presents with persistent joint symptoms.\n2. Diagnosis: Dermatopathic or panniculitis-associated panniculitis\nJustification: The enlarging, painful skin bumps on arms and legs could be subcutaneous nodules of panniculitis, which are associated with autoimmune conditions like JIA or systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in adolescents.\n3. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: SLE can present with skin lesions, joint involvement, and neurological symptoms like numbness and weakness. Although more common in females, it can occur in males, and presentation with skin and joint features is typical.\n4. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)\nJustification: Vasculitis can cause skin nodules, multisystem symptoms including joint pain, and neurological deficits due to ischemia or nerve involvement. It is an important \"can't miss\" diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Neurofibromatosis Type 1\nJustification: The presence of skin bumps could represent neurofibromas, which manifest as skin nodules, and can be associated with neurological symptoms from nerve involvement, although less likely given the acute systemic features.\n6. Diagnosis: Infectious etiologies (e.g., Mycobacterial or Fungal infections)\nJustification: Chronic skin nodules with systemic symptoms could be infectious, especially in endemic areas or immunocompromised states; however, less likely without additional risk factors or constitutional symptoms.\n7. Diagnosis: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener's)\nJustification: This small-vessel vasculitis can involve skin, joints, and the nervous system, presenting with skin nodules, joint symptoms, and neurological deficits, though less common in adolescents.\n8. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis\nJustification: Multi-organ involvement including skin and neurological symptoms; although rare in this age, it can present with granulomatous skin lesions and neurological deficits.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurocutaneous melanosis or other pigmentary/neurocutaneous syndromes\nJustification: Skin bumps and neurological symptoms could suggest neurocutaneous syndromes, although the description favors inflammatory or autoimmune causes.\n10. Diagnosis: Malignant neoplasm (e.g., Lymphoma or soft tissue sarcoma)\nJustification: Progressive enlarging skin bumps with systemic and neurological features could indicate malignancy, which should always be considered to rule out \"can't miss\" diagnoses.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)\nJustification: His joint pain and decreased mobility, especially involving large joints like the knee and elbow, are typical features; despite being a common cause of joint symptoms in adolescents, the presence of skin lesions suggests possible overlap with other systems.\n2. Diagnosis: Infectious etiology such as Lyme disease\nJustification: As this is prevalent in certain regions, joint pain, skin manifestations, and neurological symptoms such as numbness could be linked to tick-borne infections.\n3. Diagnosis: Neurofibromatosis Type 1\nJustification: Skin bumps (neurofibromas), along with neurological symptoms, may suggest a neurocutaneous disorder, which often presents during adolescence. The neurological deficits could be related to nerve involvement.\n4. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Juvenile Dermatomyositis or other small vessel vasculitis)\nJustification: Painful skin lesions combined with joint and neurological symptoms can occur in vasculitic syndromes affecting muscles, skin, and nerves.\n5. Diagnosis: Sebaceous or other benign skin tumors\nJustification: The enlarging skin bumps are painful, which is less typical for benign tumors but still possible; less likely primary cause but must be considered.\n6. Diagnosis: Rheumatologic conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: SLE can cause skin manifestations, joint pain, and neurological symptoms, and can present insidiously in adolescents.\n7. Diagnosis: Neoplastic process (e.g., soft tissue sarcoma or lymphoma)\nJustification: The enlarging skin bumps and systemic symptoms could suggest a neoplastic etiology, particularly if there are constitutional or systemic signs.\n8. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: Unilateral neurological symptoms such as numbness and weakness suggest possible MS, although skin involvement is less typical and less likely as initial presentation.\n9. Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis or other infectious/inflammatory bone conditions\nJustification: Painful skin bumps and joint symptoms could relate to underlying bone or soft tissue infection, although the neurological features are less explained.\n10.

Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\nJustification: The combination of skin bumps (which could be lupus-related skin lesions or vasculitic), joint stiffness, and episodic neurological symptoms fits with SLE's multisystem involvement. The skin findings, joint symptoms, and possible neurological manifestations (neuropathy, CNS involvement) are characteristic of lupus, especially in adolescents. The insidious progression and systemic features support this as the top consideration.\n2. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Cutaneous or Small Vessel Vasculitis)\nJustification: Painful skin bumps, which may be ulcers or palpable purpura, and joint symptoms with episodic neurological deficits can be explained by a vasculitic process damaging small vessels in skin, joints, and nerves. The systemic or localized vasculitis aligns with skin and neurological findings, and episodic presentation suggests fluctuating vascular inflammation.\n3. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\nJustification: The episodic, unilateral numbness and weakness suggest demyelination of central nervous system pathways. While MS primarily affects CNS, it can occasionally be associated with skin or systemic symptoms through comorbid autoimmune processes. The neurological episodes are characteristic, and MS is a common demyelinating disorder in adolescents.\n4. Diagnosis: Juvenile Dermatomyositis\nJustification: Skin involvement (though typically more characteristic, like heliotrope rash or Gottron papules), joint stiffness, and systemic symptoms can overlap. However, the description of skin bumps and episodic neurological symptoms is less typical for dermatomyositis, making it a less probable primary diagnosis but still worth considering.\n5. Diagnosis: Infectious or Parainfectious Vasculitis (e.g., Post-infectious)\nJustification: Some infections can cause vasculitic skin lesions, joint symptoms, and neurological symptoms. However, the chronicity and systemic autoimmune features favor a primary autoimmune process over infectious causes, though infectious vasculitis remains in differential considerations.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) with cutaneous manifestations\nJustification: The patient's joint stiffness, decreased mobility in knees and wrists, and gradual symptom progression strongly suggest an inflammatory joint disease like JIA. The tender, enlarging skin bumps could represent extra-articular manifestations, such as rash or subcutaneous nodules sometimes associated with juvenile arthritis, especially systemic subtypes. Although the skin findings are more prominent, JIA can have skin lesions that mimic nodules or dermatitis, making it a primary consideration given joint symptoms and age.\n2. Diagnosis: Granulomatous Skin Disorder (e.g., Sarcoidosis)\nJustification: The presence of enlarging, tender skin bumps suggests granulomatous skin infiltration. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect skin, joints, and nerves, fitting the constellation of skin nodules, joint stiffness, and episodic neurological symptoms. While sarcoidosis is less common in adolescents, forms can occur. The chronicity, skin involvement, and possible systemic features support this diagnosis as a significant consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Neurocutaneous Disorder (e.g., Tuberous Sclerosis Complex)\nJustification: Skin bumps that enlarge and become tender, combined with neurological episodes, raise suspicion of a neurocutaneous syndrome such as tuberous sclerosis. Tuberous sclerosis often presents with skin hamartomas, cortical tubers causing seizures or neurological deficits, and other systemic involvements. Unilateral neurological symptoms and skin lesions could be manifestations of this condition, which commonly starts early in life.\n4. Diagnosis: Infectious or Inflammatory Granulomatous Disease (e.g., Mycobacterial or Fungal Infection)\nJustification: The progressive enlarging tender skin bumps can represent infectious granulomas caused by atypical mycobacteria or fungi. These can involve skin and subcutaneous tissues, sometimes associated with systemic symptoms. Although less likely without systemic signs of infection, it remains possible because of the localized symptoms and progressive nature, especially if immunologic factors are involved.\n5. Diagnosis: Other Autoimmune/Connective Tissue Disease (e.g., Lupus Erythematosus)\nJustification: Autoimmune conditions like lupus can present with skin lesions and joint involvement. The tender skin bumps and joint stiffness may align with discoid or subacute cutaneous lupus and associated joint symptoms, with episodic neurological symptoms possibly related to vasculitis or neuropathy. However, the specific description of enlarging, tender skin bumps and neurological episodes makes this less probable than prior diagnoses but still worth consideration due to systemic autoimmune overlap.",

Diagnosis: Blau syndrome (juvenile granulomatous disease)\nJustification: The patient\u2019s age, enlarging tender skin bumps, and decreased joint mobility resemble Blau syndrome, which presents with granulomatous dermatitis, arthritis, and uveitis. Although uveitis is not specified, the skin and joint findings are characteristic, and episodic neurological symptoms may reflect granulomatous involvement of nerves.\n2. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis\nJustification: Sarcoidosis involves granuloma formation affecting multiple organs, including skin and nervous system. The chronic, enlarging skin bumps and intermittent neurological deficits fit typical sarcoid presentations, especially in adolescents with multi-organ involvement.\n3. Diagnosis: Infectious granulomatous disease (e.g., atypical mycobacterial or fungal infection)\nJustification: Chronic skin enlargements could be granulomatous infections, which might also involve the nervous system. Less likely given no systemic infectious symptoms, but must be considered due to granulomatous skin lesions.\n4. Diagnosis: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with synovial and skin involvement\nJustification: The decreased joint mobility suggests arthritis, possibly JIA, although skin bumps are less typical. The episodic neurological symptoms are atypical but could be secondary to joint or nerve involvement.\n5. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., Takayasu arteritis)\nJustification: Episodic neurological deficits and skin changes can occur in vasculitis affecting medium or large vessels, but skin lesions are more consistent with granulomatous disorders.
