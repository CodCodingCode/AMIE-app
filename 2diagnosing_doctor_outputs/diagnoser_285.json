Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychotic disorder\nJustification: Symptoms began a few days after recent substance use, including hallucinations, paranoia, agitation\u2014consistent with substance-induced psychosis, which is common in young adults following drug intake.\n2. Diagnosis: Acute paranoid schizophrenia or primary psychotic disorder\nJustification: Onset of hallucinations and paranoia could indicate a primary psychotic disorder; however, the temporal relationship with recent substance use makes this less likely as initial cause, but it remains a differential.\n3. Diagnosis: Cannabis-induced psychosis\nJustification: Cannabis is often used recreationally by young adults and can cause transient psychosis symptoms, especially in vulnerable individuals, aligning with recent use history.\n4. Diagnosis: Amphetamine or methamphetamine intoxication/psychosis\nJustification: Psychosis associated with stimulant use includes hallucinations and paranoia; the patient's pacing and agitation fit stimulant effects, common in young adult recreational use.\n5. Diagnosis: Other hallucinogen or stimulant intoxication (e.g., LSD, MDMA)\nJustification: Hallucinogens frequently induce hallucinations and paranoia, matching the clinical picture, and are common in party settings.\n6. Diagnosis: Delirium (substance-induced or metabolic)\nJustification: Agitation and hallucinations can be features of delirium, especially with recent substance use; however, no mention of altered consciousness or fluctuating levels suggests lower likelihood.\n7. Diagnosis: Neuropsychiatric disorder secondary to medical condition (e.g., CNS infection, epilepsy)\nJustification: Consider if no substance link or other causes; less likely without other neurological signs, but always part of differential.\n8. Diagnosis: Psychosis due to a medical condition (less likely given typical presentation)\nJustification: Could consider if workup reveals, but acute onset post substance use favors substance-induced.\n9. Diagnosis: Substance withdrawal psychosis (less likely if recent use was ongoing)\nJustification: Typically occurs after cessation, not concurrent with recent use; less relevant if the symptoms started immediately afterward.\n10. Diagnosis: Brief psychotic disorder unrelated to substance use\nJustification: Possible but less likely given recent substance use may be the precipitant; still important to consider if substance effect is ruled out.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder\nJustification: Onset of hallucinations and paranoia shortly after substance use; temporal relationship supports substance-induced etiology; common with synthetic or unidentified stimulants like mephedrone.\n2. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia or Primary Psychotic Disorder\nJustification: The presence of hallucinations and paranoid ideation, though recent onset, could represent initial presentation of a primary psychotic disorder, especially if symptoms persist beyond substance effects.\n3. Diagnosis: Psychosis Due to Other Medical Conditions\nJustification: Could be secondary to neurologic or metabolic disturbances; however, no specific signs or symptoms suggest medical etiology, but remains a differential.\n4.

Diagnosis: Organic Brain Syndrome (e.g., Toxicity or Neuroinfection)\nJustification: Considered if neurological impairment is evident, but not indicated here.\n8. Diagnosis: Post-Intoxication Psychosis (from unknown substance)\nJustification: Could stem from residual neurochemical effects of the unidentified substance.\n9. Diagnosis: Acute Stress Reaction or Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: Could explain agitation and paranoia but less likely to produce frank hallucinations.\n10. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Episode unrelated to substances\nJustification: Possible, but less likely due to recent substance exposure; would require persistence beyond typical timeframe.",

These features suggest a substance-ind\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder (Stimulant/Entactogen Related)\nJustification: The onset of hallucinations and paranoia follows suspected mephedrone use, a synthetic cathinone known to cause stimulant-like effects and psychosis. The temporal relationship supports this, and these symptoms are typical of stimulant intoxication, which can cause transient psychosis. The patient's vague substance history suggests possible adulterants or multiple substances, increasing risk. Symptoms may improve with time and cessation, which aligns with substance-induced pathology.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Schizophrenia or Psychotic Disorder (Brief/Persisting)\nJustification: Although the recent onset is more suggestive of a substance-related trigger, primary psychotic disorders can present in young adults and can be precipitated or unmasked by substance use. Paranoia, hallucinations, agitation, and pacing are core features. The rapid onset post-substance use raises the possibility of underlying schizophrenia spectrum disorder, either emerging or precipitated.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute Substance Intoxication with Psychosis (Other Substances)\nJustification: The patient's vague report could include other substances or adulterants besides mephedrone, such as synthetic cannabinoids or other stimulants, which can cause acute psychosis. The presentation fits with intoxication effects, which are usually transient but can sometimes persist longer if complicated.\n4. Diagnosis: Delusional Disorder or Brief Psychotic Episode\nJustification: Given the acute onset, a brief psychotic episode triggered by substance use is a plausible diagnosis. The symptom duration appears recent, aligning with brief psychosis, yet the recent substance exposure makes substance-induced psychosis more probable.\n5. Diagnosis: Neurological Causes of Psychosis (e.g., Seizures, Brain Lesions)\nJustification: Less likely given the timeline and contextual clues, but neurological causes should be considered if symptoms persist or if neurological findings emerge, especially if substance use unaccounted for neurological effects.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis (Stimulant-Induced Psychosis)\nJustification: The rapid development of hallucinations, paranoia, agitation, and pacing shortly after suspected ingestion of mephedrone supports a diagnosis of substance-induced psychosis. Mephedrone, a stimulant, is known to produce psychotic symptoms, especially in high doses or binges. The patient's recent drug use history aligns temporally with symptom onset, and the absence of prior psychiatric history\u2014or that it is not specified\u2014further favors this diagnosis. The presentation is classic for stimulant-related psychosis, with hallucinations and paranoid ideation that often resolve with cessation of the drug.\n2. Diagnosis: Toxic or Organic Psychosis\nJustification: While less likely, organic causes such as metabolic disturbances, neurological injury, or infections can cause psychosis. However, the recent substance use and acute onset make these less probable unless additional signs are present. The absence of neurological deficits or systemic illness reduces this likelihood.\n3. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia)\nJustification: Although possible, primary schizophrenia typically has a more gradual onset and a history of prior episodes; here, symptoms are recent and closely tied to substance use, making this less probable initially. Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind if symptoms persist after detoxification.\n4. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features\nJustification: No evidence of predominant mood symptoms (depression or mania) is provided. Given the acute presentation post-drug use, mood disorder is lower on the differential but cannot be excluded without further mood assessment.\n5. Diagnosis: Delirium\nJustification: The presentation does not describe fluctuating consciousness or disorientation typically seen in delirium. Therefore, delirium is less likely in this scenario.\nSTOP HERE.",

The lack of chronic psychiatric \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder (Substance intoxication or overdose)\nJustification: The onset occurred shortly after suspected ingestion of a large quantity of powder substance; hallucinations, paranoia, agitation, and pacing fit typical presentation of intoxication effects, especially with substances that can precipitate psychosis (e.g., stimulants, hallucinogens). The recent timing with suspected substance use points strongly toward this being the primary cause.\n2. Diagnosis: Stimulant-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: Many powder substances at parties are stimulants such as cocaine or synthetic stimulants, which are known to induce hallucinations, paranoia, agitation, and psychosis shortly after use. The rapid onset of symptoms following suspected intake indicates stimulant effects are highly probable, especially considering the ongoing psychosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Toxic or Toxic-Metabolic Encephalopathy\nJustification: The pattern of hallucinations, agitation, and paranoia can be seen in toxic metabolic states induced by substances or contaminants. The recent heavy use and ongoing symptoms warrant consideration of metabolic disturbances (e.g., hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, or neurotoxic effects of substances) causing or exacerbating psychosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia)\nJustification: Although this patient has no prior psychiatric history reported, primary psychotic disorders can sometimes present acutely; however, the recent onset shortly after substance use makes this less likely as the initial cause. Still, an underlying predisposition cannot be entirely excluded.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance Withdrawal Psychosis\nJustification: If the patient had used substances previously, withdrawal could precipitate psychosis; however, the timeline suggests recent use is more closely related to symptom onset, making withdrawal less likely unless there is a history of heavy, regular use not specified here.\nSTOP HERE.",
