    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a likely young or active individual based on playing soccer, experiencing eye redness, swelling, and tearing within two days. These symptoms suggest an acute ocular process, possibly related to trauma, infection, or inflammatory conditions. The absence of mention of pain level, vision change, or foreign body sensation limits specificity but still guides the differential. The most common and serious conditions in this setting are conjunctivitis, ocular trauma (like corneal abrasion), and uveitis. Less common considerations include scleritis, episcleritis, or foreign body. Red flags would include signs of globe rupture or intraocular penetration, but there's no explicit mention of trauma severity. The order emphasizes common causes first, then critical \"cannot miss\" diagnoses.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Acute Conjunctivitis (likely viral) Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling common in conjunctivitis; onset within days; often follows exposure or activity, such as playing soccer.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal Foreign Body or Trauma Justification: Recent activity involving physical exertion and outdoor play raises suspicion for minor trauma, which can cause redness, tearing, swelling.  3. Diagnosis: Minor Ocular Trauma (e.g., corneal abrasion) Justification: Sudden onset after playing sports suggests possible superficial injury, presenting with redness and tearing.  4. Diagnosis: Episcleritis Justification: Sudden redness and swelling may indicate localized inflammation of episcleral vessels, typically painless or mildly painful.  5. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival Hemorrhage Justification: Rapid onset of redness and swelling possibly due to minor trauma or increased venous pressure during activity.  6. Diagnosis: Uveitis (Anterior) Justification: Inflammatory process causing redness and tearing, though usually painful with other signs; possible but less likely without pain reported.  7. Diagnosis: Scleritis Justification: Severe, deep ocular redness with swelling; less common but serious, requiring prompt diagnosis.  8. Diagnosis: Allergic Conjunctivitis Justification: Itching and tearing common but less likely given the acute onset after physical activity, unless there's exposure to allergens.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (Acute Angle-Closure) Justification: Red eye and tearing could be symptoms, but usually associated with pain, visual disturbance, which are not described.  10. Diagnosis: Infectious Keratitis Justification: Serious eye infection presenting with redness and tearing, typically associated with contact lens use or trauma; less likely without pain or visual changes described.",

    "input": "An adult female patient reports experiencing multiple new tender skin lumps that sometimes bleed, with a duration of approximately one month, accompanied by unintentional weight loss and persistent fatigue over the past two months. She also describes a side pain of about one month\u2019s duration. Communication patterns suggest these symptoms may be more severe or impactful than reported, and further clinical evaluation is needed to assess the size, number, and characteristics of the lumps, as well as the severity of systemic symptoms. Additional details regarding symptom intensity, associated systemic features, and physical findings are necessary for an accurate assessment and diagnosis.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult female with multiple tender skin lumps that sometimes bleed, along with systemic symptoms of weight loss and fatigue, and a side pain. The lumps' characteristics and systemic involvement suggest both localized skin conditions and possible systemic disease processes. The bleeding suggests vascular or hemorrhagic components, and systemic symptoms point toward inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes. Given these clues, I will consider common benign causes, inflammatory conditions, infections, autoimmune diseases, and serious illnesses such as malignancies. Prioritizing most likely based on the combination of skin lesions and systemic symptoms, I will order the diagnoses accordingly.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous lymphoma Justification: Multiple tender skin lumps with bleeding and systemic weight loss and fatigue suggest a possible lymphoproliferative disorder affecting the skin, which is relatively common in adult women and can present with skin nodules and systemic symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Tuberculous cutaneous infection Justification: Chronic skin nodules with bleeding, systemic weight loss, and fatigue raise suspicion of infectious etiologies like tuberculosis, which can cause skin abscesses or granulomatous lesions alongside systemic symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Metastatic skin carcinoma Justification: Skin metastases often appear as firm, sometimes tender nodules that may ulcerate or bleed, often associated with systemic disease like weight loss; common in women with underlying breast or other cancers.  4. Diagnosis: Pyogenic granuloma Justification: Rapidly developing, bleeding skin lumps that are tender; while usually smaller, they can be multiple and may ulcerate, consistent with recent bleeding, though systemic symptoms are less typical unless secondary infection.  5. Diagnosis: Pyoderma gangrenosum Justification: Tender, ulcerative skin lesions that can bleed; systemic symptoms including fatigue and weight loss can be associated with underlying autoimmune diseases.  6. Diagnosis: Lupus erythematosus (discoid or systemic) Justification: Autoimmune skin lesions sometimes present as tender, erythematous, ulcerated nodules; systemic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue support autoimmune etiology.  7. Diagnosis: Nonspecific infectious cellulitis or abscess Justification: Tender, sometimes bleeding skin lumps could be due to bacterial skin infections; systemic symptoms could suggest a more widespread infection.  8. Diagnosis: Cutaneous sarcoidosis Justification: Nodular skin lesions with systemic features like fatigue and weight loss could be manifestations of sarcoidosis; tender skin nodules are characteristic.  9. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., small vessel vasculitis) Justification: Tender, bleeding skin lumps can be vasculitic lesions; systemic symptoms of fatigue and weight loss can occur, especially if systemic vasculitis is involved.  10. Diagnosis: Atypical fibrous histiocytoma or other soft tissue neoplasm Justification: Persistent tender skin nodules that bleed might be rare benign tumors, though systemic symptoms are less typical, making this less likely.

    "input": "An adult female patient reports the development of tender skin lumps that have been present for approximately one month, with some lumps bleeding on contact. She also reports persistent fatigue over the past two months and unintentional weight loss, though the severity of these symptoms may be influenced by her high anxiety levels. Physical examination is required to assess the size, number, and characteristics of the lumps, along with evaluation for any other systemic signs such as fever or lymphadenopathy. The patient's concerns about serious illnesses like cancer are likely amplified by her emotional state, and her perception of symptom progression may be exaggerated. Further diagnostic workup, including physical exam and possibly imaging or biopsy, is indicated to determine the nature of the skin lesions and evaluate for systemic involvement.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with tender skin lumps that bleed upon contact, along with systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss. These features suggest a potential underlying systemic or hematologic process with skin involvement. The bleeding nature of the lumps points toward vascular or blood dyscrasia-related causes. Fatigue and weight loss raise concern for malignancy or systemic inflammatory conditions. The differential must be refined to include conditions that can cause skin lesions with bleeding, systemic symptoms, and lymphadenopathy. Anxiety might exaggerate perception, but the clinical signs need explanation. Given these considerations, I rank the most probable diagnoses accordingly.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous lymphoma (e.g., cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative disorder) Justification: The presence of skin lumps that are tender and bleed, coupled with systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, suggests a systemic lymphoproliferative process manifesting in the skin. Such conditions often cause infiltrative skin lesions that can ulcerate or bleed and are associated with systemic symptoms. The lymphadenopathy prominent in some forms of cutaneous lymphoma also fits the clinical picture.  2. Diagnosis: Hematologic malignancy (e.g., leukemia or lymphoma with skin involvement) Justification: Bleeding skin lesions and systemic symptoms are characteristic of hematologic malignancies infiltrating the skin. The unintentional weight loss and fatigue further support this possibility. These conditions can produce palpable, bleeding lumps and systemic wasting, aligning with the patient's presentation.  3. Diagnosis: Vasculitis (e.g., small to medium vessel vasculitis) Justification: Vasculitic processes can produce tender, bleeding skin nodules due to vessel wall inflammation and necrosis. Systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss are common. The bleeding suggests vessel compromise leading to skin necrosis and hemorrhage, consistent with vasculitic pathology.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious etiology (e.g., cutaneous leishmaniasis or bacterial abscess) Justification: Certain infections can produce tender, ulcerated or bleeding skin nodules, especially if ulceration or secondary infection occurs. The duration (one month) and systemic symptoms could align with chronic infectious processes, although less likely given the weight loss unless associated with systemic infection, which is not explicitly stated.  5. Diagnosis: Carcinoma (e.g., metastatic skin tumors) Justification: Although less common, metastatic skin deposits can present as nodules which ulcerate or bleed. The systemic symptoms could relate to an underlying primary malignancy. However, the circling with bleeding and tenderness leans more toward hematologic or inflammatory causes.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with multiple skin lumps that have appeared over recent weeks, some tender and bleeding on contact, with increasing size and number. She reports persistent fatigue for approximately two months and unintentional weight loss; however, these symptoms may be overrepresented by her high anxiety. She also notes occasional difficulty swallowing and cervical swelling, but denies fever or night sweats. The timeline suggests progressive symptom development, though her emotional distress may influence her perception of rapidity and severity. Physical examination is necessary to assess the size, tenderness, and distribution of lumps, along with evaluation for lymphadenopathy and systemic signs, in order to establish an objective clinical picture and guide further diagnostic workup.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of multiple skin lumps that are enlarging, some tender and bleeding, along with systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss, suggests a possible neoplastic or hematologic process. The cervical swelling and difficulty swallowing point toward lymphadenopathy or a mass effect in the neck. Lumps that bleed and are tender may be infectious or malignant. The progressive nature and systemic features heighten concern for lymphoma or skin-related malignancy. The absence of fever or night sweats somewhat reduces classic lymphoma suspicion but does not exclude it. The combination of skin lesions and lymphadenopathy steers the differential toward hematologic malignancies like lymphoma, skin-based cancers, or metastatic disease. The presence of unintentional weight loss and fatigue warrants including malignancies high in the differential, especially lymphoma or cutaneous malignancies. The differential must be refined considering the predominance of skin symptoms and systemic features, balanced with the evolution of symptoms.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides or other T-cell lymphomas) Justification: The multiple skin lumps that are enlarging, tender, bleeding, and associated with systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder with primary skin involvement. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas often present with skin patches or plaques progressing over time, and systemic symptoms can appear as disease advances. The persistent and enlarging skin lesions, along with constitutional symptoms, support this diagnosis as it explains both the skin findings and systemic features.  2. Diagnosis: Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Justification: The cervical swelling and lymphadenopathy, possibly with systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, are classic for lymphoma. The progression of lymph node enlargement, potential for nodal bleeding or ulceration, and systemic effects fit this pattern. Although the absence of fever or night sweats complicates the classic presentation, lymphoma remains high on the differential given lymph node involvement and constitutional symptoms.  3. Diagnosis: Metastatic Skin Malignancy Justification: Multiple skin nodules that are enlarging and bleeding could represent metastases from an internal malignancy (such as breast, melanoma, or other solid tumors). The recent appearance and progression favor metastasis, especially given the woman's age and systemic symptoms, which are common in advanced metastatic disease. Difficulty swallowing might suggest head/neck or thoracic primary tumors, though this remains less specific without further info.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious or Inflammatory Granulomatous Disease Justification: The tender, bleeding lumps could, in part, be due to infectious causes such as cutaneous infections, abscesses, or granulomatous conditions, especially if multiple and involving various sites. However, the systemic symptoms and progressive nature lean less toward infectious etiologies but remain a consideration given the clinical presentation.  5. Diagnosis: Skin Appendage Tumors or Benign Lumps Justification: Although benign skin tumors (e.g., sebaceous cysts, lipomas) can be common, they usually do not enlarge rapidly, bleed, or cause systemic symptoms. Their inclusion accounts for persistent skin lesions without systemic features but is lower probability given the constellation of symptoms and progression.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's symptoms of eye redness, swelling, and tearing following playing soccer suggest an acute periocular or ocular injury, likely traumatic in origin. The recent onset (2 days ago) and activity context support trauma. The possible conditions include conjunctivitis, traumatic conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or eyelid/posterior orbital injuries. Given the acute setting and recent activity, trauma-induced conditions are most plausible. Conjunctivitis typically causes redness and tearing but less swelling and is less associated with recent trauma. Conjunctival hemorrhage from trauma fits well with the sudden onset, recent activity, and specific symptoms.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: eye redness, swelling, tearing, onset 2 days ago post-soccer, no mention of pain or visual changes. - Timeline and progression: symptoms began acutely after activity, no prior history. - Clinical pattern recognition: recent trauma with acute eye redness, swelling, suggests traumatic conjunctivitis or subconjunctival hemorrhage. - Supporting evidence: recent injury, rapid symptom onset, and nature of the eye symptoms support traumatic etiologies. - Excluding alternatives: conjunctivitis usually not linked to trauma, less swelling; orbital fracture unlikely without orbital pain or diplopia; no systemic signs indicating infection.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: high confidence in traumatic ocular injury or conjunctival hemorrhage given recent trauma and symptom profile. - Missing information: detailed eye examination (e.g., conjunctival inspection), visual acuity, presence of other orbital signs, palpation findings. - Clinical coherence: symptoms coherently align with traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage. - Diagnostic criteria: presentation consistent with conjunctival hemorrhage secondary to trauma.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: most probable diagnosis is subconjunctival hemorrhage due to trauma. - Information sufficiency: current data sufficiently supports diagnosis; imaging not immediately necessary. - Risk tolerance: low risk; no urgent additional testing needed unless visual impairment or other concerning features emerge. - Clinical urgency: minor condition; await initial assessment complicates management if worsening occurs.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes, clinical picture strongly supports traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: Yes, the presentation is characteristic and consistent.\nANSWER: Traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage END",
