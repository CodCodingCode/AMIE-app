Diagnosis: Polymyositis\nJustification: Gradual proximal muscle weakness over months with symmetrical muscle wasting suggests inflammatory myopathy; common in middle-aged adults, with no systemic symptoms reported yet, but warrants consideration.\n2. Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis\nJustification: Similar to polymyositis but often associated with skin findings; in early stages may present with muscle weakness without skin signs, but needs to be differentiated.\n3. Diagnosis: Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\nJustification: Chronic progressive proximal weakness affecting shoulders and hips, common in young to middle-aged adults, typically genetic and non-inflammatory.\n4. Diagnosis: Inclusion Body Myositis\nJustification: Usually affects older adults with insidious proximal and distal weakness; progressive course matches presentation, but lateralized weakness and muscle atrophy are characteristic.\n5. Diagnosis: Statin or Medication-Induced Myopathy\nJustification: Proximal weakness may occur in drug-induced myopathies; relevant if patient is on statins or other myotoxic agents, though no medication history provided.\n6. Diagnosis: Hypothyroid Myopathy\nJustification: Proximal weakness can be a feature of hypothyroidism, especially if metabolic causes are considered; typically associated with other hypothyroid features.\n7. Diagnosis: Mitochondrial Myopathy\nJustification: Presents with progressive proximal weakness; often involves other systemic features but can be isolated; less common.\n8. Diagnosis: Bedside or Mechanical factors (e.g., disuse atrophy)\nJustification: Not primary but may contribute; less likely given progressive muscle wasting.\n9. Diagnosis: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\nJustification: Usually presents with both upper and lower motor neuron signs; distal weakness typically prominent initially, making it less likely.\n10. Diagnosis: Myasthenia Gravis\nJustification: Characteristic fluctuating weakness; usually affects ocular and bulbar muscles first; less consistent with a several-month progressive proximal weakness without other features.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD)\nJustification: The patient's progressive proximal muscle weakness, observable atrophy, and chronic course align with LGMD, a hereditary dystrophy affecting shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. No skin rashes or systemic features argue against inflammatory myopathies, and the gradual progression over months supports a genetic dystrophy.\n2. Diagnosis: Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM)\nJustification: IBM often presents in middle-aged or older adults with both proximal and distal muscle weakness, sometimes involving finger flexors and quadriceps. While the vignette emphasizes proximal weakness and atrophy, the progressive nature over months fits. The absence of systemic autoimmune features favors IBM over inflammatory myopathies.\n3. Diagnosis: Polymyositis\nJustification: Polymyositis causes symmetric proximal muscle weakness, typically developing over weeks to months, and is an inflammatory process. Lack of skin rash suggests it's less likely than dermatomyositis; still, inflammatory myopathies remain in the differential due to the pattern of weakness.\n4. Diagnosis: Metabolic Myopathy (e.g., mitochondrial myopathy)\nJustification: Metabolic causes can present with progressive weakness, especially in adult-onset cases.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of progressive, predominantly proximal muscle weakness over several months, with observable muscle atrophy and difficulty with activities such as lifting and climbing stairs\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Inclusion Body Myositis\nJustification: The gradual, progressive proximal muscle weakness involving both upper and lower limbs, with observable muscle atrophy, is characteristic. Inclusion body myositis typically affects older adults but can occur at various ages, presenting with both proximal and distal weakness and muscle wasting. Its insidious progression and lack of significant pain or systemic inflammation fit this clinical picture. The involvement of distal muscles and asymmetry are typical features that can differentiate it from other idiopathic myopathies.\n2. Diagnosis: Polymyositis\nJustification: As an inflammatory myopathy, polymyositis presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness over months, matching this patient\u2019s presentation. Although usually associated with elevated muscle enzymes and inflammatory signs, early or mild cases can appear less-inflammatory. Lack of skin rash favors polymyositis over dermatomyositis. It remains in the differential due to the pattern of symmetric weakness and muscle atrophy.\n3. Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis (less likely)\nJustification: Dermatomyositis typically involves skin manifestations and muscle weakness, but the absence of rash and systemic findings makes it less probable. However, muscle weakness pattern aligns, so it remains a differential but less likely currently.\n4. Diagnosis: Muscular Dystrophy (e.g., limb-girdle or other forms)\nJustification: Hereditary muscular dystrophies can present with progressive proximal and sometimes distal weakness, muscle atrophy, and no inflammatory signs.

Diagnosis: Primary Neuromuscular Junction Disorder (e.g., myasthenia gravis)\nJustification: Typically causes fatigable weakness and fluctuates with activity, not steadily progressive, and usually spares muscle bulk early on.
