Prevalence is high in various age groups and risk populations, making it the most urgent concern.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral (Aseptic) Meningitis\nJustification: Similar symptoms to bacterial meningitis but typically more benign; onset and systemic symptoms support this, especially if less ill-appearing, and common in young adults.\n3. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nJustification: Sudden \"thunderclap\" headache with neck stiffness can suggest hemorrhage; however, the presence of systemic features like chills and vomiting leans more toward meningitis, and no mention of neurological deficits or trauma.\n4. Diagnosis: Encephalitis\nJustification: Headache, systemic signs, and neck discomfort could suggest brain inflammation; less likely without altered mental status, but important to consider.\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with Neck Stiffness\nJustification: Severe headache with neck discomfort may mimic migraines; however, systemic symptoms and severity point away from this as primary cause.\n6. Diagnosis: Cervical Spine Pathology (e.g., cervical disc herniation, meningitis secondary to cervical pathology)\nJustification: Neck pain and stiffness are prominent; less likely without neurological deficits or trauma, but possible.\n7. Diagnosis: Sinusitis with Secondary Headache\nJustification: Chills and systemic symptoms could fit sinus infection, but less likely to cause neck stiffness and vomiting in such severity.\n8. Diagnosis: Septicemia with Secondary Meningeal Involvement\nJustification: Systemic signs and symptoms suggest possible sepsis; meningitis can be secondary to hematogenous spread.\n9.

Diagnosis: Bacterial meningitis\nJustification: Acute onset of severe headache, neck stiffness, chills, vomiting, and fatigue are hallmark features of bacterial meningitis. The rapid progression and systemic signs support an infectious inflammation of the meninges, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The diffuse head and neck pain, especially with limited neck mobility, are classic, and the unilateral prominence could suggest an early local complication or adjacent infection.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral meningitis\nJustification: Similar symptoms of headache, neck stiffness, and systemic symptoms exist in viral meningitis, generally less severe in progression but still causes significant discomfort. It ranks second due to the systemic symptoms and acute presentation but is somewhat less likely to be bacterial given the severity; however, initial presentation can be indistinguishable without CSF studies.\n3. Diagnosis: Cervical lymphadenitis or abscess\nJustification: Unilateral prominence of symptoms could suggest adjacent lymph node infection or abscess, especially in the neck. The limited neck mobility and localized neck pain support this, but the systemic symptoms like chills and vomiting are more typical of meningitis, so while possible, this ranks lower.\n4. Diagnosis: Meningeal tumor or mass (e.g., glioma, abscess)\nJustification: Less likely in an acute setting but can present with neck stiffness and headache if there is increased intracranial pressure or local mass effect. The systemic symptoms and rapid onset favor infectious causes over neoplastic ones.\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine\nJustification: While migraine can cause headache with nausea and vomiting, it typically lacks systemic signs like chills and neck stiffness. The severity and systemic features make migraine unlikely as the primary diagnosis at this stage but cannot be entirely excluded without further details.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Bacterial meningitis\nJustification: Presents with acute onset of diffuse headache and neck stiffness, systemic features like chills and vomiting, and significant neck rigidity\u2014classic signs of bacterial meningitis requiring prompt treatment. The severity and rapid progression of symptoms make this the highest priority. The unilateral pain and stiffness do not exclude meningitis, and the immune response causing meningeal inflammation aligns with this presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral meningitis\nJustification: Similar early features to bacterial meningitis, such as headache, neck stiffness, and systemic symptoms; generally less severe but still significant. Less likely than bacterial meningitis given the severity and systemic features but remains an important differential because some viral types can cause similarly acute presentations in children.\n3. Diagnosis: Viral (aseptic) meningitis\nJustification: A subtype of viral meningitis manifested with less aggressive symptoms but still includes headache, neck stiffness, and systemic illness.

Diagnosis: Cervical spine pathology (e.g., cervical muscle strain or discogenic pain)\nJustification: Could cause neck pain and stiffness, but less likely given systemic features like chills and vomiting, and the diffuse headache.

Diagnosis: Bacterial meningitis\nJustification: The sudden, intense headache with neck stiffness, systemic symptoms such as chills and vomiting, and rapid onset within 24 hours strongly suggest bacterial meningitis. This condition can develop quickly and is associated with high morbidity if not treated promptly. The persistent and movement-aggravated neck stiffness aligns with meningeal inflammation, and the systemic features point toward infection spreading to the meninges.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral meningitis\nJustification: Similar initial presentation with headache and neck stiffness but typically less severe systemic symptoms and a more benign course. If bacterial meningitis is ruled out, viral causes are most common in childhood, especially if systemic symptoms are mild or atypical. However, the severity and rapid progression favor bacterial over viral.\n3. Diagnosis: Aseptic (viral) meningitis secondary to other infections\nJustification: Given systemic symptoms and meningeal signs, other viral causes or secondary inflammatory responses could be plausible. Less likely than primary viral meningitis but still possible, especially if initial bacterial workup is negative.\n4. Diagnosis: Meningeal carcinomatosis\nJustification: Unlikely in a previously healthy school-aged individual with acute symptoms, but possible if there was a history of malignancy. Currently, less probable due to acute onset and lack of history.\n5. Diagnosis: Cervical spine or muscular strain\nJustification: The presence of systemic symptoms and rapid progression make musculoskeletal causes less probable. Neck stiffness alone without systemic signs would favor this, but given the systemic signs, this is lower on the list.\nSTOP HERE.",
