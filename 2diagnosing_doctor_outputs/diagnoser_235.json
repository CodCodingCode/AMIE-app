Diagnosis: Vitreous Floaters\nJustification: Intermittent dark spots or shadows are characteristic of vitreous floaters, common in adults, especially with age-related vitreous degeneration, often stable over months.\n2. Diagnosis: Ocular Migraine (without aura)\nJustification: Brief visual disturbances like shadows and visual gaps may represent migraine aura phenomena; often episodic and fluctuating, with no persistent deficits.\n3. Diagnosis: Central or Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion\nJustification: Blurred vision and dark spots can be signs of retinal ischemia or hemorrhage; typically more sudden but can be episodic depending on microvascular status.\n4. Diagnosis: Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration\nJustification: Cold, blurred vision, and dark spots are characteristic; usually progresses slowly, common in adults with age-related changes.\n5. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) involving the visual cortex or retinal ischemia\nJustification: Brief episodes of vision loss or shadows suggest ischemic events, especially if vascular risk factors are present; requires prompt assessment.\n6. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis\nJustification: Visual disturbances with subtle shadowing; usually associated with pain and may involve visual acuity decline, but episodic brief episodes could be early or atypical.\n7. Diagnosis: Posterior Vitreous Detachment\nJustification: Common in adults, causes floaters and shadows, with subtle visual disturbances that may be stable or episodic.\n8. Diagnosis: Macular Hole or Pucker\nJustification: Blurred vision and localized darkening can result from structural macular changes; typically progressive but can be stable for months.\n9. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis with Occular Involvement\nJustification: Episodic visual disturbances may be retinal or optic nerve demyelination; especially in middle-aged adults, though longer history might be expected.\n10. Diagnosis: Intracranial Mass or Lesion Compressing Visual Pathways\nJustification: Less likely given no other neurological symptoms, but visual disturbances may be a presenting sign; red flag for further neurological workup.",

Diagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)\nJustification: Gradual onset of visual disturbances like blurred vision, shadows, and dark spots affecting tasks like reading and driving suggests macular degeneration, especially in older adults.\n2. Diagnosis: Vitreous Detachment or Vitreous Floaters\nJustification: Intermittent shadows and dark spots may be due to posterior vitreous detachment, common with age-related changes, often presenting with floaters and shadows.\n3. Diagnosis: Diabetic Retinopathy\nJustification: Visual symptoms with gradual progression could be associated with diabetic microvascular changes; relevant if patient has risk factors, though not specified.\n4. Diagnosis: Central Serous Chorioretinopathy\nJustification: Blurred vision and dark spots with gradual worsening could reflect serous detachment of the retina, commonly affecting middle-aged adults.\n5. Diagnosis: Optic Neuropathy (e.g., Glaucoma)\nJustification: Progressive visual field disturbances and difficulty with night vision may suggest early optic nerve damage, especially if peripheral vision is involved; absence of pain suggests non-inflammatory causes.\n6.

Diagnosis: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)\nJustification: Common in adults over 50; presents with gradual vision loss, blurriness, shadows, dark spots, especially with reading; progression over months aligns with early or intermediate AMD features.\n2. Diagnosis: Diabetic retinopathy\nJustification: Intermittent visual disturbances, shadows, dark spots, worsening over months; risk factors include diabetes; can cause transient vision issues and progressive impairment.\n3. Diagnosis: Retinal vein occlusion\nJustification: Can cause sudden or gradual vision loss, shadows, dark spots; associated with vascular risk factors; symptoms worsen over time if untreated.\n4. Diagnosis: Central or branch retinal artery occlusion\nJustification: Transient or sudden visual loss with shadowing; considered a \"red flag\" condition needing urgent evaluation.\n5. Diagnosis: Vitreous floaters or vitreous detachment with secondary retinal changes\nJustification: Floaters are common, but new or worsening shadows and dark spots raise suspicion for underlying retinal issues like tear or detachment.\n6. Diagnosis: Choroidal neovascularization in AMD\nJustification: Can cause new dark spots, shadowing; associated with AMD, especially in older adults; leads to progressive visual decline.\n7.

The symptoms\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)\nJustification: The gradual worsening of visual symptoms over months, especially affecting night vision and reading, and presence of dark spots and shadows are characteristic features of AMD. Typically affects middle-aged to older adults and presents with central vision disturbances, which align with the patient's description of visual changes impacting daily activities.\n2. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment or Tear\nJustification: Transient vision loss episodes (amaurosis fugax-like symptoms), shadows, and dark spots could suggest intermittent retinal detachment or vitreoretinal interface abnormalities. Although typically presenting with sudden onset, progressive detachments can have variable symptom patterns. No floaters or flashes reported, but the possibility remains prominent given visual symptoms' progression.\n3. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (Open-Angle)\nJustification: Worsening night vision and dark shadows may suggest peripheral or issues related to optic nerve damage seen in glaucoma. Chronic open-angle glaucoma can cause progressive visual field loss, often unnoticed until significant. The described symptoms could reflect early or moderate field deficits.\n4. Diagnosis: Optic Neuropathy (e.g., Ischemic or Other)\nJustification: Transient visual disturbances, especially with progressive worsening, might be due to ischemic optic neuropathy or chronic optic nerve pathology. Though typically associated with acute or localized field defects, some forms may present insidiously over months.\n5. Diagnosis: Cortical Visual Impairment (Occipital Cortex)\nJustification: Less likely but possible if the visual disturbances are cortical in origin, especially if initial ocular examinations are unremarkable, and symptoms include visual field deficits without ocular findings. The gradual progression over months aligns with possible cortical processes, though this is less probable given the overall presentation.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Retinal vascular insufficiency (e.g., transient ischemic retinopathy)\nJustification: The episodic nature of transient vision loss, shadows, and dark spots that worsen at night suggests ischemic episodes affecting the retina, especially in a vascular compromise context. The progression over months indicates ongoing vascular insufficiency, which can cause intermittent symptoms especially notable during activities or at night when perfusion may be compromised.\n2. Diagnosis: Retinitis pigmentosa\nJustification: The gradual worsening over months with visual disturbances more pronounced at night could be consistent with a degenerative retina disorder like retinitis pigmentosa. Although typically progressive with sustained visual decline, early stages can include night vision difficulties. The presence of shadows and dark spots could relate to peripheral retinal degeneration.\n3. Diagnosis: Ischemic optic neuropathy\nJustification: Transient episodes of vision loss, shadows, and worsening at night might point towards optic nerve ischemia. However, this usually presents with more acute or subacute visual field deficits rather than intermittent shadows unless secondary ischemia persists.\n4. Diagnosis: Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy\nJustification: Similar reasoning as above, more common in older individuals with vascular risk factors, presenting as sudden visual loss; transient episodes are less typical but cannot be entirely excluded, especially given worsening symptoms at night.\n5. Diagnosis: Visual pathway or cortical vascular lesion (e.g., occipital ischemia)\nJustification: Less common but possible if the visual disturbances are due to cortical ischemia affecting visual processing, especially considering episodic visual shadows and worsening over months, though typical presentations are more stable or progressive rather than episodic.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)\nJustification: The chronicity of visual disturbances, shadows, and dark spots, especially worsening at night and during demanding visual tasks, is characteristic of AMD. The presence of transient visual symptoms combined with progressive worsening suggests degenerative changes in the macula affecting central vision, a hallmark of AMD.\n2. Diagnosis: Diabetic Retinopathy\nJustification: If the patient has diabetes (not specified but relevant given the symptoms), the intermittent visual changes, shadows, and worsening over months could be due to microvascular damage. Nighttime prominence may relate to fluctuating blood glucose control affecting retinal blood flow.\n3. Diagnosis: Retinal Vein Occlusion\nJustification: The description of dark spots and shadows with recent progression could reflect a vascular occlusive event leading to sudden or fluctuating vision loss. The symptoms worsening over months support a slow or incomplete resolution of vascular compromise.\n4. Diagnosis: Ocular Ischemic Syndrome\nJustification: Chronic, intermittent visual disturbances worse at night and with visual demand, suggest ischemia to ocular tissues, especially if vascular risk factors like carotid artery disease or hypertension are present. Symptoms can include shadows and reduced vision.\n5. Diagnosis: Ocular Surface or Refractive Conditions (e.g., Dry Eye or Refractive Errors)\nJustification: Although less specific, symptoms worsening at night and during visual tasks can sometimes be due to dry eye or uncorrected refractive errors, which cause fluctuating vision especially in dim lighting or at night, although these are less likely to fully explain the worsening and transient loss.\nSTOP HERE.",
