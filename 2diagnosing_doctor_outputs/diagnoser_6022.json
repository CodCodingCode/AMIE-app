    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Partial Seizure (Focal Seizure with Impaired Awareness)\nJustification: The episodes involve brief loss of awareness, jerking movements, and association with activities like chewing/swallowing, which suggests focal seizure activity possibly involving the temporal or frontal lobes.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Temporal Lobe Epilepsy\nJustification: Symptoms such as automatisms, sensory phenomena, or auras related to chewing/swallowing points toward temporal lobe seizure focus.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Reflex Epilepsy\nJustification: The episodes are triggered specifically by a reflex activity (chewing or swallowing), characteristic of reflex epilepsies, which are provoked by specific stimuli or actions.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Dyskinesia\nJustification: Involves brief, recurrent episodes of abnormal movements, though typically not associated with loss of awareness; still worth considering given movement features.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)\nJustification: Given the context, especially if episodes are triggered or have unusual features, psychogenic events could mimic epileptic seizures.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia (e.g., Vasovagal Syncope)\nJustification: Brief loss of consciousness with possible motor activity can result from transient cerebral hypoperfusion, especially since episodes are triggered or associated with swallowing.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: Though more common in older individuals, TIA could present with brief neurological deficits, though less likely given her age and presentation.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Sinus or Oropharyngeal Activity-Induced Syncope\nJustification: Activities involving oropharyngeal activity could induce vasovagal responses, leading to brief loss of consciousness with movements.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Movement Disorder (e.g., Myoclonus)\nJustification: Recurrent quick jerks affecting face and arms could represent myoclonus episodes; however, loss of awareness would be less typical.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia or Metabolic Disturbance\nJustification: Fluctuations in metabolic parameters might cause episodic loss of awareness and jerking movements, particularly if episodes are linked to eating or activity.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Partial Seizure (Focal Seizure with Impaired Awareness) \u2013 due to episodes involving consciousness loss and focal motor activity.\n2. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy \u2013 because of the episodic nature linked to activities like chewing/swallowing.\n3. Reflex Epilepsy \u2013 triggered specifically by stimuli or actions like chewing or swallowing.\n4. Paroxysmal Dyskinesia \u2013 recurrent movement episodes that may resemble seizures.\n5. Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES) \u2013 episodes that could be psychogenic in origin, especially if inconsistent.\n6. Cardiac Arrhythmia/Vasovagal Syncope \u2013 brief episodes caused by transient cerebral hypoperfusion potentially triggered by swallowing.\n7. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) \u2013 brief neurological deficits, although less common in this age group.\n8. Activity-induced Syncope \u2013 physical activities like swallowing causing vagal-mediated syncope.\n9. Myoclonus \u2013 brief, involuntary jerks, although typically without loss of awareness.\n10. Hypoglycemia or Metabolic Disturbances \u2013 episodic neurological symptoms linked to metabolic factors, especially if episodes are meal-related.",

During episodes, she feels a tense or fluttering sensation in her head beforehand, and during the episodes she feels disconnected behind her eyes and unable to control her arm or face. Afterward, she feels shaky and tired, sometimes scared and worried about recurrence.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Partial (Focal) Seizures (with motor onset)\n   Justification: The episodes of brief loss of awareness with jerking movements, especially involving the arm and face, and the aura of a tense or fluttering sensation suggest focal seizures with motor features. Their occurrence during activities like chewing or swallowing aligns with focal onset seizures often triggered by specific stimuli.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)\n   Justification: The episodes are brief, with a subjective aura and post-episode fatigue, but no mention of cyanosis or tongue biting. The patient's awareness of feeling disconnected and emotional states post-episode might suggest a psychological component, common in PNES.\n\n3. Diagnosis: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)\n   Justification: While less typical in a young woman, transient neurological episodes involving motor components could suggest a TIA. However, the presence of specific seizure-like movements makes this less likely but worth considering.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\n   Justification: The tense or fluttering sensations in the head could reflect aura phenomena; however, migraines typically include visual or sensory aura, and the motor features are less prominent, making this less probable.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia causing Syncope\n   Justification: Palpitations and syncope-like episodes could be related to arrhythmias, but the jerking movements are less typical, so this is a lower probability.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Vestibular Disorder\n   Justification: Disconnection behind the eyes and tiredness post-episode might suggest vertigo or imbalance syndromes, but the motor jerks are atypical for vestibular disorders.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Rhythmic Movement Disorder\n   Justification: Usually occurs during sleep, less likely given the described episodes during activities like chewing, but some involuntary movements could be considered.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Movement Disorder (e.g., Tics or Myoclonus)\n   Justification: Brief jerks could suggest tics or other stereotyped movements, but the loss of awareness points away from simple tics.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Panic Attacks or Anxiety Disorder\n   Justification: Emotional sensations and subjective disconnection may reflect panic episodes, but the observed jerking movements are less typical of panic.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Structural Brain Lesion (e.g., tumor, malformation)\n    Justification: A structural abnormality could cause focal seizures, yet in a young woman without prior neurological history, this is less likely initially but should be considered if other causes are excluded.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Partial (focal) seizures\n2. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)\n3. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\n4. Migraine with aura\n5. Cardiac arrhythmia causing syncope\n6. Vestibular disorder\n7. Rhythmic movement disorder\n8. Movement disorder (e.g., tics, myoclonus)\n9. Panic attacks or anxiety disorder\n10. Structural brain lesion (e.g., tumor or malformation)",

Afterward, she feels shaky, tired, sometimes scared, and worried about recurrence. These episodes cause her to feel nervous about eating in front of others and affect her daily life.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Focal (partial) seizure disorder  \nJustification: The patient's episodes of loss of awareness, jerking movements, and aura-like sensations (fluttering and tension) particularly occurring with chewing or swallowing suggest seizure activity originating from a localized brain region, consistent with focal seizures.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES)  \nJustification: The emotional impact, awareness of the episodes, and the potential psychological triggers (social situations like eating in front of others) may point toward psychogenic events, especially if EEG findings are inconclusive.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura  \nJustification: The sensory premonitory symptoms (fluttering sensations, feelings of tension) and post-episode fatigue could align with migraine phenomena, although the motor involvement is less typical.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Syncope or vasovagal syncope  \nJustification: Brief episodes of loss of awareness may suggest fainting spells, especially if triggered by specific stimuli; however, the presence of jerking movements is less typical but still warrants consideration.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal dyskinesia  \nJustification: Recurrent involuntary movements triggered by specific activities and brief duration could suggest a movement disorder, although loss of awareness is less characteristic.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia-induced transient loss of consciousness  \nJustification: Sudden episodes with loss of awareness could imply reduced cerebral perfusion from arrhythmia, but the associated motor phenomena make seizure more likely.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic disorder with somatic symptoms  \nJustification: The patient's feelings of nervousness, fear of recurrence, and post-episode distress could reflect heightened anxiety, potentially manifesting as functional episodes.\n\n8. Diagnosis: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)  \nJustification: While more common in older patients, TIA can cause transient neurological deficits, but the age and symptom profile make this less probable.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Sleep-related movement disorders or episodes  \nJustification: Although less likely given no mention of sleep disturbance, some movement disorders are associated with arousals, and episodes could be mistaken for this.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Medication or substance-induced episodes  \nJustification: No mention of medication or substance use, but considering substances that can provoke neurological symptoms remains prudent.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Focal (partial) seizure disorder \u2013 due to episodes of loss of awareness, motor involvement, and sensory aura.\n2. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) \u2013 considering emotional factors, awareness, and social impact.\n3. Migraine with aura \u2013 possible given sensory premonitions and post-attack fatigue.\n4. Syncope or vasovagal syncope \u2013 episodes of transient loss of consciousness, although less typical with motor signs.\n5. Paroxysmal dyskinesia \u2013 episodic involuntary movements triggered by specific activities.\n6. Cardiac arrhythmia-induced transient ischemic attack \u2013 sudden momentary loss of consciousness with possible motor activity.\n7. Anxiety or panic disorder with somatic symptoms \u2013 episodes may be exacerbated by psychological stress.\n8. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) \u2013 brief neurological deficits, less likely but included for completeness.\n9.

She describes feeling tense or fluttering sensations in her head before the episodes. During the episodes, she feels disconnected behind her eyes and unable to control her arm or face. Afterward, she feels shaky, tired, and sometimes scared or upset, and worries about recurrence. The episodes cause her to feel nervous about eating in front of others and impact her daily life.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Focal Seizure (Sensorimotor/oral automatisms)\nJustification: The patient's episodes of brief loss of awareness with arm and face jerking, particularly triggered by chewing or swallowing, are characteristic of focal seizures originating in the motor cortex. The pre-ictal sensations (fluttering or tense feelings) and post-ictal fatigue and disorientation further support a seizure diagnosis. The patient's awareness impairment and automatisms (jerking) are typical features of focal seizures, especially focal impaired awareness seizures.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES)\nJustification: The episodes are brief, with a sense of disconnection behind the eyes, and the patient reports emotional distress\u2014scared and upset after episodes. She expresses anxiety related to social situations (eating in front of others), which could mediate psychogenic episodes. The triggers (chewing/swallowing) may be semi-volitional or associated with stress, and no mention of postictal confusional states typical of epileptic seizures. The lack of visual or generalized spread, and the context of emotional factors, also suggest PNES.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Tics or Functional Movement Disorders\nJustification: The sudden face and arm movements could suggest tics or functional movement disorder, especially if episodes are stereotyped and socially influenced. However, the lack of specific mention of premonitory urges or characteristic tics makes this less likely. Still, in young women with stress-related episodes, functional disorders remain a differential.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The pre-episode sensations (fluttering or tense feelings) could represent aura phenomena. However, the focal motor symptoms, loss of awareness, and post-episode fatigue are less characteristic when migraines are primarily visual or sensory. Given the episodic motor manifestations and consciousness impairment, migraine aura alone is less likely but remains a consideration.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Cardiac Syncope\nJustification: Although episodes involve loss of awareness, the motor features and duration favor a neurological source. Cardiac syncope typically presents with sudden loss of consciousness without seizure-like movements. The presence of pre-ictal sensations and post-episode fatigue lean away from syncope, but the symptom context warrants mention as a lower-probability consideration.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Focal Seizure (Sensorimotor/oral automatisms) \u2013 Highly probable given episodic motor automatisms, impaired awareness, and triggering by chewing/ swallowing.\n2. Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES) \u2013 Possible considering emotional distress, psychological factors, and episodes not fitting typical epileptic patterns.\n3. Tics or Functional Movement Disorder \u2013 Considered due to stereotyped movements, especially if episodes are contextually linked with stress, though less specific here.\n4. Migraine with Aura \u2013 Possible given pre-episode sensory phenomena, though less consistent with motor automatisms and impairment of awareness.\n5. Cardiac Syncope \u2013 Less likely but included due to episodic loss of consciousness; features less consistent with true syncope but cannot be entirely excluded without additional testing.",

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Focal Seizure (Neural or Temporal Lobe Epilepsy)\nJustification: The patient's episodes of brief loss of awareness, combined with ictal motor manifestations such as arm and face jerking, are characteristic of focal seizures, likely originating in the temporal lobe. The pre-ictal sensations of tension or fluttering suggest aura phenomena common in partial seizures. The fact that episodes are triggered or exacerbated by chewing/swallowing (automatisms) further supports seizure activity. Post-ictal symptoms like shakiness, tiredness, and emotional disturbances are typical following seizures.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)\nJustification: The patient's awareness loss and motor movements could tentatively be psychogenic if episodes are inconsistent or triggered by emotional stress\u2014she reports fear and anxiety related to episodes. Her age and psychosocial impact, along with the fact that episodes are related to social situations (eating with others), raise suspicion. PNES can mimic epileptic seizures but often lack electrographic correlation. The emotional aftermath and anxiety about recurrence may be features of a conversion or somatization disorder.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder with Somatic Manifestations\nJustification: The pre-episode sensations (fluttering, tension) combined with post-episode shakiness and distress suggest heightened anxiety states. Anxiety disorders can manifest with episodic somatic symptoms, including tremors, feelings of disconnection, and panic-like sensations. The patient's avoidance behaviors (nervousness about eating in front of others) further support an anxiety component, possibly exacerbating or mimicking seizure-like episodes.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Cardiac or Vasovagal Syncope\nJustification: Though episodes are described as brief and involve loss of awareness with motor activity, vasovagal syncope can sometimes produce brief blackouts with convulsive movements. However, the presence of pre-ictal sensory symptoms and post-episode fatigue makes this less likely, but it remains a differential to consider given episodes' situational triggers (eating). Usually, syncope episodes are longer and associated with prodromal lightheadedness, but the description warrants consideration.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The pre-episode sensations of tension or fluttering could be early migraine aura phenomena. Migraines can involve neurological symptoms, sometimes including sensory disruptions or even motor components, reminiscent of seizure activity. However, the episodic motor jerks are less characteristic of migraines, but given the patient's age and presenting nervousness, migraine aura remains a less likely but possible consideration.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Focal Seizure (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy)\n2. Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures\n3. Anxiety or Panic Disorder with Somatic Symptoms\n4. Vasovagal Syncope\n5. Migraine with Aura",

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Focal Seizure (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy)\nJustification: The patient\u2019s episodes of brief loss of awareness, jerking movements of the face and arm, especially during chewing or swallowing, are characteristic features of focal seizures originating in the temporal lobe. The pre-ictal sensations of tension or fluttering in her head and feeling disconnected behind her eyes support a seizure focus emanating from temporal structures. Post-ictal symptoms such as tiredness, shakiness, and emotional distress further align with seizure activity. The specific trigger associated with eating or swallowing suggests a perceptible seizure onset related to or triggered by activity involving the oropharynx.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES)\nJustification: The emotional component\u2014feeling scared, upset, and anxious after episodes\u2014along with episodes that are variable and influenced by social situations (e.g., eating in front of others) raises suspicion for a psychogenic origin. No specific mention of abnormal EEG findings, but timing with emotional stressors and psychological triggers can support this diagnosis. Sometimes, these episodes imitate epileptic seizures but are psychologically mediated.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Movement Disorder (such as Dystonia or Myoclonus)\nJustification: The facial and arm jerking, particularly when triggered by swallowing or chewing, may be explained by a movement disorder. While less likely given the length and episodic nature, some movement disorders can mimic seizures, especially if triggered by specific activities. However, the presence of pre-ictal sensations and post-episode emotional states make this less probable but still worth considering in differential.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Tics or Functional Movement Disorders\nJustification: Tics can involve facial and limb movements that are involuntary and can be exacerbated by stress, but they often have a repetitive, stereotyped quality and may improve with distraction. The report of sensations like fluttering and the emotional aftermath might be more consistent with a functional disorder but are less specific here; their episodic nature makes this diagnosis less likely as primary.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Syncope (Vasovagal or Situational)\nJustification: While episodes involving loss of awareness and post-episode tiredness could suggest syncope, the presence of motor activity (jerks) and pre-ictal sensations are less consistent with typical syncope. Syncope usually involves fainting without the tonic-clonic movements seen here, making this diagnosis less probable but still a consideration.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Focal Seizure (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy): The clinical features\u2014brief altered awareness, facial and arm jerking, triggering during chewing/swallowing, pre-ictal sensations of tension, and post-ictal exhaustion\u2014are classic for temporal lobe seizures. The episodic nature and impact on daily function strongly support this diagnosis.\n\n2. Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES): Emotional triggers, post-episode fear and upset, and the context of social eating situations suggest a possible psychogenic component. The variability and emotional aftermath are characteristic.\n\n3. Paroxysmal Movement Disorder (Dystonia/Myoclonus): Although less probable, episodic involuntary movements triggered by swallowing could reflect a movement disorder mimicking seizures; however, the associated sensory and emotional features lean away from purely movement phenomena.\n\n4. Functional Movement Disorder or Tics: The involuntary facial and arm movements, especially linked to stress or specific activities, could represent functional or tic-related phenomena, though the episodic pattern and sensory premonitions favor seizure etiology.\n\n5. Syncope (Vasovagal or Situational): Less likely given the motor components and premonitory sensations, but the post-episode tiredness and feeling of disconnection could sometimes be seen in post-faint states, warranting consideration until further testing.\n\nFurther investigation with EEG, neuroimaging, and possibly psychological assessment would help clarify these possibilities.",
