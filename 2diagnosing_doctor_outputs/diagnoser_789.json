    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult presenting with severe emotional distress, heaviness, agitation, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, internal agitation, sensory overload, fatigue, and reactive, emotionally charged responses. The timeline indicates worsening over the past week, suggesting an acute or subacute episode. The symptoms imply a significant emotional or psychiatric disorder, with potential organic or neurological contributors to consider. Depression is common with such features, but rapid onset and agitation raise concern for other causes. The sensory overload and internal agitation may also point toward anxiety or mood disorders, but the severity and distress suggest considering a range of psychiatric and medical conditions. There are no specific red flags for medical emergencies like psychosis, substance intoxication, or neurological deficits, but these should always be kept in mind. The differential prioritizes common psychiatric diagnoses with acute onset and red flag considerations for serious conditions.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Severe Justification: The patient's features of persistent poor appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and emotional distress over a week suggest a depressive episode; the severity and worsening condition point to a major depressive episode, which is common and often presents with somatic and emotional symptoms.  2. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The internal agitation, sensory overload, and emotional reactivity are consistent with anxiety, especially with worsening over a week, which could represent an anxiety disorder exacerbation.  3. Diagnosis: Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood Justification: The recent onset (past week) of distress in response to potential stressors and reactive emotional responses suggest an adjustment disorder as a plausible explanation.  4. Diagnosis: Acute Stress Reaction Justification: The sudden increase in agitation, sensory overload, and distress over a short period are characteristic of acute stress response, especially if triggered by recent stressors or events not detailed here.  5. Diagnosis: Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode Justification: While less clear without history of mood elevation, the severity of internal agitation and distress could be part of a bipolar depressive episode, particularly if there are episodic mood swings.  6. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Mood or Anxiety Disorder Justification: Considering possible substance effects contributing to emotional distress, agitation, and disturbances; however, no specific substance use is indicated here.  7. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Justification: If recent trauma or stressors are present, the reactivity and distress could be part of PTSD, especially with hyperarousal and emotional reactivity; lacking trauma history limits certainty.  8. Diagnosis: Frontotemporal Dementia (early) Justification: Less likely given the patient's age and rapid onset; symptoms don't focus on cognitive deficits but emotional disturbances, making this less probable.  9. Diagnosis: Medical Illness such as Thyrotoxicosis Justification: Severe emotional agitation and fatigue could sometimes be manifestations of hyperthyroidism; however, more physical symptoms (e.g., weight loss, heat intolerance) are typically evident.  10. Diagnosis: Psychotic Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified Justification: No hallucinations or delusions are reported, making psychosis less likely, but disturbance could suggest a prodromal or atypical presentation if other features emerge.

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with eye redness, swelling, and tearing starting 2 days ago after playing soccer. These symptoms suggest an ocular condition likely related to trauma or infection. Given the recent sports activity, trauma or infectious causes like conjunctivitis or traumatic injury are high on the list. The absence of symptoms like vision loss or severe pain makes some diagnoses less likely. \"Can't miss\" diagnoses include corneal abrasion, conjunctivitis, or orbital cellulitis. Common causes in this context include minor trauma-induced conjunctivitis or eyelid edema, and less common but serious conditions like orbital cellulitis must be considered.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Redness and tearing are hallmark symptoms; recent outdoor activity may predispose to viral conjunctivitis, common and highly prevalent.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Eye redness, swelling, tearing after playing soccer suggests possible trauma leading to superficial corneal injury, which is common in sports.  3. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Eye swelling and redness post-sport could indicate infection spreading behind the eyelid; red flags include swelling, warmth, and proximity to trauma.  4. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: Viral keratitis can cause eye redness, tearing, and swelling, particularly in young or immunocompetent individuals; triggers include trauma or stress.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid inflammation presenting with redness and swelling could be part of this common disorder; often associated with tear disturbance.  6. Diagnosis: Chalazion or Hordeolum (stye) Justification: Localized eyelid swelling after trauma or activity; can cause redness and swelling, though less likely to cause tearing unless infected.  7. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Can cause tearing and redness; less likely if symptoms started after playing soccer unless associated with environmental allergens.  8. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid hematoma Justification: Swelling and redness after physical activity strongly suggest trauma-related bleeding into eyelid tissues.  9. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Present with eyelid swelling and redness; less severe than orbital cellulitis but important to distinguish.  10. Diagnosis: Glaucoma (acute angle-closure) Justification: Typically causes eye redness and tearing but more severe pain, halos, and vision changes; less consistent with the scenario but included as a \"red flag\" diagnosis to consider if other features appear.",

    "input": "The patient presents with significant emotional distress and sensory overload symptoms, including feelings of heaviness, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and heightened sensitivity to sound and light. While the patient reports these symptoms in vague terms, they are likely experiencing more severe physical and emotional symptoms than expressed, including substantial fatigue and potential anxiety or depression. The current presentation suggests a worsening trajectory over several days, necessitating detailed sensory and emotional assessment to determine the full extent of impairment and to guide management.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of emotional distress, sensory overload, feelings of heaviness, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and heightened sensory sensitivity suggests a psychiatric condition with possible physiological components. The worsening over several days indicates an acute or subacute process. The symptoms overlap with mood and anxiety disorders, autonomic or sensory processing issues, and possibly neurological or endocrine dysfunctions. The key features include emotional distress, sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Based on the pattern, the most probable diagnoses should be prioritized, considering both psychiatric and neurological etiologies, with attention to conditions that can produce similar sensory overload and mood symptoms.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder with atypical features Justification: The patient reports decreased appetite, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and emotional distress, all common in depression. Although not explicitly stated, the worsening over days and support for significant impairment suggest a depressive episode, possibly with atypical features given the sensory sensitivity and heaviness feelings, which are common in atypical depression.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety disorder (including panic or generalized anxiety disorder) Justification: The heightened sensitivity to sound and light, emotional distress, and sensory overload are characteristic of anxiety or panic spectrum disorders. These symptoms can precipitate or coexist with depressive symptoms, explaining the emotional distress.  3. Diagnosis: Sensory Processing Disorder or Autonomic Dysregulation Justification: The description of heightened sensory sensitivity, hypersensitivity to light and sound, and sensory overload points toward a disorder involving sensory processing or autonomic dysregulation, which can manifest with emotional and physical symptoms.  4. Diagnosis: Post-viral or functional neurological disorder Justification: In some cases, after viral illnesses or stress, patients develop neuropsychiatric symptoms including sensory overload, fatigue, and mood disturbances. If the worsening pattern fits, this could be considered, especially if other signs of neurological involvement exist.  5. Diagnosis: Early-onset bipolar disorder or cyclothymia (less likely) Justification: While mood fluctuations could be consistent, the description does not explicitly mention mania or hypomania, but mood instability remains a differential, especially if emotional distress swings are observed.

    "input": "The patient presents with significant sensory overload symptoms, including heightened sensitivity to auditory and visual stimuli, accompanied by emotional distress and physical symptoms such as heaviness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Communication is limited and stereotyped, suggesting that the actual severity of sensory and emotional symptoms is likely greater than reported. The course appears to have worsened over several days, with ongoing distress that may encompass anxiety or depressive features. Further comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the full impact and underlying causes of these symptoms.",
    "output": "THINKING: Symptoms of sensory overload involving heightened sensitivity to auditory and visual stimuli, emotional distress, fatigue, and sleep disturbance are characteristic of neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric conditions. The patient's communication limitations and stereotyped behaviors suggest a neurodevelopmental disorder. The gradual worsening over days and emotional distress also raise concern for comorbid anxiety or depression. The core pattern appears consistent with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), possibly with associated sensory processing issues. Other considerations include primary psychiatric conditions like anxiety or mood disorders, but these are less probable given the specific sensory and behavioral features. The severity and progression point toward ASD with sensory integration dysfunction as the most probable diagnosis, with secondary features of anxiety or distress.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with sensory processing issues Justification: The presentation of significant sensory overload (auditory and visual hypersensitivity), stereotyped communication, emotional distress, and physical symptoms such as heaviness and fatigue strongly support ASD. The limited communication and stereotyped behaviors are hallmark features. The progression over days suggests worsening sensory overload rather than primary mood or anxiety disorder alone. The combination of these features aligns closely with ASD, especially with sensory processing dysfunction.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder or sensory-related anxiety) Justification: The emotional distress and ongoing discomfort could reflect secondary anxiety. The worsening course and distress suggest an anxiety component exacerbating sensory overload, although not solely explaining the core sensory and behavioral features. Anxiety is common in ASD, but here it appears secondary, making it a plausible but less primary diagnosis.  3. Diagnosis: Mood disorder, such as depression or dysthymia Justification: Fatigue, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress could signal depression. However, the prominent sensory overload and stereotyped behaviors are less typical of primary mood disorders, placing this lower in probability compared to neurodevelopmental conditions.  4. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or trauma-related disorder Justification: If there is a history of trauma, hypersensitivity and distress could be trauma-related. However, no mention of prior trauma or specific triggers is provided, making this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Primary psychotic or psychotic-spectrum disorder Justification: While sensory overload can be seen in some psychoses, the stereotyped, neurodevelopmental pattern and absence of hallucinations or delusions make primary psychosis less probable at this stage.

    "input": "The patient presents with sensory hypersensitivity symptoms, including heightened responses to auditory and visual stimuli, accompanied by physical signs such as heaviness and difficulty breathing, as well as sleep disturbances and fatigue. Communication suggests that these symptoms may be more severe, prolonged, and disabling than currently reported, with underlying emotional distress possibly contributing. The patient's responses indicate possible emotional or cognitive barriers that lead to minimization of symptom intensity, necessitating further detailed assessment to fully understand the impact and underlying factors.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of sensory hypersensitivity with heightened responses to auditory and visual stimuli, along with physical signs like heaviness and difficulty breathing, points toward a neurophysiological or neuropsychiatric disorder that involves sensory processing abnormalities. The sleep disturbances and fatigue suggest an ongoing systemic or neuropsychiatric impact. The description of emotional distress and potential minimization indicates possible emotional or cognitive barriers affecting self-reporting. Differential diagnoses like anxiety disorders, sensory processing disorder, or mood disorders are considered, but the prominent sensory hypersensitivity, physical responses, and their persistence point most strongly toward a diagnosis involving sensory modulation dysfunction, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or a related neurodevelopmental condition. Given the adult presentation and symptoms, sensory processing disorder with comorbid emotional distress appears most fitting. Excluding other neuropsychiatric or medical conditions, the presented pattern aligns best with ASD or a related sensory modulation disorder, especially considering the severity and impact on functioning.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate to high confidence, based on symptom pattern and physical signs meeting criteria for sensory processing issues, though confirmation via structured assessment is ideal. - Missing information: Formal assessment of developmental history, standardized sensory profiles, and ruling out medical causes. - Clinical coherence: The symptoms are well-explained by a sensory modulation disorder, possibly within an ASD spectrum. - Diagnostic criteria: Meets the criteria for sensory processing disorder, with possible overlap with ASD; formal diagnosis requires comprehensive assessment.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: The symptoms predominantly indicate a sensory modulation disorder, consistent with ASD traits, but definitive diagnosis requires further evaluation. - Information sufficiency: Not entirely sufficient; additional structured assessments and developmental history needed. - Risk tolerance: Some need for additional testing before definitive diagnosis, but clinical judgment supports provisional identification. - Clinical urgency: The patient's functional impairment warrants prompt recognition and intervention, though diagnostic closure based on current data seems appropriate.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No, due to need for further assessments. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No.\nANSWER: Sensory Processing Disorder (possibly within Autism Spectrum Disorder) END",
