    "input": "An adult patient presents with recent onset of symptoms described as irregular heartbeat and chest pressure beginning approximately one week prior to the visit. The patient reports experiencing episodes that she perceives as bothersome, but her descriptions are vague and hesitant, indicating potential underreporting or exaggeration influenced by anxiety. There is no current report of dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath, or syncope; however, such symptoms may be unrecognized or withheld. The true severity, frequency, and associated symptoms are unclear and require further detailed history-taking and diagnostic evaluation to accurately characterize the clinical situation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult with recent onset of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure over approximately one week. She perceives episodes as bothersome but is hesitant and vague, suggesting possible anxiety or somatic preoccupation. No current symptoms like dizziness or syncope are reported, but these could be unrecognized or underreported. The differential must prioritize common and serious causes of palpitations and chest discomfort, considering cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychological causes. Anxiety or panic disorder is common and can mimic cardiac symptoms. Cardiac arrhythmias, ischemia, and structural heart disease are important to consider given the chest pressure and irregular heartbeat, but no red flags like syncope or exertional symptoms are noted. Other less common causes like hyperthyroidism or medication effects are possible but less likely without further data.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Justification: Irregular heartbeat episodes suggest possible arrhythmias; SVT is common in adults, presenting with palpitations and chest pressure, often episodic and perceived as bothersome.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic disorder Justification: Vague, hesitant descriptions combined with perceived episodes, and absence of overt red flags, point toward anxiety-related symptoms mimicking cardiac issues.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Justification: Irregular heartbeat episodes are characteristic; onset over a week suggests possible paroxysmal AF, common in adults, especially those with cardiovascular risk factors (though not specified).  4. Diagnosis: Non-cardiac chest pain (gastroesophageal reflux disease or musculoskeletal) Justification: Chest pressure with vague symptoms may be related to GERD or musculoskeletal sources; common causes of chest discomfort in adults.  5. Diagnosis: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or other ectopic beats Justification: Palpitations due to ectopy can cause irregular sensations; often benign but sometimes associated with underlying heart disease.  6. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism Justification: Hyperthyroidism can cause palpitations, irregular heartbeat, and chest discomfort; common in adults, particularly women.  7. Diagnosis: Structural heart disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy, valvular disease) Justification: Potential underlying cause for arrhythmias and chest pressure; however, absence of red flag symptoms makes it less likely initially.  8. Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease (unstable angina) Justification: Chest pressure l:ikely important to consider, especially in adults, but less likely without exertional symptoms or other risk factors described.  9. Diagnosis: Medication or substance-induced arrhythmia Justification: Drugs like stimulants or caffeine can cause palpitations and irregular rhythms; no history provided, so less probable.  10. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism Justification: Although serious, absence of dyspnea, chest pain, or risk factors makes PE less likely; nonetheless important to rule out in worse-case scenarios.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is likely a young individual who has experienced eye redness, swelling, and tearing for 2 days after playing soccer. The recent activity suggests possible trauma or infection related to increased exposure or injury during sports. The absence of mention of pain severity or visual changes suggests that some diagnoses may be less urgent but still need consideration. Common causes in this context include conjunctivitis, trauma-related conditions, or eyelid infections. Serious conditions like orbital cellulitis or globe injury must be considered due to the severity and red flags. Based on prevalence, conjunctivitis and minor trauma are most probable, while orbital cellulitis and penetrating injuries are less likely but can't be missed.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness are hallmark signs; common post-exposure or infectious cause, especially in active young individuals. It\u2019s the most common cause of conjunctival symptoms after activity.  2. Diagnosis: Eyelid contusion or superficial trauma Justification: Recent soccer play increases risk of blunt trauma, which can cause eyelid swelling and redness. Symptoms onset within days supports trauma-related injury.  3. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can result from inflammation of eyelid margins, often associated with tearing, common in active or younger patients.  4. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden onset redness localized to the sclera, often following minor trauma or increased intraocular pressure, compatible with recent activity.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Tearing and redness can result from allergic response; however, less likely given recent trauma/sport activity unless exposure to allergens.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Swelling, redness, tearing could be signs; but less likely without systemic signs like fever or pain beyond the eye, especially after recent activity.  7. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or foreign body Justification: Trauma during sports can cause corneal epithelial injury, leading to redness, tearing, and swelling; requires further ophthalmic assessment.  8. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness can occur without eye involvement; need to distinguish from orbital cellulitis, less common in isolated sports injury without systemic signs.  9. Diagnosis: Glaucoma or acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Typically presents with eye redness and tearing but often with pain, vision changes, and halos\u2014less likely here given the recent sports context and no mention of pain.  10. Diagnosis: Penetrating ocular injury Justification: Traumatic origin suggests possibility; however, no specific signs of trauma or visual compromise described, making it less likely but still critical to exclude.

    "input": "An adult female patient presents with episodic sensations of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure, which she reports commenced approximately one to two weeks ago. Her account indicates the episodes involve rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, but she is uncertain about the exact timing and frequency, suggesting the possibility of more frequent or persistent episodes than reported. She exhibits emotional distress and hesitancy, which may influence her perception and reporting of symptoms. Objective evaluation is required to clarify the true nature, frequency, and severity of her episodes, and to identify any underlying arrhythmia or cardiac pathology.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's episodic sensations of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure, initiating within one to two weeks, accompanied by rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, dizziness, and lightheadedness, suggest a possible cardiac arrhythmia or other cardiac pathology. Her emotional distress could influence symptom perception, but objective evaluation is needed to clarify the nature of her episodes. Considering the symptom pattern and duration, primary differential diagnoses include arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, structural heart disease, anxiety or panic attacks, or less likely, early signs of ischemic heart disease. Immediate risk is somewhat low given no mention of syncope, exertional symptoms, or prior cardiac history, but the possibility of a serious arrhythmia warrants prioritization.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Justification: The episodes involve rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and lightheadedness, aligning with typical SVT presentations. The episodic nature, sudden onset, and duration fit common SVT patterns, especially in young to middle-aged women. Emotional distress could trigger or exacerbate episodes, and the tachycardia explains the palpitations and chest discomfort.  2. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Disorder Justification: The patient's emotional distress, hesitance, and uncertain symptom frequency suggest possible anxiety-related symptoms. Physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, chest tightness, dizziness can mimic cardiac arrhythmia but may be functional in origin. Her distress may also heighten perception of symptoms, making anxiety a plausible de facto diagnosis or comorbid condition.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial Arrhythmia (e.g., Atrial Flutter or Atrial Fibrillation) Justification: The presentation of irregular heartbeat and chest pressure can reflect atrial arrhythmias, especially if episodes are irregular and recurrent. While more common in older populations, they can occur in middle-aged women and may cause similar symptoms, necessitating further evaluation.  4. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy or ischemia) Justification: While less likely given short symptom duration and lack of prior history, structural issues could manifest as new-onset palpitations and chest pressure, especially if episodes escalate or are associated with other risk factors not specified here.  5. Diagnosis: Early-stage Ischemic Heart Disease Justification: Although chest pressure and dizziness warrant consideration of ischemia, the one to two-week duration with episodic symptoms in absence of typical risk factors or exertional triggers makes this less likely initially but still a differential, pending diagnostic tests.",

    "input": "An adult female patient reports episodes characterized by rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which she initially states have been occurring for about one to two weeks but may have begun earlier and more frequently. She exhibits emotional distress and hesitance that likely influence her symptom description, potentially leading to underestimation of severity and frequency. Objective findings suggest recurrent episodes consistent with potential arrhythmic events, although precise timing, triggers, and duration remain unclear due to communication barriers. Further diagnostic assessment is recommended to establish the exact nature and significance of these episodes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with episodes involving palpitations, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath lasting one to two weeks, possibly earlier and more frequent. Emotional distress may influence symptom perception, but objective findings suggest arrhythmia. Differential diagnoses include cardiac (arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome), benign causes (panic attack, anxiety), and less likely but possible causes (electrolyte disturbances, structural heart disease). The most probable are primary causes related to arrhythmia, given the symptom profile and duration, with anxiety/panic being a common differential, especially considering emotional distress. The pattern and features point toward a cardiac arrhythmia as the top priority, but anxiety remains a differential due to emotional distress and symptom overlap. Critical to refine probabilities based on symptom evolution, clinical clues, and typical presentation patterns.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Justification: The episodes of rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath strongly suggest a recurrent arrhythmia. SVT often presents with sudden-onset palpitations and associated symptoms, fitting the clinical pattern, especially considering the recent onset and episodic nature. The distress and rapid heartbeat are characteristic; further diagnostic testing like ECG or Holter monitoring is needed.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Attack / Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's emotional distress and hesitance may contribute to or mimic cardiac symptoms. Anxiety-related episodes can produce similar cardiorespiratory symptoms, especially if episodes are recurrent and have psychological triggers. This remains a significant differential, particularly if arrhythmias are not confirmed by diagnostics, and given her emotional state.  3. Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Justification: Given the duration of symptoms (up to two weeks) and the presentation of irregular, rapid palpitations, AFib is possible. However, less likely as initial episodes are more characteristic of paroxysmal SVT, but persistent or recurrent episodes require ruling out AFib with ECG.  4. Diagnosis: Structural Heart Disease (e.g., ischemic heart disease) Justification: Chest pressure and dyspnea raise concern for ischemic causes, especially if risk factors are present. While less consistent with the brief, episodic presentation unless episodes are prolonged or associated with exertion, this differential should be considered, especially if initial tests support it.  5. Diagnosis: Electrolyte Imbalance or Other Cardiac Conditions (e.g., Long QT syndrome) Justification: Less likely but possible causes of arrhythmias or symptoms include electrolyte disturbances or inherited arrhythmia syndromes, especially if episodes are triggered or associated with specific circumstances. These are lower probability but remain important considerations pending further workup.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult female presenting with episodes of rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, and shortness of breath occurring over the past one to two weeks, with some uncertainty about the onset date. She reports the episodes as sudden, lasting a few minutes, with symptoms such as sweating and sensation of the heart racing or skipping beats, predominantly in the evenings or during stress. Due to communication biases, these symptoms may be underreported in terms of severity or frequency. Objective clinical findings are pending further investigation, but the clinical picture is consistent with potential arrhythmic or autonomic events. Additional detailed symptom assessment is necessary to determine the exact nature, frequency, and triggers of these episodes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of episodes with rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating, and sensations of palpitations, occurring suddenly and lasting a few minutes, is characteristic of paroxysmal arrhythmic events, likely paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) or atrial tachyarrhythmia. The episodes being triggered or provoked during stress and in the evening further supports an autonomic component. The symptoms align with a possible arrhythmic cause rather than purely anxiety or a non-cardiac explanation, especially given objective features described. Excluding other causes such as panic disorder, autonomic dysregulation, or structural heart disease is crucial, but current evidence favors an arrhythmia as the primary diagnosis.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: Sudden episodes of rapid heartbeat, chest pressure, dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating, sensation of heart racing or skipping; lasting minutes; episodes occur predominantly in the evenings or during stress. - Timeline and progression: Symptoms onset 1-2 weeks ago, with uncertain exact start date, indicating recent development. - Clinical pattern recognition: Features suggestive of paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia (e.g., PSVT, atrial tachycardia). - Supporting evidence: Typical presentation and description consistent with electrical disturbance of the heart. - Excluding alternatives: Anxiety or panic disorder less likely given objective cardiac symptoms; structural causes are uncertain pending diagnostics but less likely the primary cause.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate to high confidence that an arrhythmic cause, likely paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, is primary, based on symptom pattern and clinical description. - Missing information: Objective electrocardiogram (ECG) during an episode or ambulatory monitoring is needed for definitive confirmation. - Clinical coherence: The diagnosis coherently explains the episodes and associated symptoms. - Diagnostic criteria: Episodes consistent with criteria for paroxysmal tachycardia.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Likely arrhythmic, probably PSVT, but confirmation pending further testing. - Information sufficiency: Additional diagnostics (e.g., Holter monitor, event recorder) are required for definitive diagnosis. - Risk tolerance: Proceeding with diagnostic testing before definitive treatment is advisable; immediate treatment based solely on suspicion is not ideal. - Clinical urgency: The potential for arrhythmia warrants prompt evaluation but not urgent intervention before diagnosis confirmation.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No, further confirmatory testing is needed. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No, existing data strongly suggest arrhythmic episodes.\nANSWER: Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) END",
