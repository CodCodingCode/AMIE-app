Diagnosis: Primary Amenorrhea due to Gonadal Dysgenesis (e.g., Turner Syndrome)\nJustification: The patient has not started menstruation and exhibits delayed or absent secondary sexual development, which suggests possible ovarian failure or dysgenesis, common in Turner syndrome.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Constitutional Delay of Puberty\nJustification: Tiredness and delayed menarche might be normal for some adolescents experiencing physiological delayed puberty, especially if development is consistently delayed.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Hypothalamic or Pituitary Dysfunction (e.g., Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea)\nJustification: Fatigue and amenorrhea could be due to hormonal suppression from stress, weight loss, or excessive exercise impacting GnRH secretion.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Hypothyroidism\nJustification: Fatigue and menstrual irregularities are common in hypothyroidism, and delayed or absent puberty can be a feature in severe cases.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Anorexia Nervosa or Other Eating Disorder\nJustification: Fatigue and delayed puberty can result from caloric deficit and weight loss affecting hormonal axes.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic)\nJustification: Some forms present with normal female external genitalia but delayed puberty and hormonal abnormalities which could explain menstrual delay.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\nJustification: Although external genitalia appear female, internal genitalia are absent or undescended, and amenorrhea is common.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Chronic Illness or Malnutrition-related Delay\nJustification: Underlying chronic health issues or nutritional deficiencies can impair puberty development and cause fatigue.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Structural Malformations (e.g., Mullerian agenesis)\nJustification: Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome presents with absent or rudimentary uterus; although typically with normal puberty, it can cause primary amenorrhea.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Genetic Syndromes Affecting Chromosomal Completeness (e.g., Mosaicism)\nJustification: Chromosomal abnormalities may lead to delayed or absent puberty along with other physical features, consistent with some syndromic presentations.\n\nANSWER:\n1.

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (Monosomy X)\nJustification: The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has not developed secondary sexual characteristics or experienced menarche, with concerns about delayed or absent pubertal development. Turner syndrome is characterized by primary ovarian insufficiency or streak ovaries resulting in amenorrhea and conceptive developmental features such as short stature and webbed neck. The emotional and psychological concerns, along with delayed puberty, align with classic presentations of Turner syndrome. Given her age and development, this diagnosis should be strongly considered.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypothalamic or Pituitary Dysfunction (Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism)\nJustification: The patient reports feeling \"confused,\" tired, and \"mixed up,\" which can be indicative of hormonal imbalances affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In primary hypothalamic or pituitary failure, gonadotropin levels (LH, FSH) would be low or inappropriately normal despite absent puberty. This could be isolated or part of a broader endocrine disorder, affecting pubertal development and mood.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Delayed Puberty due to Idiopathic Hypogonadism\nJustification: Some adolescents experience delayed pubertal development without an identifiable syndrome. This diagnosis is supported by her lack of secondary sexual characteristics and delayed menarche, with no obvious structural abnormalities. Emotional distress and fatigue may be part of or exacerbated by her delayed development.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-classic form)\nJustification: While primarily affecting adrenal hormone synthesis, some forms of CAH can lead to hormonal imbalances that cause menstrual and pubertal delays, as well as mood changes and fatigue. However, classic features like virilization are absent, making this less likely but still worth considering, especially if other features were to emerge.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder with Psychosomatic Manifestations\nJustification: Her reported emotional \"confusion,\" feeling \"down\" or anxious, and fatigue could reflect underlying mood or anxiety disorders. These conditions can exacerbate feelings of fatigue, affect mood, and impact perception of physical health, potentially complicated by underlying hormonal issues.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Turner Syndrome (Monosomy X) \u2013 High likelihood due to absent menarche, delayed or absent secondary sexual characteristics, and typical physical features. It is a common cause of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in adolescent females.\n\n2. Central Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism \u2013 Considered due to delayed puberty with low gonadotropin levels, especially if no structural anomalies are present. This can be idiopathic or secondary to hypothalamic or pituitary pathology.\n\n3. Idiopathic Delayed Puberty \u2013 Often a diagnosis of exclusion; her presentation aligns with delayed but otherwise normal pubertal development without structural abnormalities or syndromic features.\n\n4. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-classic) \u2013 A possibility given hormonal disruption affecting pubertal development, particularly if she develops or reports signs of androgen excess.\n\n5. Mood or Anxiety Disorder contributing to her symptoms of fatigue, emotional confusion, and perceived developmental delay \u2013 Important to address alongside endocrine evaluations given her emotional report.\n\nFurther investigations such as karyotyping, hormonal profiling (LH, FSH, estradiol, thyroid function), and imaging (e.g., pelvic ultrasound, brain MRI if indicated) would be essential for definitive diagnosis.",

She mentions that she has no features like webbed neck or low-set ears, does not know about streaked ovaries, and has always been smaller or shorter than her friends. She is unsure if her gonadotropin levels or hormone tests have been checked before.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (Premature Ovarian Failure)**\n   Justification: The patient's lack of menarche at 16, combined with her concerns about her reproductive development and being smaller for her age, strongly suggests ovarian insufficiency. She reports feeling tired and emotionally \"mixed up,\" which could indicate hormonal deficiency. Her normal physical features (no webbed neck or dysmorphic features) do not point to syndromic causes, but primary ovarian failure remains a leading consideration given her age and presentation.\n\n2. **Constitutional Delay of Puberty**\n   Justification: The patient is younger than the typical age of menarche, and her overall growth history (smaller, shorter than peers) may indicate a delayed but otherwise normal development. She feels \"kind of weird\" about her development, but without other physical abnormalities, constitutional delay remains a common benign cause of delayed puberty.\n\n3. **Hypothalamic-Pituitary Dysfunction (Hypothalamic Amenorrhea)**\n   Justification: Her feelings of fatigue, tiredness, and mood fluctuations could be related to hypothalamic suppression, possibly from stress, nutrition issues, or other factors affecting GnRH secretion. This condition can present with absent or delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhea, but additional history on stress or weight changes would help clarify.\n\n4. **Turner Syndrome or Other Chromosomal Abnormalities**\n   Justification: Although she reports no typical features like webbed neck or low-set ears, Turner syndrome can sometimes present with isolated ovarian failure and short stature. Her smaller stature and delayed puberty raise suspicion; however, absence of characteristic phenotypic features makes it less likely but still possible, warranting genetic testing.\n\n5. **Primary Hypothyroidism**\n   Justification: Symptoms such as fatigue and mood disturbances can be associated with hypothyroidism, which can also delay puberty. Physical exam should include thyroid assessment, and lab testing of TSH and T4 will help clarify this.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses:\n1. **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency** \u2013 Most probable given delayed or absent menarche, small stature, and emotional symptoms suggest hormonal ovarian failure.\n2. **Constitutional Delay of Puberty** \u2013 A common benign cause of delayed development, especially if family history supports delayed puberty.\n3. **Hypothalamic-Pituitary Dysfunction (Hypothalamic Amenorrhea)** \u2013 Potential contributing factor considering fatigue and emotional changes; underlying stress or nutritional issues should be assessed.\n4. **Turner Syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities** \u2013 Though less likely without classical features, karyotyping would be important to exclude this diagnosis.\n5. **Primary Hypothyroidism** \u2013 Should be evaluated due to symptoms like fatigue and mood swings; thyroid function tests are indicated.\n\nFurther diagnostic workup including hormonal panels (FSH, LH, estradiol), karyotype, and thyroid function tests will help refine the diagnosis.",

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome\nJustification: The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has not experienced menarche and reports being shorter than her peers, with concerns about body development. Turner syndrome typically presents with gonadal dysgenesis leading to primary amenorrhea, short stature, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Although she does not have classic physical features like webbed neck or low-set ears, these are not always present. The absence of menstruation and delayed or absent puberty strongly suggest a disorder of sex development consistent with Turner syndrome, especially given her small stature and absence of pubertal signs without hormone treatment.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism\nJustification: The patient's delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea, along with feelings of tiredness and mood changes, could also point to central hypogonadism, where inadequate gonadotropin (LH and FSH) secretion impairs ovarian function. This condition can present in adolescents with low or normal brain structures, leading to delayed or absent secondary sexual characteristics. It is also associated with fatigue and mood fluctuations, aligning with her symptoms.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Congenital hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome or other forms)\nJustification: Given her delayed puberty and lack of secondary sexual development, congenital hypogonadism such as Kallmann syndrome (which involves anosmia) could be considered; however, she doesn't report smell deficits, making this less likely. Nonetheless, congenital hypogonadism remains a differential given the lack of puberty and primary amenorrhea.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Mullerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome)\nJustification: The patient has not started periods and describes body development concerns. While her primary presentation points more toward ovarian failure, m\u00fcllerian agenesis (absence of uterus and upper vagina) could cause primary amenorrhea, but typically with normal ovarian function and normal secondary sexual characteristics if the ovaries are functional. Her concern about body image and development suggests estrogen deficiency, making this less probable unless her ovaries are functional but absent uterine structures.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Other chromosomal or genetic syndromes affecting gonadal development\nJustification: Less common syndromes such as Partial Androgen Insensitivity or Swyer syndrome could manifest with primary amenorrhea and normal or underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. However, Swyer syndrome involves streak gonads and typically phenotypic female, and androgen insensitivity involves normal female hormones but variable internal genitalia, which are less consistent with her overall presentation.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1.
