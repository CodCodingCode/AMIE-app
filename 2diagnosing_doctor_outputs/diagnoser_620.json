    "input": "The patient, a young adult female, presents with social anxiety symptoms including nervousness, physical sensations such as facial burning and sweating, and fear of judgment in social situations. Although she reports these symptoms as distressing, her communication style suggests she may be minimizing their severity and extent. Objective indicators indicate that she likely experiences frequent and intense panic episodes that contribute to significant social avoidance and impairment. Additional emotional symptoms, such as low mood or depression, may be present but are not explicitly disclosed. Her symptom onset appears gradual over the past two years, with possible recent worsening, yet the true severity and impact are probably greater than the patient initially reports. Further detailed assessment is necessary to quantify symptom frequency, functional impairment, and emotional status.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young adult female experiencing social anxiety symptoms with notable physical sensations, possible panic episodes, and evidence of social avoidance. Symptoms developed gradually over two years with possible recent worsening. She reports distress but may minimize severity. Differential diagnoses include primary social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, mood disorders, or somatic syndromes. \"Can't miss\" conditions such as panic disorder and depression warrant close consideration. Psychopathologies should be ordered based on likelihood given the symptom profile, with social anxiety disorder as most probable due to primary social fears, and other anxiety and mood disorders as plausible but less likely. Red flags like suicidal ideation are not mentioned.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Justification: Core symptoms include persistent fear of social situations, physical sensations such as facial burning and sweating, and significant social avoidance; onset over two years aligns with typical development, and the severity appears substantial given impairment.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: Objective indicators suggest frequent and intense panic episodes contributing to social avoidance; physical symptoms like facial burning and sweating are characteristic of panic attacks, which may occur unexpectedly or in social contexts.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: Possible pervasive worry and physical symptoms across various contexts; some symptoms overlap with social anxiety and panic, but if worry is more diffuse, GAD remains plausible.  4. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder Justification: Low mood or depressive symptoms may be present but are not explicitly disclosed; depressive symptoms can coexist with anxiety disorders, and social withdrawal might be secondary.  5. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia Justification: Less likely as the primary issue unless social situations are specifically feared over other contexts; not detailed in the vignette.  6. Diagnosis: Agoraphobia Justification: Typically involves fear of places or situations where escape might be difficult; no specific evidence from the vignette supports this as primary.  7. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Justification: No history of trauma or relevant triggers noted; less likely.  8. Diagnosis: Somatic Symptom Disorder Justification: Physical sensations may be somatic manifestations, but these are better explained within the context of anxiety disorders rather than primary somatic concerns.  9. Diagnosis: Bipolar Disorder Justification: No episodes of mood elevation or history of mood swings noted; less likely based on presentation.  10. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Justification: Absence of psychotic symptoms, disorganized thinking, or hallucinations makes this diagnosis improbable in this context.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, characterized by intense nervousness, physical sensations such as facial burning, sweating, and difficulty breathing during social interactions. She exhibits avoidance behaviors and a desire to withdraw in social situations. Communication patterns suggest her symptoms are likely more intense and frequent than she verbally reports, potentially including unrecognized panic episodes and underlying emotional distress. The onset appears gradual over the past two years, with possible recent worsening. Further assessment is needed to quantify the severity, identify panic episodes, and evaluate emotional wellbeing.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young adult woman with a gradual onset of intense nervousness, physical sensations like facial burning, sweating, and difficulty breathing during social interactions. She exhibits avoidance behaviors and possibly unrecognized panic episodes. Given the core features, social anxiety disorder is likely, but other conditions such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or medical causes must be considered. The most probable diagnosis is social anxiety disorder with possible panic features. Less likely but important to rule out are medical causes, substance use, or other anxiety disorders.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder Justification: The primary presentation involves intense nervousness, physical symptoms during social interactions, avoidance behaviors, and a gradual onset over two years, aligning with social anxiety disorder.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: Symptoms like difficulty breathing, facial burning, and sweating could indicate unrecognized panic episodes, which are common in panic disorder, often comorbid with social anxiety.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's ongoing emotional distress and physical symptoms may extend beyond social situations, which is characteristic of GAD.  4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia Justification: If symptoms are limited to particular social situations, this could be a specific social-related phobia, though the broad presentation suggests social anxiety.  5. Diagnosis: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Justification: Physical sensations like facial burning and distress may reflect preoccupations with appearance, but less likely when social anxiety is predominant.  6. Diagnosis: Medical causes (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmia) Justification: Physical symptoms overlap with medical conditions causing adrenergic symptoms but are less likely given the context and gradual onset.  7. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Anxiety Justification: Substance use can cause anxiety symptoms, but none are indicated in the vignette.  8. Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Justification: The presentation does not specify trauma history; less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder Justification: Social avoidance can be part of ASD, but the description suggests anxiety rather than developmental disorder.  10. Diagnosis: Malingering or Factitious Disorder Justification: No evidence suggests symptom fabrication; highly unlikely.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with signs indicative of social anxiety disorder, characterized by physical symptoms such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and breathing difficulties during social interactions. She exhibits avoidance behaviors and a desire to conceal herself in social settings. Her responses suggest her symptoms are likely more intense and frequent than she verbally reports, with possible underlying panic episodes and significant emotional distress related to shame and fear of judgment. The onset appears gradual and worsening over the past two years, but specific timelines and symptom frequencies require further assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits classic signs of social anxiety disorder, such as intense fear in social situations, avoidance, physical symptoms like sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and facial burning. The gradual onset over two years suggests a long-standing pattern rather than an acute disorder. The presence of physical symptoms, avoidance behaviors, and emotional distress points toward social anxiety disorder as the primary diagnosis. Differentiating from other anxiety or mood disorders involves considering conditions like panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or substance-induced anxieties\u2014however, her symptoms are specific to social contexts. The absence of panic attacks occurring independently of social situations indicates social anxiety disorder is most probable. The risk of immediate harm is low; long-term management is essential. Other causes such as specific phobias or ASD seem less consistent given the description.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient's pronounced anxiety during social interactions, avoidance behaviors, physical symptoms (facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulties), and emotional distress are hallmark features. The gradual worsening over two years indicates a chronic pattern consistent with social anxiety. The symptoms specifically triggered in social settings, rather than in other contexts, support this diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, trembling, breathing issues) could suggest panic episodes. However, these occur primarily during social interactions, and there is no evidence of spontaneous panic attacks outside social situations, making panic disorder less likely but still a consideration.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder Justification: The patient experiences significant anxiety, but the symptoms are specifically triggered in social settings rather than a pervasive worry across multiple domains. Her avoidance and specific situational anxiety suggest social anxiety rather than generalized anxiety.  4. Diagnosis: Body Dysmorphic Disorder Justification: Although facial burning and concern about appearance are noted, there is no evidence of preoccupations with specific body parts, nor compulsive behaviors or distortions related to appearance, making this less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Avoidant Personality Disorder Justification: The avoidance behaviors and desire to conceal oneself fit this diagnosis; however, the episodic physical symptoms are more characteristic of anxiety\u2014personality disorder diagnosis would require broader pattern assessment, which the current data do not fully support, so it remains a lower probability.

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with symptoms suggestive of social anxiety disorder, characterized by physical signs such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing predominantly during social interactions or evaluative situations. She reports avoidance of social settings and feelings of extreme nervousness, but likely underestimates her internal distress and the frequency of panic symptoms, often minimizing or concealing episodes occurring when alone. These internal symptoms may include panic-like feelings, dizziness, chest tightness, or nausea, which she might be reluctant to acknowledge fully. Her symptoms have shown a gradual onset and worsening over the past two years, but her actual experience may be more severe than described. The underlying internal anxiety and physical symptoms are probably more pervasive, especially in solitary contexts, than her current reports suggest. Further assessment is recommended to explore these concealed symptoms and internal episodes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient exhibits symptoms consistent with social anxiety disorder, including fear and avoidance of social situations, physical symptoms like sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing, which worsen around social evaluation. The gradual worsening over years indicates a chronic anxiety disorder. However, the mention of internal episodes such as dizziness and chest tightness suggests possible comorbid panic symptoms, which are common in social anxiety but can also indicate panic disorder. The patient minimizes her distress, often underreporting or concealing symptoms, making internal panic episodes potentially more frequent than acknowledged. The absence of evidence suggestive of other conditions like generalized anxiety disorder (widespread worry) or medical causes like arrhythmias and hyperthyroidism makes them less likely. The key is the focus on social interactions and performance scenarios, aligning most closely with social anxiety disorder, but with possible overlapping panic features. The priority is to list the most probable diagnoses explaining these symptoms, considering their likelihood and clinical coherence.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) Justification: The primary features\u2014extreme nervousness, avoidance of social situations, physical symptoms such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat during social interactions\u2014are classic for social anxiety disorder. The gradual onset and worsening over two years support this diagnosis, which often involves internal distress that is minimized or concealed, consistent with the patient's reporting. Her symptoms are predominantly situational and linked to social evaluation, fitting the pattern of social phobia.  2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder Justification: The mention of internal episodes including dizziness, chest tightness, and nausea suggests the presence of panic-like symptoms. These episodes may occur during social situations or even when alone, which could imply co-occurring panic disorder. The internal nature of these symptoms, their physical intensity, and reporting of rapid heartbeat support this interpretation.  3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Justification: Chronic anxiety that extends beyond social situations could be a component, especially considering the gradual worsening over time. Although less specifically focused on social contexts, GAD features include pervasive worry, which might underlie her social fears. However, given the prominence of situational social symptoms, GAD remains a less likely primary diagnosis but possible as a comorbid condition.  4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia (if social situations with certain targets are involved) Justification: If the patient's social anxiety is limited to specific contexts or feared stimuli (e.g., public speaking, performance), a specific social phobia could be considered. However, the generalized description suggests broader social anxiety rather than a narrowly focused phobia.  5. Diagnosis: Cardiac or Medical Condition (e.g., arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism) Justification: Physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and chest tightness could indicate cardiac arrhythmia or hyperthyroidism. However, the temporal pattern, situational triggers, and coexistence with anxiety symptoms make a primary psychiatric diagnosis more probable. Nevertheless, ruling out medical causes is necessary to ensure comprehensive care.  STOP HERE.",

She reports avoidance behaviors and significant internal anxiety, though her communication suggests she may underreport the severity and frequency of panic episodes, especially those occurring when alone, which include dizziness and chest pounding. Her symptoms have been gradually worsening over approximately two years, but the true extent and impact of her autonomic and panic symptoms are likely more severe than she admits, affecting her social functioning and internal well-being.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of social anxiety with physical symptoms such as facial burning, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and breathing difficulties aligns strongly with a social anxiety disorder (SAD). The history indicates avoidance behaviors, significant internal anxiety, and symptoms that are more severe than reported, including panic-like episodes both during social situations and possibly when alone, suggesting comorbid panic features. The gradual worsening over two years points to an escalating social anxiety with panic component. Key features include social situations triggering autonomic arousal and internal distress, consistent with SAD, potentially with panic disorder features given the reported episodes of dizziness and chest pounding.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: Social fears, avoidance behaviors, physical manifestations (burning face, sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulty), and panic episodes with dizziness and chest pounding. - Timeline and progression: Symptoms have developed insidiously over approximately two years, worsening over time. - Clinical pattern recognition: Classic presentation of social anxiety disorder, with associated panic symptoms, possibly indicating comorbid panic disorder. - Supporting evidence: Specific social situations trigger autonomic symptoms; avoidance behaviors; history of internal anxiety; physical symptoms consistent with autonomic hyperreactivity. - Excluding alternatives: Less likely to be generalized medical or neurological conditions; no evidence of substance use or other psychiatric conditions that best explain the entire symptom complex.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: High confidence in social anxiety disorder with panic features considering the symptom constellation and progression. - Missing information: Precise frequency and severity of panic episodes outside social situations; detailed history of past medical or psychiatric diagnoses; assessment of functional impairment; ruling out medical conditions mimicking autonomic symptoms. - Clinical coherence: All symptoms are compatible with SAD and panic features, with no contradictions noted. - Diagnostic criteria: Meets DSM-5 criteria for social anxiety disorder; evidence of panic symptoms suggests possible comorbid panic disorder but does not negate SAD diagnosis.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: The most probable diagnosis is social anxiety disorder with panic features. - Information sufficiency: Sufficient for a reliable clinical diagnosis given the symptom profile and history. - Risk tolerance: No urgent need for additional testing before initiating treatment; further assessment could refine comorbidities if desired. - Clinical urgency: Diagnosis can be finalized now; treatment planning should proceed promptly.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes, the presentation is characteristic and consistent. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: Yes, current data suffice for a confident diagnosis.\nANSWER: Social Anxiety Disorder with Panic Features END",
