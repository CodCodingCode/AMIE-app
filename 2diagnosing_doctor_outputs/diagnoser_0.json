    "input": "A 37-year-old woman reports experiencing intermittent dull headaches over the past several months, accompanied by episodes of dizziness and transient blurry vision. She describes the headaches as a sensation of tightness around her head, often attributed to stress or prolonged computer use. She reports no recent history of nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness, or speech difficulty during these episodes and denies visual phenomena like flashes or persistent visual field defects. The patient perceives her symptoms as mild and not worsening but may be minimizing the severity and frequency. No specific assessment of her blood pressure or neurological examination details have been provided. Further detailed evaluation is recommended to elucidate the nature of her symptoms and identify potential underlying causes.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n- The patient is a young woman with intermittent dull headaches, dizziness, and transient blurry vision.\n- Symptoms are mild, episodic, and may be stress-related.\n- No mention of elevated blood pressure or neurological deficits.\n- The presentation could relate to primary or secondary causes affecting vascular or neurological systems.\n- The absence of severe neurological symptoms suggests less likelihood of acute stroke or significant mass effects.\n- Stress and prolonged computer use might suggest tension or ocular origin but do not exclude systemic causes.\n- Dizziness and transient vision changes could point toward vascular issues, possibly related to blood pressure fluctuations or vasospasm.\n- The differential should consider both primary headache disorders and secondary causes like vascular or hypertensive conditions.\n\nANSWER:\n1. Diagnosis: Tension headache\nJustification: The description of head tightness and attribution to stress or prolonged computer use suggests a common tension-type headache.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Migraine without aura\nJustification: Transient visual disturbances and episodic headaches are characteristic of migraines, even if less severe, especially with associated dizziness.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Hypertensive headache\nJustification: Given the emphasis on stress and potential for blood pressure fluctuations, hypertensive episodes could contribute to recurrent headaches and visual changes.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Vitreous hemorrhage or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\nJustification: Transient blurry vision and dizziness raise concern for transient ischemic events affecting the visual pathways or retinal vasculature.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Vestibular disorder\nJustification: Dizziness episodes, especially with position changes, could indicate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or other vestibular etiologies.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Ocular pathology (e.g., astigmatism, refractive errors)\nJustification: Headaches and transient blurring associated with visual strain from prolonged computer use may point to uncorrected vision problems.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Anxiety or stress-related disorder\nJustification: Stress exacerbates symptoms, and physical symptoms like headaches and dizziness are common in anxiety-related presentations.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Although less typical, intermittent headache episodes with associated ocular or visual symptoms can occasionally mimic cluster headaches, especially if occurring in patterns.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Intracranial mass or lesion\nJustification: Although less likely with mild, episodic symptoms, a mass could cause intermittent symptoms if it affects certain pathways, but typically would present with more persistent or focal findings.\n\n10. Diagnosis: Carotid artery disease or vasospasm\nJustification: Transient visual disturbances and dizziness might be related to transient cerebral ischemia secondary to vascular abnormalities, particularly if risk factors develop over time.\n\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Ocular migraine (visual migraine)\nJustification: Transient blurry vision and visual disturbances favor a localized ocular or migrainous cause affecting visual pathways.\n5. Diagnosis: Vertiginous syndromes (Vestibular dysfunction)\nJustification: Dizziness episodes may be related to vestibular disorders, which can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\n6.

Diagnosis: Migraine without aura\nJustification: The episodic dull headache with head tightness and visual blurriness aligns with common migraine features. Stress and computer use are typical migraine triggers, and migraines often cause transient visual disturbances.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: The description of a tight, dull headache fits tension-type headache, which is common in stress and prolonged computer use.
