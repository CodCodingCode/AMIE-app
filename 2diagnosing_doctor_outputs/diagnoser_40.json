The symptoms sugges\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Viral parotitis (mumps)\nJustification: Acute swelling of the cheeks with soreness and sore throat in a pediatric patient which can occur after recent activity; mumps is common in children and presents with bilateral or unilateral parotid gland swelling, often with systemic symptoms like tiredness. No mention of fever, but it remains highly plausible given presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Bacterial parotitis\nJustification: Rapid onset of facial swelling and soreness could be bacterial infection of the salivary gland, especially if activity caused duct obstruction. Usually associated with pain, swelling, and possible erythema.\n3. Diagnosis: Peritonsillar or oropharyngeal abscess\nJustification: Sore throat, facial pain, and swelling could indicate an abscess from tonsillar or surrounding tissue, particularly if swelling extends to facial areas, with potential for discomfort after activity.\n4. Diagnosis: Allergic facial swelling (Angioedema)\nJustification: Rapid-onset facial swelling and soreness could be allergic in origin; though usually non-tender, could be triggered by activity, especially if associated with allergic exposure, with swelling that involves subcutaneous tissues.\n5. Diagnosis: Dental abscess or odontogenic infection\nJustification: Facial swelling and soreness could originate from a dental source, especially if recent activity involved dental trauma or poor dental hygiene; common cause of facial swelling in children.\n6. Diagnosis: Cellulitis of facial tissues\nJustification: Diffuse facial swelling with soreness can result from bacterial cellulitis, especially if skin appears erythematous or tender, often following minor trauma or skin breach.\n7. Diagnosis: Salivary duct stone (Sialolithiasis)\nJustification: Sudden facial swelling and soreness after activity suggest possible salivary duct obstruction; more common in older children and adolescents but can occur at any age.\n8. Diagnosis: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) involving facial tissues\nJustification: Although less common, systemic inflammatory conditions can cause swelling and soreness, especially if systemic symptoms like tiredness are reported; typically involves multiple joints or tissues but could present with localized facial swelling.\n9. Diagnosis: Neoplasm (e.g., benign salivary tumor)\nJustification: Less likely in the acute setting, but must be considered in persistent or recurrent swelling; unlikely given the rapid onset within one day.\n10. Diagnosis: Lymphadenitis or lymphadenopathy\nJustification: Swollen lymph nodes in the cervical region can cause facial swelling and soreness; often secondary to infection but less likely to be prominent in an isolated acute presentation without other systemic signs.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Infectious Parotitis (Mumps)\nJustification: Bilateral facial swelling involving the cheeks, soreness, and systemic signs like fatigue and decreased appetite are characteristic of mumps, especially in children. Although the patient reports no fever, mumps can sometimes present with mild or unrecognized systemic symptoms.\n2. Diagnosis: Bacterial Parotitis\nJustification: Acute facial swelling and soreness could also represent bacterial infection of the parotid glands, particularly if associated with decreased oral intake and facial pain. It\u2019s less likely to be bilateral without systemic signs but remains a differential consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Allergic Salivary Gland Swelling\nJustification: Allergic reactions can cause swelling of salivary glands, especially if triggered by recent activity or environmental exposures; however, absence of other allergy signs makes this less likely.\n4. Diagnosis: Salivary Gland Tumor or Cyst\nJustification: Unlikely given the acute onset, but painful swelling could suggest early inflammatory or neoplastic processes\u2014less probable in this age group and presentation.\n5. Diagnosis: Facial Cellulitis or Abscess\nJustification: Typically involves localized swelling with warmth, redness, and systemic signs of infection; less symmetrical and rapid onset makes this less likely.\n6. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Sialadenitis (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome)\nJustification: Usually bilateral but more common in adults; unlikely acutely in a pediatric patient without other autoimmune features.\n7. Diagnosis: Trauma-Induced Swelling\nJustification: Recent physical activity might have caused minor trauma leading to swelling, but skin integrity would typically be compromised, and soreness would be localized.\n8. Diagnosis: Viral Exanthems with Facial Edema\nJustification: Viruses like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause facial swelling, but typically with systemic symptoms like sore throat and lymphadenopathy.\n9. Diagnosis: Angioedema\nJustification: Rapid swelling involving facial tissues, potentially bilateral, often without pain\u2014though usually associated with allergies or medication reactions; less consistent with systemic malaise.\n10. Diagnosis: Lymphadenopathy with Soft Tissue Swelling\nJustification: Enlarged lymph nodes can cause facial fullness but less likely the diffuse, painful swelling observed; more localized and associated with infection.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Mumps parotitis\nJustification: The bilateral facial swelling specifically suggests parotid gland involvement, characteristic of mumps. Accompanying systemic symptoms like sore throat, fatigue, headache, and subjective chills support a viral infectious process. Recent physical activity may have precipitated gland swelling or exacerbated contagious spread. Mumps commonly presents with bilateral parotid swelling and systemic mild symptoms, aligning with the presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral sialadenitis (non-mumps)\nJustification: Other viral infections (such as coxsackievirus or influenza) can cause bilateral salivary gland swelling with systemic symptoms. The presentation of bilateral gland involvement and systemic signs makes viral sialadenitis plausible, especially if mumps testing is negative or unavailable.\n3. Diagnosis: Allergic angioedema\nJustification: Bilateral facial swelling can also be seen in allergic angioedema. However, systemic symptoms like sore throat, headache, and subjective chills are less typical unless accompanied by an allergic reaction. The recent activity may suggest exertion-induced or allergic component, but systemic viral symptoms favor infectious causes.\n4. Diagnosis: Bacterial cellulitis of facial tissues\nJustification: Facial swelling and soreness may be infectious; however, cellulitis usually presents unilaterally with localized erythema, warmth, and tenderness rather than bilateral swelling. The bilateral symmetry makes this less likely but still possible if considering bilateral spread or atypical presentation.\n5. Diagnosis: Lymphadenitis\nJustification: Cervical lymph node swelling can cause facial or neck swelling; however, isolated lymphadenitis typically involves discrete nodes rather than diffuse bilateral facial swelling, making it a less likely primary cause but still part of systemic infectious processes.",

Diagnosis: Viral parotitis (e.g., mumps)\nJustification: Bilateral facial swelling of short duration following activity, systemic symptoms of fatigue, headache, subjective temperature changes, and soreness, align with mumps' typical presentation in children\u2014causing bilateral parotid swelling with systemic manifestations. The recent activity may have precipitated or coincided with infection, making this the most probable.\n2. Diagnosis: Allergic angioedema\nJustification: Bilateral facial swelling with soreness and systemic symptoms can result from allergic reactions, especially in children exposed to new allergens during recreational activity, even if erythema is not prominent. Subjective hot/cold sensations and shivering could also relate to an allergic or immune response.\n3. Diagnosis: Cervical or pre-auricular lymphadenitis\nJustification: Soreness and swelling in facial regions often involve lymph nodes. Bilateral involvement suggests systemic or viral causes. Recent activity may have triggered local lymph node response to infection or inflammation.\n4. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or soft tissue infection\nJustification: Soft tissue infections typically cause warmth, erythema, and tenderness. The absence of these signs and only soreness makes this less likely, but it remains a consideration if skin changes develop.\n5.

Diagnosis: Mumps (Viral Parotitis)\nJustification: The bilateral facial swelling and soreness after recent activity, along with systemic symptoms such as sore throat, fatigue, headache, chills, and subjective fever, strongly suggest mumps. Mumps commonly presents with bilateral parotid gland swelling in children and adolescents. The timing with recent activity can be incidental but does not exclude viral etiology. The systemic symptoms further support viral infection, and the clinical presentation aligns with classic mumps features.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral Parotitis (Other than Mumps)\nJustification: Other viral causes, such as coxsackievirus, can cause parotitis, especially in children. While less specific than mumps, the presentation of bilateral swelling with systemic symptoms could still be consistent. This diagnosis is considered slightly less probable than mumps but remains plausible given clinical signs.\n3. Diagnosis: Angioedema\nJustification: Bilateral facial swelling can be caused by angioedema, often rapid in onset and potentially associated with allergic reactions. However, it generally lacks systemic infectious symptoms like sore throat and headache unless an allergic trigger is present. The prior activity may be related to trauma or allergic response, but systemic signs are less prominent, making this a less likely primary diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Bacterial Cellulitis\nJustification: Although cellulitis usually presents as unilateral skin infection with redness, warmth, and tenderness, bilateral involvement is uncommon. It could be considered if skin was involved, but absence of localized signs like erythema or abscess makes this less likely. The bilateral and systemic features point away from cellulitis as the main cause.\n5. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis\nJustification: Mononucleosis can cause pharyngitis, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sometimes facial swelling, but facial swelling is less characteristic, and bilateral parotid involvement is uncommon. Systemic symptoms support a systemic viral illness, but the predominant picture favors a parotitis-related syndrome. This diagnosis is less probable but should still be considered in differential with persistent or evolving symptoms.",
