Key features include \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Choroidal Melanoma\nJustification: Dark pigmented lesion on the eye with visual disturbances can indicate ocular melanoma, which often presents with a pigmented ocular mass. Though less common, it is a critical diagnosis to exclude due to risk of metastasis.\n2. Diagnosis: Retinal Detachment\nJustification: Flashes and visual blurriness are common symptoms, and the possibility of a retinal detachment must be considered, especially with reported visual changes and sudden onset.\n3. Diagnosis: Choroidal Nevus\nJustification: A dark spot could represent a benign congenital pigmented lesion that is often asymptomatic but can mimic melanoma; underreporting may hide their significance.\n4. Diagnosis: Ocular Melanocytosis or Nevus\nJustification: Pigmented ocular lesions are common in certain populations; while benign, persistence or change warrants surveillance.\n5. Diagnosis: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)\nJustification: In older patients, a dark spot and visual disturbances could represent geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD; less likely in young patients but relevant if age around 50+.\n6. Diagnosis: Uveal Hemorrhage\nJustification: Bleeding within the eye can cause pigmented or dark appearance with visual disturbance; though less common without trauma, it remains a differential.\n7. Diagnosis: Intraocular Foreign Body or Trauma-related Lesion\nJustification: Bump or mass could reflect prior trauma or foreign body, especially if associated with visual changes; minimal details make this less certain.\n8. Diagnosis: Papilledema or Optic Disc Edema\nJustification: Elevated intracranial pressure may cause optic disc swelling, sometimes perceived as a bump, with visual symptoms; less likely without other neurological signs.\n9. Diagnosis: Ocular Infection or Tumor (e.g., Uveitis, Lymphoma)\nJustification: Inflammatory or neoplastic processes can cause ocular mass or pigmentation and visual disturbances; less likely if absence of pain, redness, or systemic symptoms.\n10.

Diagnosis: Choroidal melanoma\nJustification: Dark spot and enlarging lesion suggest a pigmented intraocular tumor, which is the most concerning \"must not miss\" diagnosis. Although relatively rare, it is the primary malignant ocular tumor and can cause visual disturbance and retinal changes.\n2. Diagnosis: Retinal detachment\nJustification: Visual blurriness and flashes are classic symptoms; intermittent nature fits with detachment or tear. An enlarging bump could be associated with vitreoretinal interface abnormalities or localized hemorrhage.\n3. Diagnosis: Choroidal nevus\nJustification: The dark spot may represent a benign pigmented lesion such as a nevus, which can enlarge over time; however, growth and associated symptoms raise suspicion for transformation.\n4. Diagnosis: Age-related macular degeneration (exudative)\nJustification: The dark spot could be a hemorrhage or deposit related to AMD, particularly if the patient is older; intermittent flashes can relate to neovascular activity.\n5. Diagnosis: Ocular melanoma (iris or ciliary body)\nJustification: The enlarging bump and dark pigmentation could be due to a pigmented iris or ciliary body lesion, which requires differentiation from posterior chamber tumors.\n6. Diagnosis: Ocular metastasis\nJustification: A pigmented, enlarging lesion could be metastasis from another systemic cancer, especially if the lesion appears vascularized or associated with systemic symptoms.\n7. Diagnosis: Uveal sarcoidosis or inflammatory lesion\nJustification: Less likely but possible given pigmentation and growth, especially if there are signs of intraocular inflammation; would need further signs.\n8. Diagnosis: Congenital or benign pigmented lesion (e.g., congenital melanocytic nevus)\nJustification: Could be stable or slowly enlarging without symptoms, but the recent change and visual symptoms are less typical.\n9. Diagnosis: Papilledema or optic disc edema\nJustification: Not consistent with a localized bump but might explain visual disturbances; less likely, as the description suggests a distinct lesion.\n10. Diagnosis: Conjunctival nevus or pigmented lesion\nJustification: Could present as pigmented spot external to the eye, but an enlarging bump and visual symptoms suggest deeper intraocular pathology rather than superficial conjunctival lesion.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Melanoma of the choroid or uveal melanoma\nJustification: The dark spot may represent a pigmented intraocular lesion, which is characteristic of choroidal melanoma; the progressive enlarging bump could be related to tumor growth or a secondary effect on ocular structures. The intermittent visual disturbances align with intraocular pressure changes or tumor-induced retinal detachment. Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and can present with these features, especially with a pigmented appearance.\n2. Diagnosis: Choroidal nevus\nJustification: The dark spot could also be a benign pigmented lesion such as a nevus, which can enlarge slowly over time and sometimes mimic melanoma. The clinical course and slight visual disturbance are consistent with a benign pigmented lesion, though ongoing growth warrants concern for transformation. Differentiation often involves monitoring for signs of malignancy.\n3. Diagnosis: Hordeolum or chalazion (less likely but possible if bump is periocular)\nJustification: The enlarging bump might represent a cyst or inflammation of the eyelid structures; however, this typically presents with localized tenderness or erythema, which are not noted. Given the description, this is lower in probability but still considered due to the bump's gradual growth.\n4. Diagnosis: Retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage\nJustification: The intermittent flashes, spots, or flashes could be symptomatic of retinal detachment or hemorrhage. The dark spot might be due to hemorrhagic shadow or detachment, but an enlarging bump is less characteristic unless associated with other ocular structures.\n5. Diagnosis: Ocular lymphoma or metastasis\nJustification: Rare but possible if the lesion is part of a systemic malignancy presenting intraocularly; the progressive nature of symptoms and pigmented lesion make this less likely but still within consideration, especially if other systemic symptoms develop.\nSTOP HERE.

Diagnosis: Choroidal Melanoma\nJustification: The slow, progressive development of a dark spot (likely representing a pigmented lesion) along with an enlarging bump is characteristic of a choroidal melanoma. The intermittent visual flashes may be explained by tumor-related traction or proximity to the retina, and the lack of pain reduces the likelihood of inflammatory causes. The lesion\u2019s features fit well with a pigmented intraocular mass with potential for growth over weeks.\n2. Diagnosis: Choroidal Neovascular Membrane (CNVM) from Age-related Macular Degeneration or Other Causes\nJustification: The presence of a dark spot and visual disturbances such as flashes can be associated with neovascularization disrupting the retinal layers. Although less common in younger patients, this remains a consideration, especially if prior risk factors exist. Its rank reflects possible similarity in presenting symptoms but typically occurs with more rapid onset; in this case, the slow progression makes this somewhat less likely but still plausible.\n3. Diagnosis: Choroidal Hemorrhage or Hemorrhagic Choroidal Detachment\nJustification: An enlarging bump could represent a hemorrhagic lesion beneath or within the choroid, especially if caused by trauma or a vascular abnormality. The dark appearance and visual fluctuations align, but the gradual enlargement over two weeks suggests a more solid or neoplastic process rather than acute bleeding, placing this lower in the probability.\n4. Diagnosis: Ocular Metastasis\nJustification: Metastatic lesions can present as pigmented or non-pigmented intraocular masses with slow growth. Absence of systemic symptoms makes this less certain, but it remains relevant, especially if the lesion's features are atypical for primary tumors. The background probability is lower in the absence of systemic malignancy, yet this cannot be excluded.\n5. Diagnosis: Intraocular Inflammatory Mass (e.g., Granuloma)\nJustification: Inflammatory lesions may appear as pigmented or elevated intraocular masses causing visual disturbances. The minimal systemic symptoms and slow progression reduce suspicion. Since there's no pain, discharge, or signs of active inflammation, this diagnosis is less probable but still considered in a broad differential, especially if the lesion has granulomatous features or is associated with systemic inflammatory disease.\nSTOP HERE.

The absence of discharge or\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Choroidal Melanoma\nJustification: The flat dark spot that has increased in size over two weeks suggests a pigmented intraocular lesion, compatible with choroidal melanoma. Flashes and intermittent blurriness can indicate vitreoretinal traction or tumor influence on surrounding structures. The slow increase in size and pigmentation support this diagnosis, which carries significant malignant potential requiring prompt evaluation and management.\n2. Diagnosis: Conjunctival Melanoma or Conjunctival Pigmented Lesion\nJustification: The presence of a raised bump that enlarged alongside the dark spot indicates a possible conjunctival lesion, which may be a melanoma or pigmented nevus complicated by growth. The conjunctiva is accessible to visualization, and such lesions can appear as pigmented, raised growths that enlarge or change over weeks. Distinguishing features involve location and morphology, but growth favors neoplastic transformation.\n3. Diagnosis: Choroidal Nevus\nJustification: The flat dark spot may initially represent a benign choroidal nevus, which can enlarge over time, especially with growth and pigmentation. While usually more stable, recent enlargement raises concern, necessitating differentiation from melanoma. The two-week timeframe suggests possible neoplastic transformation or growth in a pre-existing nevus.\n4. Diagnosis: Uveal Hemorrhage or Hemangioma\nJustification: Although less likely due to pigmentation, a vascular lesion like a uveal hemangioma or hemorrhage could manifest as a dark spot; however, the progressive enlargement and pigmentation favor neoplastic causes. The intermittent flashes and visual changes could relate to hemorrhagic or vascular phenomena.\n5. Diagnosis: Inflammatory or Degenerative Lesions (e.g., Choroidal Granuloma or Degeneration)\nJustification: Less probable given the pigmentation and growth, but some inflammatory lesions can appear as pigmented choroidal lesions. Lack of systemic signs and absence of discharge or crusting decrease the likelihood, but they remain differential considerations, especially if infectious or inflammatory etiology is suspected later.\nSTOP HERE.",
