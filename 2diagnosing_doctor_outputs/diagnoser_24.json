Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Most common cause of virilization and menstrual irregularity in young women; presents with hyperandrogenism, menstrual dysfunction, and often polycystic ovaries. Prevalent in women of reproductive age.\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: Rapid onset of virilization, significant androgen excess, and menstrual irregularity; ovarian tumors such as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors can produce androgens and cause similar symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic form)\nJustification: Presents with hyperandrogenic features; may have menstrual irregularities; can manifest subtly in young women, especially if undiagnosed since childhood.\n4. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting adrenal tumor\nJustification: Similar to ovarian tumors, adrenal tumors can produce excess androgens leading to virilization; usually associated with rapid symptom development.\n5. Diagnosis: Cushing's syndrome (adrenal or pituitary cause)\nJustification: Although less common, hypercortisolism can cause some hyperandrogenic features due to adrenal overproduction; unlikely as primary presentation but considered in differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Ovarian hyperthecosis\nJustification: Hyperplasia of ovarian stromal cells producing androgens; typically affects middle-aged women but can occur in younger women with hyperandrogenic features.\n7. Diagnosis: Hyperprolactinemia\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularity but less likely to cause virilization unless associated with severe hormonal disturbances.\n8. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen intake\nJustification: Unlikely without history but should be considered if other causes are not evident.\n9. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome variants\nJustification: Similar to PCOS but with different phenotypic expressions; still common.\n10. Diagnosis: Other rare causes of hyperandrogenism (e.g., familial adrenal hyperplasia variants)\nJustification: Less common but part of comprehensive differential diagnosis.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS commonly presents in young women with menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism manifesting as hirsutism and voice changes, and is a prevalent etiology for androgen excess.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic form)\nJustification: This genetic disorder can present in early adulthood with signs of androgen excess such as hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, and voice deepening, especially when milder forms are involved.\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: A relatively rapid development of virilization symptoms suggests a neoplastic process that secretes androgens, particularly if accompanied by significantly elevated androgen levels.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal tumor (adrenocortical carcinoma or adenoma)\nJustification: An adrenal source of excess androgens can cause virilization; these tumors may produce high androgen levels leading to the observed features.\n5. Diagnosis: Ovarian hyperthecosis\nJustification: A rare cause of virilization in women, characterized by increased ovarian androgen production, often presenting with hirsutism and amenorrhea.\n6. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting adrenal adenoma\nJustification: Similar to adrenal carcinoma but typically benign, these tumors can produce sufficient androgens to cause virilization features.\n7. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen intake\nJustification: External exposure to androgens or anabolic steroids could cause similar features, though patient history is necessary to confirm this.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperprolactinemia\nJustification: While not directly causing virilization, prolactin elevation can disrupt menstrual cycles; however, it is less likely to cause significant hirsutism or voice deepening.\n9. Diagnosis: Cushing's syndrome\nJustification: Although it involves hormonal disturbance, features tend to include weight gain, striae, and hypertension rather than isolated virilization.\n10. Diagnosis: Ovarian cysts or other benign gynecologic conditions\nJustification: These are less likely to account for virilization and menstrual irregularity without associated hormonal findings; more supportive of other diagnoses.\nSTOP HERE.",

The evolution of symptoms point\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumor\nJustification: The rapid progression of virilization signs (voice deepening, facial hair) alongside amenorrhea in a relatively young woman strongly suggests an androgen-producing neoplasm. Such tumors often cause significant virilization over months. The clinical pattern\u2014especially if symptoms are worsening\u2014implies a neoplasm rather than a benign or polycystic process.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), non-classic form\nJustification: CAH typically presents with hyperandrogenism, including virilization and menstrual irregularities, especially if diagnosis is delayed beyond childhood. The gradual symptom onset over months is compatible with non-classic CAH, which can manifest in young adulthood. This condition can explain the hyperandrogenemia without rapid tumor growth.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with hyperandrogenism\nJustification: PCOS is a common cause of hyperandrogenism, often leading to menstrual irregularities and some virilization signs. However, the rapid progression and prominent facial hair growth are less typical unless a massive increase in androgen levels occurs. It remains a differential due to commonality, but less likely to explain the severity and progression than tumors or CAH.\n4. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure\nJustification: External androgen sources can cause virilization and menstrual irregularities. However, the vignette does not mention any relevant history of medication or supplement use, making this less likely. Still, it must be considered if history is ambiguous.\n5. Diagnosis: Adrenal or ovarian hyperplasia (benign hyperactivity)\nJustification: Hyperplastic adrenal or ovarian tissue producing excess androgens could explain the symptoms. This is less common but plausible, especially in longstanding or idiopathic cases presenting with gradual virilization. It ranks lower due to the more specific and dramatic features suggestive of a tumor or CAH.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: The relatively rapid development of virilization symptoms\u2014voice deepening, facial hair, amenorrhea\u2014over several months indicates a significant androgen excess likely from a tumor. Ovarian tumors such as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are known to produce androgens causing virilization, especially in a young woman. The progressive nature and lack of other systemic features align with this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (non-classic form)\nJustification: CAH can cause androgen excess presenting in young women with virilization, menstrual irregularities, and progressive development over months. Although typically early-onset, non-classic CAH can manifest later, especially with milder enzyme defects. If her symptoms have fluctuated or partially improved, it could reflect episodic adrenal androgen production.\n3. Diagnosis: Ovarian dermoid cyst with hormonal activity (less common)\nJustification: Though less likely, some ovarian cysts or tumors may produce hormones, leading to virilization. Their presentation is usually less dramatic, but they can contribute to androgen excess. It\u2019s included for completeness, pending imaging.\n4. Diagnosis: Cushing's syndrome\nJustification: Cushing\u2019s can cause menstrual irregularities and some degree of hirsutism, but the hallmark features include central obesity, skin changes, and hypertension, which are not described. The predominant virilization symptoms make this less probable but still consider in differential.\n5. Diagnosis: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is common in young women with hirsutism and menstrual irregularities; however, it usually develops gradually over years and rarely causes rapid virilization or significant voice deepening. Thus, it ranks lowest here but remains part of the differential for hyperandrogenism.",

Diagnosis: Ovarian Androgen-Secreting Tumor\nJustification: The rapid and progressive development of virilization signs such as deepening voice, facial hair growth, and amenorrhea strongly suggests a source of significant androgen excess, often due to an ovarian tumor (e.g., Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor or other androgen-secreting neoplasm). The severity and progression over months are characteristic of a hormone-secreting tumor rather than more common benign conditions. The abrupt cessation of menses supports significant hormonal disruption, consistent with tumor activity.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic form)\nJustification: Though less likely given the patient's age and the lack of prior symptoms, non-classic CAH can present with gradual virilization as androgen levels rise over time, especially during stress or hormonal fluctuations. It could explain some features, but typically would have been evident earlier in life, and no history suggests prior features like salt-wasting or early virilization.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is common in young women with hyperandrogenism; however, it rarely causes the rapid development of virilizing features or cessation of menses over a few months. The severity and progression in this case make it a less likely primary diagnosis but remains a differential consideration, especially if hormonal levels are modest.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal Adenoma or Carcinoma secreting androgens\nJustification: Adrenal tumors can secrete androgens, leading to virilization. This is possible given the clinical features. Adrenal carcinoma might present with more rapid or severe symptoms, and imaging studies would help distinguish this. Still, ovarian tumors are often more common sources in women of this age with such presentation.\n5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Hyperandrogenism\nJustification: Less probable given the severity of symptoms and rapid progression. Idiopathic hyperandrogenism typically presents with mild symptoms and does not cause menstrual cessation or dramatic virilization.\nSTOP HERE.",
