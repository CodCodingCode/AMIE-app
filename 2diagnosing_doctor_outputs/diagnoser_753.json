    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)\nJustification: The patient reports progressive difficulty seeing in the dark (nyctalopia) and decreased peripheral vision over several years, which are hallmark features of RP. RP is a hereditary degenerative retinal disease characterized by early night blindness and peripheral visual field loss, often manifesting in adolescence or young adulthood.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Diabetic Retinopathy or Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1)\nJustification: The increased urination frequency, constant thirst, and tiredness suggest hyperglycemia. Although diabetic retinopathy typically takes years to develop, early subtle retinal vascular changes can cause visual disturbances (flashes or spots). Given the systemic signs, diabetes should be considered, especially with potentially associated retinal pathology.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Cone-Rod Dystrophy\nJustification: Similar to RP but with a different pattern of progression\u2014attenuated or more central vision loss can occur. The patient's decreased peripheral vision and difficulty in low light could also fit, along with possible cone dysfunction leading to visual disturbances and photosensitivity.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Optic Nerve or Visual Pathway Defect (e.g., Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy)\nJustification: While these typically present with central visual loss, certain hereditary optic neuropathies can also involve peripheral vision or night vision issues. Dizziness and a perception that everything is more complicated might hint at optic or neurological contributions, although less specific.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Psychiatric or Functional Visual Loss\nJustification: The more generalized description of visual difficulty and feeling that \"everything is more complicated\" might reflect a psychosomatic component or functional visual disturbance, especially if no clear ophthalmologic etiology is identified. This is less likely as a primary cause but warrants consideration after ruling out physical causes.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1.

She notices her vision changes slowly over the last couple of years, with recent deterioration. She has difficulty navigating in low-light conditions, occasionally bumping into objects and struggling with stairs. She feels that everything is more complicated than before. There is no reported history of headaches, eye pain, or neurological issues, and family history of similar conditions is unknown.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: *Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)*\nJustification: The patient's progressive peripheral vision loss, difficulty seeing in the dark (nyctalopia), and gradual worsening over years are characteristic features of RP, a group of inherited retinal degenerations. The presence of photopsia (flashes or spots) supports retinal disturbance. The absence of pain and neurological deficits aligns with a primary retinal process.\n\n2. Diagnosis: *Vitamin A deficiency or toxicity*\nJustification: Vitamin A is essential for photoreceptor function; deficiency can cause night blindness and peripheral vision loss. Although less common in developed countries, dietary insufficiency could cause these symptoms, especially in teenagers. Symptoms may progress gradually and include nyctalopia. However, other systemic signs or dietary history would need clarification.\n\n3. Diagnosis: *Acquired Retinal Degenneration Secondary to a Syndromic Process (e.g., Bardet-Biedl syndrome)*\nJustification: The constellation of vision loss, night blindness, peripheral constriction, and systemic features like increased urination and thirst suggests a syndromic process affecting both retina and systemic metabolism. This warrants consideration, especially as the age of onset coincides with syndromic retinitis involving ciliary dysfunction.\n\n4. Diagnosis: *Diabetic Retinopathy or Diabetic Retinal Disease*\nJustification: The increased urination, thirst, fatigue, dizziness, and vision changes raise concern for diabetes mellitus. Although direct diabetic retinopathy is more common in older individuals with longstanding diabetes, early metabolic dysregulation could contribute to systemic or retinal symptoms, especially with recent worsening of vision.\n\n5. Diagnosis: *Intraocular or Optic Nerve Pathology (e.g., Cone-Rod Dystrophy, Optic Neuropathy)*\nJustification: Visual disturbances with difficulty navigating in low-light, decreased peripheral vision, and flashing could be due to retinal or optic nerve pathology. Although less typical, some hereditary or acquired optic neuropathies, or cone-rod dystrophies, could present with these overlapping symptoms.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. *Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP)*: The clinical picture of progressive peripheral vision loss, night blindness, and flashes, particularly starting in adolescence, aligns strongly with RP, especially given the slow progression over years.\n\n2. *Vitamin A deficiency or toxicity*: Vitamin A deficiency can cause nyctalopia and peripheral vision loss, potentially explaining the night vision difficulties and visual field constriction, though systemic dietary history would help clarify this.\n\n3. *Bardet-Biedl Syndrome or related ciliopathies*: The combination of visual disturbances with systemic features such as increased urination and thirst suggests a syndromic neurodegenerative process affecting the retina and possibly metabolic regulation.\n\n4. *Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus-related changes*: The systemic symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue) suggest hyperglycemia. Early diabetic retinopathy or metabolic impact on retinal function could be contributory, especially if diabetes is newly diagnosed.\n\n5. *Hereditary or acquired cone-rod dystrophy or optic nerve pathology*: These could account for peripheral and night vision impairment alongside flashes, though they often present with additional visual acuity decline, which needs further assessment.\n\nOverall, the primary consideration remains inherited retinal degenerations like RP, with systemic metabolic or nutritional issues as important differential considerations based on her systemic symptoms.",

While familial history is unknown, RP often presents in adolescence with these symptoms.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Diabetic Retinopathy\nJustification: The patient reports increased urination, constant thirst, fatigue, dizziness, and skin changes, indicating possible hyperglycemia. These systemic findings suggest diabetes mellitus, which can lead to diabetic retinopathy\u2014a common cause of gradual vision loss, including peripheral vision and visual acuity deterioration. The recent worsening of vision could be linked to microvascular changes in the retina secondary to diabetes.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Vitamin A deficiency or other nutritional optic neuropathies\nJustification: Vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness and peripheral vision loss, particularly in adolescents with inadequate nutrition. While less likely given the systemic symptoms pointing towards diabetes, nutritional deficiency remains a differential, especially in resource-limited settings.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital or hereditary optic neuropathy (e.g., Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy)\nJustification: Although typically presenting with central vision loss rather than peripheral and night vision issues, some hereditary optic neuropathies may cause progressive visual deterioration with associated neurological symptoms. The patient's age and progressive nature warrant consideration, though her symptom profile aligns less with this diagnosis.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or other demyelinating disorders\nJustification: MS may cause visual disturbances like optic neuritis, typically presenting with acute or subacute loss of vision, often central. The absence of pain or acute symptoms makes this less likely. However, spatially progressive vision loss and neurological symptoms could be part of broader demyelinating disease.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Retinitis Pigmentosa \u2013 Most probable given the classic progressive night blindness, peripheral vision loss, deficits worsening over years, and the development of flashes or spots.\n2.
