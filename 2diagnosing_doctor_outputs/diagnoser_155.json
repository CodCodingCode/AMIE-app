Diagnosis: Papular warts (Verruca vulgaris)\nJustification: Common, rough, grainy, hyperkeratotic papules frequently appear on fingers and elbows, especially after minor skin trauma; exposure to a pool could facilitate viral acquisition, and incubation period matches three weeks.\n2. Diagnosis: Keratotic eczema (Hand or contact dermatitis)\nJustification: Rough, hyperkeratotic bumps can result from irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, particularly related to pool chemicals or chlorination, with lesion distribution on exposed areas.\n3. Diagnosis: Lichen nitidus\nJustification: Small, flat-topped papules that can be skin-colored and appear on fingers and elbows; although less common, they occur in young adults and are asymptomatic.\n4. Diagnosis: Psoriasis (Guttate or localized plaque)\nJustification: Psoriasis often affects elbows and fingers, presenting as rough, scaly, hyperkeratotic papules or plaques; onset over weeks is typical, though usually associated with systemic symptoms or more widespread lesions.\n5. Diagnosis: Pityriasis lichenoides\nJustification: Presents as small, rough, erythematous to hyperkeratotic papules, often asymptomatic, with possible recent exposure history; considered in the differential for acute papular eruptions.\n6. Diagnosis: Molluscum contagiosum\nJustification: Small, dome-shaped, smooth or rough skin bumps caused by poxvirus; lesions are usually smooth but can become rough, especially if infected or irritated; more common in children but possible in adults.\n7. Diagnosis: Keratosis pilaris\nJustification: Common condition characterized by small, rough, follicular papules, often on elbows; however, less likely to have increased size over weeks without associated follicular plugging or other features.\n8. Diagnosis: Subacute dermatitis\nJustification: Diffuse or localized hyperkeratotic papules resulting from inflammatory skin response, possibly from pool chemicals, though less characteristic than eczema.\n9. Diagnosis: Early cutaneous sarcoidosis\nJustification: Can present with small, rough, granulomatous papules or bumps, often on extremities; less common but consider in differential, especially in young adults.\n10. Diagnosis: Cutaneous molluscum-like tumors (e.g., keratoacanthoma)\nJustification: Rapidly growing keratin-filled nodules; less likely without characteristic features, but included to cover less common possibilities.",

Diagnosis: Keratotic warts (verruca vulgaris)\nJustification: Warts are common on fingers and elbows, presenting as small, rough, grainy bumps that can enlarge over weeks. They are caused by HPV and are often asymptomatic, fitting the description and distribution.\n2. Diagnosis: Keratosis pilaris\nJustification: Though typically found on the upper arms, keratosis pilaris can appear as small, rough papules that may enlarge. It usually appears diffusely, but localized cases can occur, especially if exacerbated.\n3. Diagnosis: Lichen planus\nJustification: Presents as flat-topped, polygonal, slightly grainy papules that can involve elbows and fingers; although often pruritic, some cases are asymptomatic. It can develop gradually over weeks.\n4. Diagnosis: Pseudocyst of the finger (myxoid cyst)\nJustification: Usually benign cystic lesions on fingers, presenting as small bumps that increase in size, though typically they are translucent and may be associated with osteoarthritis. Less common on elbows.\n5. Diagnosis: Psoriasis (localized)\nJustification: Psoriasis can cause small, scaly, grainy plaques, particularly on elbows; however, the absence of silvery scale or itching makes this less certain but worth considering.\n6. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis or irritant dermatitis\nJustification: Could produce rough bumps, especially with exposure, but the gradual increase and spread over three weeks without itching are less typical.\n7. Diagnosis: Dermatofibroma\nJustification: Firm papules commonly on extremities; usually small and stable, unlikely to enlarge rapidly over weeks, but possible.\n8. Diagnosis: Early Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus\nJustification: Can present as scaly, grainy plaques or bumps, especially over sun-exposed areas like elbows, but typically associated with systemic features or photosensitivity.\n9. Diagnosis: Infectious etiologies (e.g., molluscum contagiosum)\nJustification: Molluscum presents as small, dome-shaped, pearly papules often with umbilication, less grainy and more waxy; less likely here.\n10.

Differe\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Verruca vulgaris (common wart)\nJustification: The description of small, rough, grainy bumps that are enlarging gradually aligns with typical verrucae, especially on fingers and elbows. Verrucae are caused by HPV and commonly appear as rough, hyperkeratotic papules, often on extensor surfaces, with a gradual increase in size, matching the patient's timeline and lesion morphology.\n2. Diagnosis: Psoriasis (plaque or pustular variant)\nJustification: Psoriasis commonly affects elbows and extensor surfaces, presenting as well-demarcated, scaly plaques. The presence on elbows suggests psoriasis, especially if lesions are raised and hyperkeratotic. Although the patient reports no scaling explicitly, psoriasis can occasionally manifest with rough, keratotic papules, especially in atypical presentations.\n3. Diagnosis: Keratosis pilaris\nJustification: This condition presents as small, rough, keratotic papules primarily over the extensor arms but can affect other extensor surfaces. While more common on the upper arms and thighs, similar lesions on fingers and elbows can occur, especially if lesions are persistent and non-tender, fitting the description of rough bumps.\n4. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis with hyperkeratosis\nJustification: Chronic irritation or contact with an offending agent may lead to hyperkeratotic, rough bumps. While less likely because lesions are enlarging gradually and asymmetrically, it remains a possibility if there's exposure to irritants, causing localized hyperkeratosis without systemic symptoms.\n5. Diagnosis: Actinic keratosis\nJustification: Typically occurs in sun-exposed areas of older individuals and appears as rough, scaly patches or papules. Given the patient's age and location (fingers and elbows), this is less consistent but included as a lower-probability diagnosis noting the keratotic features.",

Diagnosis: Psoriasis (likely plaque psoriasis)\nJustification: The presentation of well-defined, slightly raised, rough, grainy plaques on the elbows and fingers in a young adult is classic for psoriasis. The chronicity, bilateral distribution, and gradual increase in size support this. Psoriasis often affects the elbows and extensor surfaces, presenting with hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques which can be grainy in texture. Minimal discomfort does not exclude psoriasis.\n2. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma\nJustification: The grainy, rough, slightly raised bumps that are increasing in size over three weeks could represent keratoacanthomas, which are rapidly growing keratin-filled tumors. They commonly occur in sun-exposed areas like elbows and can resemble epidermal hyperplasia, sometimes mistaken for squamous cell carcinoma.\n3. Diagnosis: Keratosis Pilaris\nJustification: Though keratosis pilaris commonly involves small, rough bumps on the arms, it usually spares the elbows and is often located on posterior arms and thighs rather than elbows and fingers. Its presentation as tiny, rough, keratotic papules is consistent, but the distribution and size may not fully match.\n4. Diagnosis: Eczema (nummular dermatitis)\nJustification: Eczematous lesions can be rough and raised, but they typically present with itching and erythema, which are absent here. The chronicity and texture are less consistent, making eczema less likely as the primary diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Verrucae (warts)\nJustification: Warts can appear as rough, grainy, raised lesions, but they are often verrucous, hyperkeratotic papules with black dots (thrombosed capillaries), which the patient reports are absent. The distribution is less typical, and lesions tend to be isolated rather than bilateral or multiple.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Psoriasis\nJustification: The patient has bilateral, hyperkeratotic, rough, grainy, slightly raised lesions on fingers and elbows evolving over three weeks. Psoriasis commonly involves elbows and hands, presenting with scaly, hyperkeratotic plaques that enlarge gradually. The bilateral symmetry, chronicity, and appearance support psoriasis as the most probable diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Verruca (Warts)\nJustification: Warts are common on fingers and can appear as rough, grainy, raised lesions. They often grow gradually and may be unilateral or bilateral. The description of rough, grainy surface is characteristic. Given the location on fingers, verrucae are a strong differential, though they often have papillomatous features and may be less symmetric.\n3.

The lesions are raised and rough, but usually have violaceous color, which isn't described here. Still, it's a consideration especially if skin color is observed.\n4. Diagnosis: Actinic Keratosis\nJustification: Usually occurs on sun-exposed areas as rough, scaly patches. Less likely given the bilateral, symmetrical distribution on elbows and fingers without other signs of sun damage, and the subacute progression in a young woman.\n5.
