Other causes like leukemia are less likely without additional hematologic findings. The slow progression over a week, tenderness, and systemic features point toward an infectious process but cannot exclude lymphoma. Given these points, I will refine the differential to include the most probable conditions.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae lymphadenitis)\n2. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin)\n3. Diagnosis: Bacterial lymphadenitis (e.g., bacterial abscess)\n4. Diagnosis: Leukemia (e.g., ALL)\n5. Diagnosis: Viral lymphadenitis (e.g., infectious mononucleosis)\nJustification: The recent kitten exposure and the appearance of a tender, enlarging lymph node over a week strongly suggest cat scratch disease, which is common in children with pet exposure and presents with regional lymphadenopathy. Systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue are also consistent. Lymphoma remains a significant concern given the persistent lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and slow growth, necessitating consideration in a child with ongoing lymph node enlargement. Bacterial lymphadenitis or abscess could cause similar local findings but are less favored without signs of warmth or redness. Leukemia and viral causes like mononucleosis can present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms but are less directly linked to kitten exposure and may have other characteristic signs not described here.",
