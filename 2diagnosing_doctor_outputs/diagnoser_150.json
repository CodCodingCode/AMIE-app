The acuteness and severity increase suspicion for bacterial etiology, which requires rapid diagnosis and treatment.\n2. Diagnosis: Viral Encephalitis\nJustification: Similar presentation with intense headache, vomiting, and neurological symptoms in a young child; viral causes are common and can present with meningeal signs. It is a serious condition needing urgent attention.\n3. Diagnosis: Intracranial Hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid or intracerebral bleed)\nJustification: Sudden onset of severe headache in a child raises concern for bleed, especially with neck pain and vomiting. Although less common without trauma, hemorrhage is a critical diagnosis to exclude.\n4. Diagnosis: Meningeal or Spinal Cord Tumor (acute presentation)\nJustification: Though less common, tumor could present with abrupt headache and neck pain if hemorrhaging or swelling occurs, but less likely given the acute onset and severe distress.\n5. Diagnosis: Viral Meningitis (less severe than bacterial)\nJustification: Common cause of meningitis in children, presents with headache, neck stiffness, and vomiting; may be less severe but still serious.\n6. Diagnosis: Otitis Media with Intracranial Extension\nJustification: Ear infections can sometimes cause headache and neck pain, particularly if there's extension or meningitis, but less likely as initial presentation.\n7. Diagnosis: Migraine (rare in very young children)\nJustification: Headache with nausea and vomiting could be migrainous; however, the severity, neck pain, and distress suggest a more serious pathology.\n8. Diagnosis: Tension Headache or other Primary Headache Disorders\nJustification: Less likely given the severity and associated neurological signs; primary headaches are typically less acute and distressing in this manner.\n9. Diagnosis: Toxic or Drug-induced Encephalopathy\nJustification: Unlikely without history of toxins or medication use, but important to consider if other findings suggest.\n10.

Diagnosis: Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage)\nJustification: Sudden, severe headache (\"thunderclap\"), neck pain, and vomiting point to a hemorrhagic event, especially in the context of possible vascular rupture.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute migraine with aura or severe headache\nJustification: Severe headache in a young child can be migraine, especially if episodes are recurrent, though the abrupt onset and neck pain suggest a more emergent cause.\n4. Diagnosis: Cervical or upper spinal pathology (e.g., cervical muscle strain, cervical spine injury)\nJustification: Neck pain with associated headache can result from cervical issues, though usually less abrupt in onset and less associated with systemic symptoms.\n5. Diagnosis: Encephalitis\nJustification: Infection involving the brain parenchyma may cause headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting, often with altered mental status, but initial presentation can be similar.\n6. Diagnosis: Increased intracranial pressure (e.g., tumor, hydrocephalus)\nJustification: Symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck discomfort can be due to raised intracranial pressure, though typically more gradual unless acute.\n7. Diagnosis: Sinusitis or other sinonasal infection\nJustification: Can cause severe headache and neck pain, especially if complicated or involving the sphenoid sinus; less acute and severe in typical cases but possible.\n8. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Common in children, characterized by bilateral headache; less likely to cause neck stiffness or vomiting but considered if other causes ruled out.\n9. Diagnosis: Viral upper respiratory or systemic illness\nJustification: Can present with headache and nausea; however, the severity and sudden onset make this less likely to be the primary cause.\n10. Diagnosis: Rare intracranial or neurovascular pathology (e.g., arterial dissection)\nJustification: Although unlikely in this age group, certain vascular events can present with sudden severe headache and neck pain and should be considered in red-flag scenarios.",

Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\nJustification: The sudden, \"thunderclap\" onset of worst headache combined with neck pain, nausea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms is classic. The abrupt presentation suggests intracranial bleeding, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, which necessitates urgent imaging. The patient's emotional distress and possible underreporting of trauma or systemic symptoms do not rule out hemorrhage; this is the most urgent consideration.\n2. Diagnosis: Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture\nJustification: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is often caused by ruptured intracranial aneurysm; thus, aneurysm rupture is closely linked pathophysiologically. This explains the sudden debut and severity and is highly probable given the presentation.\n3. Diagnosis: Meningitis (Viral or Bacterial)\nJustification: The headache, neck pain, nausea, vomiting, and emotional distress can also suggest meningitis. Although less likely given the apparent abrupt onset, meningitis must be considered especially if hemorrhage is ruled out or if symptoms do not improve. Also, meningitis can sometimes present with a headache and neck stiffness, but the rapid perfect onset makes it less probable than hemorrhagic causes.\n4. Diagnosis: Intracranial Dissection (Carotid or Vertebral)\nJustification: Sudden-onset neck pain and headache can also signify arterial dissection, especially in younger patients. Dissection can cause ischemia or hemorrhage, presenting similarly. This remains a consideration in the differential, especially if vascular injury is suspected.\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura or Primary Headache Disorder\nJustification: While migraines can present with sudden severe headache, the presence of neck pain, vomiting, and emotional distress alongside rapid onset makes this diagnosis less likely to be primary but still worth consideration after ruling out more critical conditions.\nSTOP HERE.",
