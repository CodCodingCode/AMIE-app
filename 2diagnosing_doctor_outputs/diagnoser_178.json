    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young woman with sudden visual disturbances (flashing lights and zigzag shapes) followed by a severe unilateral headache, nausea, and sensory sensitivities, with persistent symptoms. \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: Classic features include transient visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzag patterns) followed by severe unilateral headache, associated nausea, and sensory sensitivities. The age, gender, and pattern support this common diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: Sudden neurological symptoms, such as visual disturbances and headache, could represent a vascular event; however, TIA less commonly presents with isolated visual aura and in the absence of other neurological deficits; still consideration for rule-out.\n3. Diagnosis: Occipital Seizure\nJustification: Visual phenomena can occur in occipital lobe seizures; however, seizures often involve ictal behaviors and postictal symptoms, which are not described here.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster Headache\nJustification: Unilateral severe headache with sensitivity to light/noise, but typically involvestearing and nasal symptoms; visual aura is less characteristic.\n5. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri)\nJustification: Can cause visual disturbances, headache, and photophobia, especially in young women; however, typically associated with papilledema, which is not mentioned.\n6. Diagnosis: Optic Neuritis\nJustification: Visual disturbances could be from optic nerve inflammation, but usually with pain on eye movement and decreased visual acuity, none of which are specified here.\n7. Diagnosis: Ocular Migraine (Retinal Migraine)\nJustification: Visual disturbances are central in ocular migraine, but usually involve more localized visual deficits rather than scintillating zigzag patterns as in aura.\n8. Diagnosis: Hemicrania Continua\nJustification: Unilateral headache may be similar but is generally continuous and not associated with visual aura-like symptoms.\n9. Diagnosis: Arterial Cerebral Event (Stroke)\nJustification: Less likely due to young age and lack of neurological deficits; but should be ruled out if concerning features develop.\n10. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis\nJustification: Can cause visual disturbances, but typically presents as episodes of optic neuritis or other neurological deficits, which are not described here; less likely given isolated aura and headache.\nSTOP HERE.",

The ep\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzag shapes) that precede a severe, unilateral headache, along with nausea and photophobia, are classic features. The episodic recurrence, linkage to menstrual cycles, and absence of neurological deficits support this diagnosis and its prevalence in young women.\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Nausea and sensitivity to light/noise can be seen in tension headaches, particularly if the headache persists or is mild-mod in severity. However, the aura component favors migraine over tension headache.\n3. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Unilateral, severe headache localized to one side can be seen in clusters, often with autonomic features; however, visual aura is less characteristic, and the younger female profile makes this less likely.\n4. Diagnosis: Hemiplegic migraine\nJustification: A rare subtype of migraine with motor aura, which may include visual disturbances followed by motor weakness; her previous episodes and visual aura are compatible, but she denies current neurological deficits, making it less likely.\n5. Diagnosis: Sinus headache\nJustification: Sinusitis can cause headache and sensitivity to noise, but the visual aura and throbbing quality are not typical, and there\u2019s no mention of sinus symptoms.\n6. Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension\nJustification: Can cause headache and visual disturbances, but typically presents with signs of increased intracranial pressure like papilledema; unlikely given the absence of other signs.\n7. Diagnosis: Temporal arteritis\nJustification: Rare in young women; generally occurs in older adults and presents with scalp tenderness and jaw claudication.\n8. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis\nJustification: MS can cause visual disturbances but usually with other neurological deficits; unlikely here due to episodic aura preceding headache without other deficits.\n9. Diagnosis: Ocular migraine (without headache)\nJustification: Visual aura may occur without headache, but in this case, headache follows, making primary ocular migraine less likely.\n10. Diagnosis: Cerebral ischemia or stroke\nJustification: Unlikely at age 28 without additional neurological deficits; sudden onset of visual aura typically does not suggest stroke in this demographic.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The visual flashing and zigzag patterns followed by a severe headache are hallmark features of migraine aura. The associated nausea and sensory sensitivities reinforce this, especially in a young woman with a history suggestive of migraines.\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache (history of similar episodes)\nJustification: The woman reports prior episodes, which could be tension headaches; however, the current episode's features are more characteristic of migraine, making tension headache less likely as the primary diagnosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Cluster headaches can cause severe unilateral headache; however, they typically involve episodic pain attacks with autonomic features like tearing or nasal congestion, which are not reported here.\n4. Diagnosis: Inner ear or vestibular disorder\nJustification: Visual disturbances like flashes and zigzags are less typical of vestibular issues, but nausea and sensitivity to light/loudness can overlap; still, the visual aura points less towards this.\n5. Diagnosis: Transient ischemic attack\nJustification: Age and symptom pattern make TIA less probable; significant neurological deficits are usually present, which are absent here.\n6. Diagnosis: Epilepsy with visual aura\nJustification: Visual auras can precede seizures, but progression to severe headache and absence of other seizure features make this less likely.\n7. Diagnosis: Ocular pathology (e.g., retinal detachment)\nJustification: Visual flashes and zigzag lines may suggest ocular causes, but the progression to a severe headache and sensory sensitivities favor neurological causes.\n8. Diagnosis: Brain tumor\nJustification: Though tumors can cause visual disturbances, the acute onset and severity of symptoms are less consistent; tumors tend to cause focal deficits over time.\n9. Diagnosis: Sinus headache\nJustification: Sinusitis can cause headache and sensitivity but less commonly produces visual aura or neurological symptoms.\n10. Diagnosis: Psychogenic or functional disorder\nJustification: Symptoms may have a functional component, but the severity and contextual features suggest a primary neurological or migrainous process; unlikely as sole diagnosis.",

The episodic\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient exhibits classic features: sudden visual changes (flashing, zigzag lines) progressing to a severe unilateral headache associated with nausea. The episodic pattern over months/years aligns with migraine aura, and previous milder episodes support a migrainous disorder.\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Although the severe aura and nausea favor migraine, tension headache can sometimes produce focal symptoms and head pressure; however, it less commonly presents with visual aura or associated nausea, making it less likely but still a differential consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Hemiplegic migraine\nJustification: Given the visual aura and severe headache, hemiplegic migraine remains a possibility, especially if any subtle neurological deficits have been reported, although the current data do not specify motor weakness.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Cluster headaches can cause severe unilateral head pain, but they typically lack visual aura and are characterized by autonomic features like lacrimation or nasal congestion, which are not reported here.\n5. Diagnosis: Intracranial vascular event (e.g., transient ischemic attack or stroke)\nJustification: Sudden visual disturbances could indicate vascular pathology, but the episodic, migrainous pattern and absence of persistent deficits make this less probable as an initial diagnosis, though it remains a differential pending further imaging.",

These feat\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The visual flashing and zigzag patterns are characteristic aura phenomena. The subsequent severe right-sided headache and nausea are typical features. Her description of previous episodes being less intense suggests a history of migraine aura episodes. The temporal relationship of visual aura followed by headache aligns with classic migraine pathophysiology. No signs of neurological deficits or red flags initially indicate a primary migraine rather than secondary causes.\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-Type Headache (possible secondary component)\nJustification: Given her description of headaches, tension-type features may coexist, especially if episodes are recurrent. However, the recent severe aura and headache surge point more toward migraine, but tension headache remains a differential for chronic or less characteristic headaches.\n3. Diagnosis: Ocular Migraine (Benign Visual Aura)\nJustification: Visual disturbances without significant neurological deficit are typical of ocular migraine. However, given the severity and progression, this is likely a variant or presentation within the migraine spectrum rather than a separate entity.\n4. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: While the visual aura and headache are more typical of migraine, sudden visual phenomena can sometimes mimic TIA. However, the absence of other focal neurological signs and the pattern being stereotypical of aura favors migraine, making TIA less probable.\n5. Diagnosis: Other Neurological Causes (e.g., seizure with visual symptoms, demyelinating disease)\nJustification: Less likely given the episodic, stereotypical aura with headache, but considered in broader differentials if symptoms evolve or persist. Visual phenomena could also result from occipital lobe seizures, but the lack of other seizure features makes this less probable.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The sudden visual disturbances such as flashing lights and zigzag patterns followed by a severe unilateral headache and nausea are hallmark features of migraine with aura. Her history of episodes occurring several times annually, often around her menstrual period, aligns with typical migraine patterns. The description of these episodes being similar to previous ones supports this diagnosis; their episodic nature and typical aura symptoms make migraine with aura the most probable.\n2. Diagnosis: Aura without headache (Migraine Aura)\nJustification: If the headache component was less prominent or absent, her visual aura alone could be considered. However, since she reports a severe headache following aura, this is less favored but still relevant in understanding her migraine spectrum.\n3. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Less likely due to the patient's age, sex, and presentation, but cluster headaches can present with unilateral head pain and visual disturbances. However, the episodic visual aura and menstrual association are more characteristic of migraines, making this diagnosis less probable.\n4. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Tension headaches are less likely given the presence of aura and severe unilateral headache with nausea; tension headaches typically lack aura and are usually bilateral with mild to moderate intensity.\n5. Diagnosis: Other secondary causes (e.g., intracranial pathology)\nJustification: While always considerations, the episodic aura-like symptoms with typical migraine features lower the suspicion for secondary causes such as tumors or vascular events unless new or atypical features appear.\nSTOP HERE.",
