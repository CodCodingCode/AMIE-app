The sudden emergence of visual hallucinations w\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Psychiatric disorder\u2014Brief Psychotic Disorder\nJustification: Sudden onset of hallucinations and paranoia in a young adult without prior psychiatric history suggests a brief psychotic episode, especially if symptoms are recent and transient.\n2. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis\nJustification: Visual hallucinations can result from intoxication or withdrawal from substances such as hallucinogens, stimulants, or cannabis; however, no substance use details are provided, but still an important consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia spectrum disorder\nJustification: Appearance of hallucinations, particularly visual, could be part of early schizophrenia; however, the recent onset and lack of mention of other characteristic symptoms (e.g., delusions, disorganized speech) make this less likely yet still plausible.\n4. Diagnosis: Organic brain disorder (e.g., neurological cause such as seizure, tumor)\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can stem from neurological issues affecting visual pathways or occipital lobe, especially in young adults; warrants consideration given the nature of hallucinations.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance withdrawal (e.g., withdrawal from psychoactive substances)\nJustification: Some substances cause hallucinations during withdrawal; no substances are specified, but it remains a differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Delirium (due to metabolic or infectious cause)\nJustification: Acute hallucinations can occur in delirium; however, no other cognitive or systemic symptoms are described, making it less likely.\n7. Diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder (Late-onset or undiagnosed)\nJustification: Less likely given the abruptness of symptoms and age; usually an early developmental disorder.\n8. Diagnosis: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with hallucinations\nJustification: If trauma occurred, hallucinations could be part of re-experiencing; no trauma info provided.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurological infection (e.g., encephalitis)\nJustification: Viral or bacterial encephalitis can cause hallucinations; although possible, no systemic or infectious symptoms are described.\n10. Diagnosis: Para-psychological or rare neuropsychiatric conditions\nJustification: Very low probability but includes rare conditions like primitive reflexes or dissociative phenomena; less consistent with presented symptoms.",

Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis (e.g., hallucinogens, stimulants, or intoxication)\nJustification: Sudden onset of hallucinations in a young adult male could be related to recent use of psychoactive substances, especially if measures are unreported. This is common and can present with visual hallucinations.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary psychotic disorder (such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder)\nJustification: The hallucinations and feelings of being watched are characteristic symptoms of psychosis, especially occurring suddenly and persistently. Although less common at this age without prior history, it remains a possibility.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute brain lesion or injury (e.g., seizure, tumor, trauma)\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can be caused by neurological events such as occipital lobe seizures or mass lesions. The persistent and intense nature warrants considering neurological causes.\n4. Diagnosis: Delirium (due to underlying medical illness)\nJustification: Acute hallucinations may be part of delirium, especially if associated with altered consciousness or agitation. Absence of detailed mental status limits certainty but remains plausible in an acute presentation.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance withdrawal (e.g., alcohol or benzodiazepines)\nJustification: If the patient recently ceased substance use, withdrawal can cause hallucinations. This is common in substance dependence histories.\n6. Diagnosis: Charles Bonnet syndrome\nJustification: Typically occurs in visually impaired older adults; unlikely here due to age and lack of visual impairment history, so less probable.\n7. Diagnosis: Psychosis secondary to metabolic disturbance (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia)\nJustification: Metabolic disturbances can induce hallucinations; no data suggest systemic illness but remain differential considerations.\n8. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features\nJustification: Hallucinations can be part of mood episodes; however, absence of mood symptoms reduces likelihood.\n9. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., early-onset dementia or Lewy body)\nJustification: Rare at 28 years, unlikely given the recent onset and lack of other cognitive decline signs.\n10. Diagnosis: Autism spectrum disorder or other developmental disorder with hallucinations\nJustification: Unlikely as primary diagnosis given recent onset in this context.\nSTOP HERE.

He mentions feelings of being unsafe, m\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The abrupt onset of visual hallucinations since last night suggests recent substance use (e.g., hallucinogens, stimulants). Young males are at risk for intoxication leading to hallucinations; the recent start supports this hypothesis.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (Early-Onset Schizophrenia or Brief Psychotic Episode)\nJustification: Visual hallucinations are characteristic of psychosis, which can present suddenly in young adults; prior episodes that resolved spontaneously could suggest a prodromal or relapsing course.\n3. Diagnosis: Medication-Induced Hallucinations\nJustification: Less likely given no medication history reported, but must consider if the patient has recent medication changes or illicit drug use.\n4. Diagnosis: Brain Neoplasm or Lesion\nJustification: Sudden visual hallucinations can result from occipital or temporal lobe pathology; however, absence of other neurological deficits makes this less likely but still important to consider.\n5. Diagnosis: Substance Withdrawal (e.g., after cessation of a hallucinogenic or stimulant drug)\nJustification: The recent onset and severity might be linked to withdrawal; further history needed but cannot be excluded initially.\n6. Diagnosis: Delirium due to an Underlying Medical Condition\nJustification: Sudden hallucinations can occur in delirium; less likely given no evidence of fever, confusion, or systemic illness, but it remains a differential.\n7.

Diagnosis: Postraumatic or Stress-Related Disorder\nJustification: Hallucinations can occur in PTSD, but the absence of trauma history and recent onset suggest lower probability.\n9. Diagnosis: Narcotic or Substance Withdrawal with Hallucinations\nJustification: Similar to substance-induced psychosis but specific to withdrawal syndromes; depend on use history.\n10.

The hallucin\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychosis (possibly due to hallucinogens, stimulants, or other drugs)\nJustification: The hallucinations began abruptly last night and are persistent; sudden onset in a young individual suggests a possible recent substance use or intoxication. Visual hallucinations are common with certain recreational drugs. The patient minimizes severity, which could indicate unrecognized or unreported substance use. Immediate consideration is warranted due to recent onset and potential toxicity hazards.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder\nJustification: Visual hallucinations, especially persistent ones, can be part of early schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, the abrupt onset in a 28-year-old with no prior history makes this less likely without prodromal features. Still, the persistent hallucinations and feelings of being watched align with psychosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute neurological event, such as seizure or temporal lobe pathology\nJustification: Onset of visual hallucinations can be secondary to neurological causes like occipital or temporal lobe disturbances or seizures. Shadows and sensations of being watched may suggest complex partial seizures or other organic processes, especially if hallucinations are vivid, sudden, and persistent.\n4. Diagnosis: Delirium or acute confusional state\nJustification: The persistent hallucinations and feelings of being watched, especially at night, could be manifestations of delirium, possibly from infection, metabolic disturbance, or intoxication. The recent change and severity of symptoms point toward an acute neurocognitive disturbance.\n5. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features\nJustification: Less likely given the abrupt onset, but mood disorders like depression with psychotic features can sometimes involve visual hallucinations, especially if co-occurring physiological stressors are present. However, the description favors a more organic or primary psychotic cause.\nSTOP HERE.",

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's abrupt onset of visual hallucinations primarily involving shadows and sensations of being watched, especially at night, points toward a psychiatric or substance-related cause. The recent\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The patient reports recent recreational drug use with an abrupt onset of visual hallucinations\u2014including shadows and being watched\u2014which are common features of intoxication or withdrawal states involving substances like cannabis, hallucinogens, stimulants, or synthetic drugs. The symptoms' initiation last night and their nocturnal occurrence align with typical intoxication effects, especially considering recent substance use. The guarded communication may mask the true severity, and substance use is a strong clue supporting this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Schizophreniform)\nJustification: While the sudden onset post-drug use suggests a substance trigger, the persistent hallucinations and sensory disturbances could indicate an emerging primary psychotic disorder. The fact that hallucinations are vivid, ongoing, and not clearly linked to ongoing intoxication leaves room for this diagnosis, especially if substance use continues or if symptoms persist after clearance.\n3. Diagnosis: Sleep-Related Hallucinations (Hypnagogic or Hypnopompic)\nJustification: The hallucinations are primarily at night and involve shadow figures and sensations of being watched, which could represent sleep-related phenomena. However, the ongoing alertness and the description suggest these may be more than typical night terrors or hypnagogic states, especially given the patient's concern and the recent onset, making this less likely but worth consideration.\n4. Diagnosis: Paranoid or Anxiety-Related Psychosis\nJustification: The sensation of being watched and shadows could reflect paranoid ideation, often seen in anxiety disorders or in early stages of psychosis. Yet, without other signs of paranoia or anxiety symptoms, this is lower probability but remains in differential diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Organic Brain Cause (e.g., Temporal Lobe Seizures or Neurocognitive Disorder)\nJustification: The abrupt onset of hallucinations could also suggest an underlying neurological issue, such as focal seizures affecting visual perception or an early neurocognitive process. Nonetheless, the lack of focal neurological findings and temporal relation to recent drug use make this less probable here but still a relevant consideration if symptoms persist or other features emerge.",

He has recent re\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychosis\nJustification: The recent recreational drug use combined with abrupt onset of visual hallucinations primarily at night suggests a substance-induced etiology. Many recreational substances, including hallucinogens or stimulants, can cause acute psychotic reactions manifesting as visual hallucinations. The lack of other psychotic symptoms and the temporal relationship support this diagnosis as most probable.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary Psychiatric Disorder (Brief Psychotic Disorder)\nJustification: Although less likely given the abrupt onset without prior psychiatric history, new-onset psychosis can occur idiopathically or as part of a primary psychotic disorder. The absence of previous symptoms or mood disturbances reduces likelihood, but it remains a differential, especially if substance effects are ruled out.\n3. Diagnosis: Delirium (Secondary to Substance or Other Underlying Cause)\nJustification: The visual hallucinations occurring abruptly, especially at night, could indicate delirium; however, core features such as fluctuation of consciousness or widespread cognitive deficits are not described, making this less probable but still worth consideration if other signs develop.\n4. Diagnosis: Neurological Causes (e.g., Occipital Lobe Lesion)\nJustification: Visual hallucinations can occur with occipital lobe pathology, but the sudden, isolated onset starting overnight and associated with drug use make this less likely without additional neurological signs or deficits present.\n5. Diagnosis: Sleep-Related Hallucinations or Parasomnias\nJustification: While hallucinations at night can occur in sleep disorders, these are generally associated with sleep paralysis or narcolepsy. The persistence over the night and the patient's report suggest a more active psychopathological process rather than a sleep disorder, but considering sleep-related causes allows comprehensive differential.\nSTOP HERE.",
