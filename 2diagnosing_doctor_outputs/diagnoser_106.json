These features suggest a serious underlying process with possible lymphatic or hematologic involvement. The differential includes infectious, malignant, and autoimmune causes. The duration of about a month and systemic features point more toward malignancies or severe infections rather than benign causes. The possibility of lymphoma is high given the lymphadenopathy pattern, B symptoms, and weight loss. Infectious causes like viral (e.g., infectious mononucleosis) or bacterial (e.g., TB) are considerations but often have more localized findings or other features. Autoimmune diseases are less likely here without other signs like rash or joint symptoms. 1. Diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma Justification: The presentation of bilateral, persistent lymphadenopathy with systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) is classic for Hodgkin lymphoma. The localizable lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms fit this pattern; age at presentation is typical. The presence of systemic B symptoms indicates a more aggressive or advanced stage, consistent with lymphoma.",

Diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: The classic presentation includes painless lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions, systemic B symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, and weight loss, and occurrence in young adults. The progression over months aligns with typical Hodgkin lymphoma. Its patterns of lymph node involvement and constitutional symptoms fit this clinical picture best, making it the most probable diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: Similar lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms are seen, but NHD is often more aggressive or widespread. While less characteristic than Hodgkin, it remains a key consideration given the systemic features and lymph node distribution.\n3. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis\nJustification: Caused by EBV, presenting with lymphadenopathy, fever, fatigue, and sometimes night sweats. However, the duration of months and weight loss are less typical, and the pattern tends to be self-limited, so it ranks lower.\n4. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis lymphadenitis\nJustification: TB can cause chronic lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms, especially in endemic regions. However, the bilateral involvement and systemic symptoms over months without localized lung findings reduce its likelihood compared to lymphomas.\n5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune disease (e.g., SLE)\nJustification: Can present with lymphadenopathy, fevers, fatigue, and weight loss.
