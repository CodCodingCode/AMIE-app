Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis\nJustification: The hallmark features include sudden onset, initial peri-umbilical pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, worsening over time, associated nausea and vomiting, subjective fever, and decreased bowel movements. These are classic signs of appendicitis. The patient's young age and typical symptom progression reinforce this diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Lymphadenitis\nJustification: Common in young adults with clinical features similar to appendicitis, including right lower quadrant pain and systemic symptoms. Often associated with viral infections, which can cause lymphoid hyperplasia mimicking appendicitis, especially when the pain is migratory. The subjective fever and systemic symptoms could be explained here, but the specific pain migration pattern favors appendicitis.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Nausea, vomiting, systemic symptoms, and decreased bowel movements are consistent with infectious gastroenteritis. However, the localized right lower quadrant pain, especially with its migration, makes this less likely as the primary cause but still relevant as a differential, particularly if the pain is less localized or more diffuse at initial presentation.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian or Testicular Torsion (if applicable)\nJustification: In males, testicular torsion can mimic appendicitis with lower abdominal pain. However, the report does not specify testicular pain or swelling, and age-specific features are not detailed. It remains a consideration in male patients with lower abdominal pain but less likely here given the classical presentation of appendicitis.\n5. Diagnosis: Early Diverticulitis (less likely at this age)\nJustification: Typically affects older individuals, but can occasionally present in young adults. Pain often localizes to the left lower quadrant, but right-sided diverticulitis can occur. The absence of prior diverticulosis history and the clinical picture makes this less probable, but included as a lower-probability differential.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: The evolution of pain from peri-umbilical to RLQ, persistence and worsening over time, along with associated nausea, vomiting, subjective fever, and decreased bowel motility, are classic features of appendicitis. The localized right lower quadrant tenderness and systemic symptoms support this diagnosis, making it the most probable cause of the clinical picture.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric adenitis\nJustification: This condition can mimic appendicitis with similar presentation of RLQ pain, especially in young adults. It often follows a viral illness and presents with lymphadenopathy in mesenteric nodes causing similar symptoms, but typically has less severe systemic signs and may involve less localized tenderness.\n3. Diagnosis: Ovarian pathology (e.g., ovarian cyst rupture or torsion)\nJustification: In females, ovarian cysts or torsion could cause RLQ pain and resemble appendicitis; however, in this 22-year-old male, this is irrelevant, thus unlikely.\n4. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: The nausea and vomiting could be due to gastroenteritis, but the localized migration of pain and worsening intensity, along with systemic signs, argue against a primary gastrointestinal infection.\n5. Diagnosis: Constipation or bowel obstruction\nJustification: Decreased bowel movements are noted, but the acute onset and localized pain pattern favor inflammation over mechanical obstruction, although it remains a consideration in differential diagnosis.",

Diagnosis: Acute Appendicitis\nJustification: The presentation with initial peri-umbilical pain progressing to right lower quadrant, increasing severity, and associated nausea, vomiting, and systemic symptoms is characteristic of appendicitis. The pain description as sharp initially and now sore, worsened by movement and breathing, fits typical inflammatory intra-abdominal pathology involving the appendix.\n2. Diagnosis: Mesenteric Adenitis\nJustification: This condition can mimic appendicitis with RLQ pain, especially in young adults. It often follows an infectious prodrome and may cause similar systemic symptoms. However, it is less likely if systemic signs are pronounced or if imaging shows no lymphadenopathy, but its inclusion accounts for differential diagnoses with similar presentation.\n3. Diagnosis: Cecal Diverticulitis\nJustification: Can cause right lower quadrant pain similar to appendicitis, particularly in young adults. Its presentation overlaps with appendicitis, but it is less common in this age group, making it a consideration, especially if imaging indicates diverticula or localized cecal inflammation.\n4. Diagnosis: Small Bowel Inflammation (e.g., Crohn's Disease flare)\nJustification: Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum can cause RLQ pain, nausea, and systemic symptoms. But the abrupt onset and more localized pain emphasize an acute process like appendicitis over chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n5.
