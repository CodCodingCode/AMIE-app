Diagnosis: Infectious or inflammatory swelling (e.g., sialadenitis)\nJustification: Can produce swelling and discomfort; however, the two-month duration without systemic symptoms makes this less probable.\n7. Diagnosis: Malignant salivary gland tumor\nJustification: Less likely given the age and slow growth, but critical to consider in persistent intraoral masses.\n8. Diagnosis: Osteoma or other bony lesion (if bony involvement)\nJustification: Usually presents as bony hard swelling; the soft characteristic reduces likelihood but can sometimes be involved.\n9. Diagnosis: Traumatic or reactive lesion (e.g., traumatic hemosiderotic hematoma)\nJustification: Usually resolves faster; the two-month persistence suggests a more chronic process.\n10. Diagnosis: Lymphadenopathy\nJustification: Typically presents as a firm, tender, or movable lymph node; soft intraoral mass less typical unless secondary to infection, but less likely in this scenario.",

Diagnosis: Congenital or developmental benign cyst (e.g., dentigerous cyst)\nJustification: The intraoral swelling\u2019s soft to firm consistency, duration of two months, and mild discomfort are consistent with a cystic lesion, such as a dentigerous cyst, especially in a younger patient. These cysts often present as slow-growing, painless or mildly uncomfortable swellings in the jaw or cheek area, correlating with intraoral location. The potential for slight enlargement aligns with a cystic process that may be expanding gradually.\n2. Diagnosis: Benign salivary gland tumor (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma)\nJustification: Mild discomfort during chewing and mouth opening suggests involvement of minor salivary tissue, which could produce a slow-growing, firm, intraoral swelling. Pleomorphic adenomas are common benign salivary tumors in adolescents/young adults, presenting as persistent, painless, or mildly uncomfortable swellings, often firm but mobile.\n3. Diagnosis: Odontogenic tumor (e.g., ameloblastoma or odontogenic fibroma)\nJustification: These tumors can present as intraosseous or soft tissue masses with slow growth over months, sometimes causing mild discomfort. The soft to firm consistency fits with these slow-growing tumors, with ameloblastoma being more likely if the lesion is intraosseous, causing expansion in the cheek area.\n4. Diagnosis: Lipoma or adipose tissue tumor\nJustification: Soft consistency and slow growth over two months are characteristic of a lipoma, which can occur intraorally as a soft, mobile, painless mass. Given the description as \"soft to firm,\" lipoma remains a possible benign soft tissue tumor.\n5. Diagnosis: Minor salivary gland minor mucosal cyst (e.g., mucocele)\nJustification: Mucoceles are common intraoral cystic lesions resulting from salivary duct rupture, presenting as soft, bluish swellings; however, their typical presentation is more rapid onset with fluctuant, bluish appearance. Given the two-month duration and slightly enlarging nature, this is less likely but still within differential considerations for soft tissue cysts.\nSTOP HERE.

Diagnosis: Pleomorphic Adenoma\nJustification: This is the most common benign salivary gland tumor affecting the palate and buccal mucosa in adolescents. The lesion's soft to firm consistency, slow growth over two months, and location in the cheek region align with typical presentation. Mild discomfort during chewing and mouth opening correlates with a mass exerting pressure on adjacent tissues, but lack of systemic symptoms supports a benign process.\n2. Diagnosis: Mucocele\nJustification: Mucoceles are common mucous extravasation phenomena, often presenting as soft, fluctuant swellings in the oral cavity, especially in the lower lip, but can occur in the cheek. Although mucoceles tend to fluctuate in size rapidly, chronic low-grade mucoceles may persist and slowly enlarge, possibly fitting this scenario. The lesion's soft consistency and intraoral location are compatible, although the progressive timeline is less typical.\n3. Diagnosis: Lipoma\nJustification: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that can occur intraorally, presenting as soft, well-circumscribed, slow-growing masses. They are less common in adolescents but remain possible. The lesion's consistency (soft to firm) and slow growth over two months are characteristic, although lipomas are usually asymptomatic and unchanging.\n4. Diagnosis: Lymphatic Malformation (Cystic Hygroma)\nJustification: Developmental lymphatic malformations can present as soft, cystic, gradually enlarging intraoral swellings. They are often present from childhood but can manifest later. Mild discomfort fits if the lesion exerts pressure, though they are usually soft and transilluminate readily, helping differentiate. The slow growth aligns with typical behavior.\n5. Diagnosis: Low-grade Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma\nJustification: Though less likely due to the benign features and gradual growth, low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma can occur in young patients and present as a slow-growing intraoral mass with mild symptoms. It remains included because it can mimic benign conditions and warrants consideration, especially if lesion changes or additional concerning features develop.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Mucocele\nJustification: The lesion is within the oral cavity, appears soft or squishy, with slow growth over two months, and mild discomfort during mastication. Mucoceles are common mucous retention cysts resulting from blockage or rupture of salivary gland ducts, often presenting as painless, fluctuant swellings. The gradual increase and soft consistency fit well with a mucocele, especially considering the location and symptom description.\n2. Diagnosis: Pleomorphic Adenoma\nJustification: As the most common benign salivary gland tumor, pleomorphic adenoma can occur intraorally, particularly in minor salivary glands of the palate or buccal mucosa. It tends to grow slowly, is usually painless, and presents as a firm, well-circumscribed mass. The lesion's slow enlargement, mild discomfort, and persistence over two months support this diagnosis, especially if the lesion feels firmer than a cyst.\n3. Diagnosis: Lipoma\nJustification: Lipomas are benign tumors of adipose tissue that often present as soft, non-tender, slowly enlarging swellings. The description of a soft or squishy lesion aligns with lipoma, which typically grows slowly and may be asymptomatic. The location in the cheek is common for intraoral lipomas.\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital or Developmental Cyst (e.g., Dermoid or Epidermoid Cyst)\nJustification: These cysts are benign developmental lesions that can appear as slow-growing, soft, fluctuant swellings in the oral cavity. They often present in similar age groups and can cause mild discomfort if enlarging or pressing on surrounding tissues. The persistence over months and soft consistency are compatible.\n5. Diagnosis: Vascular Malformation (e.g., Hemangioma or Lymphangioma)\nJustification: These can present as soft, sometimes squishy swellings with slow progression. The history of a lesion that may fluctuate or feel compressible aligns with vascular anomalies; however, they often show color changes or blanching, which are not described here. Nonetheless, given the lesion's characteristics, they remain considerations, particularly if imaging reveals vascular features.\nSTOP HERE.",

The differential includes mucoceles, benign salivary gland tumors (such as pleomorphic adenoma), cystic lesions, or less likely, neoplastic processes. The history of slow progression and soft consistency favors a mucous retention phenomenon like a mucocele, especially considering intraoral location, but the possibility of a benign salivary gland tumor cannot be excluded without imaging. Physical examination hints at a lesion that may be larger or firmer than perceived, warranting further imaging for clarification. Exclusion of malignant processes is less supported given the benign symptomatology, but cannot be fully ruled out without tissue diagnosis. - Complete symptom profile: Slow-growing, soft, squishy intraoral swelling with mild discomfort during chewing and mouth opening. - Timeline and progression: Persistent for approximately two months, with a gradual increase in size.",
