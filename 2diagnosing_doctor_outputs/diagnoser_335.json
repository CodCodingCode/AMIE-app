Diagnosis: Psoriasis vulgaris\nJustification: Chronic, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales on elbows and knees are characteristic of psoriasis vulgaris, which is common in adults and often exacerbated by environmental triggers such as dust and pollen.\n2. Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis (adult eczema)\nJustification: Itchy, dry, erythematous patches that worsen with environmental allergens may suggest eczema; however, the location on elbows and knees and thickening points more toward psoriasis.\n3. Diagnosis: Nummular eczema\nJustification: Coin-shaped, itchy, scaly patches can resemble nummular eczema, especially with environmental aggravation, but their typical presentation is more round and more variable.\n4. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis (allergic or irritant)\nJustification: Environmental triggers such as dust and pollen can cause contact dermatitis, which manifests as itchy erythematous patches, but the persistent thickening over months favors psoriasis.\n5. Diagnosis: Tinea corporis (fungal infection)\nJustification: Fungal infections can cause scaly, erythematous patches; however, the chronicity and waxing/waning pattern, along with the thickening, make fungal less likely.\n6. Diagnosis: Lichen planus\nJustification: Can cause pruritic, scaly, erythematous patches, but classically presents with violaceous, polygonal papules.\n7. Diagnosis: Seborrheic dermatitis\nJustification: Involves erythematous, scaly patches, often on scalp or face, less common on elbows and knees in light-skinned adults.\n8. Diagnosis: Pityriasis rosea\nJustification: Typically presents with a single herald patch and secondary eruptions; not persistent with thickening on elbows and knees.\n9. Diagnosis: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus\nJustification: Can cause erythematous, scaly patches, but usually associated with photosensitivity and other systemic findings.\n10. Diagnosis: Lichen simplex chronicus\nJustification: Result of chronic scratching; presents with thickened, scaly plaques, but generally develops as a consequence, not primary.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Psoriasis vulgaris\nJustification: Classic presentation with erythematous, thickened, scaly plaques on extensor surfaces (elbows and knees), chronic duration, and progression in thickening fit well with psoriasis, which is common in this age group.\n2.

Diagnosis: Tinea corporis (ringworm)\nJustification: Fungal infection can cause scaly, erythematous patches; but lesions are usually annular with clear centers, less characterized by thick plaques on elbows and knees.\n5.

Diagnosis: Psoriasis vulgaris\nJustification: The persistent, erythematous, thickened, scaly patches on extensor surfaces, triggered or worsened by environmental factors like dust and pollen, are characteristic of psoriasis. The chronicity and localization support this diagnosis, which is common in adults and often involves extensor surfaces.\n2. Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis\nJustification: Although typically involving flexural areas, atopic dermatitis can sometimes affect extensor regions, possibly in adults. Mild itching with environmental triggers can support this, but the chronic, thickened plaques are less typical.\n3. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis (chronic irritant or allergic)\nJustification: Environmental exposures like dust and pollen could cause contact dermatitis. However, the lesion distribution and scaling are more characteristic of psoriasis, making contact dermatitis less likely as the primary diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Tinea corporis (ringworm)\nJustification: Fungal infections can cause scaly patches on the skin, often with a ring-like appearance. However, the description of thickened, chronic plaques with minimal mention of central clearing makes tinea less likely.\n5.

Diagnosis: Plaque Psoriasis\nJustification: The description of erythematous, scaly, hyperkeratotic patches on extensor surfaces of elbows and knees is classic for plaque psoriasis. Environmental exacerbation with dust and pollen is common in psoriasis, and the chronic, gradually enlarging nature supports this. The minimal pruritus and absence of systemic symptoms are typical features of psoriasis.\n2. Diagnosis: Nummular Eczema\nJustification: Nummular eczema can present with well-defined, round, erythematous, scaly patches similar in appearance; however, it typically affects the extremities and is often more pruritic.

Diagnosis: Tinea Corporis (Ringworm)\nJustification: Fungal infections can cause scaly, erythematous patches with central clearing; however, the description of thickened and hyperkeratotic patches is less typical. The distribution on elbows and knees can fit, but chronicity without systemic spread makes this less probable.\n4.

Diagnosis: Psoriasis vulgaris\nJustification: The location on extensor surfaces (elbows, knees), presence of erythematous, scaly, hyperkeratotic patches, gradual enlargement over months, and exacerbation with environmental factors such as dust and pollen are classic for psoriasis. The chronicity and scaling pattern reinforce this likelihood, and the guarded communication may underestimate actual severity.\n2. Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis (eczema)\nJustification: Although more common in younger individuals and often affecting flexural areas, atopic dermatitis can present with chronic dry, scaly patches, especially in adults with environmental triggers. The patient's reported dryness and itching fit, but the distribution and appearance are less characteristic than psoriasis.\n3. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis\nJustification: Worsening with household triggers suggests an allergic or irritant component. if there is recent exposure to potential allergens or irritants, contact dermatitis could explain localized patches. However, the pattern and duration favor a more chronic process like psoriasis.\n4. Diagnosis: Nummular eczema\nJustification: This form of eczema presents with coin-shaped, scaly plaques on extremities, similar to the described patches, and can be chronic. Still, the classical configuration and location favor psoriasis over nummular eczema.\n5.

Diagnosis: Psoriasis vulgaris\nJustification: The presentation of erythematous, scaly, hyperkeratotic plaques on the extensor surfaces of elbows and knees, progressing gradually over months, aligns with classic plaque psoriasis. The chronicity, location, and scale support this diagnosis. Itching that worsens at night is common in psoriasis, and environmental triggers like pollen and dust can exacerbate it. The patient's age and symptom pattern fit typical psoriasis epidemiology.\n2. Diagnosis: Atopic dermatitis (eczema)\nJustification: The patient's report of itching worsening at night and emotional discomfort suggests atopy-related dermatitis. While classically affecting flexural areas, atopic dermatitis can present with dry, itchy patches on extensor surfaces, especially if exacerbated by environmental allergens such as pollen and dust, which are known triggers. The emotional and sleep disturbances support a significant pruritic, eczema-related component.\n3. Diagnosis: Contact dermatitis\nJustification: Exacerbation with household activities and environmental exposures like dust and pollen suggests possible contact hypersensitivity. Although the lesion distribution is more typical for psoriasis, contact dermatitis can produce erythematous, scaly patches and intense itching, especially if there's recent exposure to allergens or irritating substances.\n4. Diagnosis: Tinea corporis (dermatophyte infection)\nJustification: Chronic, scaly patches on the extensor areas could represent a fungal infection. However, the description favors psoriasis due to the hyperkeratotic, well-demarcated plaques that have been gradually enlarging over months, which is characteristic of psoriasis. Tinea typically shows more centripetal scaling and less well-defined plaques in this context but remains in differential.\n5. Diagnosis: Nummular eczema\nJustification: The described hyperkeratotic, scaly patches could be consistent with nummular eczema, which presents as round or oval patches that are itchy and scaly, often on the extremities. Despite this, the classic location and appearance favor psoriasis, but nummular eczema remains a differential diagnosis due to similar features.\nSTOP HERE.",
