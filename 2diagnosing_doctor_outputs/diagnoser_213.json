The combination of acute \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Aortic dissection\nJustification: The sudden onset of chest and back pain radiating to the arms strongly suggests aortic dissection, especially in a young woman with no prior history. The systemic symptoms and possible signs of hypoperfusion or vascular involvement are consistent with this life-threatening vascular emergency, which must be ruled out promptly.\n2. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism\nJustification: The chest pain radiating to the arms and systemic symptoms raise concern for PE, especially with acute onset and systemic signs. PE often presents with chest pain and dyspnea, but the systemic symptoms and back pain could be atypical features, requiring urgent consideration.\n3. Diagnosis: Hepatitis (most likely acute viral hepatitis)\nJustification: Jaundice, fatigue, malaise, chills, low-grade fever, and systemic symptoms point toward an infectious hepatic process, which may also trigger systemic inflammatory responses affecting other organs.\n4. Diagnosis: Cholecystitis or biliary pathology\nJustification: Features like jaundice, systemic symptoms, and possibly right upper quadrant pain (if described in full) suggest biliary tract disease, especially considering the jaundice and malaise.\n5. Diagnosis: Infective endocarditis\nJustification: Systemic symptoms, chills, fever, malaise, and possible vascular phenomena could signify infective endocarditis with embolic events affecting the aorta or another vascular site.\n6. Diagnosis: Hematologic disorder leading to vaso-occlusion (e.g., sickle cell crisis)\nJustification: Although less common in a young woman without prior history, sickle cell crisis can produce severe vaso-occlusion, chest/back pain, and systemic symptoms, with possible jaundice due to hemolysis.\n7. Diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis\nJustification: Systemic symptoms with abdominal pain radiating to the back are typical, but the lack of explicit mention of abdominal pain specifics makes it less likely; still, jaundice could suggest biliary pancreatitis.\n8. Diagnosis: Sepsis\nJustification: The systemic symptoms, chills, fever, malaise, and jaundice could reflect sepsis from a hepatic or biliary source, especially with systemic inflammatory response.\n9. Diagnosis: Autoimmune hepatitis\nJustification: Jaundice and systemic symptoms could be consistent, especially if there's a history of autoimmune disease; however, the acute nature favors infectious or vascular causes initially.\n10. Diagnosis: Malignancy (e.g., hepatic or vascular tumor)\nJustification: Less likely in this age and acute presentation but remains a consideration in systemic symptoms and jaundice, especially if symptoms persist or evolve.",

Key features include the\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Aortic dissection\nJustification: The sudden, severe chest and back pain radiating to the arms, along with systemic symptoms (weakness, fatigue, jaundice, chills, low-grade fever), suggests a life-threatening vascular event. Aortic dissection classically presents with abrupt onset of severe pain that may radiate to the extremities or back; the systemic signs could reflect ischemia or impending catastrophe. The age (28-year-old female) is less typical for degenerative aneurysm, but congenital or connective tissue disorders, which are not detailed here, could predispose to dissection.\n2. Diagnosis: Ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm\nJustification: Similar presentation to dissection with sudden severe chest/back pain radiation, signs of systemic illness, and possible hemodynamic instability. A rupture would cause intense pain and systemic effects. The systemic signs such as jaundice might reflect shock or organ hypoperfusion secondary to vascular catastrophe.\n3. Diagnosis: Acute cholangitis or hepatitis\nJustification: Jaundice suggests hepatic or biliary pathology. Cholangitis can present with RUQ pain, fever, and jaundice, and systemic symptoms like chills are consistent. Though it doesn't fully explain the severe chest/back pain or arm radiation, systemic infectious processes could coexist or contribute.\n4. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism\nJustification: Presents with chest pain, possible radiating symptoms, and systemic signs such as weakness and fever. Although less classic in radiation to arms, embolism can cause chest pain and systemic symptoms, especially if complicated by infarction or pulmonary infarct, but less associated with jaundice.\n5. Diagnosis: Other systemic infectious or inflammatory process (e.g., hepatitis with systemic effects)\nJustification: The combination of jaundice, fevers, chills, and systemic symptoms points towards infectious hepatitis or other systemic infections. While less directly explaining the pain, systemic infectious causes can cause such presentations and should be considered, especially given the systemic symptoms.\nSTOP HERE.",

While she has systemic symptoms, these can occur with dissection if complicated by ischemia or secondary effects. The rapid onset and severity align with this diagnosis, which demands prompt recognition to prevent catastrophic outcomes.\n2. Diagnosis: Hepatic or biliary pathology with systemic infection\nJustification: Jaundice along with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and fatigue suggests hepatitis, cholangitis, or another hepatic infection/inflammation. Although her primary pain isn\u2019t localized to the abdomen, systemic inflammation can cause referred pain or be secondary to hepatic process, especially if complicated by infection.\n3.

Diagnosis: Systemic Infectious Process (e.g., Infective Endocarditis / Septicemia)\nJustification: Fever, chills, weakness, systemic distress, and jaundice could point to systemic infection.

Diagnosis: Acute Viral Hepatitis\nJustification: The patient exhibits jaundice, fatigue, weakness, chills, and low-grade fever\u2014classic systemic features of hepatitis. The hepatic inflammation can cause referred pain to the chest/back area, especially if the liver capsule is stretched. Her age and systemic symptoms fit well, and no evidence of trauma or vascular pathology is indicated; systemic symptoms support infectious hepatic causes.\n2. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection (Type B)\nJustification: Sudden-onset chest and back pain radiating to the arms is characteristic. While less common in young women without risk factors, the severity, radiation, and progression make this a critical consideration. However, absence of specific risk factors or pulse asymmetry makes it slightly less probable, but it must remain on the list due to potential severity and overlapping pain pattern.\n3. Diagnosis: Biliary Tract Disease (Cholangitis or Cholecystitis)\nJustification: Jaundice, systemic symptoms, and pain localized to the upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back, suggest biliary pathology. Systemic signs like fever and chills support cholangitis, which can cause referred pain and systemic illness. The acute presentation and jaundice support this.\n4. Diagnosis: Pancreatitis\nJustification: Sudden upper abdominal/back pain radiating to the back, elevated systemic symptoms, and jaundice (if bile duct involved) suggest pancreatitis.

She states the pain started yesterday evening and has been ongoing since then, describing it as constant with some perception of intermittent worsening. She reports radiation of pain down her arms and feelings of weakness and fatigue. She notes systemic symptoms including jaundice, fatigue, chills, and a low-grade fever that have persisted since symptom onset. She describes feeling unable to sleep and experiencing discomfort that she perceives as worsening overall, although she reports the pain as \"coming and going,\" which may reflect difficulty in accurately perceiving episodic symptom changes. She also reports mild breathlessness and weakness but does not specify whether these symptoms fluctuate or are persistent.\nAssociated symptoms: The patient mentions chills, fatigue, jaundice, and low-grade fever. She reports feeling weak and tired, and some difficulty breathing, but details about specific triggers, relief periods, or associated gastrointestinal symptoms are not provided, and her perception may underrepresent episodic symptom variation.\nCONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT:\n- High confidence: Presence of chest and back pain, systemic signs of jaundice, fatigue, chills, and fever.\n- Medium confidence: Perception of pain being constant, with potential underreporting of fluctuation; systemic symptoms appear ongoing but may vary in severity.\n- Low confidence: Exact pattern of symptom fluctuation, triggers, and episodic relief states; the severity may be overestimated due to emotional distress.\n- Missing information: Clarification on whether symptoms improve with rest or medication, detailed symptom fluctuation patterns, and any other systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms not currently reported.",
