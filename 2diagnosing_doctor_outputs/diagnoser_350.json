Diagnosis: Melanoma\nJustification: Rapid enlargement over 6 mm, irregular borders, uneven pigmentation, and recent change strongly suggest malignant melanoma, which is a skin cancer requiring urgent diagnosis due to aggressive potential.\n2.

These features increase suspicion of malignancy significantly, making melanoma the most probable diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma\nJustification: Although typically presenting as pearly, telangiectatic, or rolled border lesions, some basal cell carcinomas can ulcerate or crust, especially if neglected or inflamed.

The intermittent soreness and itching, combined with the patient's concern and perception of change, further support suspicion. These features align with malignant melanoma's typical presentation, especially considering the new, asymmetrical, pigmented lesion with irregular borders.\n2.

The patient's description of crusting or bleeding hints could be consistent, but the rapid growth and heterogeneity favor melanoma more strongly.\n3. Diagnosis: Atypical (dysplastic) nevus\nJustification: While atypical nevi can develop irregular borders and pigmentation, they tend to change gradually. The recent rapid change over three weeks with size increase is less typical, but atypical nevi can sometimes evolve in this manner, thus still in the differential.\n4.

Diagnosis: Melanoma\nJustification: The lesion exhibits recent growth, irregular borders, heterogeneous pigmentation, and crusting, all features highly suggestive of melanoma. The three-week evolution aligns with malignant transformation. Intermittent soreness and itching, combined with her anxiety about melanoma, heighten concern. The lesion's size (>6mm) and irregular features further support malignant potential, demanding urgent evaluation.\n2.

The intermittent itchiness and soreness, along with prior crusting and bleeding, further support this suspicion. The absence of active bleeding at the moment does not negate the possibility, as melanoma can sometimes have variable surface activity. The clinical pattern aligns with a pigmented malignant lesion rather than benign nevus or other benign conditions. Features do not favor inflammatory or infectious etiologies, and the irregular borders rule out many benign lesions.

These characteristics are typical of melanoma, especially considering the irregular borders, color heterogeneity, and recent growth. The absence of current bleeding or ulceration does not rule out melanoma, which can be asymptomatic or intermittently bleeding. Differential diagnoses like seborrheic keratosis or benign nevi are less likely given rapid growth and border irregularity.

The patient\u2019s intermittent itching and crusting could indicate ongoing surface changes, but current absence of active bleeding or crusting suggests the lesion may not be acutely inflamed or bleeding. Her anxiety might exaggerate perceived severity, but objective features are worrying for a pigmented melanoma. The lesion\u2019s size, irregularity, and pigmentation are key clues. Excluding benign causes like seborrheic keratosis or dysplastic nevi seems reasonable given the described characteristics.
