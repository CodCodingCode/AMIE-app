Diagnosis: Melanoma (Amelanotic)\nJustification: Given the recent change, rapid growth, and bleeding, melanoma remains a key concern, particularly the amelanotic subtype which can be less pigmented and more challenging to identify but can present as raised, rough lesions with bleeding.\n3. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma\nJustification: Rapid growth over weeks with a raised, rough surface can mimic keratoacanthoma, which often resembles SCC but tends to grow quickly and may spontaneously regress.\n4.

The vague description coupled with progression suggests potential neoplastic processes, possibly ma\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nJustification: The lesion's recent rapid growth over two weeks, becoming raised and rough, with intermittent bleeding, strongly suggests a keratinizing malignant tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) commonly presents with a keratotic, ulcerated, or bleeding lesion that enlarges over weeks, especially in sun-exposed areas. Its tendency to bleed intermittently matches the described features, making it high on the differential.\n2. Diagnosis: Basal Cell Carcinoma\nJustification: BCC often appears as a slowly enlarging, pearly or translucent nodule with possible ulceration and crusting, which could explain bleeding. The lesion's recent growth and raised texture align with BCC, which is common in sun-exposed skin. While typically slower-growing, some subtypes can progress rapidly, especially if neglected.\n3. Diagnosis: Melanoma\nJustification: Although not specified as pigmented, melanoma can sometimes present with rapid growth, irregular surface, and bleeding. The recent increase and change in surface characteristics could reflect a malignant melanocytic lesion. Further morphological detail would be needed, but melanoma remains a significant consideration due to its aggressive potential.\n4. Diagnosis: Seborrheic Keratosis (regressed or irritated)\nJustification: These benign lesions can become raised, rough, and may occasionally ulcerate or bleed if traumatized. While typically slow-growing, recent changes might be due to irritation or minor trauma. Less likely given the rapid progression, but still included due to their prevalence.\n5. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma\nJustification: Keratoacanthoma presents as a rapidly enlarging, keratotic nodule often with a crateriform center and can bleed. It develops over a few weeks and is often mistaken for SCC; thus, it is included. Its rapid growth and central keratin plug fit the timeline and morphology, though histologic confirmation is needed.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Melanoma\nJustification: The lesion's rapid onset, recent growth, crusty surface with pigmentation (black and brown), bleeding episodes, and the two-week period is characteristic of melanoma, especially considering the lesion's irregular coloration and rapid change. Melanoma often appears suddenly, grows quickly, and can ulcerate or bleed, matching this presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Basal Cell Carcinoma (Ulcerated or Pigmented Type)\nJustification: BCC can present as a crusted, pigmented, vascular lesion that may bleed, especially if ulcerated. Its slow growth is typical, but aggressive or pigmented variants can mimic melanoma and present with rapid changes in certain cases.\n3. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nJustification: SCC can present as a crusted, bleeding, raised lesion, especially if ulcerated or keratinized.

Diagnosis: Pigmented Seborrheic Keratosis\nJustification: Although typically slow-growing and benign, unusual rapid changes, bleeding, or crusting could cause confusion. However, the recent rapid growth over two weeks makes this less probable but worth considering initially until further assessment.\n5.

The pigmentat\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Melanoma\nJustification: The pigmented, crusted lesion with black and brown pigmentation, rapid initial growth, and intermittent bleeding are characteristic features of melanoma, a highly malignant and invasive skin cancer with potential for quick growth and ulceration. The recent increase in size and bleeding episodes raise concern for malignancy with invasive behavior.\n2. Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nJustification: The crusted, ulcerated appearance and intermittent bleeding are typical features of squamous cell carcinoma, which often presents as hyperkeratotic, crusted, and bleeding lesions. While less pigmented than melanoma, its ability to rapidly grow and bleed matches the lesion\u2019s features.\n3. Diagnosis: Pigmented Basal Cell Carcinoma\nJustification: Although less common, pigmented basal cell carcinoma can present with pigmented, crusted, and ulcerated features with intermittent bleeding, aligning with some aspects of this lesion. Its inclusion considers the lesion's pigmentation and bleeding but is lower in probability than melanoma and SCC.\n4. Diagnosis: Clinically Suspicious Nevus (Dysplastic or Borderline)\nJustification: A recent and rapid change in pigmentation and size could suggest a dysplastic or atypical nevus. However, the bleeding and crusting are less characteristic of benign nevi, making this less likely but still worth considering.\n5. Diagnosis: Keratoacanthoma\nJustification: Keratoacanthoma can present as a rapidly growing, crusted, keratin-filled lesion that may bleed, mimicking squamous cell carcinoma.
