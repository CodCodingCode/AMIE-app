The in\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: The palpable cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like fevers, fatigue, and muscle weakness, along with unexplained bruising, are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphadenopathy is a hallmark, and systemic \"B symptoms\" such as fevers are common. The duration and progression fit lymphoma, and the autoimmune or infectious causes are less consistent with lymph node distribution and systemic signs observed here.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma, with lymph node involvement and systemic symptoms. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present with lymphadenopathy, systemic fevers, and constitutional symptoms. The widespread lymphadenopathy and symptoms without other specific features remain compatible. The absence of Reed-Sternberg cells (not available here) makes lymphoma still most probable.\n3. Diagnosis: Leukemia (e.g., acute leukemia)\nJustification: The symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, unexplained bruising (suggesting thrombocytopenia), and lymphadenopathy could be explained by marrow infiltration, as seen in leukemia. The systemic symptoms and signs of hematologic failure align with leukemia, especially if marrow suppression leads to cytopenias causing bruising.\n4. Diagnosis: Autoimmune vasculitis (e.g., systemic vasculitis)\nJustification: The unexplained bruising and systemic symptoms might be due to vasculitis causing vessel inflammation and damage, leading to bruising, along with systemic illness. Lymphadenopathy is less typical but can occur due to immune activation. Absence of specific autoantibodies data prevents confirmation, but autoimmune causes remain in differential.\n5. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis (EBV infection)\nJustification: REcurrent fevers, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue are characteristic. Bruising and muscle weakness are less typical but could occur with associated immune effects.

Diagnosis: Hodgkin Lymphoma\nJustification: The presence of painless lymphadenopathy\u2014especially in cervical and axillary regions\u2014along with systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue is characteristic.

The subacute course over a month aligns with Hodgkin lymphoma's typical presentation, and age (35) fits common demographic. Although night sweats and weight loss are not reported, their absence does not exclude lymphoma.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\nJustification: Similar to Hodgkin lymphoma, with lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms, but non-Hodgkin variants are more variable in presentation. The multiple lymph node groups involved and ongoing systemic symptoms favor a lymphoproliferative process. The persistent bruising and fatigue also suggest marrow or blood cell involvement.\n3. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr Virus)\nJustification: Recurrent fevers, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue are typical. Mild bruising can occur due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy secondary to infection. Usually affects younger individuals, but presentation can be similar at age 35. The absence of sore throat or sore tonsils is noted, but symptom variability is common.\n4.

The key features have been described coherently, and physical findings are consistent with lymphoid malignancy.

The timeline indicates symptoms started approximately one month ago, with lymphadenopathy emerging within two weeks. The presence of bruising points toward possible cytopenias. The episodic fevers and night sweating further support a lymphoid or hematologic malignancy such as Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The lack of weight loss does not exclude malignancy, but it suggests an active inflammatory or neoplastic process. Differential diagnoses like infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV), autoimmune conditions (e.g., lymphoma-associated autoimmune phenomena), or hematologic disorders (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma) need to be considered. The clincher is the combination of lymphadenopathy, systemic B symptoms, bruising, and fatigue without significant weight loss, favoring lymphoma. - Complete symptom profile: Fatigue, skin bruising, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, episodic fevers, night sweats, no weight loss. - Timeline and progression: Symptoms began about one month ago; lymphadenopathy developed within two weeks.",

The lymphadenopathy involves cervical and axillary regions, and the fevers are unpredictable, occurring both day and night. The absence of weight loss suggests a systemic inflammatory or hematological process rather than metastatic malignancy with cachexia. Bruising indicates possible thrombocytopenia or other hematological abnormalities. The constellation of constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and cytopenias raises suspicion for hematologic malignancy, specifically Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or a hematological disorder like leukemia. Infectious causes (e.g., infectious mononucleosis, TB) are less likely given persistent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, though they must be considered. The pattern indicates a likely lymphoproliferative disorder with systemic involvement. - Complete symptom profile: fatigue, skin bruising, lymphadenopathy (cervical and axillary), episodic fevers, night sweating. - Timeline and progression: symptoms started roughly a month ago, overlapping in onset; precise order uncertain but lymphadenopathy and fevers emerged within this period.",

The combination of constitutional symptoms, lymph node enlargement, and bleeding tendencies points toward a lymphoproliferative disorder, possibly lymphoma. The lack of weight loss does not exclude this; early-stage lymphoma can present subtly. The episodic fevers and night sweats are characteristic of B symptoms seen in lymphoma. Bruising and fatigue may also relate to marrow involvement or thrombocytopenia. The timeline indicates symptoms began with fatigue and bruising, with lymphadenopathy and fevers arising within weeks. The clinical pattern aligns with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, considering systemic B symptoms and lymphadenopathy.

The recent onset of easy bruising and fatigue suggests possible hematologic or systemic pathology. The timeline indicates fatigue and bruising preceded lymphadenopathy and fevers, but recall is uncertain, raising the question of whether these symptoms are interconnected or coincidental. The combination of constitutional B symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and hematologic manifestations strongly points toward a lymphoid malignancy, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma. The tenderness and firmness of nodes further support lymphoid pathology. The absence of weight loss does not rule out lymphoma.
