Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids\nJustification: Protruding anal bulge, bleeding, mucus, and pain during defecation are hallmark features. Hemorrhoids are highly prevalent in older adults and often present with prolapse and bleeding, especially when symptomatic.\n2. Diagnosis: Rectal prolapse\nJustification: The protruding anal bulge that appears after bowel movements and the sensation of incomplete evacuation point toward full-thickness rectal prolapse, particularly in an older woman.\n3. Diagnosis: Anal fissure\nJustification: Pain with defecation and bleeding are typical; mucus discharge may also be present. However, fissures usually cause sharp pain during and after defecation without a prolapsed bulge.\n4. Diagnosis: Rectocele\nJustification: Feelings of incomplete evacuation and mucus may be associated with a rectocele, a posterior vaginal wall prolapse affecting defecation.\n5. Diagnosis: Colon or rectal tumor\nJustification: Bleeding and mucus could suggest neoplasm; however, the prolapse is less characteristic unless associated with advanced tumors causing mass effect.\n6. Diagnosis: Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis)\nJustification: Mucus discharge and bleeding could be related; however, the localized protrusion is less typical, and no systemic symptoms are noted.\n7. Diagnosis: Crohn's disease\nJustification: Similar to ulcerative colitis; possible but less likely in the absence of other systemic or transmural features.\n8. Diagnosis: Anal abscess or fistula\nJustification: Pain and possibly mucus; bleeding less typical, and no signs of infection or swelling are mentioned.\n9. Diagnosis: Anal or rectal neoplasm (less likely but important to consider)\nJustification: Persistent bleeding and mucus are risk factors; the protrusion could represent a neoplastic mass, but less likely without systemic signs.\n10. Diagnosis: Infectious proctitis\nJustification: Mucus and bleeding could suggest infection, but less likely given the absence of other infectious symptoms or risk factors.",

Diagnosis: External or combined hemorrhoids\nJustification: Most common cause of anal protrusions and bleeding, especially in older women with straining history; symptoms of bleeding, mucus, and pain fit well.\n2. Diagnosis: Full-thickness rectal prolapse\nJustification: Protruding anal bulge with associated incomplete evacuation and mucus; common in women over 60, especially with chronic straining.\n3. Diagnosis: Mucosal prolapse (intussusception)\nJustification: Mucosal protrusion that may appear as a reducible bulge, with symptoms of inadequately evacuated bowels and mucus discharge.\n4. Diagnosis: Anal fissure\nJustification: Pain during defecation and bleeding are characteristic; although a bulge is less typical, chronic fissures can cause significant discomfort.\n5. Diagnosis: Condyloma or anal skin tags\nJustification: Could be mistaken for external prolapse; associated with chronic irritation, but less likely to cause bleeding or mucus.\n6. Diagnosis: Rectal or anal neoplasm\nJustification: While less probable without more alarming red flags, bleeding and mucus could suggest malignancy; a concerning differential due to age.\n7. Diagnosis: Abscess or fistula\nJustification: Less consistent given the described bulge and no explicit signs of infection, yet possible if an abscess extends externally.\n8. Diagnosis: Anorectal abscess\nJustification: Typically presents with pain and swelling but less likely as a protruding bulge unless complications.\n9. Diagnosis: Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\nJustification: These inflammatory bowel diseases can cause rectal bleeding and mucus but less commonly produce a protruding anal bulge unless complicated by prolapse.\n10.

Diagnosis: External or mucosal rectal prolapse\nJustification: The prolapsing anal mass with associated symptoms and ongoing duration strongly suggest rectal prolapse, which is common in women of this age group and presents with prolapse, mucus, and incomplete evacuation.\n2. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoidal disease\nJustification: Bleeding, mucus discharge, and anal mass are characteristic of hemorrhoids, especially if mucosal prolapse occurs, common in women over 60.\n3. Diagnosis: Non-strangulated hemorrhoidal prolapse\nJustification: Could account for prolapse with bleeding and mucus, with symptoms worsening over weeks.\n4. Diagnosis: Mucosal prolapse syndrome\nJustification: Similar to rectal prolapse but involving mucosal folds; causes prolapse, mucus, and bleeding.\n5. Diagnosis: Chronic constipation leading to straining and secondary prolapse\nJustification: Constipation/sensation of incomplete emptying may contribute to prolapse development.\n6.

Diagnosis: Rectal prolapse\nJustification: The presence of a prolapsing anal mass, with associated symptoms of incomplete evacuation and mucous discharge, strongly suggests rectal prolapse. Its characteristic features include full-thickness protrusion during straining, which can cause mucosal irritation, bleeding, and discomfort. The recent onset and progression support an acute or subacute prolapse.\n2. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids (internal or external)\nJustification: Bleeding, mucus discharge, and anal discomfort are typical of hemorrhoidal disease. Hemorrhoids can become symptomatic with mucosal irritation and prolapse, especially if internal hemorrhoids prolapse externally. They are common and can coexist with rectal prolapse, explaining some of the symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Mucosal prolapse syndrome (solitary rectal ulcer syndrome)\nJustification: Mucosal prolapse can cause mucosal thickening, ulceration, bleeding, and mucus discharge. Although less common, this can mimic or coexist with rectal prolapse, especially with mucosal irritation and prolapse symptoms.\n4. Diagnosis: Anorectal neoplasm (such as rectal adenocarcinoma)\nJustification: Bleeding and a prolapsing mass raise concern for neoplasm; however, the short duration and typical presentation favor benign conditions. Still, malignancy should be considered, especially if symptoms persist or worsen, making it necessary to rule out.\n5.

Diagnosis: Rectal prolapse\nJustification: The primary symptom is a prolapsing anal bulge that worsens postpartum activities, with associated mucus and bleeding, suggestive of full-thickness rectal prolapse. The description of a protruding mass during or after bowel movements aligns with rectal prolapse, especially in an older woman. The feeling of incomplete evacuation further supports this, as rectal prolapse often causes obstructive symptoms and mucosal protrusion.\n2. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids\nJustification: Bleeding and mucus discharge are classic features. The fact that bleeding is noted with prolapse suggests external or internal hemorrhoids that become symptomatic with straining. Hemorrhoids may coexist with prolapse, especially if bleeding is recurrent, and may explain the mucus.\n3. Diagnosis: Anal fissure\nJustification: Pain during bowel movements, reported as a significant symptom, is typical for anal fissures. Although fissures do not cause prolapse, they often coexist with other anorectal conditions in this age group and may perpetuate pain and bleeding.\n4. Diagnosis: Rectocele\nJustification: The persistent incomplete evacuation and anterior rectal bulge could suggest a rectocele, which often presents with a sensation of incomplete evacuation and may be associated with prolapse or mucosal protrusions, especially in women post-childbirth.\n5. Diagnosis: Rectal neoplasm\nJustification: Bleeding and mucus with prolapse could also be due to rectal tumors, especially if symptoms persist or worsen over time. While less likely given primarily prolapse features, neoplasia must always be considered in older patients with rectal bleeding and structural abnormalities for risk stratification.",

Diagnosis: Full-thickness rectal prolapse\nJustification: The prolapsing anal mass with bleeding, mucus, pain during defecation, and sensation of incomplete evacuation align with full-thickness rectal prolapse. The fact that symptoms have persisted for 1-2 weeks suggests an ongoing prolapse, which is characteristic of rectal prolapse due to weakening of pelvic floor muscles and rectal support tissues. The prolapsing mass is external, consistent with full-thickness protrusion of rectal wall.\n2. Diagnosis: Hemorrhoids\nJustification: Bright red bleeding and mucus secretion are hallmark features of hemorrhoids, which are common in this age group and often associated with straining during bowel movements. The mucosal swelling and bleeding point toward internal hemorrhoids that have prolapsed or become thrombosed, contributing to the prolapse and mucus symptoms. Hemorrhoids can coexist with rectal prolapse, worsening symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Anal carcinoma or rectal adenocarcinoma\nJustification: Although less likely given the acuteness, the patient's age and bleeding warrant concern for malignancy. Tumors can cause bleeding, mucus, and a sensation of mass if ulcerated or invasive. The absence of systemic signs makes this less probable as the primary cause but remains a differential due to her age and symptom profile.\n4. Diagnosis: Rectal intussusception\nJustification: Rectal intussusception can cause prolapse and similar symptoms; however, it's less common and usually presents with more chronic or intermittent symptoms. The recent onset makes this a less probable primary diagnosis but still a consideration if prolapse is due to internal intussusception extending outside the anal canal.\n5. Diagnosis: Rectal polyp\nJustification: Polyps can cause bleeding and mucus and may become prolapsed if large or pedunculated, but they are less likely to cause significant prolapse or the sensation of incomplete evacuation compared to other causes. Polyps are included as a less probable cause but may coexist.\nSTOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.",
