    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Vestibular Migraine\nJustification: The patient's episodes involve dizziness, imbalance, and possibly sensation of being \"off-balance,\" which are characteristic of vestibular migraine. The episodes are triggered by quick head movements and physical activity, which can provoke vestibular symptoms in migraineurs. The presence of episodes since childhood and increasing frequency suggests a migraine-related disorder. Slurred speech and jerking could be post-ictal or aura symptoms associated with migraine. No clear cerebellar signs or focal neurological deficits are noted, making migraine a strong candidate.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Vestibular Oscillation or Episodic Ataxia\nJustification: The episodes involve sudden dizziness, stumbling, and imbalance, which could point toward episodic ataxia, particularly types I or II, known for episodic cerebellar dysfunction triggered by physical activity or head movements. The jerking and slurred speech could reflect cerebellar or brainstem involvement during episodes. The lifelong history and triggers fit within episodic ataxias' typical presentation.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nJustification: The sudden onset of dizziness, imbalance, and speech disturbances raises concerns for TIA, especially in older patients. However, the childhood onset and lack of other vascular risk factors make this less likely. Also, TIAs typically resolve within an hour, but episodic presentation since childhood suggests a different etiology.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Seizure Disorder ( focal or partial seizures)\nJustification: The episodes' jerking movements, slurred speech, and sensations of \"weirdness\" could represent focal seizures, particularly partial or similar seizure types. The episodes last minutes and are triggered by movement, which can sometimes provoke seizure activity. The history of episodes since childhood and progression support this.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Cardiac Arrhythmia Leading to Transient Cerebral Hypoperfusion\nJustification: Episodes of dizziness and imbalance can occur with arrhythmias leading to transient cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the presence of speech slurring and jerking makes this less probable. Usually, these episodes would be associated with palpitations or syncope, which are not described here.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1.

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Vertebrobasilar (posterior circulation) transient ischemic attack (TIA) or vertebrobasilar insufficiency  \nJustification: The patient's episodes involve dizziness, stumbling, and imbalance triggered by quick head movements or physical activity. These are classic features of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, where reduced blood flow to the posterior circulation causes transient neurological symptoms. The presence of slurred speech, jerking, and episodes from childhood suggest a longstanding vascular or anatomical predisposition that might be exacerbated by positional changes, consistent with vertebrobasilar ischemic events. Although more common in older adults, congenital vascular anomalies or early atherosclerosis could explain the childhood onset and increasing frequency.  \n\n2. Diagnosis: Vestibular migraine  \nJustification: The symptom pattern of dizziness, imbalance, and sensation of being \"off\" could be consistent with vestibular migraine. These episodes can last minutes to hours, are often triggered by motion or stress, and may include neurological symptoms like slurred speech and jerking (though less typical). The history of childhood episodes and worsening frequency aligns with migraine spectrum disorders, especially if there is a personal or family history of migraine.  \n\n3. Diagnosis: Epilepsy (with partial or focal seizures)  \nJustification: The jerking movements and changes in sensation during episodes suggest seizure activity\u2014especially focal seizures with motor components or sensory aura. The episodes' sudden onset, duration of minutes or longer, and post-episode tiredness are characteristic of seizure episodes. Childhood onset and increasing frequency might indicate a longstanding epileptic disorder, possibly with a trigger such as head movements or physical activity.  \n\n4. Diagnosis: Orthostatic hypotension or autonomic dysfunction  \nJustification: Dizziness and imbalance triggered by physical activity might reflect blood pressure drops upon position changes. While less likely given the presence of jerking and speech changes, autonomic dysfunction could contribute to transient deficits in cerebral perfusion, especially if episodes are also associated with feeling \"off\" or tired afterward. Still, this is probably less primary compared to neurologic or vascular causes.  \n\n5. Diagnosis: Structural brain lesion (e.g., cerebellar or brainstem abnormality)  \nJustification: Chronic episodes involving balance disturbances, slurred speech, and jerking suggest possible underlying structural abnormalities, possibly congenital or acquired, affecting the cerebellum or brainstem. The lifelong nature and progression favor a developmental anomaly or longstanding lesion potentially exacerbated over time.  \n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications as above:\n1. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency/TIA \u2013 considering the positional triggers, balance issues, and neurological symptoms aligned with posterior circulation ischemia.\n2. Vestibular migraine \u2013 accounting for episodic dizziness, imbalance, and possible migrainous features with an onset in childhood.\n3. Epilepsy (focal seizures) \u2013 due to episodic motor and sensory phenomena, with characteristics fitting seizure activity evolving over years.\n4. Orthostatic/autonomic-related hypotension \u2013 as a possible contributing factor to dizziness and imbalance, though less likely to explain all features independently.\n5.

    "output": "THINKING:\n\n1. Diagnosis: Vestibular Migraine\n   Justification: The patient\u2019s episodes include dizziness, imbalance, visual disturbances (blurry vision, sensitivity to bright lights), and occur with triggers like head movements and physical activity. These are classic features of vestibular migraine, which often presents with vertigo and visual symptoms without persistent neurological deficits. The history of episodes since childhood and their worsening frequency align with migraine-related phenomena.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (or other paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmia)\n   Justification: The episodic dizziness, slurred speech, and jerking movements could suggest transient cerebral hypoperfusion due to cardioembolic events or arrhythmias. Although no mention of palpitations is made, the sudden onset and resolution are typical of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which often mimic migraine or seizure symptoms. Cardiac causes must be considered, especially given the episodes\u2019 duration and triggering by physical exertion.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Seizure Disorder (Partial Seizures with Focal Features)\n   Justification: Jerking movements, slurred speech, and episodes lasting minutes are characteristic of focal seizures. The fact that episodes are triggered by head movements and have a postictal feeling of tiredness supports this possibility. The presence of visual symptoms and the long-standing history from childhood also fit with seizure semiology.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Orthostatic Hypotension or Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)\n   Justification: The episodes are triggered by quick head movements or physical activity and involve dizziness and imbalance. Although less likely to cause jerking movements, these autonomic dysfunctions can produce dizzy spells and blurred vision, especially with rapid positional changes. The persistence since childhood suggests a chronic orthostatic or autonomic regulation issue.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura (without Vestibular component)\n   Justification: The visual sensitivities and episodic nature are typical of migraine aura.

The history of childhood onset, increased frequency, and no persistent neurological deficits point toward a diagnosis involving episodic vestibular and neurological symptoms. The associated visual changes, limb jerking (which may represent disequilibrium or myoclonus), and autonomic features suggest a central or peripheral mechanism involved in episodic dysfunction. The triggering by head movements suggests a positional component, which can be seen in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular migraine, or vestibular paroxysmia.  \nGiven the involved autonomic symptoms (sweating, shortness of breath) and visual changes, vascular causes such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency or cerebellar ischemia could also be considered, but the episodic, positional nature and early onset favor a benign episodic vestibular disorder.
