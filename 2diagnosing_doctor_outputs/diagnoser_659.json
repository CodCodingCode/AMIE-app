    "input": "Patient demographics: Adult female (exact age unspecified). Chief complaint: Reported worsening skin spots and lumps, with increasing exhaustion and shortness of breath. Present illness: The patient reports a progression of skin lesions and lumps, describing them as worsening over time, accompanied by daily fatigue and dyspnea. However, due to emotional distress and anxiety, these descriptions may overemphasize severity. Objective assessment requires clarification, as she may be underreporting systemic signs such as fever, weight changes, or night sweats. The timeline of symptom progression is uncertain and likely more gradual than indicated verbally. Associated symptoms beyond skin and respiratory complaints are unconfirmed but should be explored further, particularly systemic signs and mental health factors. Confidence assessment: - High confidence: Skin lesions and lumps are present and progressing, as the patient reports. - Medium confidence: Severity and progression of symptoms may be exaggerated due to emotional distress; systemic symptoms like fatigue and breathlessness may be less severe than described. - Low confidence: Exact timeline and full scope of systemic symptoms, as the patient might be withholding information or amplifying concerns. - Missing information: Details on systemic signs such as fever, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, additional medical history, and mental health status are needed to form a complete clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult female with progressive skin lesions and lumps, coupled with increasing exhaustion and shortness of breath. These symptoms suggest a need to consider both dermatologic and systemic conditions, ranging from benign to serious. The skin manifestations and systemic symptoms could indicate inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes. Given her age and presentation, malignancies, particularly lymphomas or skin cancers, need to be high on the differential. Autoimmune diseases could also cause skin and systemic symptoms. Infectious causes are less likely without systemic signs like fever, but cannot be excluded until further history is obtained. The emotional distress might influence symptom reporting but does not negate serious conditions. Diagnoses are ordered from most to least likely based on the weight of symptoms, prevalence, and potential for serious outcomes.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous lymphoma (e.g., Mycosis Fungoides) Justification: Progressive skin lesions and lumps suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting the skin; common in adult females, often presenting with persistent patches or plaques that worsen over time, with systemic involvement possible.  2. Diagnosis: Non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g., Squamous Cell Carcinoma or Basal Cell Carcinoma) Justification: Progressive skin lumps and lesions, especially if ulcerated or nodular, are characteristic; more common than melanoma, especially in older adults or those with sun exposure history.  3. Diagnosis: Melanoma Justification: Skin lesions that worsen over time, especially if pigmented and irregular, suggest melanoma; can metastasize and cause systemic symptoms, including exhaustion.  4. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (systemic) Justification: Systemic symptoms like fatigue and lumps, along with skin involvement, raise suspicion for lymphoma with cutaneous manifestations or secondary skin involvement.  5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune skin disease (e.g., SLE with cutaneous involvement) Justification: Autoimmune conditions can cause skin lesions, systemic fatigue, and shortness of breath; less likely in the absence of other systemic features like joint pain or serositis, but possible.  6. Diagnosis: Infectious etiology (e.g., Cutaneous leishmaniasis or other granulomatous infections) Justification: Progressive skin lesions and lumps could indicate infectious causes, especially if risk factors (travel, exposure) are present; systemic symptoms less common unless advanced.  7. Diagnosis: Lipomas or benign skin tumors Justification: Lumps that are slow-growing and soft are common benign tumors; less likely given the progressive nature and systemic symptoms, but still part of differential.  8. Diagnosis: Psoriasis with psoriatic plaques Justification: Chronic, worsening skin plaques, commonly on extensor surfaces, but systemic symptoms are less typical and severity may be overreported.  9. Diagnosis: Metastatic carcinoma to the skin Justification: Progressive skin lumps could be secondary to metastasis from primary internal malignancies, like breast carcinoma, especially in women.  10. Diagnosis: Infectious dermatoses (e.g., cellulitis, abscess) Justification: Typically acute and localized, usually associated with systemic signs like fever; less likely given the described gradual progression and systemic fatigue.

    "input": "OBJECTIVE_VIGNETTE: Patient demographics: Adult female (specific age unknown).  Chief complaint: Reported worsening skin spots and lumps along with increasing exhaustion and shortness of breath; these are likely exaggerated in perceived severity due to emotional distress.  Present illness: The patient describes a progression of skin lesions and lumps over several months, noting that the skin spots have increased in size and soreness, and the underlying lumps are growing. She reports daily fatigue and breathlessness, but these may be magnified by her anxiety. The actual progression of symptoms is likely more gradual, and systemic signs such as fever or weight changes have not been definitively reported and require further inquiry.  Associated symptoms: No confirmed reports of fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss; these are possible but not explicitly endorsed by the patient and should be objectively assessed.  CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT: - High confidence: Skin lesions and lumps are present and are reportedly progressing over months. - Medium confidence: Severity and rapidity of symptom progression may be overestimated due to emotional amplification. - Low confidence: Precise timeline and the presence of systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss; these require further investigation. - Missing information: Objective data on systemic signs (fever, weight fluctuations), detailed characteristics of skin lesions, and mental health status related to anxiety levels.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult female with worsening skin lesions and lumps over months, accompanied by systemic symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath, with no confirmed systemic signs yet. These skin findings could represent a range of benign dermatologic or systemic conditions, but the progressive nature and systemic symptoms raise concern for potentially serious underlying disease. The emotional distress may amplify perceived severity but does not exclude organic pathology. Differential diagnosis should prioritize common causes with skin and systemic involvement, including inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes, especially lymphoma or skin cancers, considering the presence of lumps and skin changes. Serious conditions such as lymphoma or malignancies should also be considered due to the progressive lumps and systemic symptoms.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides) Justification: Presenting skin patches and plaques that are enlarging and possibly sore, with systemic symptoms like fatigue, align with early lymphomatous skin involvement; this is a relatively common primary cutaneous lymphoma in adults.  2. Diagnosis: Lipoma or other benign soft tissue tumors Justification: Lumps that grow over months can be benign lipomas; however, they are typically painless and less associated with systemic symptoms, making this less likely given fatigue and skin changes.  3. Diagnosis: Granulomatous skin disease (e.g., sarcoidosis) Justification: Skin lesions, especially if nodular or papular, accompanied by systemic symptoms, can be part of sarcoidosis; however, progression over months points more toward neoplastic processes.  4. Diagnosis: Subcutaneous panniculitis or inflammatory dermatosis Justification: Inflammatory skin and subcutaneous nodules could match panniculitis or other dermatoses, but persistent progression and lumps raise suspicion for underlying malignancy.  5. Diagnosis: Cutaneous metastases from internal malignancy Justification: Skin nodules and lumps could indicate metastasis, particularly if the primary is undiagnosed; systemic symptoms support this possibility.  6. Diagnosis: Infectious etiology (e.g., atypical mycobacterial or fungal infections) Justification: Chronic skin lesions and lumps can be due to infections, common in immunocompromised or certain exposure histories, but less likely without systemic infectious signs currently.  7. Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus with skin involvement Justification: Lupus may cause skin changes and systemic symptoms; however, the description of lumps suggests more of a tumor or granulomatous process.  8. Diagnosis: Rheumatoid nodules Justification: Rheumatoid nodules are subcutaneous and firm but usually associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which has not been indicated; thus, less likely.  9. Diagnosis: Cellulitis or skin abscesses Justification: Usually acutely sore, warm, erythematous; chronic progression over months makes this less probable.  10. Diagnosis: Psychosomatic or somatization disorder Justification: Emotional distress may exaggerate perceived symptom severity, but this does not explain objective skin lesions and lumps; thus, it is a consideration after organic causes are ruled out.",

Objectively, physical examination is needed to assess the characteristics of the skin findings, systemic signs, and possible underlying pathology.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with gradually developing skin lesions and lumps over several months, with recent worsening, increased soreness, and spreading. She also reports fatigue and shortness of breath, likely influenced by emotional distress. No systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss are definitively noted. The skin lesions' progression and systemic symptoms point toward certain dermatologic and systemic conditions. Differential diagnoses include inflammatory, neoplastic, autoimmune, infectious, and metabolic causes. The commonality of skin changes plus systemic complaints guides the top differentials. Emotional distress possibly affecting symptom perception suggests mental health impact but does not exclude organic pathology. Considering all factors, I prioritize conditions that can explain skin lesions with systemic features, with attention to features that distinguish between inflammatory, neoplastic, or autoimmune causes.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides) Justification: The gradual development and spreading of skin lesions and lumps over months, with recent increased soreness, aligns with classic progression of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This condition often presents with patches, plaques, and tumors that can spread and worsen over time, sometimes accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue. The absence of acute systemic signs like fever makes aggressive infection less likely, and the chronicity supports a lymphoma. The patient's subjective worsening and spreading are characteristic, and the skin involvement can be widespread and infiltrative.  2. Diagnosis: Autoimmune Dermatosis (e.g., Lupus Erythematosus) Justification: Autoimmune skin conditions can present with evolving skin lesions, including erythematous, scaly, or sore patches that can spread. Fatigue is common, and autoimmune diseases often have variable presentations influenced by emotional stress. The spreading nature of lesions and their soreness could fit with discoid or subacute cutaneous lupus. The systemic features are subtle but could be early manifestations; no mention of classic malar rash or systemic involvement makes this less certain than lymphoma but still plausible.  3. Diagnosis: Psoriasis or Psoriatic Arthritis Justification: Psoriasis can present with spreading erythematous plaques with silvery scales and sometimes involve lumps or nodules consistent with psoriatic arthritis. The recent progression and soreness, along with fatigue, could relate to psoriatic skin or joint involvement, especially if lumps are psoriatic plaques or related to inflammatory joint disease. The chronicity over months fits this cause, though the systemic symptoms are less prominent unless complicated by psoriatic arthritis.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Etiology (e.g., Cutaneous Sarcoidosis or Chronic Skin Infection) Justification: Certain infections, such as cutaneous sarcoidosis, can present with granulomatous skin lesions and lumps that develop over months and spread. Soreness and spreading could also reflect infectious or inflammatory granulomas. The systemic symptoms, while non-specific, could be secondary to granulomatous inflammation. However, lack of systemic signs like fever makes infection less likely than autoimmune or neoplastic processes.  5. Diagnosis: Metastatic Carcinoma to Skin Justification: Skin metastases can present as firm, nodular lumps that spread over time, often associated with an underlying malignancy. The patient's gradual development of lumps and spreading over months supports consideration of metastasis, especially in older adults, but less so without known primary cancer or systemic signs. This diagnosis remains a lower probability but is included given the possibility of skin metastases presenting with nodules.  STOP HERE.",

She describes the lesions as hard or rubbery and inflamed, with increased soreness and itchiness. She also reports fatigue and shortness of breath, although her emotional distress and anxiety may have amplified her perception of symptom severity and progression. Objective examination is needed to assess the physical characteristics of the skin findings, look for signs of systemic involvement, and verify the actual progression timeline.

    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with progressive skin lumps and spots that are hard, rubbery, inflamed, tender, and itchy, with recent worsening and spread. She reports fatigue and shortness of breath, which could indicate systemic involvement. The progression over months suggests a chronic process. Differential diagnoses include benign skin conditions (e.g., dermatofibromas, lipomas, keloids), inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, granulomatous dermatitis), and neoplastic processes (e.g., cutaneous lymphoma, skin metastases). Considering the systemic symptoms, autoimmune or granulomatous conditions become higher on the list. The fact that the lumps are inflamed and tender suggests active inflammation or infiltration. The rapid worsening and spread favor a more aggressive process such as granulomatous disease or lymphoma. The importance of distinguishing between infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic processes guides the ranking. Her psychological distress might influence symptom perception but does not exclude organic pathology. The physical findings and symptom pattern lean toward systemic inflammatory or neoplastic causes, with some consideration of autoimmune granulomatous skin disease, lymphoma, or sarcoidosis as top differentials.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cutaneous lymphoma (e.g., Mycosis Fungoides or other primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas) Justification: The persistent, progressively worsening skin lumps that are hard, inflamed, and tender over several months, along with systemic symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath, raise concern for a lymphoproliferative disorder involving the skin. The spread and increased tenderness suggest infiltration of malignant lymphocytes into the skin layers, which aligns with cutaneous lymphoma presentations.  2. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis involving the skin Justification: Sarcoidosis commonly involves skin presenting with inflammatory, firm papules or plaques that can be tender and inflamed. Systemic fatigue and shortness of breath support possible pulmonary or systemic sarcoidosis. The chronicity and progression support this autoimmune granulomatous condition, especially if bilateral or multisystem findings are present.  3. Diagnosis: Granulomatous dermatitis or other autoimmune inflammatory skin conditions (e.g., granuloma annulare, granulomatous rosacea) Justification: The description of inflamed, tender, hard lumps fits granulomatous skin processes. The spread and worsening over months suggest ongoing immune-mediated inflammation. These conditions can be associated with systemic diseases, making them relevant.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious granulomatous disease (e.g., atypical mycobacterial or fungal infections) Justification: Chronic granulomatous skin lesions can result from infectious causes, especially if lesions are hard, inflamed, and spreading. Latent infections or immune suppression could facilitate this. Though no systemic signs are confirmed, infection remains a consideration given the chronic nature.  5. Diagnosis: Lipomas or benign skin nodules (e.g., dermatofibromas, keloids) Justification: These are common benign skin lumps but are less likely given the recent inflammation, tenderness, rapid progression, and systemic symptoms. Still included due to their prevalence, but less probable as sole explanation for systemic features.  STOP HERE.",

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation with enlarging, tender, and inflamed skin lesions that are hard and rubbery, along with systemic symptoms such as fatigue and night sweats, suggests a systemic dermatologic or lymphoproliferative process. The characteristics of the skin lumps\u2014progression over months, associated inflammation, and systemic signs\u2014point toward a condition involving possible lymphoid or malignant proliferation, such as cutaneous lymphoma, particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome), or a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder with skin involvement like lymphoma or leukemia. The absence of fever and significant weight loss does not preclude lymphoma, as systemic symptoms can vary. The morphology and symptoms favor a malignant or lymphoid infiltrative process over benign conditions. Additional details, including biopsy results, are necessary for definitive diagnosis, but the clinical picture leans strongly toward cutaneous lymphoma with systemic features.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: skin lesions that are enlarging, inflamed, tender, hard/rubbery, spreading, with systemic symptoms (fatigue, night sweats). No fever or significant weight loss reported; potential underreporting. - Timeline and progression: symptoms developed over several months, with worsening and spreading. - Clinical pattern recognition: features suggest a lymphoid neoplasm involving skin, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, possible S\u00e9zary syndrome, or systemic lymphoma with skin infiltration. - Supporting evidence: persistent palpable, hard, inflamed skin lumps with systemic symptoms. The spreading and tenderness suggest progressive infiltration. - Excluding alternatives: benign skin lesions (e.g., cysts, infections) are less likely given systemic symptoms and lesion characteristics; inflammatory dermatoses usually less hard/rubbery and less systemic; granulomatous or infectious causes less fitting without additional infectious symptoms or signs.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate to high. The clinical picture aligns with cutaneous lymphoma, but without biopsy or lab results, certainty is not absolute. - Missing information: histopathology, immunophenotyping, systemic workup, blood counts, imaging (e.g., PET-CT) to assess internal involvement. - Clinical coherence: The diagnosis explains skin findings and systemic symptoms collectively. The progression pattern fits with lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorder. - Diagnostic criteria: Not fully met without biopsy; clinical suspicion is high.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Most probable diagnosis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (likely mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome) with systemic features. - Information sufficiency: Not complete; need histological confirmation for definitive diagnosis. - Risk tolerance: Additional diagnostics recommended before definitive treatment; early biopsy advised. - Clinical urgency: Given progressive symptoms and systemic signs, timely biopsy and workup are warranted, but immediate definitive therapy can wait until confirmation.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No, because biopsy-proven diagnosis is lacking, but clinical suspicion is strong. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No, as current evidence strongly points to cutaneous lymphoma, pending histological confirmation.\nANSWER: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (likely mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome) END",
