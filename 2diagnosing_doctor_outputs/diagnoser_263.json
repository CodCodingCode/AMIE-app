Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin)\nJustification: Persistent lymphadenopathy in multiple regions, systemic symptoms (B symptoms like weight loss, fever, fatigue), raises concern for lymphoma. Lymphadenopathy is tender but can be painless; systemic symptoms over two weeks are concerning.\n3. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis\nJustification: TB can cause chronic lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms.

Diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: The presence of tender lymphadenopathy in multiple regions (cervical and inguinal), weight loss, fatigue, and a subacute progression without a clear infectious source aligns with lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma, which often presents with painless or tender lymphadenopathy, constitutional B symptoms, and a progressive course. The age of 35 is also common for this diagnosis, and these features fit well with a lymphoproliferative disorder.\n2. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr Virus infection)\nJustification: The systemic symptoms of fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy (especially cervical), and weight loss are characteristic of mononucleosis, which typically affects young to middle-aged adults. Tender lymph nodes, constitutional symptoms, and a subacute course favor this viral etiology. Although spleen involvement is common, it isn't specified here, but EBV remains a leading consideration due to its classic presentation.\n3. Diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis\nJustification: Toxoplasma gondii infection can cause lymphadenopathy, especially in immunocompetent individuals, presenting with tender lymph nodes, fatigue, and mild constitutional symptoms. This diagnosis is plausible, especially if exposure risk factors (e.g., undercooked meat, cat contact) are present, though such details are lacking here. It\u2019s ranked high because it can mimic infectious mononucleosis sufficiently.\n4. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis lymphadenitis (scrofula)\nJustification: TB can cause chronic, painful lymphadenopathy, particularly in cervical regions, with systemic symptoms like weight loss and low-grade fever. The gradual progression over weeks supports this. Lack of night sweats and other features does not exclude TB, but it's slightly less likely compared to viral or hematologic causes in this scenario.\n5. Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nJustification: Given the lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, and weight loss, non-Hodgkin lymphoma remains a significant differential. Its presentation overlaps with Hodgkin lymphoma, but specific features or biopsy results are needed for distinction. It is included here because it can present similarly and is a common cause of lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms in this age group.\nSTOP HERE.",

The progression over two we\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's)\nJustification: The presence of persistent, enlarging tender lymph nodes in multiple regions, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, weakness), and a gradual progression over two weeks is highly suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Lymphoma characteristically presents with painless or tender lymphadenopathy, B symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), and systemic malaise, which aligns with this patient\u2019s presentation. The weight loss and weakness further support a neoplastic process affecting the lymphatic system.\n2. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis (EBV)\nJustification: The systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy), particularly if tenderness is prominent, are compatible. The two-week timeline fits, and this condition commonly affects young adults. While typically associated with sore throat and atypical lymphocytes, the systemic nature and lymphadenopathy make this plausible, especially if no other exposures suggest alternative infections.\n3. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Lymphadenitis)\nJustification: Chronic granulomatous infection can present with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy, systemic illnesses such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The two-week timeframe may be somewhat shorter than typical TB lymphadenitis but remains possible, especially with associated systemic symptoms. Exposure history could further support this diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Zoonotic infection related to primate exposure (e.g., Simian Hemorrhagic Fever or Other Viral Zoonosis)\nJustification: Recent travel involving primate exposure raises concern for zoonoses like Ebola or other hemorrhagic viruses. These can produce systemic illness with fever, lymphadenopathy (less commonly prominent), and malaise. Given the exposure context, especially if recent contact with primates involved blood or bodily fluids, this remains a differential, especially considering the systemic symptoms. However, the absence of hemorrhagic signs or bleeding makes this less likely but worth consideration given exposure history.\n5. Diagnosis: HIV/AIDS with opportunistic infection\nJustification: Progressive systemic symptoms, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and weakness are characteristic of advanced HIV infection with possible opportunistic infections or hematologic malignancies. If the patient\u2019s exposure history or risk factors suggest immunosuppression, this diagnosis gains probability. Although no explicit risk factors are mentioned, the clinical pattern warrants consideration.\nSTOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.",

Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV)\nJustification: The classic presentation includes fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and potentially hepatosplenomegaly, which aligns well with this patient's two-week symptoms. The lymph nodes are tender and enlarging, common in infectious mononucleosis. Although no pharyngitis or splenomegaly is specified, systemic illness and lymphadenopathy are typical. The recent travel and exposure are not traditional risk factors but could be incidental or associative, and this condition remains the most common cause of such symptoms in a young adult.\n2. Diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis\nJustification: Toxoplasma gondii infection can cause lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue, particularly in immunocompetent hosts. Recent exposure to primates may imply exposure to contaminated food or environment. While typically less symptomatic, the weight loss and prolonged course fit within the spectrum. This diagnosis is high on the list given the travel history and exposure.\n3. Diagnosis: Lymphoma\nJustification: Persistent, progressive lymphadenopathy in multiple regions (neck and groin), systemic weight loss, and night sweats are concerning for lymphoma, especially in a two-week period with worsening systemic symptoms. Though less specific initially, lymphoma should be strongly considered due to lymph node enlargement and constitutional symptoms; further workup is warranted.\n4. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (TB)\nJustification: TB can present with systemic symptoms, weight loss, fevers, and lymphadenopathy (particularly in the cervical region). The two-week timeframe and systemic signs could fit early TB, especially if there is a history of exposure or travel to endemic areas; the absence of explicit mention makes it less likely but still relevant.\n5. Diagnosis: Zoonotic infection related to primate exposure (e.g., simian herpesvirus, rabies, or other arboviruses)\nJustification: The recent contact with primates suggests possible zoonotic infection; symptoms like headache and systemic illness could be attributable. However, these are less common and typically associated with specific neurological or systemic syndromes, making them less probable but still within differential consideration.\nSTOP HERE.",
