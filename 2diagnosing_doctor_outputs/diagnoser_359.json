The primar\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: Most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage presenting with heavy bleeding and large clots; occurs due to failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery, leading to continued bleeding.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Persistent bleeding since delivery with large clots may suggest incomplete expulsion of placenta, causing ongoing bleeding and risk of secondary postpartum hemorrhage.\n3. Diagnosis: Genital trauma (lacerations, episiotomy)\nJustification: Vaginal or cervical lacerations can cause ongoing bleeding; may be associated with large clots and unstable recovery post-delivery.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., DIC or thrombocytopenia)\nJustification: Bleeding that is disproportionate or persists despite uterine contraction suggests possible bleeding disorder; DIC can occur postpartum due to obstetric complications.\n5. Diagnosis: Placental accreta/increta/percreta\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence leading to excessive bleeding; more common in women with prior cesarean or uterine surgeries but still a possibility post-delivery.\n6. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the placental site\nJustification: Delayed involution of the uterus leading to continued bleeding and hematoma formation at the placental site.\n7. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Rare but life-threatening; usually associated with abnormal labor or prior uterine surgery, presenting with bleeding, abdominal pain, and signs of hypovolemia.\n8. Diagnosis: Coagulopathies unrelated to pregnancy (e.g., hemophilia)\nJustification: Less likely without prior history or bleeding diathesis, but should be considered if bleeding persists despite uterotonics and no obvious obstetric cause.\n9. Diagnosis: Endometrial or cervical neoplasm\nJustification: Rare in postpartum setting; less likely without prior history or abnormal findings, but important to consider in recurrent or atypical bleeding.\n10. Diagnosis: Uterine inversion\nJustification: Rare complication causing massive bleeding and shock; usually presents acutely during or immediately after delivery with characteristic signs, but included as less likely due to absence of specific signs.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage characterized by inadequate uterine muscle contraction leading to heavy bleeding; symptoms align with ongoing blood loss, and large clots are typical.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Persistence of bleeding and large clots post-delivery may suggest retained placental fragments preventing uterine contraction and increasing bleeding risk.\n3. Diagnosis: Vaginal or cervical lacerations\nJustification: Persistent heavy bleeding with large clots could be due to trauma-related vascular lacerations, especially if bleeding continues despite uterine tone.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation, inborn bleeding disorder)\nJustification: Systemic symptoms and ongoing bleeding may be exacerbated by a bleeding disorder, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone or trauma.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta spectrum disorder\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence leading to bleeding; elevated risk in cases with previous cesarean or uterine surgery, although less common acutely postpartum.\n6. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Severe bleeding and systemic symptoms could suggest uterine rupture, especially if obstetric history supports risk factors, though less common in this context without prior surgical history.\n7. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the placental site\nJustification: Delayed involution leading to continued bleeding; typically presents days postpartum but can be in early postpartum as well.\n8. Diagnosis: Endometrial or uterine infection (endometritis)\nJustification: Less likely acutely unless associated with signs of infection such as fever, but systemic symptoms warrant keeping it in differential.\n9. Diagnosis: Hematologic disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia)\nJustification: Underlying platelet deficiency or clotting disorder could cause bleeding; relevant if systemic bleeding out of proportion.\n10. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy secondary to preexisting conditions (e.g., liver disease)\nJustification: Less likely without other systemic signs; still an important \"can't miss\" diagnosis if suspected, but less probable given the primary postpartum setting.\nSTOP HERE.",

The persistent bleeding suggests significant postpart\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage due to Uterine Atony\nJustification: The most common cause of heavy postpartum bleeding with large clots and continuous flow in the immediate postpartum period. The persistent bleeding, large clots, and systemic symptoms of dizziness and near-fainting strongly suggest ongoing blood loss from uterine atony, where the uterus fails to contract effectively after delivery. The lack of specific mention of trauma or placental abnormalities further supports this as the primary diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception\nJustification: Persistent bleeding with large clots could also indicate retained placental tissue or membranes preventing uterine contraction and promoting continued bleeding. If bleeding does not reduce with uterotonics, retained products become highly probable, especially in the context of ongoing postpartum hemorrhage. This diagnosis is also important to consider given the ongoing nature of bleeding beyond immediate delivery.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, uterine rupture can cause significant postpartum bleeding and systemic symptoms. It is more probable if there were risk factors such as previous cesarean, uterine scar, or labor complications, which are not mentioned. Still, severe hemorrhage with systemic symptoms warrants keeping this on the differential until more findings are available.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy\nJustification: Coagulopathies can cause postpartum bleeding, especially if there is pre-existing bleeding disorder or conditions like placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism, which are not specified here. Given the lack of other features suggestive of coagulopathy (easy bruising, petechiae), it's a less likely primary cause but still relevant to consider in ongoing hemorrhage.\n5. Diagnosis: Bleeding due to Vaginal or Cesarean Surgical Site Complication\nJustification: Bleeding from surgical sites can cause postpartum hemorrhage, but the description of large clots and continuous flow points more toward uterine source bleeding. Still, without explicit physical findings, this remains a secondary consideration.\nSTOP HERE.",

Key \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Uterine Atony\nJustification: Postpartum bleeding with heavy flow and large clots suggests uterine atony, the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. It explains persistent bleeding and inability of the uterus to contract effectively. Systemic symptoms like dizziness and weakness result from hypovolemia secondary to ongoing blood loss.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Placental Tissue\nJustification: The ongoing bleeding with large clots also raises suspicion for retained products of conception, which prevent uterine contraction and cause continuous bleeding. Her recent delivery aligns with this diagnosis, which can cause significant bleeding if not expelled.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, uterine rupture is a critical postpartum complication, especially shortly after delivery, causing heavy bleeding. The systemic symptoms and heavy hemorrhage could indicate uterine rupture, especially if bleeding rapidly progresses or if fetal remnants are suspected, though no fetal or intra-abdominal signs are reported.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)\nJustification: Excessive bleeding and systemic symptoms might suggest a bleeding disorder such as DIC, especially if initial causes are backing up. However, no prior signs of coagulopathy are detailed, making this less immediate but still possible.\n5. Diagnosis: Placental Site Bleeding/Implantation Site Bleeding\nJustification: Postpartum bleeding at the site of placental attachment can cause ongoing bleeding, especially in cases of abnormal placental adherence (increta, percreta).

    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with ongoing postpartum bleeding characterized by large clots, rapid pad saturation, dizziness, weakness, blurry vision, and syncope-like episodes, suggestive of significant blood\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: The heavy bleeding with large clots and rapid saturation of pads is classic for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. The absence of mention of surgical or manual intervention suggests the uterus may be relaxed and unable to contract effectively, leading to continued bleeding. Dizziness and weakness are consistent with hypovolemia caused by ongoing hemorrhage, making uterine atony the most probable cause.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained placenta or placental tissue\nJustification: Large blood clots and ongoing bleeding may stem from retained placental fragments preventing uterine contraction and expelling blood efficiently. The postpartum period is highly suggestive of this diagnosis, especially if the bleeding is persistent despite efforts to contract the uterus. It fits with the clinical pattern of continued bleeding and is a common cause of postpartum hemorrhage.\n3. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation or primary bleeding disorder)\nJustification: Severe postpartum bleeding and large clots could be exacerbated by an underlying bleeding disorder or coagulopathy, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone or palpable trauma. Although not explicitly indicated, the potential for coagulopathy must be considered if bleeding persists despite initial management, and it explains the severity of hemorrhage.\n4. Diagnosis: Genital lacerations or cervical tears\nJustification: Continuous heavy bleeding with blood clots, especially during or after delivery, can result from lacerations or tears in the cervix or vagina. Although physical findings are unavailable, this diagnosis is included given the postpartum bleeding context, particularly if bleeding exceeds what uterine atony alone can explain. It remains a differential, especially if bleeding does not respond to uterotonics.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta accreta spectrum (abnormal placental attachment)\nJustification: Placenta accreta or increta may cause abnormal postpartum bleeding due to incomplete separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. Although less immediately common than the others, it should be considered if bleeding persists and is not controlled after initial measures, especially in cases of previous uterine surgery or placenta previa, which are not specified but are relevant in postpartum hemorrhage cases.\nSTOP HERE.",
