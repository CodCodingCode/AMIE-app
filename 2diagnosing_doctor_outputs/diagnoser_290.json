Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion\nJustification: Unilateral pelvic/abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, common in women of reproductive age; progressive worsening suggests torsion of an ovarian cyst or mass, which can cut off blood supply and cause low-grade fever.\n2. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nJustification: Irregular uterine bleeding, lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever; common in sexually active women, typically presents with pelvic pain and systemic signs.\n3. Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy\nJustification: Irregular uterine bleeding, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting; important to consider in women of reproductive age with abnormal bleeding and pain, could present with low-grade fever if rupture or inflammation occurs.\n4. Diagnosis: Ruptured ovarian cyst\nJustification: Sudden or worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; may cause bleeding and localized inflammation, especially if cyst ruptures.\n5. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever; although less common in women with reproductive anatomy considerations, it's a common surgical emergency.\n6. Diagnosis: Endometriosis or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst\nJustification: Irregular bleeding and pelvic pain; can cause cyclic or progressive symptoms; hemorrhagic cysts may present with pelvic pain and systemic symptoms.\n7. Diagnosis: Tubo-ovarian abscess\nJustification: PID complicated by abscess formation; presents with continuous pelvic pain, fever, irregular bleeding, and systemic signs; warrants urgent diagnosis.\n8. Diagnosis: Gastroenteritis\nJustification: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, low-grade fever; less likely given localized pelvic symptoms, but possible as a differential in nausea/vomiting.\n9. Diagnosis: Uterine fibroid degeneration\nJustification: Irregular uterine bleeding, pelvic discomfort; can cause localized pain, especially with degeneration or torsion of a fibroid.\n10. Diagnosis: Ovarian neoplasm\nJustification: Pelvic mass with pain and irregular bleeding; less common in young women but important to consider, especially with persistent symptoms.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Ectopic pregnancy\nJustification: Irregular bleeding, abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever in a woman of reproductive age strongly suggest ectopic pregnancy, especially if pregnancy is recent or unconfirmed; this is a life-threatening cause that must be promptly identified.\n2. Diagnosis: Ovarian torsion\nJustification: Sudden or worsening unilateral lower abdominal pain, radiation, nausea, vomiting, and possibly associated with ovarian cysts, are classic for torsion; it can cause ischemia and is an urgent diagnosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nJustification: Fever, lower abdominal pain, irregular bleeding, nausea; PID commonly affects women in this age group and can present subacutely with worsening symptoms, especially if ascending infection.\n4. Diagnosis: Ruptured ovarian cyst\nJustification: Sudden worsening pain, bleeding, nausea, and possible mild fever; rupture can cause significant abdominal pain and bleeding, with pain radiation and systemic symptoms.\n5. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Right lower quadrant pain that worsens over days, nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever; however, the back radiation is less typical but possible if the appendiceal position is high or associated with pelvic inflammation.\n6. Diagnosis: Acute diverticulitis\nJustification: Abdominal pain localized to the right lower abdomen in rare cases (more common in older adults), with fever and nausea; less likely but considered due to the abdominal pain.\n7. Diagnosis: Endometriosis with acute exacerbation\nJustification: Irregular bleeding, pelvic pain, nausea, and radiation; activity or hormonal fluctuation triggers can cause worsening symptoms in young women, though systemic fever is less typical.\n8. Diagnosis: Urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis\nJustification: Nausea, fever, flank/back radiation of pain; although urinary symptoms are not specified, it remains a plausible differential given systemic symptoms and back radiation.\n9. Diagnosis: Ovarian neoplasm\nJustification: Irregular bleeding and pelvic pain; less common at this age but possible, especially if cystic or solid mass is present.\n10. Diagnosis: Colon pathology (e.g., inflammatory or neoplastic process)\nJustification: Right lower abdominal pain with systemic symptoms could suggest colonic disease, though less likely given the subacute contextual clues and age.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)\nJustification: The patient's irregular vaginal bleeding, recent sexual activity with multiple partners, systemic symptoms (fever), and lower abdominal pain are classic features; it is a common etiology in sexually active women with these presentations.\n2. Diagnosis: Ectopic Pregnancy\nJustification: Abdominal pain radiating to the back or upper abdomen, irregular bleeding, and systemic symptoms could indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, which is a critical \"can't miss\" diagnosis, especially in women of reproductive age with recent unprotected sex.\n3. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain worsening over two weeks, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, with systemic signs like fever, makes appendicitis a plausible consideration, especially if pain is localized and persistent.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian Cyst Rupture or Torsion\nJustification: Acute or worsening lower abdominal pain with systemic symptoms could result from ovarian cyst complications, common in women of this age group, especially with irregular menstrual or bleeding patterns.\n5. Diagnosis: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) or Pyelonephritis\nJustification: Systemic fever, nausea, and abdominal pain could be manifestations of a UTI or pyelonephritis, especially if the pain localizes to the flank or lower abdomen.\n6. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal causes (e.g., Diverticulitis)\nJustification: Although less common at her age, diverticulitis or other GI inflammatory conditions could produce abdominal pain radiating to the back.\n7.

Diagnosis: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)\nJustification: The combination of recent unprotected sex, multiple partners, irregular bleeding, abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever strongly suggests PID. PID can cause cyclical or irregular bleeding, pelvic or lower abdominal pain radiating posteriorly, and systemic symptoms like fever. The two-week duration and systemic symptoms indicate a significant infection likely involving the upper reproductive tract.\n2. Diagnosis: Ovarian Cyst or Ovarian Torsion\nJustification: Right lower abdominal pain radiating to the back is characteristic and can be associated with ovarian cysts or torsion, especially in young women. The ongoing pain and nausea support this, and her risk factors include possible hormonal or menstrual irregularities, with some overlap with PID symptoms. However, systemic fever is less typical, making this a less likely primary diagnosis but still important.\n3. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Right lower quadrant pain radiating to the back can be typical of appendicitis, especially if localized to the right iliac fossa. Although systemic symptoms are mild, the persistent fever and nausea are concerning. The two-week duration is somewhat longer than typical appendicitis, but a subacute or complicated appendicitis remains possible.\n4. Diagnosis: Endometritis or Other Gynecological Infection\nJustification: Irregular bleeding, recent sexual activity, and systemic symptoms suggest a possibility of endometrial or cervical infection, particularly if involved with STI pathogens. While less common with extended duration without localized gynecologic signs, it remains plausible considering her sexual history and bleeding pattern.\n5. Diagnosis: Intra-abdominal Abscess or Diverticulitis\nJustification: The radiating pain and persistent fever raise the possibility of intra-abdominal abscesses or diverticulitis. Although more common in older populations, predisposing factors or overlooked conditions could allow such diagnoses. The symptoms are less specific but included given the systemic signs and pain pattern, perhaps indicating more advanced infection.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)\nJustification: The patient's recent sexual activity with multiple partners, inconsistent condom use, history of pelvic infections, and current symptoms of pelvic/abdominal pain, irregular bleeding, and low-grade fever strongly support PID. The two-week duration suggests a subacute, ongoing infectious process involving the upper genital tract. While vaginal symptoms are not explicitly reported, underreporting is possible; PID can present with minimal vaginal discharge. The radiating abdominal pain and systemic symptoms align with inflammatory processes affecting the pelvis.\n2. Diagnosis: Tubo-ovarian Abscess\nJustification: As a complication of untreated or severe PID, a tubo-ovarian abscess can present with persistent pelvic pain, fever, and systemic symptoms. The location of pain radiating to the back and upper abdomen fits with an intra-pelvic abscess extending or causing referred pain. Her history of pelvic infections and multiple partners increases risk for abscess formation.\n3. Diagnosis: Appendicitis (post-rupture or atypical presentation)\nJustification: Right lower abdominal pain radiating to the back could suggest appendiceal pathology. The presence of nausea, vomiting, fever, and recent symptom progression might fit appendicitis, especially if atypical or complicated with perforation. However, her systemic signs and reproductive history favor gynecologic causes.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian Cyst Rupture or Torsion\nJustification: Ovarian cysts, especially functional or hemorrhagic cysts, can cause acute or subacute pelvic pain radiating to the back. Torsion can also present with severe pain and nausea. Her history of pelvic infections could predispose to cyst formation or torsion, but the systemic fever makes an infectious etiology more probable.\n5. Diagnosis: Ectopic Pregnancy\nJustification: Although not explicitly mentioned, ectopic pregnancy must be considered in women of reproductive age with abdominal pain and irregular bleeding, particularly if pregnancy is unconfirmed or unknown. The two-week duration and systemic symptoms could suggest a ruptured ectopic. Missing explicit pregnancy data limits certainty, but it remains a critical differential due to potential life-threatening complications.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) with possible tubo-ovarian abscess\nJustification: The history of recent sexual activity with multiple partners, inconsistent condom use, pelvic pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, low-grade fever, and nausea/vomiting strongly suggest a pelvic infectious process. The gradual onset and location of pain, along with systemic symptoms, support PID, which can escalate to a tubo-ovarian abscess, explaining the severity and symptom progression.\n2. Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst rupture or torsion\nJustification: Irregular vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain could represent ovarian pathology, especially in women with concurrent cyst formation. The pain radiating to the back may occur with torsion or rupture, though the systemic symptoms and fever are less typical for isolated cyst events. Still, they remain relevant differential considerations due to the gynecologic nature.\n3. Diagnosis: Appendicitis\nJustification: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain with radiation to the back is characteristic. However, the presence of irregular vaginal bleeding, systemic fever, and history of pelvic infections make gynecologic causes more probable. Appendicitis is considered but less likely given the vaginal symptoms and recurrent infections.\n4. Diagnosis: Intra-abdominal abscess secondary to pelvic infection\nJustification: The ongoing fever, pain, and systemic symptoms raise concern about an abscess formation resulting from progressive PID. This condition explains the severity of symptoms and radiates as described. It is a complication that becomes highly probable if PID progresses unchecked.\n5. Diagnosis: Early ectopic pregnancy or other pregnancy-related complications\nJustification: Irregular bleeding and pelvic pain raise suspicion, but less likely given the duration of two weeks and systemic symptoms like fever. Still, it requires consideration, especially in reproductive-aged women, until pregnancy exclusion is confirmed.\nSTOP HERE.",
