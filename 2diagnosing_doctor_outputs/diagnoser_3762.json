Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient's severe headaches, nausea, and visual disturbances are characteristic features of migraines, which often present with episodic throbbing headaches accompanied by visual changes such as blurry vision.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Pseudotumor cerebri (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension)\nJustification: Symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, nausea, and unsteadiness, especially in a young woman, suggest increased intracranial pressure; bilateral papilledema would support this diagnosis.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Intracranial mass lesion (tumor or cyst)\nJustification: A space-occupying lesion could cause persistent headaches, visual symptoms, nausea, and gait disturbances due to localized pressure effects.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Hypertensive headache\nJustification: Elevated blood pressure can cause severe headaches and visual disturbances; however, it typically correlates with elevated BP readings which need to be confirmed.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Temporal arteritis (Giant cell arteritis)\nJustification: Though less common in women under 50, this condition can cause headaches and visual changes, especially if associated with systemic symptoms.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Vestibular dysfunction or inner ear disorder\nJustification: The feeling of being off and unsteady could be from vestibular issues, which sometimes occur alongside or separate from headache episodes.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse\nJustification: Visual disturbances and neurological symptoms like unsteadiness could result from demyelinating lesions, especially in young women.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Sinusitis\nJustification: Sinus infections can cause facial pain, headaches, nausea, and visual discomfort, though less likely to cause severe neurological symptoms.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Hypertensive encephalopathy\nJustification: Severe hypertension can lead to encephalopathy presenting with headache, visual disturbances, and unsteadiness; clinical assessment of BP is crucial.\n\n10.

Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: The description of a tight, pressure-like headache localized to the forehead aligns with tension headaches, which can be episodic and cause a sensation of pressure and discomfort.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Although less common, sudden, severe, unilateral headaches with associated symptoms could indicate cluster headache episodes, especially if they occur intermittently over two weeks.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Sinusitis (sinus headache)\nJustification: Headaches involving the forehead and associated with feelings of pressure and discomfort could be caused by sinus inflammation or infection affecting the frontal sinuses.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Elevated intracranial pressure (intracranial hypertension)\nJustification: Symptoms such as headache with visual disturbances, feeling off balance, and nausea may suggest increased intracranial pressure impacting optic nerves and balance systems.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Ocular pathology (e.g., glaucoma)\nJustification: Blurry vision and headache might relate to ocular pressure issues, such as acute angle-closure glaucoma.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Neurovascular disorders (e.g., transient ischemic attack)\nJustification: The unsteady feeling and episodic nature of headaches might indicate brief ischemic episodes affecting the brain's blood supply.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Brain tumor or mass lesion\nJustification: Persistent or worsening headaches, visual changes, and unsteadiness over two weeks could be signs of a space-occupying lesion causing increased intracranial pressure or local effects.\n\n9.

The headaches are associated with feeling sick, blurry vision, and feeling unsteady or out of sorts. She has not noticed other neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness, or tingling, but mentions feeling like she might fall over sometimes.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura or aura without headache\nJustification: The patient reports a two-week history of episodic headaches with a sensation of pressure in the forehead, associated with nausea (feeling sick) and visual disturbances (blurry vision). The symptoms are transient and can come on suddenly or gradually, which is characteristic of migraines. The feeling of being unsteady and the sensation that she might fall over can correspond to the aura phase or migraine-related vestibular symptoms. Migraines are common in women of this age and often present with associated neurological symptoms and episodic nature.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: The description of a \"tight pressure\" in the forehead suggests tension headaches, which are usually bilateral and pressing in nature. However, tension headaches typically do not cause visual symptoms or nausea, making this diagnosis less likely as the primary explanation. Still, given the forehead pressure component, tension headaches could coexist or partly explain her symptoms.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Vestibular migraine or other migraine-related disorder\nJustification: The unsteadiness and feeling like she might fall over, along with visual disturbances and nausea, are consistent with vestibular migraine. This subtype of migraine primarily involves vestibular symptoms such as dizziness and disequilibrium, which match her description of feeling unsteady.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Elevated intracranial pressure (e.g., pseudotumor cerebri)\nJustification: The symptoms of headache, blurry vision, and unsteadiness, with no mention of focal neurological deficits, could indicate increased intracranial pressure. Although this usually occurs in overweight women or those with other risk factors, it must be considered given her visual symptoms and head pressure. The episodic nature may be less typical, but fluctuating intracranial pressure can produce such symptoms.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Secondary headache due to an underlying process (e.g., brain lesion, vascular disorder)\nJustification: Her symptom presentation\u2014including blurring vision, unsteady feelings, and nausea\u2014raises concern for intracranial pathology such as a mass effect, vascular lesion, or other structural abnormality. Although less common in her age group without prior neurological issues, it warrants consideration given the symptom profile and duration.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Migraine (with or without aura) \u2014 Given the episodic nature, visual disturbances, nausea, and sensations of unsteadiness, migraine remains the most probable primary diagnosis. The symptoms align well with common migraine features.\n\n2. Vestibular migraine \u2014 The specific mention of feeling unsteady or like she might fall over suggests vestibular involvement, a known feature of migraine with vestibular symptoms.\n\n3. Tension-type headache \u2014 The pressure sensation in the forehead could represent tension headache features; however, associated visual and nausea symptoms make this less likely as the primary cause but possibly coexisting.\n\n4. Elevated intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri) \u2014 The combination of headache, visual symptoms, and unsteadiness warrants evaluation for intracranial hypertension, especially if fundoscopic findings suggest papilledema.\n\n5. Other secondary causes (e.g., space-occupying lesion, vascular events) \u2014 While less immediately likely in this otherwise healthy young woman, persistent or worsening neurological symptoms would prompt neuroimaging to rule out structural abnormalities or vascular pathology.\n\nFurther clinical assessment, including neurological examination, fundoscopic exam, and neuroimaging, is recommended to clarify the diagnosis.",

She also reports feeling unsteady or out of sorts and sometimes feels like she might fall over. She has not noticed other neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness, or tingling.",
    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura  \nJustification: The patient\u2019s description of headaches that come and go, with sudden or gradual onset, associated visual phenomena (flashes, weird shapes), and sensitivity to light strongly suggests migraine with aura. The nausea and visual disturbances are classic features. The unsteady feeling and sensation of imbalance also fit with some migrainous episodes, particularly if they involve neurological symptoms like aura.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri)  \nJustification: The presence of headache with visual disturbances, especially in a young woman, raises concern for increased intracranial pressure. Symptoms like transient visual changes, blurry vision, and feeling unsteady could point toward papilledema due to elevated intracranial pressure. Although typically associated with obesity, recent weight gain or other risk factors should be considered.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Vestibular Migraine (Migraine-associated Vertigo)  \nJustification: The sensation of unsteadiness, feeling like she might fall, and visual disturbances could reflect vestibular involvement. Vestibular migraines commonly present with episodic vertigo, imbalance, and visual symptoms, often overlapping with migraine aura features. The episodic nature fits well with this diagnosis.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Other Ischemic Event  \nJustification: Although less common in this age group, sudden onset of visual phenomena and imbalance could indicate transient ischemia affecting occipital or cerebellar regions. The duration of symptoms and fluctuating nature are compatible. It warrants consideration, especially given the serious implications of cerebrovascular events.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Demyelinating Disease  \nJustification: Visual disturbances such as flashes or blurry vision, combined with unsteady gait or balance issues, could suggest demyelinating processes affecting the optic nerve or cerebellar pathways. MS often presents with episodic neurological symptoms, which could transiently affect vision and coordination.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Migraine with Aura  \nThe patient's characteristic visual phenomena, headache pattern, nausea, and light sensitivity strongly indicate migraine with aura. The episodic visual disturbances and associated symptoms align well with this diagnosis.\n\n2. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri)  \nThe visual symptoms, unsteadiness, and headache in a young woman raise suspicion for increased intracranial pressure. This condition can cause transient visual changes, headache, and balance issues, and requires prompt evaluation for papilledema.\n\n3. Vestibular Migraine (Migraine-associated Vertigo)  \nThe sensation of feeling unsteady and imbalance, along with visual symptoms, suggests a vestibular component related to migraines. This diagnosis involves episodic vertigo and imbalance associated with migrainous activity.\n\n4. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Ischemic Event  \nThe sudden or gradual visual phenomena and imbalance could be ischemic in origin. While less common at her age, it remains an important consideration in the differential for episodic neurological symptoms.\n\n5. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Demyelinating Disease  \nThe visual disturbances in conjunction with gait imbalance could signify demyelinating disease. MS often manifests with episodic neurological symptoms affecting vision and coordination, making it a pertinent consideration in this context.",

    "output": "THINKING:\n\n1. **Migraine with Aura**  \nJustification: The patient's episodes of headache are sudden or gradual, with associated visual disturbances such as flashes, shapes, and blurry vision, which are characteristic of aura phenomena. The recurrent nature over two weeks and symptoms like feeling unsteady fit with migraine aura. Nausea is also a common migraine symptom. The episodic pattern and visual symptoms strongly suggest migraine with aura.\n\n2. **Cluster or Other Primary Headache Disorder**  \nJustification: The described pressure-like headache and episodic pattern could initially suggest cluster headaches; however, the longer duration (days) and visual aura are less typical for cluster headaches, which typically have shorter, severe attacks with autonomic features. Still, primary headache disorders may sometimes overlap or have atypical features.\n\n3. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**  \nJustification: The unsteadiness, feeling out of sorts, and visual disturbances could suggest transient ischemic events. However, the patient is relatively young and lacks other vascular risk factors. The duration (two weeks of episodic symptoms) and the presence of headache make TIA less likely but still worth consideration, especially because visual symptoms and unsteady gait could be neurological.\n\n4. **Intracranial Mass Lesion (e.g., tumor or structural abnormality)**  \nJustification: Persistent, episodic headaches with visual disturbances and unsteadiness can be signs of increased intracranial pressure or mass effect. The pattern of symptoms, especially visual symptoms like flashes and shapes, raises concern for a lesion affecting the visual pathways or occipital cortex. The gradual or sudden onset fits with a growing lesion.\n\n5. **Optical or Ocular Pathology (e.g., Papilledema, Bleeding from Ocular Fundus or Retinal Detachment)**  \nJustification: Visual disturbances such as flashes and blurry vision could relate to ocular pathology; however, the presence of headache and unsteadiness points more toward neurological causes, but ophthalmoscopic pathology remains a possibility and warrants examination.\n\n---\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. **Migraine with Aura**  \nThe patient's visual disturbances (flashes, shapes), headache characteristics (pressure in forehead, episodic), and associated nausea align closely with migraine with aura. The episodic nature over two weeks and aura symptoms support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Structural intracranial lesion (e.g., tumor, cyst, or mass)**  \nPersistent, recurrent visual symptoms and unsteadiness raise concern for intracranial mass effect. This warrants neuroimaging to identify possible lesion impinging on visual pathways or affecting the cerebrocerebellar balance, especially given her ongoing symptoms.\n\n3. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) / Cerebrovascular event**  \nAlthough less typical due to patient's age and lack of vascular risk factors, visual disturbances and imbalance could represent transient cerebrovascular insufficiency. Differentiation requires further vascular assessment and imaging.\n\n4. **Benign intracranial hypertension / Pseudotumor Cerebri**  \nThe pressure-related headache, visual changes (flashes, blurred vision), and unsteady gait could suggest increased intracranial pressure despite the patient's age. Ophthalmic examination for papilledema is indicated.\n\n5. **Ophthalmologic pathology (e.g., retinal detachment, ocular ischemia)**  \nVisual phenomena may originate from ocular causes, especially if retinal pathology or ocular ischemia is present, though this is less likely without more ocular-specific symptoms; still, fundoscopy is necessary.\n\nNext steps should include neuroimaging (MRI brain) and ophthalmologic examination to clarify structural and ocular causes.",
