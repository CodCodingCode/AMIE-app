Diagnosis: Infected pilonidal cyst\nJustification: Classic presentation of sacrococcygeal swelling with foul drainage, history of development after cycling activity, local pain, and signs of infection point towards an infected pilonidal cyst with possible abscess formation.\n2. Diagnosis: Pilonidal abscess\nJustification: Presence of swelling with foul odor and drainage suggests abscess formation within a pilonidal cyst, especially with increased pain and pressure when sitting.\n3. Diagnosis: Sacrococcygeal abscess\nJustification: Similar to pilonidal abscess but broader in description; localized collection of pus in the sacrococcygeal area due to infectious process.\n4. Diagnosis: Pilonidal sinus\nJustification: Chronic sinus formation with drainage and foul odor indicates a persistent sinus tract secondary to prior cyst and skin breakdown.\n5. Diagnosis: Furuncle or carbuncle near sacrococcygeal region\nJustification: Infectious process of a hair follicle or follicular infection causing localized swelling and pus, though less specific given the description.\n6. Diagnosis: Perianal abscess\nJustification: Though less common in origin, perianal abscess can present with pain, swelling, and drainage near anal area; however, the location is more sacrococcygeal.\n7. Diagnosis: Sacrococcygeal epidermoid cyst\nJustification: Dermoid or epidermoid cysts are congenital and can become infected, presenting with swelling and drainage, but usually without foul odor unless infected.\n8. Diagnosis: Pilonidal granuloma\nJustification: Chronic inflammatory response without active infection, but less likely given the signs of active infection and drainage.\n9. Diagnosis: Pilonidal cyst carcinoma\nJustification: Rare complication of longstanding cysts; unlikely in a 2-week history but should be considered if recurrent or chronic.\n10. Diagnosis: Soft tissue neoplasm near sacrococcygeal area\nJustification: Less likely due to the acute presentation with signs of infection; neoplasms typically present as painless, firm masses without drainage.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Pilonidal sinus without active infection\nJustification: The presence of sinus tract and prior swelling could suggest a chronic, non-infected sinus, but the recent symptoms point toward active infection.\n5. Diagnosis: Furuncle or carbuncle in the perineal area\nJustification: Localized abscess from hair follicle infection; less likely given the multiple features over time.\n6. Diagnosis: Perianal abscess\nJustification: Presents with swelling and drainage near the anal region; location overlaps, but the description of sacrococcygeal swelling favors pilonidal path.\n7.

Common in young males with hair and friction in the sacrococcygeal region.\n2. Diagnosis: Pilonidal abscess\nJustification: Progression from cyst to abscess is common; characterized by localized swelling, pain, and purulent drainage. The increased pain and worsening swelling over two weeks are typical.\n3. Diagnosis: Sacrococcygeal abscess\nJustification: Fluctuant swelling with drainage in the sacrococcygeal region suggests abscess formation, especially in the context of infection from pilonidal disease.\n4.

Diagnosis: Localized skin or soft tissue infection (cellulitis)\nJustification: Presents with swelling and drainage; however, persistent sinus formation suggests a more chronic process rather than simple cellulitis.\n6. Diagnosis: Pilonidal fistula\nJustification: Chronic drainage and sinus formation are indicative; fistulous tracts often develop in longstanding pilonidal disease.\n7.

Diagnosis: Pilonidal Abscess\nJustification: The patient\u2019s swelling, foul odor, drainage, and localized pain in the sacrococcygeal region suggest an infected pilonidal cyst, which frequently progresses to an abscess. The recent activity (cycling) could have precipitated or exacerbated the condition. The two-week duration indicates ongoing local infection with possible abscess formation.\n2. Diagnosis: Infected Cutaneous or Subcutaneous Abscess (non-pilonidal)\nJustification: Other abscesses in the gluteal or sacral skin could produce similar signs of swelling, drainage, odor, and pain. However, given proximity and history, a pilonidal origin is more probable. The regional localization favors pilonidal disease but cannot entirely exclude other cutaneous abscesses.\n3. Diagnosis: Pilonidal Sinus or Chronic Sinus Tract\nJustification: The drainage and foul odor suggest a chronic tract, especially if drainage has been ongoing or recurrent. The two-week course could represent a worsening of a chronic sinus increasing in size and infection.\n4. Diagnosis: Hidradenitis Suppurativa (perineal or gluteal)\nJustification: Although more common in axillary or groin regions, hidradenitis can involve the sacrococcygeal area, producing painful, draining abscesses. The description of foul odor and drainage allows consideration, but the acute timeline and focus in the sacrococcygeal area favor pilonidal disease.\n5.

Diagnosis: Pilonidal Abscess/Abscess with Infection\nJustification: The focal swelling with foul odor, drainage from a sinus tract, and recent increase in swelling and discomfort strongly point to an infected pilonidal cyst. The two-week course aligns with abscess formation progressing from a chronic cyst. Localized pain with pressure and the presence of drainage support this. Malaise and feeling unwell suggest possible early systemic response, although no definitive fever is reported. These features make this the most probable diagnosis, explaining the signs and symptoms well.\n2. Diagnosis: Cellulitis over Sacrococcygeal Area\nJustification: The signs of swelling, potential spreading of infection to surrounding tissues, and localized discomfort are consistent with cellulitis. The foul odor and drainage suggest an infected process, possibly complicating the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Cellulitis often accompanies abscesses and can account for systemic malaise without overt systemic signs.\n3. Diagnosis: Hidradenitis Suppurativa (Intertriginous Skin Infection)\nJustification: Although more common in axillary or inguinal regions, hidradenitis suppurativa can involve the sacrococcygeal area, especially in persistent, recurrent suppurative skin infections with sinus formation and foul odor. The chronicity and formation of sinus tracts align with this condition, which may mimic an infected pilonidal cyst.\n4. Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis of Coccyx or Sacrum\nJustification: The duration of symptoms, systemic malaise, and worsening swelling raise concern for possible deep tissue involvement such as osteomyelitis, especially if infection extends beyond skin and subcutaneous tissues. While this is less probable without systemic signs like fever or preliminary imaging, it remains a differential, especially if symptoms continue or worsen.\n5. Diagnosis: Cutaneous Neoplasm or Other Chronic Skin Condition\nJustification: Less likely but considered to account for a persistent, non-healing lesion with sinus formation. Chronic ulcers or neoplastic processes could mimic infective sinus tracts but are less probable given the acute features and signs of infection.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Infected Pilonidal Cyst\nJustification: The typical presentation with swelling, foul odor, drainage from a sinus tract in the sacrococcygeal region following cycling activity, and increased discomfort points strongly to a pilonidal cyst that has become secondarily infected. The chronicity (two weeks), symptom progression, and local signs support this, making this the most probable diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Localized Soft Tissue Infection (Cellulitis/Abscess)\nJustification: The worsening swelling, increased pain, and foul drainage suggest cellulitis or abscess formation as a complication of the pilonidal cyst or as a separate localized skin infection. The patient's general unwell feeling and warmth may reflect early systemic inflammatory response, but no definitive fever, making this a high-probability differential.\n3. Diagnosis: Hidradenitis Suppurativa\nJustification: Although more commonly involves axillary or inguinal regions, hidradenitis can involve sacrococcygeal areas, presenting with recurrent abscesses and sinus formation. The foul odor and drainage could suggest this, but less likely given the typical pattern and history centered around a cyst that became infected.\n4. Diagnosis: Soft Tissue Neoplasm (e.g., epidermal cyst or other cystic tumor)\nJustification: Less likely, but persistent swelling with sinus formation could raise suspicion for a neoplasm; however, clinical features favor infection over neoplasm, and absence of induration or solid mass points away from this.\n5.
