    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young woman with an extremely intense unilateral headache, nausea, light and noise sensitivity, and visual disturbances preceding headache onset\u2014classic features of migraine with aura\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The description of an intense, throbbing unilateral headache preceded by visual disturbances such as flashing lights or zigzag patterns is characteristic of migraine with aura. This is common in young women and fits her presentation closely.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary thunderclap headache\nJustification: The extremely intense headache might suggest a thunderclap headache; however, the presence of aura symptoms and lack of mention of sudden onset or maximal intensity at onset reduces likelihood. Still, it must be considered given severity.\n3. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: While typically less severe and less associated with aura, the patient's emotional distress might contribute to tension headaches, but presentation suggests a more severe migrainous process.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Typically unilateral, severe, with autonomic features, but usually occurs in men and has shorter bouts; less likely but considered due to severity.\n5. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage\nJustification: Sudden severe headache is a red flag; however, absence of neck stiffness, altered mental status, or other neurological deficits makes it less likely.\n6. Diagnosis: Sinus headache\nJustification: Also causes unilateral headache, but does not typically present with aura or nausea in this manner.\n7. Diagnosis: Intracranial mass lesion or tumor\nJustification: Usually presents with more gradual progression or other neurological signs; less likely acutely.\n8. Diagnosis: Intracranial infection (e.g., meningitis)\nJustification: No fever or meningismus reported; less probable but important to keep in mind.\n9. Diagnosis: Cortical spreading depression phenomena (not a diagnosis but underlying process)\nJustification: Underlying mechanism for aura but not a standalone diagnosis.\n10. Diagnosis: Trigeminal neuralgia\nJustification: Characterized by brief, stabbing facial pain rather than a throbbing headache, so unlikely here.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: Classic features of unilateral throbbing headache, visual aura (flashing lights, zigzag patterns), associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, and episodic history favor migraine with aura, common in young women.\n2. Diagnosis: Migraine without aura\nJustification: Previous episodes without aura or significant associated symptoms suggest a history of migraine, which could be evolving or mixed in presentation.\n3. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Common in young women; however, less likely given the intense unilateral throbbing nature and aura, but should be considered due to prevalence.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster headache\nJustification: Typically presents with severe unilateral pain, often orbital or temporal, with autonomic features; less likely here due to age, gender, and associated aura but included for completeness.\n5. Diagnosis: Sinus headache\nJustification: Unilateral headache with nausea can occur, but absence of sinus symptoms or facial pressure makes it less likely.\n6. Diagnosis: Medication-overuse headache\nJustification: No medication history provided, but if frequent headaches exist, overuse can contribute; less likely without prior frequent episodes.\n7. Diagnosis: Temporal arteritis\nJustification: Rare in a 22-year-old; unlikely but critical to consider if atypical features or visual loss were present.\n8. Diagnosis: Intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion\nJustification: Headache severe and associated with nausea/vomiting warrants exclusion; no red flags like neurological deficits or altered consciousness explicitly reported, making less probable but urgent to rule out.\n9. Diagnosis: Optic neuritis\nJustification: Visual aura and sensory sensitivities could suggest optic pathway issues, but lacks other signs like visual acuity decrease or eye pain; less likely.\n10. Diagnosis: Post-concussive headache or other secondary headache disorder\nJustification: No history of trauma provided, making secondary underlying causes less probable.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient's presentation of an acute, severe unilateral headache with throbbing quality, aura symptoms such as flashing lights and zigzag patterns, along with nausea and photophobia, are classic features of migraine with aura. Her history of similar episodes around her menstrual cycle suggests that these headaches are recurrent migraines, with current severity and complexity representing an exacerbation or progression. The absence of neurological deficits supports this diagnosis and makes secondary causes less likely at this time.\n2. Diagnosis: Primary headache disorder \u2013 menstrual migraine\nJustification: Her episodes occurring around her menstrual cycle indicate a hormonal influence on her migraines. Menstrual migraines are a common pattern; they are often less severe but can become more intense or complicated, as in her current presentation. Recognizing this pattern helps refine probability, though currently her symptoms are more severe than typical.\n3. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: Although her presentation is more characteristic of migraine with aura, tension-type headache can cause unilateral headache and sensitivity to light and sound. Its episodic nature and less associated aura or nausea make it less probable but possible as part of her headache spectrum.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster headache (less likely)\nJustification: Cluster headache features include severe unilateral intense pain, often periocular, with autonomic symptoms. Her headache is cephalic, but lacks autonomic features like lacrimation, rhinorrhea, or eyelid drooping; thus, while possible, it is less probable.\n5. Diagnosis: Migraine secondary to medication overuse or other secondary causes (less likely)\nJustification: No mention of medication overuse or underlying secondary pathology. However, her increasing severity warrants consideration of secondary causes if symptoms evolve further. Currently less probable but remains part of a broader differential, especially if new signs develop.",

    "output": "THINKING: Apply focused diagnostic reasoning:\n- Symptom evolution: The patient reports initial episodes that were less severe and simpler, mainly around her menstrual cycle, but current episode is more intense,\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The patient's unilateral throbbing headache, visual aura (flashing lights and zigzag patterns), nausea, vomiting, and photophobia strongly support migraine with aura. Her prior episodes, primarily around her menstrual cycle, align with typical migraine patterns, though her current episode is more intense and prolonged, consistent with a severe migraine attack.\n2. Diagnosis: Sinus Headache or Sinusitis\nJustification: The location and quality of headache can sometimes mimic sinus issues; however, lack of nasal symptoms and the presence of aura make this less likely. Nevertheless, sinus pathology remains a differential especially in differential clinical context.\n3. Diagnosis: Tension-type Headache\nJustification: While tension headaches can cause bilateral, band-like head pain, they do not typically include aura or associated nausea and vomiting. Given the presentation's features, tension headache is less probable but considered as a baseline differential.\n4. Diagnosis: Cluster Headache\nJustification: Cluster headaches are characterized by unilateral head pain, often around the eye, with autonomic features, and episodic pattern, but usually involve severe periorbital pain with autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation or nasal congestion. The lack of these features diminishes its likelihood.\n5. Diagnosis: Secondary headache due to intracranial pathology (e.g., tumor, vascular event)\nJustification: The worsening severity and change from usual pattern warrant consideration of secondary causes such as intracranial mass or vascular event. However, absence of neurological deficits or focal signs makes this less immediately probable; nonetheless, it remains an important consideration given symptom evolution.",

Diagnosis: Migraine with aura\nJustification: The patient\u2019s visual aura\u2014flashing lights and zigzag patterns\u2014preceding the headache, along with the throbbing quality, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia, are classic features of migraine with aura. The episodic pattern, often related to hormonal changes, supports this diagnosis.

Diagnosis: Migraine without aura\nJustification: The patient reports previous headache episodes that occurred around her menstrual period\u2014likely migraines without aura\u2014indicating a tendency for recurrent migraine attacks. While this episode has prominent aura, her history of similar episodic headaches suggests that migraine without aura is a component of her overall disorder.\n3. Diagnosis: Hormonal migraine\nJustification: Menstrual-related headaches suggest hormonal influence on migraine activity, making hormonal migraine plausible. The association of past episodes with her menstrual cycle supports this, particularly as hormonal fluctuations are known triggers.\n4. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache\nJustification: While tension headaches can involve bilateral, pressing pain without aura, her symptoms are more characteristic of migraine. However, tension-type headache remains in the differential, especially if her headaches are sometimes less severe and without neurological symptoms.\n5. Diagnosis: Secondary headache (e.g., cluster, other secondary causes)\nJustification: Although less likely given her presentation, the severity and acute nature warrant considering secondary causes, especially if atypical features emerge.
