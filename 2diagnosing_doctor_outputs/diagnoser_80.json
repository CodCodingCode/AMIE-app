No evidence of blood pressure fluctuations or postural symptoms points away from orthostatic hypotension, although it remains a consideration. Anxiety could contribute or exacerbate sensations of unsteadiness but does not explain the characteristic brief spinning episodes triggered by movement.",

The patient reports sensations of \"room spinning\" and sometimes nausea during episodes. They also note feeling \"unsteady sometimes, especially when I turn my head quickly or lie down,\" but clarify they \"haven't actually fallen.\" They describe that episodes are triggered by specific head movements\u2014\"mostly when I turn my head quickly or when I lie down in bed and roll over\"\u2014and sometimes shift position slightly to induce symptoms. No hearing loss or auditory symptoms are reported. The patient mentions they haven't checked blood pressure but suspect it might vary with position.
