Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis\nJustification: Prosthetic heart valve presence, intermittent high-grade fevers, changing heart sound (possible new murmur or regurgitation), and fatigue strongly point to infective endocarditis. The risk of prosthetic valve endocarditis is high in this context.\n2. Diagnosis: Valvular Dysfunction (Prosthetic Valve Regurgitation or Dysfunction)\nJustification: Change in heart sound suggests valve deterioration or regurgitation, which could be due to infective colonization or mechanical failure, leading to symptoms.\n3. Diagnosis: Perivalvular Abscess or Extension of Infection\nJustification: Fever and changing heart sounds could indicate complication of endocarditis involving adjacent cardiac structures.\n4. Diagnosis: Cardiac Embolism or Stroke\nJustification: If embolization occurred due to vegetations, signs might include neurological deficits, although not specified.\n5. Diagnosis: Non-infectious Pericarditis or Myocarditis\nJustification: Chest pain worsened by movement, although dull, could suggest inflammatory cardiac conditions, less likely given the context.\n6. Diagnosis: Cardiac Neoplasm or Tumor\nJustification: Less likely, but can present with constitutional symptoms and cardiovascular findings; clinical context favors infectious causes.\n7. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism\nJustification: Fevers are less typical, but chest pain and fatigue could suggest PE, especially if embolic phenomena originate from vegetations.\n8. Diagnosis: Pneumonia or Lung Infection\nJustification: Fever and chest pain could result from pulmonary pathology, though less directly connected to prosthetic valve issue.\n9. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Somatic Symptom Disorder\nJustification: Anxiety is mentioned as a communication factor; however, fever and heart sound change are less explainable solely by anxiety.\n10. Diagnosis: Other Systemic Infection (e.g., Cellulitis, Skin Infection)\nJustification: Less likely without local signs, but differential captures possible infectious sources.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis\nJustification: The recent change in heart sounds suggests valvular involvement, which combined with fever and fatigue raises high suspicion for infective endocarditis, especially as cardiac signs can evolve insidiously; prevalent in this age group with risk factors not specified but still a critical diagnosis to rule out.\n2. Diagnosis: Pericarditis\nJustification: Dull chest pain worse with movement, associated with recent fever, can point to pericarditis, especially if cardiac sounds have changed, possibly indicating pericardial effusion or friction rub; common in middle-aged adults with systemic inflammatory responses.\n3. Diagnosis: Myocarditis\nJustification: Fever, fatigue, and chest discomfort may represent inflammation of the myocardium; can cause functional and auscultatory changes, often presenting with systemic infection signs and chest symptoms.\n4. Diagnosis: Viral Systemic Infection\nJustification: Intermittent fever, fatigue, and malaise are typical of viral illnesses, which may also cause mild myocarditis or pericarditis; more common in this age group, especially if lab data suggests viral etiology.\n5. Diagnosis: Autoimmune/Inflammatory Cardiac Disease\nJustification: Given systemic symptoms and cardiac findings, autoimmune causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue diseases could involve the heart, causing valvular or pericardial issues, though less common without other autoimmune features.\n6. Diagnosis: Non-cardiac Chest Pain (Musculoskeletal)\nJustification: Pain worsening with movement suggests musculoskeletal origin; however, systemic symptoms like fever are atypical, making this less likely but important to rule out as a benign cause.\n7. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism\nJustification: Worsening fatigue, chest discomfort could indicate PE, particularly if associated with signs of hypoxia or DVT risk factors; intermittent fever less typical but still consider in serious causes.\n8. Diagnosis: Tuberculous Pericarditis\nJustification: Periodic fever and pericardial involvement could suggest TB-related pericarditis, especially in endemic areas; though less common without TB risk factors.\n9. Diagnosis: Cardiac Tumor or Structural Abnormality\nJustification: Change in heart sounds and chest pain may reflect structural heart issues, but systemic fever is less characteristic; hence less likely but still feasible.\n10. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Functional Chest Pain\nJustification: Symptoms may be exaggerated or influenced by anxiety; however, objective fever and changing cardiac sounds indicate underlying pathology demanding thorough evaluation, making this the least likely primary diagnosis.\nSTOP HERE.",

These features strongly suggest infective endocardit\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis\nJustification: The persistent fever lasting days, especially in a patient with a prosthetic heart valve, and a new heart sound (likely a new murmur or prosthetic valve abnormality) strongly support infective endocarditis. The symptoms of fatigue and chest pain worsening with movement are consistent with inflammatory or infective processes affecting the heart valves. The change in auscultation is a key discriminating feature indicating valvular involvement, which is characteristic of infective endocarditis in this context.\n2. Diagnosis: Prosthetic Valve Deterioration/Failure\nJustification: The new heart sound may also represent prosthetic valve dysfunction or deterioration, which can be infectious or degenerative. Given the recent change and systemic symptoms, this is a high priority to consider and likely related to infective endocarditis or mechanical failure. It is ranked second as it often coexists with or results from infective processes.\n3. Diagnosis: Systemic Infection (Sepsis)\nJustification: The prolonged fever (>100\u00b0F), systemic symptoms like fatigue, and ongoing infectious process involving heart valves suggest systemic infection or sepsis secondary to infective endocarditis. Although sepsis is a consequence rather than a primary diagnosis, it explains the systemic signs and warrants urgent attention.\n4. Diagnosis: Myocarditis or Cardiac Inflammation\nJustification: Dull chest pain worsening with movement and systemic symptoms could suggest myocarditis; however, the presence of a prosthetic valve and change in cardiac sounds makes infective endocarditis more probable. Nonetheless, myocarditis remains a differential, especially if blood cultures are negative.\n5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary or Other Systemic Infection\nJustification: While less specific given the current data, chest pain and fatigue can be caused by pneumonia or other systemic infections. However, these are less likely given the specific cardiac findings and prosthetic valve history, but they remain possible differential diagnoses.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis\nJustification: The patient's history of a prosthetic valve, persistent fever over several days, new heart sound, and worsening symptoms strongly suggest infective endocarditis. The prosthetic valve is a major risk factor, and the clinical picture aligns with septic process involving the valve, especially with an abnormal auscultation. Dull chest pain worsening with movement could reflect valvular inflammation or mycotic aneurysm. The absence of systemic signs like chills does not exclude the diagnosis, as presentation varies.\n2. Diagnosis: Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction / Valve Thrombosis\nJustification: The new heart sound and worsening symptoms could reflect mechanical dysfunction of the prosthetic valve. Fever may be secondary to inflammation or infection, but mechanical failure itself could cause symptoms. Given the timing, prosthetic valve thrombosis or structural failure should be considered.\n3. Diagnosis: Device-Related Infection (e.g., Pacemaker or Device pocket infection)\nJustification: Not explicitly mentioned, but with a prosthetic heart device, secondary infection of the device itself could cause fever and malaise. However, no specific evidence of device pocket signs is reported, so lower on the list.\n4. Diagnosis: Systemic Infection or Sepsis\nJustification: The persistent fever and fatigue suggest a systemic infectious process. Given the context of a prosthetic valve, sepsis secondary to endocarditis is highly probable.\n5.

The fact that systemic symptoms like chills and weight loss are absent does not exclude this diagnosis; they may be underreported or absent in early/subacute stages.\n2. Diagnosis: Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis (Subtype of infective endocarditis)\nJustification: Given the prosthetic valve, the risk of prosthetic valve endocarditis is high. The symptoms match well with this diagnosis, and the change in auscultation supports it, distinguishing it from native valve endocarditis.\n3. Diagnosis: Non-infectious Valve Disease or Mechanical Complication\nJustification: The precise new heart sound could represent a mechanical complication or valvular dysfunction, which can mimic infectious endocarditis symptoms but is less likely given persistent fever. Still, it must be considered, especially if blood cultures are negative.\n4. Diagnosis: Constrictive Pericarditis or Pericardial Disease\nJustification: Dull chest pain that worsens with movement and fatigue could suggest pericardial involvement, but this is less likely without signs like pericardial rub or characteristic ECG changes. Still, pericardial pathology can coexist or mimic certain cardiac findings.\n5. Diagnosis: Viral or systemic febrile illness (e.g., viral syndrome, flu)\nJustification: Less likely given the presence of a new heart sound and prosthetic valve history, but systemic viral illnesses can cause fever and malaise.
