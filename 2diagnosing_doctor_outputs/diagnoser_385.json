Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage due to Uterine Atony\nJustification: Most common cause of significant postpartum bleeding; presents with heavy bleeding and large clots, especially in the immediate postpartum period; clinical signs of volume loss may be evident.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception (Retained Placenta)\nJustification: Can cause ongoing bleeding with large clots; often presents shortly after delivery with bleeding that persists despite initial management.\n3. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)\nJustification: Can occur postpartum, especially if there is underlying infection or amniotic fluid embolism; presents with abnormal bleeding and large blood clots, with signs of hemodynamic instability.\n4. Diagnosis: Placental Abruption\nJustification: Can cause significant bleeding with large clots shortly after delivery; may be associated with pain and fetal compromise (although not specified here).\n5. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Rare but severe cause of postpartum bleeding; presents with sudden, heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, and signs of shock, especially if recent delivery complicates the process.\n6. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy due to Liver Disease (e.g., HELLP Syndrome)\nJustification: Less likely given the recent childbirth context, but possible if underlying hypertensive disorders are present; causes bleeding diathesis.\n7. Diagnosis: Bleeding from Vaginal or Cervical Trauma\nJustification: Could cause heavy bleeding and large clots, especially if trauma occurred during delivery; physical exam would clarify.\n8. Diagnosis: Hematologic Disorder (e.g., Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura)\nJustification: Unlikely acutely postpartum without prior history, but can cause abnormal bleeding and large clots.\n9. Diagnosis: Coagulation Factor Deficiency (e.g., Hemophilia)\nJustification: Usually diagnosed before pregnancy unless acquired; less likely in this presentation unless there is prior history.\n10. Diagnosis: Vascular Malformation of Reproductive Tract\nJustification: Rare; may cause abnormal bleeding but less likely in acute postpartum setting without prior symptoms or history.",

Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage (Uterine Atony)\nJustification: Heavy bleeding with large clots in postpartum woman strongly suggests uterine atony as the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage, especially if bleeding is worsening since delivery.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception\nJustification: Worsening bleeding postpartum can result from retained placental tissue, which impairs uterine contractions and prolongs bleeding.\n3. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy or Bleeding Disorder\nJustification: If bleeding is disproportionate or persists despite uterine tone, underlying coagulopathies such as postpartum hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia or clotting factor deficiencies should be considered.\n4. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Severe bleeding postpartum could be indicative of uterine rupture, especially if she has predisposing risk factors or abnormal obstetric history, though less common in a normal delivery.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorder\nJustification: Abnormal placentation can lead to excessive postpartum bleeding, particularly if the placenta failed to separate properly.\n6. Diagnosis: Postpartum Hematoma\nJustification: Large blood clots and ongoing bleeding may be due to hematoma formation in pelvis or perineum causing ongoing blood loss.\n7. Diagnosis: Preeclampsia/Eclampsia Complication\nJustification: Although not explicitly indicated, these conditions may cause postpartum hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability; vital signs would guide further.\n8. Diagnosis: Anemia\nJustification: Her symptoms of dizziness and weakness suggest significant blood loss causing anemia, possibly contributing to her subjective symptoms.\n9. Diagnosis: Hemorrhagic Shock\nJustification: Signs of dizziness, weakness, blurry vision upon standing suggest hemodynamic compromise; if blood loss is severe, she may be progressing toward shock.\n10. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Emotional Amplification\nJustification: Her detailed and emotionally expressive reporting could indicate anxiety amplification; however, clinical stability must be confirmed first.",

Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) due to Uterine Atony\nJustification: The most common cause of heavy postpartum bleeding involving large blood clots, especially when bleeding worsens since delivery, indicating uterine inability to contract effectively after delivery.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception (Placental Remnants)\nJustification: Ongoing heavy bleeding with large blood clots suggests incomplete placental separation, common in postpartum bleeding, especially if bleeding persists or worsens.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, worsening bleeding postpartum with associated abdominal or chest discomfort could indicate uterine rupture, which is a critical diagnosis not to miss.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., DIC)\nJustification: Significant bleeding and large clots could be exacerbated by a bleeding disorder, especially in the postpartum setting, and may be secondary to other obstetric complications.\n5. Diagnosis: Placenta Accreta Spectrum\nJustification: Abnormal placental attachment can cause postpartum bleeding, especially if bleeding persists and worsens over time.\n6. Diagnosis: Postpartum Hematoma\nJustification: Large bleeding with clots might be due to a vulvar or pelvic hematoma, although usually localized, it is part of postpartum complications.\n7. Diagnosis: Placental Abruption\nJustification: While typically presenting antepartum, retained placental tissue or bleeding related to subtle placental separation could cause postpartum bleeding and discomfort.\n8. Diagnosis: Bleeding Disorder (e.g., Hemophilia)\nJustification: Less common, but hereditary bleeding disorders could contribute to prolonged bleeding, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to clinical findings.\n9. Diagnosis: Uterine Inversion\nJustification: Rare, but can cause postpartum bleeding with sudden removal of the uterus from the uterine wall, leading to severe hemorrhage\u2014clinical signs often include shock and a protruding uterine fundus.\n10. Diagnosis: Endometritis or Infection\nJustification: Usually presents with fever and foul discharge, less so with heavy bleeding involving clots, thus lower likelihood unless associated with other infectious signs.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Uterine Atony\nJustification: The heavy, persistent postpartum bleeding with large clots is characteristic of uterine atony, which is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. It explains the ongoing bleeding and the worsening symptoms due to ongoing blood loss and hypovolemia. The clinical scenario suggests the uterus may not be contracting adequately post-delivery, leading to poor tamponade of bleeding vessels.\n2. Diagnosis: Retained Products of Conception\nJustification: Persistent heavy bleeding and clots postpartum can indicate retained placental tissue or membranes preventing uterine contraction and healing, contributing to ongoing hemorrhage. It aligns with the description of worsening bleeding since delivery and could exacerbate atony or act as a bleeding source.\n3. Diagnosis: Uterine Rupture\nJustification: Although less common, the presence of mild chest discomfort and ongoing bleeding raises concern for uterine rupture, especially if there was a difficult delivery or operative procedures. It can cause massive bleeding and systemic symptoms. However, without more specific signs (e.g., abdominal pain, palpable defect), it ranks lower than primary causes like atony or retained tissue but remains a differential.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)\nJustification: The ongoing bleeding and large clots raise the concern for an underlying coagulopathy, which can be precipitated by severe hemorrhage, placental abruption, or pre-existing conditions. It could worsen bleeding despite uterine contractions, affecting the clotting mechanism globally.\n5. Diagnosis: Subinvolution of the Uterus\nJustification: This condition involves delayed involution, leading to prolonged bleeding postpartum, but it's typically less acute and associated with milder bleeding. Given the severity and systemic symptoms, it is less likely than the above causes but still possible, especially if bleeding persists beyond the usual timeframe and without other obvious causes.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Retained products of conception\nJustification: The immediate postpartum onset of heavy bleeding with large clots suggests incomplete expulsion of placental tissue, which can cause ongoing uterine bleeding and prevent uterine contraction. Persistent bleeding worsening over time, along with systemic hypovolemia symptoms, supports retained products as a primary cause. The inability to specify blood loss volume and presence of blood clots aligns with retained tissue impeding uterine contraction and bleeding control.\n2. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: Although typically associated with atonic uterus immediately after delivery, it remains a leading cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Persistent bleeding with large clots could reflect failure of uterus to contract properly, especially if the uterus feels boggy on exam\u2014a key feature. The worsening bleeding and clinical signs of hypovolemia support significant uterine bleeding, making atony a top differential.\n3. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., DIC)\nJustification: The presence of heavy bleeding, large blood clots, and systemic symptoms suggest possible coagulopathy. Postpartum DIC may develop due to massive bleeding, placental abruption, or fetal demise, leading to disseminated clotting abnormalities that worsen bleeding. Although less specified in the vignette, systemic symptoms and ongoing bleeding warrant consideration of coagulation disorder.\n4. Diagnosis: Placental abruption\nJustification: While typically presenting with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain prior to delivery, antepartum abruption can cause postpartum bleeding if associated with partial placental separation or bleeding from placental site. This condition can also cause coagulopathy and hypovolemia, explaining systemic signs. However, less likely if bleeding is exclusively postpartum without prior antepartum signs, but still within differential.\n5. Diagnosis: Uterine rupture\nJustification: Rare but serious complication that can cause massive bleeding postpartum with signs of hypovolemia. The mild chest discomfort could be referred pain, but lack of mention of abdominal pain or trauma makes this less likely. Still, due to the severity of potential, it remains a differential consideration, especially if bleeding is uncontrolled and physical exam suggests a uterine defect.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)\nJustification: The patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding immediately after delivery, large blood clots, and worsening bleeding over time strongly suggest PPH. The presence of orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and weakness indicates significant blood loss leading to hypovolemia, which is characteristic of severe postpartum hemorrhage requiring urgent intervention.\n2. Diagnosis: Uterine atony\nJustification: Uterine atony is the most common cause of primary postpartum hemorrhage. The progressive nature of bleeding and large clots support ineffective uterine contraction, contributing to continued bleeding. Although not explicitly stated, the clinical pattern aligns with this cause, making it a leading diagnosis.\n3. Diagnosis: Retained placental tissue\nJustification: Hemorrhage beginning immediately postpartum with ongoing bleeding and clots can result from retained placental fragments preventing uterine contraction and controlling bleeding. This is a common cause of persistent postpartum hemorrhage, especially if bleeding worsens over time.\n4. Diagnosis: Coagulopathy (e.g., Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)\nJustification: Although less likely without specific lab data, significant postpartum bleeding can also be caused or exacerbated by bleeding disorders or disseminated intravascular coagulation. This would be considered if bleeding persists despite uterine management or if there are other systemic signs, warranting consideration.\n5. Diagnosis: Placental abnormalities (e.g., placenta accreta)\nJustification: Abnormal placental adherence can cause severe postpartum hemorrhage. Given the immediate postpartum start and heavy bleeding, placental attachment disorders are possible, especially if bleeding is disproportionate to uterine tone. However, without imaging or specific history, it's a less likely initial diagnosis compared to obstetric causes.\nSTOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.",
