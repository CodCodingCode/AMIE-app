Diagnosis: Cleidocranial Dysplasia\nJustification: The nearly absent clavicles with movement of shoulders and facial dysmorphic features are classical; inherited, consistent with longstanding presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome\nJustification: Although typically tall, some variants or related connective tissue disorders can present with facial features; less likely given the patient\u2019s shorter stature.\n3. Diagnosis: Noonan Syndrome\nJustification: Characterized by facial dysmorphism, short stature, and skeletal anomalies; fits some features but less classic.\n4. Diagnosis: Stickler Syndrome\nJustification: Connective tissue disorder with facial features, skeletal abnormalities; possible but less classic presentation here.\n5. Diagnosis: Osteogenesis Imperfecta\nJustification: Skeletal abnormalities; however, lack of fracture history makes this less likely.\n6.

Diagnosis: Cleidocranial Dysplasia\nJustification: Classic features include near-absent clavicles, open skull sutures, and typical craniofacial features such as a prominent forehead and flat nasal bridge; familial inheritance supports this diagnosis.\n2.

Diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome\nJustification: Features like a prominent forehead and skeletal anomalies are possible, but near-invisible collarbones are less characteristic; nevertheless, connective tissue disorder relevance warrants consideration.\n4.

Diagnosis: Cleidocranial Dysplasia\nJustification: Classic features include prominent forehead, wide-set eyes, flat nasal bridge, very prominent collarbones, and stature issues. The skeletal manifestations and clavicular abnormalities point toward this genetic disorder, which often presents with clavicular hypoplasia and dental anomalies; the patient's report of shoulder movement difficulties aligns with clavicular hypoplasia common in this condition.\n2. Diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome\nJustification: Features such as a tall stature, prominent forehead, and skeletal anomalies could suggest Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder affecting skeletal growth. However, the specific craniofacial features like flat nasal bridge are less typical, making this less likely but worth considering due to overlap in skeletal features.\n3. Diagnosis: Grandis syndrome (or similar sclerosing dysplasia)\nJustification: The described features may overlap with certain rare genetic syndromes involving craniofacial and skeletal anomalies; although not as common, they should be considered, especially when features are longstanding.\n4. Diagnosis: Williams Syndrome (the dysmorphic features)\nJustification: While Williams syndrome features characteristic facial appearance, they tend to include full lips, wide mouth, and certain cognitive features; the patient's features are more skeletal, so this is less likely.\n5. Diagnosis: Noonan Syndrome\nJustification: Known for facial dysmorphology and short stature; however, connective tissue or clavicular abnormalities are less characteristic, making this less probable.\n6. Diagnosis: Achondroplasia\nJustification: Features include short stature and skull/face anomalies, but typically include rhizomelic shortening and characteristic facial features different from the patient's presentation.\n7. Diagnosis: Multiple Congenital Anomaly Syndromes (unspecified)\nJustification: Various syndromes could cause these features, but the consistency and stability over years favor a single syndrome.\n8. Diagnosis: Congenital Skeletal Dysplasia (unspecified)\nJustification: General category including many conditions affecting bone growth; specific diagnosis uncertain.\n9. Diagnosis: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (mild forms)\nJustification: Features such as stature issues and skeletal abnormalities exist, but the lack of history of fractures or bone fragility makes this less likely.\n10. Diagnosis: Acromegaly\nJustification: Features such as prominent forehead and facial features can appear in acromegaly, but the longstanding stable features since childhood and lack of other signs (e.g., enlarged hands, feet) make this unlikely.",

The patient's self-perception and social difficulties hint at possible psychosocial impact secondary to physical features. The occasional shoulder difficulty may reflect anatomical anomalies rather than primary muscular or neurological pathology. The features are stable, indicating a congenital condition rather than acquired. Differential diagnoses include syndromes affecting skeletal development or craniofacial structure, such as Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or other connective tissue disorders, but the prominence of specific features like collarbones leaning toward syndromic diagnoses. 1. Diagnosis: Cleidocranial Dysplasia Justification: Characterized by defective development of bones formed from intramembranous ossification, notably including absent or hypoplastic clavicles resulting in very prominent collarbones; craniofacial features often include a prominent forehead and flat nasal bridge; short stature is common. The lifelong nature and stability of features, along with clavicular prominence, strongly point to this diagnosis influencing skeletal morphology and patient self-image.",

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's features of flat nasal bridge, prominent forehead, wide-set eyes, prominent collarbones, and short stature suggest a congenital disorder affecting skeletal and craniofacial development. \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Cleidocranial Dysplasia\nJustification: The prominent collarbones are characteristic of cleidocranial dysplasia, a congenital skeletal disorder involving clavicular hypoplasia or aplasia leading to wide-set shoulders and shoulder mobility issues. The facial features such as flat nasal bridge and prominent forehead are also consistent with craniofacial abnormalities seen in this condition. Short stature and lifelong physical features support this diagnosis. The syndrome is known for skeletal anomalies rather than severe intellectual impairment, explaining the patient's stable features and specific skeletal signs.\n2. Diagnosis: Noonan Syndrome\nJustification: The patient's facial features (prominent forehead, wide-set eyes, flat nasal bridge), short stature, and skeletal characteristics align with Noonan syndrome. This disorder often presents with distinct craniofacial features, short stature, and sometimes skeletal anomalies, including chest wall deformities. Social withdrawal and feeling out of place could be secondary to appearance-related societal perceptions, common in Noonan syndrome. The occasional shoulder movement difficulty might be related to connective tissue laxity or skeletal issues typical in this syndrome.\n3. Diagnosis: Marfan Syndrome\nJustification: Although Marfan syndrome mainly presents with tall stature and arachnodactyly, it can occasionally include craniofacial features like a prominent forehead and flat nasal bridge. The patient's short stature argues against it as the primary diagnosis but cannot exclude Marfan, especially if other features such as joint hypermobility are present. Since no mention of cardiovascular findings is made, it remains a consideration but lower than others.\n4. Diagnosis: Skeletal Dysplasia (e.g., Short Stature Dysplasia)\nJustification: The patient's short stature and skeletal features suggest a form of skeletal dysplasia. However, the specific features, particularly prominent collarbones and facial features, may not align with common dysplasias like achondroplasia but could represent a less typical form. It's included due to the generalized skeletal abnormalities.\n5. Diagnosis: Growth Hormone Deficiency (or other endocrine disorder)\nJustification: While this could explain short stature, it does not account for the specific craniofacial features described. Therefore, it is less likely primary but remains a consideration when evaluation of stature and growth patterns are performed.\nSTOP HERE.",
