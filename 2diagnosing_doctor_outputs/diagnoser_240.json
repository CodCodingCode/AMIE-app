    "input": "A patient presents reporting a severe unilateral headache lasting all day, associated with nausea. The patient's description suggests high perceived pain intensity, potentially amplified by anxiety or distress. Objective assessment should include detailed inquiry into visual or neurological symptoms, headache frequency, and medication use to determine the nature and severity of the episode, considering possible migraine or secondary headache causes while accounting for communication biases.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a severe unilateral headache lasting all day and associated nausea. The presentation suggests a primary headache disorder, such as migraine, but must also consider secondary causes like intracranial pathology. The severity and duration raise concern for potentially serious conditions. The absence of mention of neurological deficits or other red flags shifts initial suspicion toward migraine or other primary headache types, but secondary causes cannot be excluded without further information. Given the critical importance of ruling out life-threatening conditions, the differential must include serious secondary headaches. The likelihood ranking starts with the most common primary headache and moves toward less common but critical secondary causes.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine without aura Justification: The unilateral, severe, all-day headache with nausea is characteristic of migraine; common and prevalent in the population.  2. Diagnosis: Tension-type headache Justification: Although typically less severe, unilateral tension headaches can be intense; may be considered if pain quality is aching and pressure.  3. Diagnosis: Cluster headache Justification: Unilateral, severe headache with nausea could suggest cluster; however, typically episodic and with associated autonomic features, which are not described here.  4. Diagnosis: Sinusitis Justification: Unilateral facial or headache pain with nausea can occur, but less likely given the severity and duration unless sinus pathology is evident.  5. Diagnosis: Medication overuse headache Justification: If the patient has frequent headaches and overuses medication, this could cause a severe headache; needs consideration if history supports.  6. Diagnosis: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension Justification: Severe unilateral headache with nausea, especially in young women, may suggest increased intracranial pressure; requires further assessment.  7. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Justification: Sudden onset \"thunderclap\" headache often associated with maximal intensity, but the description suggests a more prolonged rather than abrupt onset.  8. Diagnosis: Cervical artery dissection Justification: Unilateral headache with nausea can be a symptom; associated neck pain or neurological deficits would support this.  9. Diagnosis: Brain tumor or mass lesion Justification: Persistent headache with nausea could be due to mass effect; less likely without neurological signs but should be considered.  10. Diagnosis: Meningitis or encephalitis Justification: Headache and nausea can occur, especially if associated with fever or neurological signs, but not indicated here.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "A woman reports experiencing an abrupt, severe unilateral headache lasting a day, characterized by pounding pain, visual flashing lights prior to onset, and associated nausea and vomiting. Her communication suggests high genuine concern, with no obvious signs of symptom minimization. The presentation is suggestive of a migraine with aura; however, due to the sudden and intense nature of symptoms, secondary causes should be considered until ruled out. Further assessment should include neurological examination, inquiry about previous episodes, and evaluation for additional neurological signs to confirm the diagnosis and exclude serious underlying pathology.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a woman experiencing a sudden, severe unilateral headache with associated visual flashing lights, nausea, and vomiting. The abrupt onset and intensity raise concern for secondary causes such as vascular or neurological emergencies, despite the migraine-like features. The visual aura prior to onset suggests a possible migraine with aura, but the severity and abruptness warrant consideration of other serious conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial thrombosis, or other neurovascular events. Factors to consider include red flags such as new or different headache patterns, focal neurological deficits, or altered consciousness. The differential prioritizes life-threatening causes while acknowledging common primary headache disorders.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Justification: Abrupt, severe unilateral headache with visual aura and vomiting is classic; this is an emergent condition requiring exclusion. Even with suspicion of migraine, high suspicion persists given the severity and abruptness.  2. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura Justification: Visual flashing lights prior to headache, unilateral pounding pain, and nausea are typical features. Common in women of reproductive age; coincides with previous episodes in many cases.  3. Diagnosis: Ischemic Stroke (cortical involvement) Justification: Sudden unilateral headache with visual disturbances could represent cortical ischemia, though less common than hemorrhage; important to exclude due to neurological deficits.  4. Diagnosis: Intracranial Mass or Tumor (new or pre-existing) Justification: Can produce sudden worsening headache, especially if precipitated by increased intracranial pressure; less likely acutely but considered in differential.  5. Diagnosis: Primary Thunderclap Headache Justification: Sudden, severe headache of maximal intensity, often with alarming features; can be secondary or primary; warrants urgent evaluation.  6. Diagnosis: Meningitis or Encephalitis Justification: Headache, nausea, vomiting; usually associated with fever or neck stiffness but can mimic primary headaches.  7. Diagnosis: Carotid or Vertebral Artery Dissection Justification: Sudden unilateral headache, often with visual symptoms, and potential for neurologic ischemia; more common in certain risk groups but critical to exclude.  8. Diagnosis: Cluster Headache Justification: Severe unilateral headache with autonomic features; typically more localized and with restlessness rather than aura.  9. Diagnosis: Temporal Arteritis Justification: Usually in older women, with new onset headache, visual symptoms, and systemic signs; less likely in this age group if younger.  10. Diagnosis: Sinusitis or other infectious sinus issues Justification: Can cause intense pain localized to one side; less likely with visual aura but included for completeness.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is a woman presenting with a recent onset, unilateral, severe headache described as pounding, beginning suddenly in the morning. She reports visual flashing lights prior to headache onset, along with nausea and vomiting. Communication suggests high emotional distress, which may amplify her perception of severity. Objective examination details are currently limited; no focal neurological deficits have been reported. The presentation is consistent with a migraine with aura; however, due to the sudden and intense symptoms, secondary causes must be ruled out. Further assessment should include neurological examination, detailed history of past headache episodes and neurological symptoms, and evaluation for red flags such as persistent deficits or progression of symptoms. Her portrayal of symptoms indicates genuine concern, but clinician should remain vigilant for possible symptom amplification due to anxiety.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation with a sudden, severe unilateral headache accompanied by visual flashing (aura), nausea, and vomiting strongly suggests a primary migraine with aura. The abrupt onset and severity raise concern for secondary causes such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, so ruling out dangerous conditions is essential. The absence of focal neurological deficits makes some secondary causes less likely, but not impossible, especially initially. The described aura aligns with migraine, but the clinician must consider other vascular or neurologic issues given the sudden and intense symptoms. The primary focus should be on conditions that can produce these features with high likelihood while remaining vigilant for red flags.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura Justification: The patient describes a sudden, unilateral, pounding headache with visual flashing lights prior to onset, typical of migraine with aura. The associated nausea and vomiting support this diagnosis. The pattern fits well with a primary headache disorder, especially given the aura presentation and absence of neurological deficits, making it the most probable.  2. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) Justification: The sudden, severe headache described as \"the worst headache of her life\" is classic for SAH. Although no neurological deficits are currently reported, the abrupt onset and severity warrant urgent exclusion with neuroimaging due to high risk of morbidity and mortality if missed.  3. Diagnosis: Ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) Justification: Given the sudden pain and visual aura, especially with resolve, stroke is a concern. While she currently lacks focal deficits, vascular phenomena can present variably; further assessment is needed to exclude or confirm this.  4. Diagnosis: Cluster headache Justification: The unilateral, severe pain and timing (morning onset) fit but the visual flashes and nausea are less typical. Cluster headaches often involve autonomic features; thus, less likely but still considered in differential.  5. Diagnosis: Intracranial mass or vascular malformation Justification: Less likely given the recent acute presentation, but intracranial lesions can sometimes lead to similar symptoms if they cause sudden changes or bleed. This remains a consideration until imaging rules out structural causes.  STOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.",

    "input": "A woman presents with an acute, unilateral, severe headache beginning suddenly this morning, characterized as pounding in nature. She reports visual flashing lights with jagged, shimmering qualities prior to headache onset, consistent with migraine aura. Associated nausea and vomiting are noted. She denies other neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, speech difficulty, or balance issues. Her communication suggests emotional distress, which may amplify her perception of severity; she may also underreport previous similar episodes or subtle neurological symptoms. Objective neurological examination and detailed history are necessary to distinguish primary migraine with aura from secondary causes, and to clarify her baseline headache pattern and aura frequency.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has an acute, severe, unilateral headache with characteristic migraine aura (visual flashing lights with jagged, shimmering qualities) preceding the headache, along with associated nausea and vomiting. She denies neurological deficits such as weakness or speech difficulties, and her symptoms are consistent with a primary migraine with aura. The sudden onset, severity, and aura support this, but it is crucial to consider secondary causes like subarachnoid hemorrhage or other vascular events, although lack of neurological deficits diminishes immediate concern. Her emotional distress might influence symptom perception but doesn't alter diagnosis. The key features favor a primary migraine diagnosis, but differential diagnosis still needs to include secondary causes that can mimic such presentation.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Migraine with aura Justification: The patient's visual flashing lights with jagged, shimmering pattern preceding the headache are classic aura symptoms. Severe, pounding unilateral headache occurring suddenly aligns with typical migraine characteristics. Nausea and vomiting further support this, as these are common associated features. Absence of neurological deficits and typical aura pattern make primary migraine the most probable diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Justification: Sudden, worst headache (\"thunderclap\" headache) raises concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Visual aura can sometimes be mimicked by bleeding-related ischemia or irritation, and abrupt onset demands consideration. However, the absence of neurological deficits and no mention of neck stiffness or altered mental status make this less likely, but it remains in the differential until ruled out.  3. Diagnosis: Primary LE (likely tension or cluster headache) Justification: While the headache's description is typical for migraine, the severity and sudden onset warrant considering primary headache disorders such as tension-type or cluster headaches, especially if recurrent. Yet, the aura and associated nausea tilt more towards migraine, so these are less probable but remain differential considerations.  4. Diagnosis: Secondary vascular event (e.g., ischemic stroke) Justification: Sudden severe headache could indicate ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, especially in a woman with risk factors. However, absence of neurological deficits reduces probability. Still, initial assessment should exclude these possibilities.  5. Diagnosis: Other secondary causes (intracranial mass, infection) Justification: Less likely given the acuity and aura, but some intracranial pathologies can cause new, severe headaches. These are lower likelihood based on presentation but should be considered if atypical features or persistent symptoms develop.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient presents with an acute onset of a severe, unilateral headache characterized as pounding, beginning suddenly after waking. She reports visual phenomena described as jagged, shimmering flashing lights that preceded the headache, consistent with migraine aura. She also experiences nausea and vomiting associated with this episode. The patient indicates that this is the worst headache she has ever experienced, with no prior episodes of similar severity, though her previous headaches were milder and lacked aura features. She denies other neurological symptoms such as weakness or speech difficulties; however, her communication suggests that she may have experienced mild, overlooked symptoms in past episodes. Objective assessment should focus on detailed neurological examination and history to differentiate primary migraine with aura from secondary causes, recognizing that her past symptom history may be underreported or minimized.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of a sudden, severe unilateral headache with aura features (visual flashing lights), nausea, and vomiting aligns strongly with a migraine with aura. The worst-headache-ever nature indicates an acute episode, but her history of milder headaches supports a primary migraine diagnosis. No neurological deficits are present, and the aura symptoms are characteristic of migraine. Differential diagnoses like subarachnoid hemorrhage or other secondary causes are less likely given the lack of neurological signs, risk factors, or focal deficits. While further investigation might be warranted in atypical cases, the classical presentation here strongly suggests a migraine with aura.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: Sudden unilateral pounding headache, preceded by visual aura (jagged, shimmering flashing lights), nausea, and vomiting. - Timeline and progression: Sudden onset after waking, with aura preceding headache, severity described as worst so far. - Clinical pattern recognition: Classic migraine with aura features, consistent with primary headache disorder. - Supporting evidence: Visual aura with jagged or shimmering lights, typical migraine symptoms, no focal neurological deficits. - Excluding alternatives: Absence of neurological deficits, no signs of secondary headache causes, and history supports primary migraine.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: High confidence\u2014classic migraine with aura presentation. - Missing information: None critical; neurological exam pending but not expected to alter the diagnosis significantly. - Clinical coherence: The symptoms fit well into the migraine with aura pattern, explaining visual phenomena and headache. - Diagnostic criteria: Meets criteria for migraine with aura: at least one aura symptom prior to headache, episodic, and typical features.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Clear diagnosis of migraine with aura. - Information sufficiency: Yes, clinical history and symptom pattern are definitive. - Risk tolerance: No additional diagnostic workup needed unless atypical features develop. - Clinical urgency: Immediate treatment appropriate; no urgent further testing required based on current symptoms.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes\u2014symptom profile is classical and consistent. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: Yes\u2014clinical picture strongly supports migraine with aura.\nANSWER: Migraine with aura END",
