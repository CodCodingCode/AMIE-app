    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a soccer player with eye redness, swelling, and tearing starting 2 days ago. The acute onset after playing suggests possible trauma, infection, or allergic reaction. Common conditions include conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, trauma-related corneal abrasion or contusion, eyelid injury, or foreign body. Serious \"can't miss\" diagnoses include orbital cellulitis and globe rupture. Less likely but possible are conjunctivitis from other causes or insect bites. The timeframe and activity point toward trauma-related or infectious causes, with trauma-related issues likely given the recent activity.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are classic; recent activity may predispose to bacterial conjunctivitis or viral conjunctivitis.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or foreign body Justification: Acute onset after playing soccer suggests trauma causing corneal injury or foreign body, leading to redness, tearing, and discomfort.  3. Diagnosis: Subconjunctival hemorrhage Justification: Sudden redness after activity can indicate minor vascular rupture; typically painless but can appear dramatic.  4. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Eye redness and tearing are typical; less likely given recent activity, but possible if exposed to allergens.  5. Diagnosis: Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness over the eyelid following activity could suggest infection, especially if associated with skin disruption.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: More severe; symptoms include eyelid swelling, pain with eye movement, and possibly vision changes. Less likely without systemic signs but important to consider.  7. Diagnosis: Traumatic eyelid hematoma or contusion Justification: Swelling and redness can result from blunt trauma; history of recent activity supports trauma.  8. Diagnosis: Globe rupture Justification: Eye trauma after sports could cause globe rupture; look for signs such as decreased vision, a teardrop-shaped pupil, or extrusion of intraocular contents. Less likely if no specific trauma signs.  9. Diagnosis: Insect bite or sting Justification: Could cause localized swelling and redness, particularly if an insect was involved during play; less common.  10. Diagnosis: Orbital fracture Justification: Blunt trauma from sports activity can cause orbital floor or orbital rim fracture leading to swelling, ecchymosis, or enophthalmos; less likely without other trauma signs.",

    "input": "The patient presents with a rapidly enlarging, hard, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm, which has increased in size over two weeks from a small, painless lump to a golf ball-sized lesion. The patient reports increasing pain and swelling, particularly with movement or pressure. While subjective reports suggest significant distress and concern about serious causes, objective assessment is needed to evaluate signs of infection, trauma, or neoplasm, and to determine the precise nature of the lesion. Further clinical examination and diagnostic studies are indicated to clarify the underlying pathology.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has a rapidly enlarging, hard, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm with increasing pain and swelling over two weeks. The lesion was initially painless, small, and then grew quickly. The clinical picture suggests a concern for aggressive processes such as malignant neoplasm, infectious causes like abscess or necrotizing infections, or other less common entities like hematoma or benign tumors with rapid growth. Red flags include rapid growth, increasing pain, and size, which raise suspicion for malignancy or infection. Key considerations are soft tissue sarcoma, infection (abscess, necrotizing fasciitis), benign but rapidly growing tumors, or trauma-related hematoma. Non-malignant causes are less likely given the rapid growth and pain, but must be ruled out. The most likely diagnosis, based on rapid growth and firmness, is a soft tissue sarcoma, with infection as a significant concern needing exclusion.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Soft tissue sarcoma Justification: Rapid enlargement, hard and rubbery consistency, recent growth over two weeks, increasing pain\u2014all suggest an aggressive neoplasm like sarcoma, which can present as a painless or painful lump with rapid growth.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious abscess or necrotizing fasciitis Justification: Increasing pain, swelling, and rapid expansion raise suspicion for infection, especially if there is systemic infection or signs of skin involvement; however, the lesion's initial painless nature makes abscess less likely but remains a differential.  3. Diagnosis: Hematoma from trauma Justification: Rapid growth and firmness could be from bleeding into tissues; trauma history is not specified, but hematoma can enlarge and become tender.  4. Diagnosis: Benign soft tissue tumor (e.g., lipoma or giant cell tumor) Justification: Usually slow-growing, but very rare cases can enlarge rapidly; less likely given the recent rapid change and pain.  5. Diagnosis: Impending or early osteosarcoma or bone tumor extension Justification: If underlying bone involvement occurs, lesions may develop on soft tissue; less likely without bone signs but considered.  6. Diagnosis: Pseudotumor or reactive lesion Justification: An inflammatory or reactive process may produce a mass, but less common in this presentation.  7. Diagnosis: Metastatic lesion Justification: Less likely without known primary tumor elsewhere; can present as soft tissue mass.  8. Diagnosis: Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma Justification: Typically seen in immunocompromised patients and presents as purple patches; less likely in this presentation.  9. Diagnosis: Myositis or inflammatory pseudotumor Justification: Usually associated with systemic inflammatory features; less likely given the firm, enlarging mass.  10. Diagnosis: Neurofibroma or schwannoma Justification: Usually slow-growing, benign nerve sheath tumors; rapid growth and pain make these less likely.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "Patient demographics: Adult patient, gender unspecified. Chief complaint: Rapidly enlarging, hard, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm, with increasing size and pain over two weeks. Present illness: The lesion has increased in size from about the size of a grape to a golf ball within two weeks. It is described as hard and rubbery, with progressive pain that worsens with movement and pressure. The patient reports swelling and soreness, and expresses significant fear and distress about the lesion. Objective evidence of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, weight loss, or constitutional signs is not available based on reported history; physical examination details are pending. Likely, the actual lesion\u2019s growth and pain may be less rapid or severe than patient perceives, and the concern about critical, life-threatening conditions might be exaggerated due to anxiety. Possible causes include benign reactive processes such as hemorrhage or cyst, but further clinical evaluation and diagnostics are required to confirm the nature of the lesion and exclude malignancy or infection. Additional information on any trauma, systemic symptoms, or other associated signs is needed for comprehensive assessment.",
    "output": "THINKING: The rapid growth of a hard, rubbery soft tissue mass over two weeks accompanied by increasing pain raises concern for malignancy, such as soft tissue sarcoma, particularly given the rapid enlargement and persistence of symptoms. The absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss slightly reduces the likelihood of infectious causes but doesn't eliminate infections that can present without systemic signs. Benign processes like cysts or hematomas typically either do not enlarge rapidly or are associated with a history of trauma, which is not provided. The pattern of a firm, enlarging mass with pain is characteristic of neoplastic processes. The patient's distress and concern suggest the possibility of malignancy, which warrants prioritization. Including other benign or infectious causes ensures the differential remains comprehensive but ranked lower unless supported by further clinical data.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Soft tissue sarcoma Justification: Rapid growth over two weeks with a hard, rubbery consistency and increasing pain strongly suggests a malignant soft tissue tumor such as sarcoma. The size increase from a grape to a golf ball indicates aggressive proliferation. No systemic signs are present, but the pattern of rapid enlargement and firmness are classic malignant features, making this the most probable diagnosis.  2. Diagnosis: Hematoma Justification: A rapidly enlarging, painful mass can be caused by hemorrhage within tissues, especially if trauma is involved. The hardness and rubbery texture could reflect organized blood products. While trauma history isn't specified, spontaneous hemorrhages can occur, especially in vascular lesions or coagulopathies, which should be considered. This ranks second given the rapid growth and pain.  3. Diagnosis: Infectious process (e.g., abscess or cellulitis) Justification: Infection can cause painful, enlarging soft tissue masses, especially if abscess formation occurs. Although no systemic signs are reported, localized infection remains possible. The hard, rubbery consistency can be seen in organized abscesses or granulomatous infections, but the rapid, progressive enlargement favors neoplastic processes more.  4. Diagnosis: Benign soft tissue tumor (e.g., lipoma, cyst) Justification: Benign tumors like lipomas are typically soft and slow-growing, but some cystic or benign tumors can enlarge rapidly or become painful if inflamed or hemorrhaged, thus remaining a lower likelihood but still within differential considerations.  5. Diagnosis: Reactive or inflammatory process (e.g., traumatic bursitis, granulomatous reaction) Justification: An inflammatory mass due to trauma or other benign causes may enlarge and cause pain; however, the rapid and significant growth over two weeks without trauma history makes this less probable but still worth considering.

    "input": "An adult patient presents with a soft tissue mass on the arm that has increased in size over approximately two weeks from about a grape to a golf ball in size. The lesion is described as firm, rubbery, and associated with constant dull pain, occasionally sharp, which worsens with movement and pressure. No systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or weight loss are reported. The patient reports swelling and soreness around the lesion and expresses significant anxiety and fear regarding the lesion, which may amplify her perception of the severity and rapidity of progression. Physical examination and diagnostic evaluation are necessary to determine the precise nature of the lesion, including its growth rate, consistency, and any associated systemic findings.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient has a rapidly enlarging, firm, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm with constant dull pain, occasionally sharp, worsening with movement and pressure. The lesion increased from grape-sized to golf ball-sized over two weeks, suggesting a quick growth rate. Absence of systemic symptoms reduces likelihood of infectious or systemic malignancy initially. The characteristics favor a soft tissue tumor, possibly a benign or malignant neoplasm, but rapid growth raises concern for malignancy, such as soft tissue sarcoma. The pain associated with movement and pressure suggests an infiltrative or compressive process. The size increase over brief interval favors an aggressive process, warranting differentiation among benign growths, infectious processes, and malignancies.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Soft Tissue Sarcoma Justification: The rapid increase in size over two weeks, firm and rubbery consistency, and associated pain are highly suggestive of a malignant soft tissue tumor such as a sarcoma. The lesion's growth pattern, especially its swift enlargement, raises concern for malignancy. Pain worsening with movement may indicate infiltration into surrounding tissues, and the absence of systemic symptoms does not exclude a malignancy. Sarcomas often present as painless or painful enlarging masses that grow quickly.  2. Diagnosis: Liposarcoma Justification: Among soft tissue sarcomas, liposarcoma is a common subtype that presents as a deep, painless, but sometimes painful mass if compressing nerve or surrounding tissues. Its presentation as a rapidly enlarging, firm mass aligns with this possibility. The rubbery feel may reflect fatty tissue components, although the rapid growth is more characteristic of higher-grade tumors.  3. Diagnosis: Benign Soft Tissue Tumor (e.g., Lipoma or Fibroma) Justification: Although benign tumors such as lipomas tend to grow slowly, their initial presentation may mimic malignant tumors in early stages. Rapid growth suggests a less typical growth pattern for benign lesions but cannot be completely excluded without further imaging. Their consistency as soft and rubbery can overlap with the current findings, but the quick enlargement makes them less probable.  4. Diagnosis: Infectious Process (e.g., Abscess) Justification: Infection could cause a tender, enlarging mass, sometimes associated with warmth and systemic symptoms, which are absent here. The two-week rapid growth without fever or systemic signs makes abscess less likely, but initial suspicion should include this possibility until ruled out by imaging or labs.  5. Diagnosis: Hematoma or Vascular Lesion Justification: Hematoma could present as a rapidly enlarging, tender mass following trauma, but no history of injury has been provided. Vascular malformations or hematomas generally have different physical characteristics and evolution, making them less likely in this scenario.  STOP HERE.",

    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with a rapidly enlarging, firm, rubbery soft tissue mass on the arm associated with persistent dull and sharp pain that worsens with movement and pressure. The lesion has no signs of infection like redness, warmth, or systemic symptoms. The rapid growth over two weeks, firm consistency, and pain are concerning for a neoplastic process, most likely a soft tissue sarcoma. The absence of systemic symptoms reduces suspicion of infectious or inflammatory causes such as abscess or inflammatory pseudotumor. The clinical presentation aligns with features typical of soft tissue sarcomas, which often present as enlarging, painless or painful, firm masses and may grow quickly.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: Firm, rubbery, soft tissue mass, approximately the size of a golf ball, enlarging over two weeks, associated with dull and sometimes sharp pain worsened by movement and pressure. No redness, warmth, or systemic symptoms. - Timeline and progression: Rapid enlargement over a short period (~2 weeks), with escalation in size and pain. - Clinical pattern recognition: Rapidly enlarging, firm mass with pain suggests malignancy, most consistent with soft tissue sarcoma. - Supporting evidence: Rapid growth, firm/rubbery consistency, location on the arm, pain worsening with movement\u2014classic features of soft tissue sarcoma. - Excluding alternatives: An abscess or inflammatory process is less likely due to absence of signs of infection; benign tumors usually grow more slowly and may not cause significant pain or rapid growth.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: High confidence based on clinical features suggestive of soft tissue sarcoma. - Missing information: Imaging (MRI/ultrasound), biopsy results, and histopathology are needed for definitive diagnosis but are not currently available. - Clinical coherence: Symptoms and growth pattern fit well with soft tissue sarcoma; no contradictions. - Diagnostic criteria: Clinical presentation aligns with criteria for a malignant soft tissue mass, but definitive histopathology is necessary for confirmation.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Most probable diagnosis is soft tissue sarcoma. - Information sufficiency: Sufficient for a provisional diagnosis; definitive confirmation requires pathological assessment. - Risk tolerance: Further imaging and biopsy are needed before definitive treatment initiation. - Clinical urgency: Yes, given rapid growth and pain, urgent imaging and biopsy should be prioritized but do not preclude provisional diagnosis now.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes, given clinical picture strongly suggests soft tissue sarcoma. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: Yes, based on current data, clinical features strongly point toward this diagnosis.\nANSWER: Soft tissue sarcoma END",
