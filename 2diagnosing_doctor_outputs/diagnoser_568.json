    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a recent outdoor activity participant (playing soccer) with new onset of eye redness, swelling, and tearing over 2 days. The symptoms suggest an external eye process likely related to trauma or exposure. Redness, swelling, and tearing point towards conjunctivitis or ocular surface injury, with trauma-related issues also possible. The timing (post-soccer) raises suspicion of trauma, foreign body, or infection. The most common initial concern is conjunctivitis, potentially bacterial or allergic, but trauma must also be considered, especially given recent activity. Less likely but still important are other ocular infections or intraocular issues. Serious red flags like vision loss or severe pain are not mentioned, somewhat reducing suspicion of urgent intraocular pathology.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (bacterial or viral) Justification: Common cause of redness, tearing, and swelling, especially in a setting of outdoor activity; quick onset suggests infectious etiology.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or superficial trauma Justification: Sudden onset after playing soccer, eye rubbing or foreign body could cause abrasion leading to swelling and tearing.  3. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Palpebral swelling and tearing can be allergic in nature, especially in outdoor environments with pollen exposure.  4. Diagnosis: Foreign body in the eye Justification: Playing soccer outdoors increases risk of foreign objects, causing localized redness, irritation, swelling.  5. Diagnosis: Blepharitis Justification: Eyelid swelling and redness could suggest eyelid margin inflammation, common with external eye complaints.  6. Diagnosis: Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness localized to eyelids with recent activity; requires differentiation from orbital cellulitis.  7. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Although less likely without pain or visual changes, must consider due to swelling and recent outdoor activity, especially if systemic signs develop.  8. Diagnosis: Viral keratoconjunctivitis Justification: Usually bilateral and associated with other viral symptoms; tearing and redness fit, but less common after trauma.  9. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Unlikely without pain, photophobia, or vision changes; less associated with recent sports activity.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Typically presents with pain, vision changes, and haloes, none of which are described here, making it least likely.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "An adult patient reports experiencing ongoing visual hallucinations, described as shadows, and auditory hallucinations involving voices, which have increased over the past one to two weeks. The patient reports feeling \"wired\" and overwhelmed but is vague about the exact onset of symptoms. They deny feeling tired despite stating they have not slept for several days, indicating possible sleep deprivation. The patient expresses concern about losing control due to the intensity of the hallucinations. There are no explicitly reported paranoid or suspicious thoughts, but cognitive disorganization is suggested by their inconsistent timeline and emotional description. The clinical picture indicates persistent, possibly moderate to severe hallucinations with associated anxiety and emotional distress; however, the severity may be underestimated due to communication biases and emotional state. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify hallucination content, frequency, safety risks, and functional impact.",
    "output": "THINKING: This adult patient reports persistent visual and auditory hallucinations over the past one to two weeks, with an increase in severity, along with symptoms of being \"wired,\" overwhelmed, and sleep deprivation. The lack of detailed history limits the understanding of onset and prior episodes, but the acute presentation suggests a possible primary psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychosis, or medical cause. The prominent hallucinations and emotional distress point toward a severe psychiatric condition, while the sleep deprivation may contribute or result from the psychosis. Other consideration includes delirium or neurological causes, especially if hallucinations are new and without prior psychiatric history. Parkinsonian disorders are unlikely due to the absence of motor symptoms. The pattern favors primary or substance-induced psychosis as most likely, with some possibilities less common or urgent to rule out.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia spectrum disorder (specifically acute psychosis or first-episode psychosis) Justification: The presence of persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, emotional distress, cognitive disorganization, and the subacute onset fit with a primary psychotic disorder, especially given no mention of substance use or medical causes. Although the timeline is only weeks, the presentation is characteristic.  2. Diagnosis: Substance-induced psychotic disorder Justification: The patient reports being \"wired,\" overwhelmed, and sleep deprivation \u2014 common in stimulant or hallucinogen use, which can cause hallucinations. The acute change and increased symptoms over weeks could suggest recent substance use.  3. Diagnosis: Psychotic disorder due to a medical condition Justification: Hallucinations can result from neurological disorders, metabolic disturbances, or infections affecting the brain. The patient's altered mental state warrants considering these, especially in absence of psychiatric history.  4. Diagnosis: Delirium Justification: Sleep deprivation and hallucinations can be features of delirium, especially with disorganized cognition and emotional distress; however, the duration (weeks) and lack of fluctuating awareness make it less likely.  5. Diagnosis: Mood disorder with psychotic features Justification: Mood disturbances can produce hallucinations, but no specific mood symptoms are reported. Still, it remains a differential, especially if mood symptoms develop.  6. Diagnosis: Neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., Lewy body dementia) Justification: Visual hallucinations are common in Lewy body dementia, but usually in older adults and with motor symptoms, which aren't described here.  7. Diagnosis: Primary neurological disorder (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) Justification: Seizure-related hallucinations are possible but usually episodic and associated with other neurological signs; less consistent with ongoing hallucinations over weeks.  8. Diagnosis: Post-ictal psychosis Justification: Usually follows seizures; not indicated here, but to note as part of differential in certain contexts.  9. Diagnosis: Postpartum or hormonally related psychosis Justification: Less relevant unless context supports reproductive hormonal changes, not indicated here.  10. Diagnosis: Factitious or malingering psychosis Justification: Less likely without evidence of deception; symptom presentation appears genuine.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, including shadows and voices, which have increased over the past one to two weeks. The patient reports feeling \"wired\" and distressed, with ongoing hallucinations that they perceive as intense and difficult to distinguish from reality. She reports not sleeping for several days but describes feeling alert, suggesting significant sleep deprivation may be contributing to her psychotic symptoms. Communication patterns indicate emotional distress, but also suggest potential minimization of symptom severity and chronicity, with possible unreported psychotic features such as paranoia or disorganized thinking. Further detailed assessment is necessary to clarify hallucination content, frequency, associated symptoms, and safety risks, given the communication biases and potential for underreporting.",
    "output": "THINKING: Applying clinical reasoning to the scenario: - Symptoms include persistent visual and auditory hallucinations, distressed but alert state, recent increase in hallucinations over 1-2 weeks, and sleep deprivation. - The patient reports feeling \"wired\" and distressed, with potential for underlying psychosis. - The recent escalation suggests possible primary psychotic disorder, but sleep deprivation could also be precipitating or exacerbating psychotic features. - Differential diagnoses include primary psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia), substance-induced psychosis, mood disorder with psychotic features, brief psychotic disorder, or medical causes affecting the brain. - The absence of clear medical or substance use history limits certainty but symptoms fit best with primary psychotic processes, especially considering duration (>1 week) and prominent hallucinations. - Mood disorder with psychotic features typically involves notable mood symptoms not described here, making it less likely. - Immediate risk due to hallucinations and sleep deprivation emphasizes need for prioritizing psychosis. - The pattern suggests a likely primary psychosis, possibly schizophrenia spectrum, but could be substance-induced or affective.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder Justification: The patient exhibits persistent, prominent auditory and visual hallucinations with distress and difficulty distinguishing reality, which are characteristic of primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. The symptom duration of more than one week supports this diagnosis. The recent exacerbation and lack of mood symptoms point toward a primary psychotic disorder rather than mood disorder with psychosis or substance-induced psychosis.  2. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: Certain substances (e.g., stimulants, hallucinogens) can induce hallucinations and psychosis, especially in sleep-deprived states. While no substance use is explicitly reported, the patient's \"wired\" feeling and sleep deprivation could indicate stimulant use, which may cause hallucinations. Consideration is warranted, especially given recent changes and the potential for substance involvement.  3. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: If the hallucinations are a recent, transient episode possibly triggered by stress or sleep deprivation, brief psychotic disorder is plausible. The symptom duration (1-2 weeks) fits this category, but the \"persistent\" description suggests a more ongoing process, thus making this lower in likelihood than schizophrenia.  4. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: While mood symptoms are not described, mood disorders such as bipolar disorder can feature psychosis. However, absence of reported mood symptoms reduces probability. Still, this remains a possibility until further mood assessment.  5. Diagnosis: Delirium or Medical Causes Justification: The patient's sleep deprivation could lead to delirium or neuropsychiatric manifestations. However, hallucinations in delirium are usually more fluctuating, and no explicit medical abnormalities are indicated, so this is less likely but to be ruled out.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "An adult patient presents with ongoing visual and auditory hallucinations, including shadow figures and voices, which began approximately one to two weeks prior. She reports severe sleep deprivation and emotional distress, feeling \"wired\" and paranoid, though she minimizes the severity and duration of her symptoms. The hallucinations have reportedly increased in intensity, with persistent visual and auditory phenomena. She displays possible mood instability and paranoia, but details are limited due to communication patterns that suggest emotional distress and cognitive disorganization. Further assessment is needed to clarify the full scope of her symptoms, risk factors, and possible underlying psychiatric conditions.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation involves acute onset of visual and auditory hallucinations, combined with sleep deprivation, emotional distress, paranoia, and possible mood instability. The rapid progression over one to two weeks suggests an acute psychiatric episode or substance-induced condition, but no mention of substance use is provided. She displays features consistent with psychosis, which could be primary (like schizophrenia) or secondary (due to substance, medical, or mood disorder). The recent onset, severity, and context suggest conditions that manifest acutely. Differentiating factors include the acuity, hallucination types, and emotional state. Given the information, primary psychotic disorders are less likely due to shorter duration. Nor do findings strongly support neurological causes like delirium or neurodegenerative conditions. The combination of hallucinations, paranoia, emotional distress, and recent onset indicates schizophrenia spectrum disorders, substance/medication-induced psychosis, or brief psychotic disorder. Mood disorder with psychotic features is possible but less emphasized due to limited mood symptom details.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder Justification: The sudden onset of vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, coupled with sleep deprivation and emotional distress, suggests possible substance use effects, especially given the recent timing of symptoms. Although no substance history is provided, psychoactive substance intoxication or withdrawal often precipitate hallucinations and paranoia in the short term, fitting the case\u2019s rapid onset.  2. Diagnosis: Brief Psychotic Disorder Justification: The acute onset (within one to two weeks), presence of hallucinations, paranoia, and emotional distress without prior chronicity support a brief psychotic episode. The relatively short duration and recent escalation align with diagnostic criteria, especially if symptoms remit within a month.  3. Diagnosis: Schizophreniform Disorder Justification: The hallucinations and paranoia could fit early schizophrenia, especially if symptoms persist beyond one month (though this detail is not confirmed). The recent onset and significant distress are consistent; however, without confirmation of duration surpassing one month, this remains less certain.  4. Diagnosis: Schizophrenia (early or emerging) Justification: If symptoms persist beyond one month, schizophrenia becomes likely. The presence of visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and emotional instability align with core features. However, the brevity of symptoms since onset makes this less probable at this initial stage.  5. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features Justification: Emotional distress and paranoia could be stemming from an underlying mood disorder such as mania or depression with psychotic features. Nevertheless, limited mood symptoms and their prominence relative to hallucinations make this a lower probability as the primary diagnosis at present.",

    "input": "A middle-aged adult patient presents with visual and auditory hallucinations, including shadow figures and voices, which she estimates began approximately one to two weeks prior but possibly earlier. She reports experiencing shadows moving out of the corner of her eye and hearing voices that are sometimes persistent and bothersome, particularly when alone or distracted. She describes herself as feeling \"wired\" and unable to sleep for several days, which she attributes to her symptoms but may also contribute to their worsening. The patient exhibits evidence of paranoia, feeling that the hallucinations and voices are trying to communicate or control her, with emotional distress noted. Her communication style involves vague timelines and minimization of symptom severity, suggesting the actual onset and persistence may be more extensive and severe. She has not disclosed information regarding substance use, risk behaviors, or acting on hallucinations, though these areas remain to be explored further. Overall, her hallucinations and paranoia are likely more persistent and impactful than she acknowledges, potentially lasting longer and being more severe, especially in the context of sleep deprivation and distress.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation includes recent-onset visual and auditory hallucinations, paranoia, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress in a context that initially seems to be of psychotic phenomena. The symptoms began approximately one to two weeks ago but could have been present earlier, with possible escalation due to sleep deprivation. The hallucinations involve shadow figures and voices, both of which are prominent, and there is delusional paranoia about communication or control. No evidence currently suggests substance-induced causes or medical conditions; the symptoms are characteristic of a brief psychotic episode, potentially triggered by stress, sleep deprivation, or other environmental factors. Differential diagnoses like primary psychotic disorders require longer symptom duration and more consistent history, which seem less likely given the recent onset and possible reaction to acute stressors. Other possibilities such as substance-induced psychosis or bipolar disorder with psychotic features are less supported due to lack of substance use data and mood disturbance reports. The coherence and recent emergence favor an acute or brief psychotic disorder.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate to high confidence since symptoms align with brief psychotic disorder criteria, but precise duration and stressors need confirmation. - Missing information: Clarification on symptom duration, substance use, mood symptoms, and stressors would increase certainty. - Clinical coherence: Symptoms are consistent with brief psychotic disorder presentation. - Diagnostic criteria: Meets DSM-5 criteria for brief psychotic disorder (sudden onset, at least one positive symptom, duration less than one month).  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Most probable diagnosis is brief psychotic disorder. - Information sufficiency: Sufficient for provisional diagnostic closure, pending confirmation of symptom duration and stressor context. - Risk tolerance: Low; would be prudent to observe and clarify details before committing to long-term diagnosis or treatment. - Clinical urgency: High; symptomatic distress warrants prompt treatment but not necessarily definitive diagnosis now.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No, due to the need for further clarification on duration and stressors. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No, as additional context would solidify confidence but current evidence supports the diagnosis.\nANSWER: Brief Psychotic Disorder END",
