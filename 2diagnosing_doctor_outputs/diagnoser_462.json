    "output": "THINKING: The patient is experiencing increased anxiety centered around social situations, with physical symptoms such as sweating and flushing, suggesting a social anxiety component possibly complicated by pan\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: The primary presentation involves anxiety predominantly in social situations, with physical symptoms like sweating and flushing, typical features of social anxiety disorder. It is common and aligns with the described symptom pattern.\n2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: The presence of sudden physical sensations such as sweating, flushing, and overwhelming feelings raises suspicion of panic attacks, which may be occurring in social contexts or independently, especially as episodes have increased in frequency.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\nJustification: While the focus is on social situations, the increased frequency of anxiety symptoms could reflect broader generalized anxiety, especially if symptoms extend beyond social contexts.\n4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia\nJustification: If social interactions are specifically feared, this could represent social-specific phobia, a subtype of specific phobia, especially if specific social triggers can be identified.\n5. Diagnosis: Agoraphobia\nJustification: Physical symptoms like sweating and flushing, along with a sense of overwhelm, could relate to agoraphobia if episodes occur in or are triggered by situations where escape is perceived difficult.\n6. Diagnosis: Mood Disorder (e.g., Major Depression with anxiety features)\nJustification: Although primary presentation is anxiety, underlying mood disorders can present with anxiety symptoms and physical sensations, especially if subtle depressive features are present or suspected.\n7. Diagnosis: Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: If recent substance use (e.g., caffeine, stimulants, or withdrawal) occurred, it could trigger anxiety symptoms, though no such history is provided.\n8. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma\nJustification: While less likely, episodes of sweating and flushing could be related to catecholamine-secreting tumor; however, typically associated with other systemic symptoms like hypertension, not indicated here.\n9. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: Symptoms like sweating, flushing, and nervousness can be seen in hyperthyroidism, though other classic signs (weight loss, tachycardia) are not described.\n10. Diagnosis: Cardiac or Other Medical Causes (e.g., Arrhythmia)\nJustification: Physical symptoms like sweating and flushing could stem from cardiac arrhythmias, but without additional cardiovascular symptoms or red flags, this is less likely.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: Symptoms are specifically triggered by social situations such as meeting new people, with physical panic sensations, consistent with social anxiety. This is common and typically manifests with anticipatory anxiety and physical symptoms during social exposures.\n2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: Recurrent episodes of intense fear with physical symptoms such as sweating, hot flashes, difficulty breathing, which can occur unexpectedly or be triggered by social stressors, fitting the clinical picture of panic attacks.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: Chronic anxious feelings with physical symptoms recurring during social interactions could be part of generalized anxiety, especially if episodes are persistent and not solely situational.\n4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia (Social Type)\nJustification: Anxiety and physical symptoms predominantly around social interactions with specific triggers related to social situations, characteristic of social phobia.\n5. Diagnosis: Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition\nJustification: Some endocrine conditions (e.g., pheochromocytoma) can cause episodic sweating, heat sensation, and panic-like symptoms. However, without other systemic signs, less likely.\n6. Diagnosis: Substance-induced Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: Certain substances (caffeine, stimulants) could provoke similar symptoms, but no mention of substance use complicates this.\n7. Diagnosis: Early-Onset Dementia or Cognitive Disorder\nJustification: Unlikely given the age and presentation, unless additional cognitive impairment is noted.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: Symptoms such as heat intolerance, sweating, nervousness could be related, but typically persistent rather than episodic.\n9. Diagnosis: Cardiac arrhythmia or other cardiovascular causes\nJustification: Can cause palpitations and panic sensations but less often triggered solely by social interactions and without other cardiovascular symptoms.\n10. Diagnosis: Mitral Valve Prolapse\nJustification: Can cause palpitations and anxiety symptoms, but less specific to social situations and episodic panic sensations.\nSTOP HERE.",

The symptoms suggest an anxiety-related condition, likely \nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: Symptoms of sweating, heat sensations, nervousness, and difficulty breathing during social situations, with avoidance behaviors, strongly suggest social anxiety disorder, a common condition with onset often in young adulthood or early adulthood.\n2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: The episodes of physical discomfort, especially during perceived social threats, may resemble panic attacks, characterized by sweating, heat sensations, and feelings of losing control, although less predictable than typical panic attacks.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: The patient reports ongoing feelings of anxiety that could be part of a broader anxiety disorder, especially if episodes are frequent and associated with worry beyond social situations, but current focus is on social triggers.\n4. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma\nJustification: Catecholamine-secreting tumor causing episodes of sweating, heat sensations, and nervousness; however, typically accompanied by hypertension or other systemic signs, and episodes are often paroxysmal regardless of social context.\n5. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: Symptoms of heat intolerance, sweating, and nervousness can be due to hyperthyroidism, though usually accompanied by weight loss, tachycardia, and other systemic signs, which are not reported here.\n6. Diagnosis: Menopause or Perimenopause\nJustification: Flushing and sweating may be related, but age and specifics of symptoms being social trigger make this less likely, especially in the absence of menopausal status or other menopausal symptoms.\n7.

Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: The patient experiences episodic heat sensations, sweating, nervousness, and breathlessness predominantly triggered by social interactions and group settings, with significant avoidance and impairment. This aligns with social anxiety disorder, where social situations provoke excessive fear and physical symptoms, leading to functional impairment and social withdrawal.\n2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: The episodes include physical sensations such as breathlessness and sweating, which are characteristic of panic attacks. Although triggers are social situations, the presence of intense physical symptoms that cause anxiety about future episodes may suggest panic disorder, especially if attacks are recurrent and unpredictable. However, the clear association with specific social triggers favors social anxiety over panic disorder.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nJustification: The one-year duration and physical symptoms can be consistent with generalized anxiety disorder, especially if anxiety extends beyond social situations. However, the specific social triggers and social avoidance focus the primary suspicion on social anxiety disorder, making GAD less probable but still possible if symptoms are more pervasive.\n4. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: Symptoms such as heat intolerance, sweating, nervousness, and breathlessness could be due to hyperthyroidism. However, the episodic nature tied specifically to social situations and the absence of other systemic signs like weight loss, tremor, or ophthalmopathy reduce its likelihood. Thyroid function tests would clarify this.\n5. Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma\nJustification: Catecholamine-secreting tumors can cause episodic sweating, heat sensations, and nervousness. Nonetheless, the specific social triggers and the pattern of symptoms suggest a primary psychiatric cause rather than an endocrine tumor. This diagnosis is lower in probability but remains a differential to consider if physical symptoms persist or are unresponsive.\nSTOP HERE. Do not add notes, recommendations, or additional text.",

    "output": "THINKING: Applying systematic clinical reasoning to the case:\n- The episodic nature of heat sensations, sweating, nervousness, dizziness, and fear of fainting strongly suggests panic attacks.\n- The triggers bei\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: The patient's sudden episodes of heat, sweating, nervousness, dizziness, and fear of fainting are classic panic attack symptoms. The episodes are episodic, with a clear trigger (social situations), and cause significant functional impairment. These features strongly support panic disorder as the primary diagnosis, especially with the sudden onset and associated physical sensations.\n2. Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: The episodes are predominantly triggered in social settings involving new people, and the patient reports avoiding social interactions, suggesting social anxiety. The social context as the main precipitant makes social phobia a prominent diagnosis, often overlapping with panic attacks in social situations.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\nJustification: While chronic worry might be present, the primary features described are episodic and specifically triggered by social interactions. GAD typically involves more persistent, diffuse worry rather than discrete attacks, making it less likely the main diagnosis but still relevant as a comorbidity.\n4. Diagnosis: Specific Phobia (Social type)\nJustification: The patient's avoidance and heightened anxiety specifically around social settings point toward a specific social phobia. However, since panic attacks and physiological symptoms are prominent, social phobia alone is less comprehensive, thus ranking below social anxiety disorder.\n5. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: The physical sensations resemble hyperadrenergic states seen in hyperthyroidism, but the episodic, situationally triggered pattern, especially with fear of fainting and avoidance behaviors, makes a primary psychiatric cause more probable. No mention of other hyperthyroid signs such as weight loss, tremors, or heat intolerance shifts suspicion away from this diagnosis.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)\nJustification: The patient's episodes are mostly triggered by social interactions, especially with new people or group settings, which is characteristic of social anxiety disorder. Avoidance behaviors, fear of social embarrassment, and physical symptoms like sweating and nervousness support this. The symptoms' episodic nature and focus on social situations reinforce this diagnosis as the primary.\n2. Diagnosis: Panic Disorder\nJustification: The episodes involving fear of passing out, dizziness, sweating, and nervousness resemble panic attacks, which can be triggered or occur unexpectedly. The patient's report of episodes possibly happening outside social contexts suggests panic attacks may be part of the clinical picture, especially if episodes are sudden and intense.\n3. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)\nJustification: Chronic anxiety about social situations, with physical symptoms such as sweating and dizziness, could indicate GAD, particularly given the one-year duration. However, the prominence of social triggers favors a more specific social anxiety diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Vasovagal Syncope\nJustification: While episodes include dizziness and fear of passing out, the absence of clear triggers like orthostatic changes or prolonged prodrome makes vasovagal syncope less likely, but it remains a differential considered mainly if episodes are vasodepressive.\n5. Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism\nJustification: Symptoms like heat sensations and sweating could suggest hyperthyroidism; however, without other systemic signs (weight loss, tachycardia, tremors), it is less probable.
