Diagnosis: Lymphoma (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin)\nJustification: The patient's prominent systemic B symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), persistent lymphadenopathy in neck and groin, and recent onset of fatigue are classic features of lymphoma. The pattern of generalized lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms strongly suggests a lymphoid malignancy. The two-week duration indicates an active, possibly aggressive process, aligning with lymphoma's typical presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis\nJustification: Persistent lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms and weight loss could suggest TB, especially in endemic areas. Night sweats are also common in TB. However, TB lymphadenitis is usually associated with exposure history or risk factors; without such data, it's suspected but less probable than lymphoma.\n3. Diagnosis: HIV-associated lymphadenopathy\nJustification: HIV infection can cause generalized lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and systemic symptoms. The night sweats and lymphadenopathy fit with acute or early HIV-related immune activation, especially if other risk factors are present. Still, the clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma, which is common as an AIDS-related malignancy, making this secondary consideration.\n4. Diagnosis: Autoimmune disorder (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus)\nJustification: Autoimmune diseases can produce lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and systemic symptoms, but the significant weight loss and night sweats are less typical. Autoimmune lymphadenitis usually presents with additional features such as rash, joint symptoms, or serologic markers, which are not detailed here.\n5. Diagnosis: Other infectious causes (e.g., infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus)\nJustification: These infections can cause lymphadenopathy, fever, fatigue, and night sweats, especially in young adults.

Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (extrapulmonary)\nJustification: TB can present with systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy (especially in the neck, calledscrofula).

The presence of lymphadenopathy in cervical and inguinal regions raises concern for a lymphoproliferative disorder, such as Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The symptom pattern (night sweats waking him soaked and feeling cold) is characteristic of lymphoma. The progressive nature over two weeks with constitutional symptoms supports this consideration. There is no evidence yet pointing strongly toward infection or other neoplastic processes; the constellation is suggestive of lymphoma. - Complete symptom profile: systemic symptoms including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, and frequent night sweats. - Timeline and progression: symptoms developed over two weeks with increasing severity.",

The night sweats waking him soaked and cold support a constitutional B symptom often associated with lymphoma or other hematologic malignancies. The presence of lymphadenopathy in cervical and inguinal regions strengthens the suspicion. Differential diagnoses such as infections (e.g., tuberculosis), other malignancies, or autoimmune conditions are less likely given the systemic profile and lymphadenopathy, but cannot be entirely excluded without further testing. The symptom constellation aligns strongly with lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, given the B symptoms and lymphadenopathy. - Complete symptom profile: systemic symptoms including fatigue, weakness, unintentional weight loss, low-grade fever, night sweats (possibly almost nightly), and lymphadenopathy in cervical and inguinal regions. - Timeline and progression: symptoms have developed over two weeks, with systemic signs possibly worsening or persistent.",
