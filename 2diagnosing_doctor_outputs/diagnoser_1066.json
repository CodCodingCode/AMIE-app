    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a soccer player presenting with redness, swelling, and tearing of the eye that began two days ago. The recent activity and symptoms suggest possible ocular trauma or infection. Common diagnoses to consider include conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion or foreign body, trauma-related injury, or eyelid infection. Less likely but critical possibilities include orbital cellulitis or intraocular foreign body. The timing and triggers lean toward trauma-related causes, but infectious conjunctivitis remains common. Given the limited data, I prioritize diagnoses accordingly.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis Justification: Redness, tearing, and swelling are hallmark signs; common in young active individuals, especially with exposure to environmental irritants or infectious agents.  2. Diagnosis: Corneal foreign body Justification: Recent soccer activity increases risk of ocular trauma, which can introduce a foreign body causing redness and tearing.  3. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion Justification: Trauma during sports can cause superficial corneal injury, presenting with redness, tearing, and discomfort.  4. Diagnosis: Eyelid abscess or cellulitis Justification: Swelling and redness could represent infection of eyelid tissues, especially if trauma created an entry point for bacteria.  5. Diagnosis: Traumatic hyphema Justification: Trauma from sports may cause bleeding into the anterior chamber, leading to ocular redness and swelling; less common but important to consider.  6. Diagnosis: Orbital cellulitis Justification: Though less likely without systemic signs, the swelling could reflect deeper infection following trauma, especially if progression occurs.  7. Diagnosis: Intraocular foreign body Justification: With trauma and persistent symptoms, intraocular foreign bodies must be considered; can cause redness and tearing.  8. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: Less likely without systemic or pain findings, but ocular inflammation can present with conjunctival injection.  9. Diagnosis: Herpes simplex keratitis Justification: Usually presents with pain, photophobia, and dendritic corneal ulceration, but trauma may predispose to viral reactivation.  10. Diagnosis: Acute angle-closure glaucoma Justification: Rare given the presentation, but ocular trauma can sometimes precipitate secondary glaucoma; relies on pain, visual changes, not specified here.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a three-week history of fatigue, palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck and axillary regions, skin rash, intermittent fevers, and ocular redness with a foreign-body sensation. While the patient describes these as moderate and bothersome, the communication pattern suggests that the actual physical findings such as lymph node size, tenderness, or systemic symptom severity may be more pronounced than reported. Additional clinical assessment is needed to evaluate lymph node characteristics, identify other systemic features like night sweats or weight loss, and perform relevant laboratory and imaging studies to determine the underlying etiology.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is an adult with a three-week history of fatigue, palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck and axillary regions, skin rash, intermittent fevers, and ocular redness with a foreign-body sensation. These symptoms suggest a systemic condition involving immune activation or lymphoid pathology. The combination of lymphadenopathy, fever, rash, and ocular symptoms raises concern for infectious, autoimmune, or hematologic causes. Given the duration and multisystem involvement, autoimmune processes like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and infectious causes such as viral infections need consideration. The physical findings, especially palpable lymph nodes and skin and eye involvement, are key in narrowing differential diagnoses. Elevated suspicion for \"can't miss\" diagnoses like lymphoma or infectious mononucleosis is essential. The ranking will be based on commonality, systemic features, and severity.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Justification: Features such as skin rash, ocular redness, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue are characteristic of SLE, an autoimmune disease that often presents with multisystem involvement including skin, joints, and mucous membranes. The presence of skin rash and ocular symptoms suggests immune-mediated pathology.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV infection) Justification: Fever, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and possibly sore throat and splenomegaly are typical of EBV-related infectious mononucleosis, common in adults, with these features fitting the timeline.  3. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin) Justification: Persistent lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like fever, and possibly a skin rash could point toward lymphoid malignancy; these are crucial \"red flag\" diagnoses to exclude.  4. Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection Justification: Similar to EBV, CMV can cause febrile illness with lymphadenopathy, rash, and eye symptoms, especially in immunocompromised patients; less common but plausible.  5. Diagnosis: Drug reaction or Drug-Induced Lymphadenopathy Justification: If recent medication exposure is present, drug hypersensitivity reactions can cause lymphadenopathy, rash, and systemic symptoms.  6. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis Justification: This granulomatous disease often involves lymphadenopathy, skin rash, and ocular involvement; common in adults.  7. Diagnosis: Secondary Syphilis Justification: Can present with generalized lymphadenopathy, rash, and ocular signs; important to consider in sexually active adults.  8. Diagnosis: Allergic or Immune-Mediated Skin Conditions Justification: While less systemic, allergic dermatitis or other immune skin conditions could explain rash and ocular redness, but less likely to cause prolonged systemic symptoms.  9. Diagnosis: Viral Hepatitis or other viral infections Justification: Some hepatitis viruses can cause systemic symptoms including lymphadenopathy and rash, although less characteristic.  10. Diagnosis: Tuberculosis (Extrapulmonary) Justification: TB can cause persistent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms; skin and ocular involvement are less typical but possible in disseminated disease.",

    "input": "Patient presents with eye symptoms including redness, swelling, and tearing. Symptoms began approximately 2 days ago after playing soccer.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient presents with recent onset of eye redness, swelling, and tearing after playing soccer, which suggests an acute ocular condition likely related to trauma, infection, or inflammation. The recent activity and timing point toward an injury or infectious process initiated by physical activity. Key features include the acute onset, post-physical exertion, and symptoms indicating ocular surface or anterior segment involvement. Differential diagnoses are narrowed by symptom pattern: conjunctivitis, corneal injury, or uveitis are typical considerations. The lack of systemically severe symptoms or vision changes reduces the likelihood of more serious posterior segment issues.  Refined priorities: 1. Conjunctivitis or acute conjunctival inflammation \u2014 common, likely post-exposure, causes redness, tearing, and swelling. 2. Corneal abrasion or minor trauma \u2014 playing soccer could cause minor injury, explaining redness, tearing, swelling. 3. Viral or bacterial keratitis \u2014 less common without more symptoms but possible if trauma introduces infection. 4. Uveitis \u2014 less likely given rapid onset post-activity, but cannot be excluded. 5. Allergic conjunctivitis \u2014 less probable given the activity-related onset without prior allergy history.  Ranking based on likelihood given the recent activity and symptoms: - The injury-related conditions (conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion) are more probable than intraocular or immune-mediated conditions.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Corneal abrasion or minor trauma Justification: The acute onset following playing soccer suggests mechanical injury to the cornea; redness, tearing, and swelling are common signs of corneal epithelial compromise, especially after sports activities involving physical contact or risk of blunt trauma.  2. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis (viral or bacterial) Justification: The symptoms of redness, tearing, and swelling are characteristic of conjunctival inflammation; recent physical activity might facilitate pathogen exposure or contribute to irritation, making conjunctivitis highly probable.  3. Diagnosis: Keratitis (viral or bacterial corneal infection) Justification: Although less common without significant pain or vision change, minor trauma can introduce pathogens causing keratitis; symptoms align with superficial corneal involvement, especially if the trauma facilitated infection.  4. Diagnosis: Uveitis Justification: While less likely given the brief symptom duration and absence of other signs such as pain or photophobia, uveitis can cause redness and swelling, warranting consideration if other causes are ruled out or symptoms evolve.  5. Diagnosis: Allergic conjunctivitis Justification: Less likely primary cause given recent activity and lack of allergy history; however, swelling and tearing are compatible features, so it remains in differential but lower priority.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult presenting with a three-week history of persistent fatigue, enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the neck and axillae, a non-itchy, red, and blotchy rash on the chest and arms, and intermittent systemic fevers. He reports his fatigue has been uniform and worse in the mornings. He also describes occasional redness and a foreign-body sensation in the eye but minimizes discomfort or visual disturbance. Due to communication hesitancy and anxiety, physical examination and further assessment are necessary to determine if there are more significant findings such as lymph node enlargement or eye involvement. Objective findings may include enlarged, firm lymph nodes and signs of conjunctival or eyelid redness not fully expressed by the patient. Further investigation should include detailed examination of the lymphatic and ocular systems, along with laboratory testing to evaluate for infectious, immune, or hematologic causes.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of persistent fatigue, lymphadenopathy (enlarged, tender lymph nodes), and a non-itchy rash, along with systemic features like intermittent fever, suggests a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The eye symptoms, although mild, indicate possible mucocutaneous or ocular involvement. The duration (three weeks) and constellation of symptoms point toward conditions involving immune activation or infiltration, such as infectious, autoimmune, or hematologic diseases. The prominent lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms raise suspicion for lymphoproliferative or autoimmune conditions. The rash's nature and systemic features help differentiate among possibilities such as infections, autoimmune syndromes, hematologic malignancies, or granulomatous diseases.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis Justification: The presentation of systemic fatigue, enlarged tender lymph nodes, and a non-itchy, erythematous, blotchy rash is characteristic; sarcoidosis commonly involves granulomatous inflammation affecting skin, lymph nodes, and eyes. Eye involvement with redness and foreign-body sensation aligns with ocular sarcoidosis. The three-week duration with persistent systemic and localized symptoms suggests ongoing granulomatous inflammation typical of sarcoidosis.  2. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis (EBV) Justification: The systemic symptoms including fatigue, fever, and tender lymphadenopathy fit with infectious mononucleosis. The rash, though less typical, can occur especially in the context of a viral exanthem. Ocular symptoms are less typical but possible. The subacute presentation over three weeks is consistent; however, the skin rash and specific lymph node tenderness are more characteristic of sarcoidosis.  3. Diagnosis: Lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma) Justification: The firm, enlarged lymph nodes and systemic symptoms such as fever and fatigue raise suspicion for lymphoma. The rash could be a paraneoplastic manifestation or secondary to immune dysregulation. The duration and systemic involvement fit with lymphoma, which often presents with B symptoms and lymphadenopathy.  4. Diagnosis: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Justification: SLE can present with constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, and ocular manifestations. The non-itchy rash may be a malar or discoid rash, and the eye symptoms could reflect conjunctivitis or scleritis. Although SLE often involves other findings like joint pain or serositis, early systemic features can be varied.  5. Diagnosis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Justification: GPA involves granulomatous inflammation affecting the respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. The ocular redness and systemic symptoms could fit, especially with mucocutaneous involvement. However, absence of nasal or pulmonary symptoms makes this less probable than the top differentials but still worth considering.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is an adult male presenting with a three-week history of persistent fatigue that appears more severe upon thorough clinical evaluation. He exhibits enlarged, firm, and tender lymph nodes in the neck and axillary regions, which are likely more prominent and possibly more tender than described. He reports a non-itchy, red, blotchy rash on the chest and arms, which may have increased in size or extent and could be more symptomatic than conveyed. Ocular symptoms include a sensation of debris or foreign body and mild redness in one eye, lasting about two weeks, without reported visual disturbances. Although the patient denies systemic symptoms like night sweats or weight loss, these may be underreported due to communication hesitancy. Physical examination and laboratory testing are necessary to assess the true extent of lymphadenopathy, skin involvement, and systemic illness; additional ocular evaluation should be conducted to characterize eye findings more precisely.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation of persistent fatigue, enlarged tender lymph nodes, a non-itchy red rash, and ocular symptoms suggests a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The lymphadenopathy pattern, with involvement of cervical and axillary regions, and skin findings point toward a reactive or infectious etiology rather than malignancy, considering the tender, firm nodes and acute symptoms. The ocular findings combined with systemic symptoms raise suspicion for conditions like infectious mononucleosis, autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or a viral exanthem with conjunctivitis.  The absence of night sweats or weight loss makes lymphoma less likely but not impossible. The skin rash and lymphadenopathy together, particularly if the rash is erythematous and blotchy, could be consistent with viral exanthems or autoimmune conditions. The ocular complaints could be secondary to conjunctivitis, uveitis, or inflammation associated with systemic autoimmune or infectious conditions.  Supporting evidence such as laboratory findings and physical exam details are pending, but based on clinical presentation, infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) is a leading consideration, given lymphadenopathy, fatigue, and pharyngeal involvement are hallmark features. Autoimmune diseases like SLE would typically involve other systemic signs and laboratory markers which are currently unspecified.  Excluding other conditions: malignancy is less likely without systemic \"B\" symptoms like significant weight loss or night sweats; an autoimmune process remains plausible but needs serologic confirmation.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate, based on typical features but confirmation is needed through labs (EBV serology, ANA, etc.). - Missing information: Laboratory results, detailed physical exam, ocular examination, and possible biopsy data. - Clinical coherence: The combined presentation can be explained by infectious mononucleosis or another viral syndrome with systemic effects. - Diagnostic criteria: Pending lab data, clinical features align with infectious mononucleosis, meeting CDC criteria.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Moderate certainty that infectious mononucleosis is the leading diagnosis. - Information sufficiency: Slightly insufficient; lab testing will clarify. - Risk tolerance: Reasonable to initiate further testing before definitive treatment. - Clinical urgency: Elevated but not emergent; confirmatory testing in a timely manner recommended.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No, moderate certainty due to pending labs. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No, pending serology and physical exam details.\nANSWER: Infectious mononucleosis <If both checklist items are 'Yes', append 'END' to signify diagnostic conclusion>",
