    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with subjective complaints of an abnormal sensation of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and clicking in her knees during ambulation. She reports these symptoms as mild and gradually developed but may be underreporting accompanying pain, stiffness, or functional limitations. Her communication pattern suggests possible emotional distress or body image concerns that are not fully disclosed. Physical examination and further assessment are necessary to determine the extent of joint or connective tissue involvement, functional impairment, and emotional factors influencing her presentation.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young adult female with subjective sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and clicking in her knees, with a gradual onset, mild symptoms possibly underreported, and potential emotional distress. The presentation suggests possible connective tissue abnormalities, joint hypermobility, or functional/musculoskeletal issues. Differential diagnoses should prioritize common conditions related to joint sensation and clicking, as well as serious disorders that require prompt identification. Considering her demographics, symptoms, and subtle clues, I will rank based on likelihood and clinical importance.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Joint hypermobility syndrome (Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder) Justification: The sensations of joint instability and clicking suggest hypermobility; common in young females and often associated with subtle subjective complaints. The mild, gradually developing nature aligns with benign hypermobility.  2. Diagnosis: Temporomandibular joint disorder (related to generalized joint hypermobility) Justification: Musculoskeletal and joint sensation issues could reflect generalized joint dysregulation, with possible psychosocial contribution considering emotional distress.  3. Diagnosis: Benign joint hypermobility Justification: Common in young females; painless joint subluxations or clicking are typical, fitting her mild symptoms and gradual onset.  4. Diagnosis: Articular cartilage or labral tear (e.g., shoulder or knee) Justification: Clicking and abnormal sensations can also result from mechanical joint issues, although less likely given the absence of significant pain or trauma.  5. Diagnosis: Early osteoarthritis or cartilage degeneration Justification: Uncommon in young adults unless predisposed, but clicking can be related; however, typically presents with pain and stiffness, which are mild or absent here.  6. Diagnosis: Psychiatric or somatic symptom disorder Justification: The communication pattern hinting at emotional distress and body image concerns suggests psychosomatic components influencing perception of joint sensations.  7. Diagnosis: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a connective tissue disorder) Justification: Connective tissue disorder causing joint hypermobility, possible symptoms of joint sensation anomalies, though less likely without other systemic features.  8. Diagnosis: Osteonecrosis Justification: Rare in this age group with these symptoms; unlikely but important to consider if unexplained joint sensations persist.  9. Diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthritis Justification: Usually presents with pain, swelling, and stiffness; no such signs are described, making this less likely.  10. Diagnosis: Neurovascular or sensory neuropathy Justification: Sensory abnormalities could involve nerve issues; however, the localized joint sensations and clicking favor musculoskeletal origins over neurogenic causes.",

    "input": "A young adult female reports sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and audible clicking in her knees during ambulation. These symptoms are described as mild and developing gradually. Physical examination and further diagnostics are needed to evaluate for possible joint or connective tissue abnormalities. She may be experiencing underlying issues more significant than she reports, and emotional or body image factors could be influencing her presentation. Additional assessment is necessary to determine the presence of pain, stiffness, or functional impairment, as well as psychological factors that may impact her health.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient is a young adult female with sensation of collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and audible clicking in her knees during walking. Symptoms are mild, gradually developed, with physical exam and diagnostics needed. No mention of pain, swelling, or systemic symptoms. Possible causes include musculoskeletal, connective tissue, or psychological factors. Common causes like benign hypermobility syndromes are more likely, whereas serious conditions like ligamentous injuries or systemic connective tissue disorders need to be considered but appear less probable given the mild, gradual onset and absence of systemic features. Psychological or body image factors could also influence symptom perception. Prioritizing common and important diagnoses, from most to least likely:\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome Justification: Features include mild joint sensations and clicking, common in hypermobile individuals; often incidental and benign but can cause proprioception issues.  2. Diagnosis: Mild connective tissue laxity (e.g., mild Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) Justification: May present with generalized joint hypermobility, minor symptoms, and sensory abnormalities without significant systemic features.  3. Diagnosis: Temporomandibular or shoulder joint laxity-related disorder Justification: Absent sensations and clicking could reflect joint instabilities or laxity affecting sensory feedback; common in young females.  4. Diagnosis: Patellofemoral (knee) instability or mild patellofemoral syndrome Justification: Clicking and sensory disturbances during ambulation align with joint tracking issues; common in young active females.  5. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal strain or mild synovitis Justification: Gradual onset and mild symptoms could relate to overuse or mild inflammation; less likely given absence of pain or swelling.  6. Diagnosis: Psychological factors with somatic symptom features Justification: The mention of emotional or body image factors influencing presentation suggests somatic symptom disorder or related conditions.  7. Diagnosis: Early or mild form of connective tissue disorder (not specific) Justification: Non-specific symptoms may reflect early or atypical presentation of a systemic disorder.  8. Diagnosis: Osteoarthritis (unlikely at this age) Justification: Typically affects older individuals; unlikely given patient age and symptom profile.  9. Diagnosis: Rheumatologic disorder (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) Justification: No systemic symptoms or signs of inflammation reported, making this less probable.  10. Diagnosis: Structural abnormalities or congenital syndromes affecting bone/cartilage (e.g., congenital dysplasias) Justification: Less likely given gradual development of symptoms and lack of other congenital features.",

    "input": "A young adult female reports sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and audible clicking in her knees during walking or running, with symptoms described as mild and gradually developing. She expresses concern about her appearance and health, though she minimizes the severity of her symptoms and does not mention associated pain or stiffness. Physical examination and diagnostic evaluation are necessary to assess for potential joint or connective tissue abnormalities, with awareness that her psychological factors may influence her symptom reporting. Further inquiry into functional limitations, previous evaluations, and emotional state is recommended to fully elucidate her clinical picture.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's symptoms include sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and audible clicking in the knees during walking or running. She is young, has mild symptoms that developed gradually, and minimizes severity. She is concerned about her appearance and health but reports no pain or stiffness. These features suggest a possible connective tissue or joint abnormality, but psychological influence may also be relevant. Key considerations include benign joint hypermobility, connective tissue disorders, patellofemoral syndrome, subtle joint hyperlaxity, or somatic symptom disorder. The absence of pain and stiffness points away from inflammatory arthritis or degenerative joint disease. Her concern about appearance and symptom mildness points toward a functional or hypermobility-related condition rather than a severe underlying pathology.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Hypermobility Syndrome (Joint Hypermobility) Justification: The sensations of absent collarbones during shoulder movement and clicking in knees suggest generalized joint hypermobility. The gradual development of symptoms, mild presentation, lack of pain, and concern about appearance fit with hypermobility syndrome, which often manifests with proprioceptive feedback alterations and audible joint sounds, without significant structural damage.  2. Diagnosis: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Hypermobility Type Justification: As a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and fragility, this diagnosis aligns with the symptoms of joint hypermobility without severe systemic features. Though no skin or other systemic signs are reported, her concern about appearance and joint sensations support considering EDS hypermobility type.  3. Diagnosis: Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Justification: The clicking in knees during walking or running could reflect patellofemoral joint maltracking or instability. The symptom's activity-related nature and mild severity are consistent; however, absence of pain makes this less likely as a primary diagnosis, but it remains a possible contributing factor or secondary phenomenon.  4. Diagnosis: Somatic Symptom Disorder (functional symptomatology) Justification: Her concern about appearance and health, along with mild, gradually developing symptoms and the minimization of severity, may suggest a psychological or functional component. The sensations and clicks could be amplified or influenced by somatic focus, especially if no objective findings are present.  5. Diagnosis: Early Connective Tissue Disorder (Other than EDS) Justification: Mild signs suggest possible underlying connective tissue involvement without full-blown EDS. Variants or early manifestations could explain joint laxity and sensory phenomena without more systemic features.  STOP HERE.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with subjective sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movement and intermittent clicking in her knees during walking and running, sensations that have persisted for approximately two years. She reports these symptoms as mild and not associated with pain or stiffness, though her guarded and minimizing communication suggests potential underlying pathology may be more significant. No evidence of overt instability, swelling, or functional impairment has been noted based on the history. Further physical examination and diagnostic evaluation are warranted to assess for joint instability, connective tissue disorders, or structural joint abnormalities, with consideration of possible psychological influences on her symptom reporting.",
    "output": "THINKING: The patient's history of subjective sensations of absent collarbones during movement and intermittent clicking in the knees for two years, without pain or overt instability, suggests a possible underlying connective tissue or structural abnormality. The minimal symptoms and lack of pain point away from inflammatory or degenerative conditions. The description of sensations and clicks, combined with guarded communication, raises suspicion of a discreet structural or functional issue, possibly linked to connective tissue disorders such as benign hypermobility syndromes, or a benign positional/movement pattern. The absence of pain reduces the likelihood of inflammatory or degenerative joint conditions, and her age and symptom stability make severe systemic or autoimmune conditions less probable. The focus is on structural and connective tissue conditions, with consideration of psychological factors influencing symptom perception.\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Hypermobility Syndrome (Joint Hypermobility) Justification: The patient's sensations of absent collarbones and joint clicking without pain or instability are characteristic of hypermobility, especially when these symptoms are positional and asymptomatic otherwise. These features suggest generalized ligamentous laxity affecting joint stability and proprioception, fitting with benign hypermobility spectrum disorders.  2. Diagnosis: Structural Joint Abnormality (Congenital or Developmental Variations) Justification: The subjective feeling of \"absent\" collarbones may reflect an anatomical variation or developmental anomaly, such as clavicular dysplasia or congenital absence of certain ligaments, although less common. This could explain sensations without active pathology.  3. Diagnosis: Connective Tissue Disorder (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Hypermobility Type) Justification: While the symptoms are mild, the pattern of joint sensations and clicking could be early or mild manifestations of a connective tissue disorder affecting ligamentous integrity. Lack of pain and systemic features lessen likelihood but do not exclude.  4. Diagnosis: Functional or Psychogenic Movement/Perception Disorder Justification: Guarded communication and minimization of symptoms might suggest psychological factors influencing symptom reporting or perception. Certain functional syndromes can produce subjective sensations without structural findings.  5. Diagnosis: Early or Mild Osteoarthritis or Cartilage Wear Justification: Less likely given absence of pain, swelling, or stiffness, but intermittent clicking could represent early joint changes, though this is less probable considering the duration and mild symptoms.",

    "input": "The patient is a young adult female presenting with subjective sensations of her collarbones feeling absent during shoulder movements and intermittent clicking in her knees during walking and running, symptoms that have persisted for about two years. She reports that these sensations are mild, without associated pain, swelling, or instability, and describes the clicking as odd or loud at times. She also notes feeling her knees are sometimes loose during activity. Despite her guarded communication and minimization of symptoms, these signs may reflect underlying joint hypermobility or mild joint laxity, potentially associated with connective tissue laxity. There are no reported systemic features such as skin hyperelasticity, easy bruising, or systemic connective tissue disease signs. Given the communication pattern, her actual joint instability or laxity may be understated and warrants further physical examination and diagnostic evaluation to accurately assess joint stability and systemic involvement.",
    "output": "THINKING: Applying diagnostic closure reasoning, the patient's symptoms of mild, intermittent joint sensations, clicking, feelings of laxity, absence sensations in collarbones, and no systemic features suggest a connective tissue or joint hypermobility disorder. The guarded communication may underestimate severity, but the clinical presentation aligns with benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS), also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (hEDS) if criteria are met. The lack of systemic features and stability of symptoms over two years favor benign hypermobility rather than a systemic connective tissue disorder. Physical examination details are pending but necessary for confirmation. Alternative diagnoses like inflammatory or degenerative joint disease are less likely given the patient's age, symptom nature, and absence of systemic signs.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: Subjective sensations of absent collarbones during shoulder movements, intermittent knee clicking, feelings of knee looseness, no pain or swelling, no systemic features. - Timeline and progression: Symptoms have persisted for approximately two years with mild, non-progressive characteristics. - Clinical pattern recognition: Clues suggest joint hypermobility, connective tissue laxity, consistent with benign joint hypermobility syndrome. - Supporting evidence: Duration, pattern, absence of systemic features, subjective joint laxity signs. - Excluding alternatives: No evidence of inflammatory or degenerative joint pathology; systemic syndromes less likely due to lack of features.  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: Moderate confidence, supported by symptom pattern, timeline, and typical presentation; physical exam findings are pending and may increase confidence. - Missing information: Physical examination data on joint laxity, Beighton score, skin hyperextensibility. - Clinical coherence: The diagnosis explains the predominant joint sensations, clicking, and feelings of looseness without systemic abnormalities. - Diagnostic criteria: Pending examination, but initial features suggest clinical diagnosis compatible with BJHS/hEDS if criteria met.  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: Likely benign hypermobility syndrome; however, definitive diagnosis may require physical validation. - Information sufficiency: Adequate initial suspicion; further exam needed for confirmation. - Risk tolerance: Proceed with clinical suspicion and consider physical exam; no urgent intervention indicated. - Clinical urgency: No immediate urgency pending physical assessment.  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: No; further physical exam needed for confirmation. - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: No; physical exam will clarify.\nANSWER: Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (BJHS)",

    "output": "THINKING: The patient's presentation with recent onset redness, swelling, and tearing of the eye after playing soccer suggests an acute eye condition. The timing (2 days ago), the activity (soccer), and the specific symptoms point towards an eye injury or inflammation. Common causes include conjunctivitis, trauma-induced conjunctival reaction, or corneal injury. Conjunctivitis is less likely because of the trauma-related context and swelling. Trauma can cause subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasions, or eyelid injuries. Trauma is more consistent with recent sports activity and the sudden onset.  CLINICAL SYNTHESIS: - Complete symptom profile: eye redness, swelling, tearing starting 2 days ago after playing soccer - Timeline and progression: acute onset following physical activity, likely worsening or persistent - Clinical pattern recognition: injury-related presentation, possibly conjunctival or corneal trauma - Supporting evidence: recent activity involving physical contact or impact, swelling, tearing, redness consistent with possible trauma or injury - Excluding alternatives: conjunctivitis less likely without other infectious signs; systemic conditions less relevant given context  DIAGNOSTIC CONFIDENCE: - Certainty level: moderate to high; the scenario strongly suggests traumatic eye injury due to recent activity - Missing information: specific ocular examination findings (visual acuity, foreign body presence, fluorescein stain, intraocular pressure) - Clinical coherence: symptoms align with trauma-induced conjunctivitis or abrasion - Diagnostic criteria: not strictly formal, but clinical picture matches a trauma-related eye injury  CLOSURE ASSESSMENT: - Diagnostic clarity: most probable diagnosis is ocular trauma, possibly corneal abrasion or conjunctival injury - Information sufficiency: sufficient for presumptive diagnosis; further exam would clarify specifics but not necessary here - Risk tolerance: low; immediate management likely needed, but true diagnostic closure can be achieved based on the common presentation - Clinical urgency: prompt evaluation recommended, but diagnosis can be confidently made as trauma-related injury  Checklist: - No meaningful diagnostic uncertainty remaining: Yes, given typical presentation and context - No further clarification needed for primary diagnosis: Yes, current info sufficient to proceed with trauma management\nANSWER: Acute ocular trauma (likely corneal abrasion or conjunctival injury) END",
