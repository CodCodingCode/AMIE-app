Diagnosis: Acute ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)\nJustification: Classic presentation with sudden, heavy substernal chest pressure radiating to jaw and arm, associated diaphoresis and nausea, and onset during exertion are highly suggestive of MI, a common and critical cause in this age group.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)\nJustification: Similar symptoms without persistent ST elevation are possible; still urgent and life-threatening, with high prevalence in this demographic, and the presentation overlaps with STEMI.\n3. Diagnosis: Unstable Angina\nJustification: Chest pain with similar features but without evidence of myocardial necrosis; occurs in destabilized coronary plaques, common in this age group with risk factors, and can present similarly.\n4. Diagnosis: Aortic Dissection\nJustification: Severe chest pain radiating to the jaw/arm can occur; typically abrupt onset with a ripping or tearing quality, often associated with hypertension, which increases risk in this age group. Need for urgent differentiation.\n5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism\nJustification: While less typical, PE can present with chest discomfort, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and nausea, especially if the patient has underlying thrombosis risk factors; must be distinguished rapidly.\n6. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease or Esophageal Spasm)\nJustification: Chest pain radiating to jaw/arm can mimic ischemic pain; often related to meals or position, less likely but common enough for consideration.\n7. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain (Costochondritis or Muscular strain)\nJustification: Usually less severe, reproducible on palpation, and may have a more localized, stabbing quality; less likely given the severity and associated symptoms but commonly encountered.\n8. Diagnosis: Pericarditis\nJustification: Usually presents with pleuritic chest pain that improves when sitting up, but can occasionally mimic MI; typically associated with friction rub, not described here.\n9. Diagnosis: Panic Attack or Anxiety-Induced Chest Pain\nJustification: Can cause chest tightness, nausea, diaphoresis, but less likely with persistent pain radiating and during exertion, in a patient with risk factors for cardiac disease.\n10. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Ulcer or Esophageal Reflux\nJustification: Can cause substernal discomfort; typically non-radiating or less associated with exertion, but important to exclude in differential diagnosis.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nJustification: Persistent chest pressure radiating to jaw and arm, associated diaphoresis and nausea during exertion in a patient with possible prior episodes suggest acute MI, especially ST-elevation type needing urgent intervention.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\nJustification: Similar symptoms without mention of ST-elevation; the ongoing chest discomfort and risk factors favor unstable angina/ NSTEMI, both under acute coronary syndrome umbrella.\n3. Diagnosis: Unstable angina\nJustification: Recent episodic chest discomfort, worsening in severity and frequency, during exertion, with classical symptoms; may not have biomarker elevation but indicates high ischemic risk.\n4. Diagnosis: Stable angina\nJustification: Prior episodes suggest a pattern of exertional chest discomfort; if symptoms are now worsening or more frequent, it may be shifting toward unstable angina, but still relevant as a recognizable coronary artery disease marker.\n5. Diagnosis: Acute pericarditis\nJustification: Chest pressure and radiating pain could be pericardial in origin; however, the exertional trigger and associated symptoms favor ischemic causes. Less likely here but considered differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Esophageal spasm or GERD\nJustification: Chest discomfort radiating to jaw/arm can mimic cardiac ischemia; but the exertion trigger and autonomic features (diaphoresis, nausea) make this less likely initially.\n7. Diagnosis: Aortic dissection\nJustification: Chest pain radiating to the jaw/arm can involve the aortic arch, but usually with abrupt onset and often tearing quality; absence of such detail and no mention of radiation or pulse deficits reduces likelihood.\n8. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal chest pain\nJustification: Can cause exertional chest discomfort, but less likely given persistent, heavy, radiating nature during activity, associated autonomic symptoms which point more towards ischemia.\n9. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism\nJustification: Pleuritic chest pain might mimic heart pain, but usually associated with dyspnea, tachypnea, or risk factors; less likely based solely on presentation.\n10. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal causes (e.g., esophageal reflux)\nJustification: Can cause chest discomfort that radiates and is exertion-related; however, the presence of diaphoresis and nausea with exertion points more to cardiac ischemia.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\nJustification: The ongoing, severe substernal chest pressure radiating to jaw and arm with associated sweating and nausea strongly suggest an acute coronary event, especially with symptom onset during activity and escalation in severity, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n2. Diagnosis: Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\nJustification: Similar symptoms localized to chest and radiation, with recent episodic chest tightness, could represent unstable angina or NSTEMI, particularly without initial ST elevation if electrocardiogram were to be performed.\n3. Diagnosis: Unstable angina\nJustification: Recent episodes of milder chest tightness and current severe symptoms during exertion point toward unstable angina, which is part of acute coronary syndrome spectrum but may not yet show biomarker elevation.\n4. Diagnosis: Acute aortic dissection\nJustification: Chest pain radiating to jaw and arm, especially if described as tearing or severe, can be indicative of dissection; however, less likely without mention of tearing chest pain or differential pulse deficits, but remains in differential due to severity.\n5. Diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism\nJustification: Acute chest pain with radiation to arm and associated nausea could be consistent with PE, especially if risk factors are present; however, radiation pattern and prominent jaw pain are less typical.\n6. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nJustification: Chest pressure and nausea can be related to reflux, but in this context, the exertional onset and radiation to jaw/arm make this less likely as a primary cause.\n7. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal chest pain\nJustification: Possible, given the chest pressure, but less likely to be ongoing and severe in nature, especially with associated autonomic symptoms and radiation, making this a less probable primary diagnosis.\n8. Diagnosis: Pericarditis\nJustification: Chest pain that is pleuritic and positional, often sharp, may radiate, but the presentation here is more pressure-like, and radiation is more characteristic of cardiac ischemia.\n9. Diagnosis: Esophageal spasm\nJustification: Can cause chest pain radiating to the jaw or arms, but typically not associated with sweating or nausea, and often triggered by certain foods or swallowing.\n10. Diagnosis: Anxiety or panic attack\nJustification: Can cause chest tightness, nausea, and sweating; however, focal radiation and activity-related onset favor a cardiac etiology over a psychological one in this context.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (Myocardial Infarction/Unstable Angina)\nJustification: The patient exhibits classic signs of cardiac ischemia, including severe, pressure-like chest pain radiating to the jaw and left arm, with associated diaphoresis and nausea. The exertional component and progression from previous mild episodes strongly suggest worsening coronary ischemia, raising concern for an evolving heart attack. The absence of other prominent symptoms like dizziness does not exclude ACS. Given the presentation, this is the top priority diagnosis.\n2. Diagnosis: Stable Angina (Episodic Chest Tightness)\nJustification: The prior episodes of mild, self-resolving chest tightness indicate underlying ischemic heart disease. These episodes, occurring over the last one to two weeks, are consistent with stable angina that has recently worsened or become more frequent, hinting at disease progression. Recognizing this helps to understand the patient\u2019s baseline risk and the evolution towards an unstable state.\n3. Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\nJustification: Chest discomfort can sometimes mimic ischemic pain, especially if it radiates and is associated with meals or reflux symptoms. However, the exertional nature, radiation to jaw/arm, and associated diaphoresis favor a cardiac origin, making GERD a less likely but possible differential, particularly if initial cardiac workup is inconclusive or delayed.\n4. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain\nJustification: Musculoskeletal causes are common in chest pain but less likely here given the severity, radiation, and associated systemic symptoms. Nonetheless, if pain improves with rest and is reproducible on palpation, it could be considered, but current presentation aligns more with cardiac etiology.\n5. Diagnosis: Anxiety or Panic Attack\nJustification: Anxiety can cause chest tightness and discomfort; however, the presence of exertional pain with radiation and accompanying autonomic symptoms (sweating, nausea) points away from purely anxious causes. Still, it remains on the differential until cardiac causes are ruled out, especially if other diagnoses are not confirmed promptly.",

Diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (Unstable Angina / Myocardial Infarction)\nJustification: The severe, persistent chest pressure initiated during activity, radiating to the jaw and left arm, with accompanying diaphoresis and nausea, are classic features of cardiac ischemia. The progression from occasional mild symptoms to a more severe episode suggests worsening coronary artery occlusion, and the symptoms are highly suggestive of an acute coronary event requiring urgent evaluation.\n2. Diagnosis: Unstable Angina\nJustification: The patient reports previous mild episodes of chest tightness over the past 1-2 weeks that resolved on their own, indicating possible unstable angina. The recent escalation in symptom severity and persistence align with the criteria for unstable angina, which signals a higher risk of progression to infarction.\n3. Diagnosis: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)\nJustification: The clinical presentation is consistent with an evolving infarction, especially with ongoing severe symptoms. Although no mention of troponin levels is provided, the symptoms and history elevate suspicion for NSTEMI; further labs are needed. It is ranked second due to the potential for myocardial necrosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal Reflux or Esophageal Spasm\nJustification: While chest discomfort can stem from GI causes, the pattern of radiation, severity, and associated symptoms such as diaphoresis and nausea are less typical, but still plausible as differential diagnoses. They are considered less likely but should be evaluated, especially if cardiac workup is inconclusive.\n5. Diagnosis: Musculoskeletal Chest Pain\nJustification: Mild, self-resolving episodes could relate to musculoskeletal sources, such as costochondritis, but they are less likely to cause the severe, radiating, and associated systemic symptoms seen in the current episode.
