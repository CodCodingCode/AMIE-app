    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  \nJustification: The patient's feelings of being nervous around others, feelings of being \"off,\" and heightened anxiety during challenging or confusing tasks suggest a significant anxiety component. The symptom pattern of worse feelings at school or during demanding activities aligns with typical anxiety triggers. Additionally, feeling better with rest and engaging in enjoyable activities indicates that the anxiety may be situational and responsive to relaxation, consistent with GAD.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Depressive Disorder (Major Depressive Disorder or Subthreshold Depression)  \nJustification: The patient reports feeling upset and tired more than usual, which are hallmark features of depression. The sense of feeling \"weird in my head,\" reduced motivation, and difficulty functioning suggests a low mood state, possibly subclinical or mild depression. These symptoms often fluctuate and can worsen with stressors like school difficulties.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2013 Inattentive Type  \nJustification: Difficulties in understanding, feeling \"off,\" easy tiredness, and confusion are characteristic of attentional deficits and distractibility seen in ADHD.
