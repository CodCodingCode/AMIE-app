    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Strabismus (e.g., Esotropia or Exotropia)\n   Justification: The early onset of visual changes suggests a developmental eye alignment issue, often presenting as strabismus diagnosed in childhood.\n\n2.

Congenital Refractive Error (e.g., High Myopia or Hyperopia)  \nJustification: The onset in early childhood and difficulty focusing suggest a longstanding refractive error that was present early on and has progressively impacted vision.\n\n2. Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)  \nJustification: Early visual issues, particularly poor vision in one eye, combined with difficulty focusing and squinting, are classic signs of amblyopia, which develops when the brain favors one eye over the other during childhood.\n\n3. Strabismus  \nJustification: The presence of squint and visual focus difficulty points toward misalignment of the eyes, a common cause of visual disturbances and amblyopia development in childhood.\n\n4. Congenital Cataract  \nJustification: Visual impairment beginning early in life could be caused by a congenital lens opacity, which can cause poor focusing and hinder normal visual development.\n\n5. Retinal or Choroidal Abnormality (e.g., Coloboma or Retinal Dysplasia)  \nJustification: Developmental anomalies involving the retina or choroid can cause persistent visual issues from childhood, especially if associated with peripheral or central vision loss.\n\n6. Nystagmus  \nJustification: Continuous eye movements can impair focus and clarity, often associated with early-onset visual impairment, potentially linked with other congenital eye conditions.\n\n7. Anisometropia  \nJustification: Significant difference in refractive power between the two eyes can lead to poor focusing and amblyopia, especially if longstanding.\n\n8. Congenital Keratoconus or Corneal Dystrophy  \nJustification: Corneal irregularities present from early childhood can cause visual distortion and difficulty focusing, leading to frustration with reading and daily activities.\n\n9.

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Refractive Error (e.g., Myopia or Hyperopia)\nJustification: The patient's visual issues began in early childhood and have progressively worsened, suggesting a longstanding refractive error present since developmental years. Difficulty focusing, especially in dim light, and squinting behaviors align with uncorrected or poorly corrected hyperopia or myopia. Such conditions often cause sustained visual fatigue and discomfort, which might explain the \"weird\" tired feeling in the eye.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)\nJustification: The longstanding, uncorrected visual deficit in one eye since childhood is characteristic of amblyopia, which results in decreased visual acuity in one eye due to abnormal visual development. The difficulty seeing with the left eye, especially if it has not been properly corrected, corresponds with this diagnosis. The hesitance to go to unfamiliar places and frustration could stem from limited visual input affecting spatial awareness.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Strabismus (Esotropia or exotropia)\nJustification: The history of early childhood visual issues and difficulty focusing might suggest strabismus, which often coexists with refractive errors. Strabismus can cause amblyopia if untreated, and the patient's squinting may be a compensatory mechanism. Although not explicitly stated, the mention of visual difficulty and childhood onset raises suspicion.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Presbyopia (less likely but worth considering)\nJustification: Usually manifests in middle age, but since the patient has had visual worsening since childhood, presbyopia is less probable. However, as the eyes age, near focus difficulties can develop, exacerbating existing refractive conditions. Still, given the early onset, this is unlikely the primary cause.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Early-Onset Degenerative Eye Disease (e.g., Congenital Cataract or Retinal Abnormalities)\nJustification: Some congenital or developmental ocular conditions, such as congenital cataracts or retinal anomalies, can cause lifelong visual deficits. However, these are typically identified earlier or associated with other signs; the lack of mention of other ocular or systemic issues makes this less probable. Still, they remain considerations.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications as above:\n1. Congenital Refractive Error (Myopia or Hyperopia)\n2.

    "output": "THINKING:\n\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital or long-standing refractive error (e.g., anisometropia or astigmatism)\nJustification: The patient reports visual problems that began in early childhood, suggesting a congenital or longstanding issue. Difficulty focusing, especially in dim light, and failure to see clearly with the left eye are consistent with significant uncorrected refractive error. These issues often become more pronounced as visual demands increase with age and can lead to sustained discomfort and frustration with visual tasks.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Amblyopia (lazy eye)\nJustification: The history of longstanding visual impairment from childhood, particularly if unilateral and associated with strabismus or significant refractive asymmetry, raises the possibility of amblyopia. The fact that the patient experiences persistent visual difficulties despite no recent notable changes supports a longstanding developmental visual deficit that may not have been fully correctable.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Convergence insufficiency or binocular vision disorder\nJustification: The patient's reported difficulty focusing and squinting, especially in less well-lit conditions, suggests possible difficulties with binocular coordination or convergence. Such issues cause eye strain, fatigue, and hesitant reading, especially in challenging visual environments, and are common in patients with underlying refractive or accommodative disorders.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Early signs of an ocular or neurological pathology affecting visual pathways\nJustification: While less likely given the chronicity and lack of new neurological symptoms, persistent visual issues dating back to childhood prompt consideration of congenital or developmental optic nerve anomalies or cortical visual processing issues. Conditions such as optic nerve hypoplasia or cortical visual impairments could manifest as long-standing reduced clarity and focusing issues.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Early-onset structural abnormalities of the eye (e.g., corneal or lens disorders)\nJustification: Although less supported without recent changes, congenital abnormalities such as keratoconus, high astigmatism, or lens dislocation could cause longstanding visual impairment. The patient's difficulty focusing and squinting could be compensatory behaviors for such structural issues, especially if uncorrected during childhood.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1.

    "output": "THINKING:\n\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Esotropia (Infantile or Childhood-Onset Strabismus)  \nJustification: The patient's longstanding history dating back to early childhood suggests a congenital or early-onset strabismus, likely esotropia (esotropia is inward deviation). The difficulty with focusing, squinting, and persistent visual impairment in one eye points toward a longstanding ocular misalignment that was probably present since early development. The worsening or increased awareness over time is common as depth perception and binocular vision are compromised. The fact that he does not see clearly with the left eye indicates amblyopia, which is often associated with childhood strabismus.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Amblyopia (Lazy Eye)  \nJustification: The history of visual impairment from childhood with persistent poor vision in the left eye suggests amblyopia. This condition commonly develops when the brain suppresses input from one eye due to misalignment or refractive issues during early visual development. The patient's frustration with focusing and poor visual acuity supports this. Since amblyopia can persist if untreated, it explains ongoing difficulties despite normal visual structures on examination.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Refractive Error (Uncorrected Refractive Amblyopia)  \nJustification: The difficulty focusing in dim light and difficulty reading could reflect significant uncorrected refractive errors, especially hyperopia or astigmatism, contributing to his visual discomfort and accommodation challenges. These refractive issues, if not corrected early, can lead to amblyopia and persistent visual problems. The fact that his symptoms have worsened over time could partly be due to uncorrected refraction, which may not be fully compensating.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Convergence Insufficiency or Dysfunction  \nJustification: The patient's difficulty focusing and squinting may be related to dysfunction of convergence mechanisms, especially if he has exaggerated accommodative or vergence effort to maintain single vision. This correlates with his history of focusing problems and may contribute to eye strain and fatigue, especially in low-light situations.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Visual Processing or Focusing Disorder (possibly a Functional Vision Problem)  \nJustification: The described \"weird\" or tired sensation and difficulty with focusing might also be related to a higher-order visual processing or focusing disorder. While less likely the primary cause given his history, such issues can coexist with ocular misalignment, especially when longstanding visual deprivation has affected visual development.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n\n1. Congenital Esotropia (Childhood-Onset Strabismus) \u2014 The patient's early onset of visual problems since childhood strongly indicates congenital or early childhood esotropia, leading to persistent inward eye deviation and amblyopia if untreated.\n\n2. Amblyopia \u2014 The long-standing visual impairment in the left eye, along with poor visual acuity and frustration with focusing, suggests amblyopia resulting from years of uneven visual input and suppression due to strabismus.\n\n3. Refractive Error (Hyperopia or Astigmatism) \u2014 Uncorrected refractive errors likely contribute to difficulty focusing, especially in low-light conditions, and may have played a role in the development or persistence of amblyopia.\n\n4. Convergence Insufficiency/Dysfunction \u2014 Problems with eye teaming, especially in near tasks, could explain the patient's squinting, focusing issues, and visual fatigue, particularly seen in dim light or prolonged focus.\n\n5. Visual Processing or Functional Vision Disorder \u2014 The sensation of tiredness or \"weird\" eye feelings and focus difficulties may also involve higher-order visual processing issues, which can accompany longstanding ocular misalignments or developmental visual problems.\n\nThis refined list prioritizes true structural and functional causes related to early onset strabismus and amblyopia, addressing both primary eye alignment issues and associated refractive/functional problems.",
