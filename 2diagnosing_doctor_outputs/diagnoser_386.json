Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\nJustification: XY individual with testes and female phenotype due to defective androgen receptors; presents with primary amenorrhea, normal female external genitalia, and absence of internal female reproductive organs.\n\n3. Diagnosis: M\u00fcllerian Agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome)\nJustification: Normal ovarian function but absent or underdeveloped uterus and upper vagina; presents with primary amenorrhea despite normal secondary sex characteristics.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypothalamic or Pituitary Dysfunction\nJustification: Deficiencies in gonadotropin secretion (e.g., Kallmann syndrome) leading to absent pubertal development and primary amenorrhea.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Pharmacy or Medication-Induced Amenorrhea\nJustification: Certain medications or substances can suppress menstrual cycles; though less likely if the patient reports feeling \u201cweird\u201d without other exposures mentioned.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia\nJustification: Can cause primary amenorrhea with virilization; may present with ambiguous genitalia if severe, but some forms present only with amenorrhea.\n\n7.

She is otherwise tall for her age, which can be seen in Turner syndrome due to differential growth patterns.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome)  \nJustification: The delayed or absent secondary sexual characteristics along with primary amenorrhea suggest a deficiency in GnRH secretion or action, leading to low estrogen levels and absent puberty despite normal growth stature.\n\n3. Diagnosis: M\u00fcllerian Agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome)  \nJustification: Primary amenorrhea with normal external genitalia but absence of a uterus or upper vaginal structures could fit this diagnosis; however, other aspects like delayed secondary sexual development are less typical unless associated with primary ovarian failure.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) / Primary Ovarian Insufficiency  \nJustification: Although more common in older women, early ovarian failure can cause primary amenorrhea with underdeveloped secondary sexual features; however, the patient is young, making this less likely unless there is familial history.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete)  \nJustification: Patients have typical female external genitalia with absent or undeveloped secondary sexual characteristics despite normal or elevated androgens; however, typically they have normal or elevated testosterone levels and undescended testes.\n\n6. Diagnosis: Structural Mullerian Duct Anomaly (e.g., Rokitansky)  \nJustification: Similar to M\u00fcllerian agenesis, with absent uterus leading to primary amenorrhea; sexual development could be normal or delayed depending on associated ovarian function.\n\n7. Diagnosis: Delayed Pubertal Development Due to Psychosocial Factors  \nJustification: If psychological factors delay hormonal activation, secondary sexual characteristics may be delayed; however, primary amenorrhea and absence of sexual features point toward physiological causes.\n\n8. Diagnosis: Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism (e.g., Gonadal Dysgenesis)  \nJustification: Elevated gonadotropins indicate gonadal failure\u2014such as Turner syndrome or other gonadal dysgenesis\u2014leading to primary amenorrhea and delayed secondary sexual features.\n\n9. Diagnosis: Structural or functional hypothalamic or pituitary disorder  \nJustification: Central causes impair GnRH secretion, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, presenting with delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea.\n\n10.

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome)\nJustification: The patient exhibits primary amenorrhea, delayed secondary sexual characteristics with scant body hair, and normal growth in height\u2014consistent with low gonadotropin (LH and FSH) levels leading to insufficient estrogen production. Kallmann syndrome features a defect in GnRH neuron migration, resulting in absent or delayed puberty and anosmia, which could explain her \"weird\" feelings and delayed sexual development.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (45,X0)\nJustification: While Turner syndrome often presents with short stature, it can sometimes have a normal or near-normal adult height, especially if growth hormone therapy is used. Features include primary amenorrhea, streak ovaries, and delayed or absent secondary sexual characteristics. The little body hair and delayed development fit, though her height being normal is less typical. The absence of mention of webbed neck or other dysmorphic features makes this less certain, but it remains plausible.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)\nJustification: Complete AIS typically presents with phenotypically female external genitalia, scant pubic and axillary hair, and primary amenorrhea, with XY chromosomal makeup. While the vignette doesn\u2019t specify her chromosomal status, the features of minimal secondary sexual characteristics and primary amenorrhea align with AIS, especially if internal testes were present and estrogen levels low.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Gonadal Dysgenesis (e.g., Swyer Syndrome, 46,XY)\nJustification: XY individuals with gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome) often present with primary amenorrhea and sparse body hair due to gonadal failure, along with low sex steroid levels. They typically have normal or tall stature and absence of secondary sexual characteristics. The \"weird\" feeling could correspond to underdeveloped gonads producing insufficient hormones.\n\n5. Diagnosis: M\u00fcllerian Agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser Syndrome)\nJustification: Although this condition primarily involves congenital absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina, it typically features normal ovarian function and normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, including pubic hair.

    "output": "THINKING:\n1. Diagnosis: Turner's Syndrome (46, XO)\nJustification: The patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea, delayed secondary sexual characteristics, and absence of pubic or axillary hair suggests ovarian failure or hypogonadism. Turner's syndrome is a common cause of primary amenorrhea with streak ovaries, short stature, and characteristic physical features, although not all features may be evident. Height being similar to peers is somewhat atypical since Turner's syndrome is often associated with short stature, but variability exists. The lack of secondary sexual development indicates gonadal dysgenesis.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome)\nJustification: The patient has primary amenorrhea and delayed secondary sexual characteristics, along with feelings of \"weird\" and emotional symptoms (sad/nervous). Kallmann syndrome involves GnRH deficiency leading to absent or delayed puberty and anosmia or hyposmia, though anosmia is not specified. Emotional symptoms can accumulate due to hormonal deficiency. The normal height growth suggests normal growth hormone function, but delayed puberty indicates disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)\nJustification: AIS occurs in individuals with a 46, XY karyotype who are phenotypically female and have partially or completely unresponsive androgen receptors. They present with absent or minimal secondary sexual characteristics, primary amenorrhea, and scant body hair in androgen-dependent areas. Given the description of little hair development and no mention of ambiguous genitalia, partial AIS could be considered. However, confirmation would require karyotyping.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Turner-like syndromes or Mosaicism\nJustification: Other mosaic or partial deletions involving the X chromosome can cause similar features, such as primary amenorrhea with mixed or variable phenotype, including normal height in some cases. Since the physical features are not overtly described as classic Turner stigmata (e.g., webbed neck, shield chest), these remain considerations.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Gonadal Dysgenesis (Other than Turner's)\nJustification: Other forms of gonadal dysgenesis may lead to ovarian failure without the full spectrum of Turner stigmata, resulting in primary amenorrhea and delayed puberty. These are less common but still relevant, especially if chromosomal abnormalities are involved.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Turner's Syndrome (46, XO): Highly probable given primary amenorrhea, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, and potential gonadal dysgenesis. Even if height appears normal, phenotypic features or mosaicism could be present.\n2. Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome): Possible due to delayed puberty, primary amenorrhea, emotional symptoms, and intact growth potential; absence of secondary sexual development suggests GnRH deficiency.\n3. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): Considered based on scant body hair and primary amenorrhea; phenotypically female but karyotype typically 46, XY.\n4. Mosaic or Partial X chromosome deletions ( Turner spectrum): Can cause primary amenorrhea with variable physical features, including normal stature with gonadal dysgenesis.\n5. Gonadal Dysgenesis (Other forms): Other chromosomal abnormalities causing ovarian failure and delayed puberty, outside of classic Turner\u2019s, remain plausible.\n\nFurther testing, including pelvic ultrasound, karyotyping, and hormonal profiles, is needed to confirm the diagnosis.",

Although she reports feelings of being \"weird\" and has experienced growth in height similar to peers, individuals with Turner syndrome often have normal or near-normal stature as children but tend to have webbed neck, low-set ears, or cardiac anomalies\u2014features not noted here, but absence does not exclude diagnosis. Not having undergone genetic testing leaves open the possibility of a monosomy X.\n\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (Kallmann Syndrome)\nJustification: This condition involves defective GnRH secretion leading to absent pubertal development and primary amenorrhea. She has delayed secondary sexual characteristics but no mention of anosmia, which is characteristic of Kallmann syndrome. Mood changes like feeling \"weird\" and nervous could be related to hypogonadism. Normal growth suggests her growth plates are still open, and she might have recent-onset pubertal failure.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Gonadal Dysgenesis (e.g., Swyer Syndrome)\nJustification: The female with primary amenorrhea and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics may have gonadal dysgenesis, which involves dysgenic or streak gonads producing little to no sex steroids. She reports feeling \"weird\" and has minimal pubertal development. Her growth has been normal, which suggests her height is appropriate for her age, possibly due to delayed development rather than growth failure.\n\n4. Diagnosis: Turner Syndrome (Mosaic or Other Variants)\nJustification: While classic features are absent or subtle, mosaic Turner syndrome can present with milder or atypical features, including primary amenorrhea and subtle physical features. Without physical anomalies noted, this remains possible, especially given her clinical presentation.\n\n5. Diagnosis: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Complete)\nJustification: Typically presents in XY individuals with testes and female phenotype, but since she is genetically female (XX implied), this diagnosis is less likely. However, if she has unusual androgen receptor function, some features might be questioned, but her presentation more reliably fits ovarian failure or hypogonadism rather than androgen insensitivity.\n\nANSWER:\nRefined list of 5 probable diagnoses with detailed justifications:\n1. Turner Syndrome (45,X or mosaic variant) \u2013 Most probable given primary amenorrhea and delayed sexual development, typical features of Turner syndrome include gonadal dysgenesis leading to amenorrhea, with possible subtle or absent physical features in some cases.\n2.

Gonadal Dysgenesis (Swyer Syndrome) \u2013 Underdeveloped or streak gonads causing ovarian failure; presented with primary amenorrhea and minimal secondary sexual features.\n4. Mosaic Turner Syndrome \u2013 Less classic but possible given the phenotype and absence of overt physical anomalies; genetic mosaicism can result in variable expression.\n5. Other causes of primary ovarian insufficiency or delayed puberty, such as autoimmune gonadal failure or genetic factors, though less likely without more data.\n\nFurther testing such as karyotype analysis is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.",
