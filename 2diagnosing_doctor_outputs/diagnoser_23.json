Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: Common etiology of hyperandrogenism in young women presenting with hirsutism, amenorrhea or irregular menses, and metabolic symptoms; supported by the pattern of symptoms.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (non-classic)\nJustification: Can present in young women with hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities; often has a gradual onset and may be misdiagnosed as PCOS.\n3. Diagnosis: Ovarian androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Rapid onset or worsening of symptoms; typically more severe virilization signs, although less common in young women.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Similar to ovarian tumors, but adrenal masses may produce excess androgens leading to virilization; important to consider due to potential malignancy.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure\nJustification: Considered if there's history of androgen medication use or supplements; non-described in the vignette but relevant in differential.\n6. Diagnosis: Cushing's Syndrome\nJustification: Can involve hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularities; less likely without classic features such as purple striae or osteoporosis, but still a consideration.\n7. Diagnosis: Androgen-producing ovarian cysts\nJustification: Rare but possible cause of hyperandrogenism; typically associated with ovarian cysts seen on imaging.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperprolactinemia\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularities and fatigue; hyperandrogenic features are less direct but possible if associated with other endocrine disturbances.\n9. Diagnosis: Thyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism)\nJustification: Can cause menstrual irregularities and fatigue; rarely causes hyperandrogenism but should be considered in systemic evaluation.\n10. Diagnosis: Idiopathic hirsutism\nJustification: In some cases, hirsutism occurs without clear laboratory abnormalities; less likely given the presence of other symptoms like voice deepening and irregular menses.",

Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is the most common cause of hyperandrogenism in young women, presenting with menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and sometimes voice changes. The gradual onset over months aligns with typical PCOS presentation.\n2. Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: Rapid or progressive virilization (voice deepening) suggests a tumor secreting high levels of androgens; though less common, it must be considered due to her symptoms, especially if symptoms are worsening or pronounced.\n3. Diagnosis: Adrenal hyperplasia (congenital or acquired)\nJustification: Adrenal hyperplasia can produce excess androgens, leading to similar features; persistent symptoms over months and bilateral adrenal involvement can point toward this.\n4. Diagnosis: Idiopathic hirsutism\nJustification: Common in young women, presenting with androgen excess without other hormonal abnormalities; usually milder, but can cause significant hirsutism.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen use\nJustification: Although not mentioned, should be considered if patient is using supplements or medications containing androgens or anabolic steroids.\n6.

Diagnosis: Ovarian or adrenal neoplasm (benign or malignant)\nJustification: May produce androgens leading to virilization; less common, but critical to consider.\n8. Diagnosis: Hyperthecosis (a form of stromal ovarian hyperplasia)\nJustification: Causes severe virilization in younger women, with features like deepening voice; rare but relevant.\n9. Diagnosis: Adrenal carcinoma\nJustification: Rare but important to consider if elevated androgen levels are disproportionate and associated with other signs of malignancy.\n10. Diagnosis: Other rare causes of hyperandrogenism (e.g., familial male-limited precocious puberty or genetic syndromes)\nJustification: Unlikely in this case based solely on presentation, but residual considerations.",

Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-Classical)\nJustification: The presence of hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity can be seen in non-classical CAH, which develops gradually and can cause virilization signs. This is plausible in a young woman with evolving symptoms and increased androgen activity.\n3. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Ovarian Tumor\nJustification: The progressive virilization, including voice deepening and facial hair, suggests a possible androgen-secreting ovarian tumor, which typically presents with rapid or significant virilization; the subacute worsening over months can fit, though less common.\n4. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumor or Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Cortex Adenoma\nJustification: Signs of virilization could result from an adrenal tumor producing excessive androgens. The slow progression over months is plausible in some benign tumors, though these are often associated with more abrupt onset.\n5.

The progression of symptoms s\nANSWER: 1. Diagnosis: Androgen-Secreting Ovarian Tumor\nJustification: The patient exhibits signs of virilization (facial/body hair, deep voice) and irregular menses, over a relatively short period (six months). Ovarian tumors, such as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, are known to produce excess androgens leading to virilization. The rapid onset and progression strongly favor a neoplastic cause rather than a benign or functional disorder. This diagnosis best explains both the menstrual irregularity and the virilization changes.\n2. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (Non-classic Form)\nJustification: This condition can present in young women with androgen excess and menstrual disturbances, sometimes developing gradually. Though more common earlier in life, non-classic adrenal hyperplasia can manifest in adolescence or early adulthood with signs of virilization, especially if untreated or undiagnosed. The gradual progression supports this possibility, although rapid virilization is less typical unless an adrenal crisis occurs.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is a common cause of irregular menses and hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism and mild virilization. However, severe voice deepening is less characteristic. Nonetheless, given the menstrual irregularity and androgen features, PCOS remains a plausible, although less likely, diagnosis.\n4. Diagnosis: Ovarian Hyperthecosis\nJustification: This is a rare condition involving diffuse luteinization of ovarian stroma, leading to increased androgen production, causing virilization and menstrual irregularity. It can present in young women and explain progressive virilization features.\n5. Diagnosis: Adrenal Tumor/Hyperplasia\nJustification: Adrenal sources of androgen excess can cause virilization and menstrual disturbances, particularly if an androgen-secreting tumor or hyperplasia exists. Although less common than ovarian causes, it remains a possibility, especially if initial evaluation points toward adrenal involvement.\nSTOP HERE.",

Diagnosis: Androgen-secreting ovarian tumor\nJustification: The rapid onset (6 months) of virilizing features such as facial and body hair growth, voice deepening, and increased skin oiliness strongly suggests an androgen-secreting tumor, most commonly ovarian. These tumors can produce high levels of testosterone, leading to prominent virilization. The relatively quick progression over six months favors this diagnosis over other chronic causes. The patient's age aligns with ovarian tumors that can present hormonally active.\n2. Diagnosis: Adrenal androgen-secreting tumor\nJustification: Similar to ovarian tumors, adrenal tumors can produce excess androgens resulting in virilization. The six-month history and severe features could be explained by an adrenal carcinoma or adenoma secreting androgens. The clinical picture aligns with this possibility, especially if tumor localization or hormone levels support adrenal origin.\n3. Diagnosis: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nJustification: PCOS is a common cause of irregular menses and mild androgen excess, often presenting with hirsutism and skin oiliness. However, the rapid development and severe virilization points less toward PCOS, which usually causes gradual, milder symptoms. It remains a differential consideration but is lower in likelihood given the clinical severity and quick progression.\n4. Diagnosis: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)\nJustification: CAH, especially 21-hydroxylase deficiency, can cause virilization and menstrual irregularities. However, this condition typically presents in childhood or early adolescence, and features tend to include salt-wasting crises or adrenal insufficiency. Its presentation at age 22 with rapid virilization over six months is less typical, making it a less probable diagnosis.\n5. Diagnosis: Exogenous androgen exposure\nJustification: External androgen intake can cause virilization, but typically, patients or their environment are aware of such exposure. No information suggests external androgen use, making this less likely in this case. It's included for completeness but is a lower probability.\nSTOP HERE.",
