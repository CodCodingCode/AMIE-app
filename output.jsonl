As a passenger in a rear-ended vehicle, he experienced multiple impacts causing his right index finger to hyperextend. Since the injury, he has been unable to make a fist due to pain and swelling, describing a pulling and tearing sensation exacerbated by activities such as driving. He has worn a splint and undergone physical and occupational therapy without significant improvement. An MRI performed in April 2021 revealed focal soft tissue swelling over the right index metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, a partial-thickness tear of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon, and tenosynovitis around the flexor tendons; however, the radial and ulnar collateral ligaments, MCP joint capsule, and extensor tendons were intact. Physical examination showed the right index finger resting in approximately 10 degrees of PIP joint flexion with discomfort on passive extension, slight sensory diminution over the PIP joint, no swelling or ecchymosis, and preserved pulses. X-rays were unremarkable. The clinical picture is consistent with post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis causing impaired tendon excursion. Given his allergies to dexamethasone (palpitations) and methylprednisolone (itching), a trial of a betamethasone (Celestone) corticosteroid injection was attempted but complicated by significant procedural pain and a minor palmar vein bleed; nevertheless, the patient was reassured and instructed on icing and NSAIDs.

The lesion, initially noticed by her mother during a visit last month, was biopsied by her dermatologist on April 10th and confirmed as invasive superficial spreading melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 0.7 mm, Clark level 4, and no ulceration or mitotic activity. She has no personal history of atypical nevi and has undergone annual mole checks by her primary care provider but had never previously seen a dermatologist. Family history is significant for melanoma in her mother and maternal aunt, and pancreatic cancer in her maternal grandfather. Sophia’s past medical history is unremarkable aside from prior cholecystectomy and appendectomy, and she is a current smoker attempting cessation. On physical exam, the biopsy site measured 1 cm with no residual pigmentation or satellite lesions, and no suspicious moles elsewhere. A soft, nontender right inguinal lymph node was noted, prompting recommendation for ultrasound to exclude metastatic involvement. The peripheral biopsy margin was positive, while the deep margin was negative. The patient was counseled on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options, including wide local excision with 1-2 cm margins, with primary closure anticipated but skin grafting possible. Emphasis was placed on sun protection, skin self-examination, and adherence to NCCN follow-up guidelines. After discussion, Sophia expressed understanding and agreed to proceed with the planned management.", "output": ""}

She has been on progesterone therapy to regulate menstruation, which was effective, and continues weekly use of vaginal cream to manage associated itching and discomfort. Her gynecologic history includes an abnormal pap smear in 2009 with subsequent normalization, and a normal pap smear in 2019; a repeat pap smear was performed during this visit and found to be normal. Donna reports a history of significant anxiety exacerbated in late 2021, attributed to work-related stress supporting COVID-19 evaluation centers and clinics, as well as possible medication effects from Singulair, which she is currently taking alongside Buspar, the latter effectively controlling her anxiety. She discontinued Camila birth control, noting a prior increase in appetite that has since resolved, with weight loss over the past six months. Physical examination revealed stable breast density without significant changes in cyst size, and no new concerning findings. Given her family history of breast cancer (mother deceased at 45 from breast cancer) and ongoing breast cyst surveillance, she was referred to a breast specialist for further assessment, including potential ultrasound evaluation. The plan includes continued close monitoring of breast cysts, routine gynecologic screening, and maintenance of current anxiety management.", "output": ""}

Despite attempts to manage symptoms at home, she sought emergency care after 4 days. Cardiac workup including EKG and labs was normal, and no medications were prescribed. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously about 3 days after the emergency visit and have not recurred since. She denies weight changes, abdominal pain, or bowel disturbances and reports a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia, as well as cholecystectomy. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants without other abnormalities. Given her asymptomatic status and normal cardiac evaluation, differential diagnoses include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal pain, and anxiety. The clinical impression favors an anxiety-related etiology possibly compounded by musculoskeletal factors, especially considering the temporal association with job-related stress. After discussing the option of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), the patient opted for symptom monitoring with plans to pursue endoscopy only if symptoms recur. She was advised to self-monitor and follow up as needed.", "output": ""}

The pain, described as sharp, shooting, and stabbing, worsens with activity and wrist extension, rated up to 8/10 during use and 3/10 at rest. He attributes the symptoms to increased tennis play after a recent surge in activity. Physical examination reveals moderate tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, pain with passive elbow range of motion, and mild pain with resisted wrist extension, without joint effusion. Cardiovascular exam notes a stable grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Right elbow X-rays show no fracture, malalignment, or effusion. His diabetes is suboptimally controlled with blood sugars around 150-160 mg/dL despite metformin 500 mg twice daily; asthma remains well controlled on Flovent and albuterol as needed. The diagnosis of acute lateral epicondylitis is made, likely due to overuse from tennis. Management includes cessation of tennis for 4-6 weeks, use of ice, a forearm brace, and Ultram 50 mg daily for pain. Diabetes management is intensified by increasing metformin to 1000 mg twice daily with home glucose monitoring and laboratory evaluation (HbA1c, CBC, Chem-12). Asthma treatment remains unchanged with a refill of albuterol provided. The patient understands and agrees with the plan and will follow up in four weeks for reassessment and consideration of further imaging or physical therapy.", "output": ""}

Since her last visit in mid-September, she reports overall improvement and feels better, though she continues to experience intermittent chest pain and episodes of shallow breathing that last a few minutes and recur every few weeks. She manages these symptoms by reducing exertion during episodes, which typically resolve without intervention. Physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation, a slightly accentuated S1, no S3 heart sound, clear lung auscultation despite reduced breath sounds, no jugular venous distension, and trace peripheral edema in the extremities. An ECG performed in late December shows atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and anterior T-wave inversion, stable compared to prior studies. She is maintained on Coumadin 4 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily, and Atenolol 50 mg daily, with good medication adherence aided by a reminder app. There are no new cardiac symptoms or signs of decompensation. The plan is to continue current medical management, encourage activity within tolerance, and schedule the next follow-up in 6 to 9 months.", "output": ""}

She is currently maintained on methotrexate and a low dose of prednisone (1 mg daily), which she reports has effectively controlled her joint pain. Since her last visit, she has successfully tapered prednisone from higher doses but occasionally increased it to 2 mg for brief periods due to episodic bilateral foot pain, especially after days of increased activity. Ms. Gomez described a notable adverse reaction when she held methotrexate around the time of her first COVID-19 vaccine, experiencing significant malaise until resuming the medication; however, she did not hold methotrexate for the second dose. On examination, she has full musculoskeletal range of motion but exhibits dystrophic changes in all toenails consistent with psoriasis. She also reports easy bruising, likely related to prednisone use. The plan is to discontinue prednisone entirely while continuing methotrexate, with close monitoring through scheduled blood work and follow-up in three months.

She describes the pain as a deep, achy sensation localized to the posterior aspect of her patellae, accompanied by crepitus but no swelling or redness. The pain worsens with activities involving knee flexion such as rising from a seated position and stair climbing, and improves with rest. An avid runner, Sophia reports a significant reduction in her running tolerance from 5–6 miles daily to less than half a mile due to pain. Physical examination reveals normal gait, tenderness over the bilateral retinacula, a positive patellar grind test, and knee pain with squatting; strength testing shows 3/5 abduction bilaterally with otherwise normal lower extremity strength. Ligamentous tests including Lachman, anterior/posterior drawer, and McMurray are negative, and reflexes are symmetrical. Bilateral knee X-rays show no fractures or osteoarthritis. Based on clinical findings and imaging, she is diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome. The management plan includes conservative treatment with formal physical therapy focusing on strengthening, mobility, and running mechanics correction, activity modification with temporary reduction in running, and intermittent use of NSAIDs for pain control, with plans for close follow-up.", "output": ""}

He describes the pain as sharp and occasionally throbbing, rated 7/10 in intensity, with intermittent radiation down the left lower extremity accompanied by numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his symptoms and induces weakness, while lying on his side provides some relief. He reports a single episode of bowel incontinence over the past two years, attributed to prolonged standing and alcohol use, but denies other bowel or bladder changes or loss of genital or rectal sensation. Past interventions include physical therapy with minimal benefit, an injection which he found distressing due to needle phobia, and an unspecified pain medication. He is currently sedentary, having gained approximately 80 pounds in the past year. Physical examination reveals midline tenderness at the L4-L5 level with right paravertebral tenderness, pain on lumbar flexion and extension, a positive straight leg raise test on the right, and decreased sensation over the right lateral thigh corresponding to the L4 dermatome; reflexes are symmetrical. MRI lumbar spine demonstrates disc desiccation and a paracentral disc herniation at L4-L5 causing moderate right neural foraminal stenosis. The clinical picture is consistent with a herniated lumbar disc with radiculopathy. The treatment plan includes a fluoroscopy-guided spinal corticosteroid injection with premedication for anxiety, close follow-up to assess response, and consideration of pain medications or surgery if symptoms persist.", "output": ""}

Her symptoms began with acute right-sided abdominal pain and vomiting, initially thought to be a stomach virus. Subsequent imaging identified a nonfunctioning, small right kidney, along with cysts on both kidneys, ovaries, and other sites, and swollen lymph nodes. She has a history of recurrent febrile illnesses in early childhood requiring multiple hospitalizations treated with antibiotics and fluids, though no definitive infectious workup was performed at that time. Currently, Ashley reports intermittent dysuria, hesitancy at urinary stream initiation, and stomach burning, but denies hematuria. Physical exam is unremarkable, and laboratory studies show preserved renal function (creatinine 0.62 mg/dL, estimated GFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m²), normal electrolytes, and no proteinuria or sediment on urinalysis. Family history is notable for paternal relatives with end-stage renal disease and obstructive uropathy but no known polycystic kidney disease. She is active in sports and advised to maintain hydration, avoid NSAIDs, and undergo annual monitoring with renal ultrasound, urinalysis, and blood pressure checks.

He also experiences mild neck stiffness and has a history of a head contusion from the accident. His medical history includes hypertension controlled with Coreg, anxiety managed with Lexapro, and diet-controlled prediabetes; he denies thyroid disease. Review of systems is notable for fatigue, weight gain, bilateral lower extremity edema, shortness of breath, gout, muscle pain, dry itchy skin with nail bed changes, and excessive hunger. On examination, pinprick sensation is diminished in the affected fingers bilaterally, reflexes are symmetric but mildly reduced (1+), and Tinel’s sign is positive at both wrists and elbows. The clinical picture is consistent with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, with possible contribution from cubital tunnel syndrome. The patient was counseled on the diagnosis and plans were made for nerve conduction studies (EMG) to localize nerve irritation.

As a passenger in a rear-ended vehicle, he experienced multiple impacts causing his finger to forcibly hyperextend. Since the injury, he has been unable to fully flex the finger or make a fist due to pain, swelling, and a pulling, tearing sensation exacerbated by activities such as driving. Initial evaluation included physical therapy and imaging at an orthopedic practice; MRI demonstrated focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, a partial-thickness tear of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon, and tenosynovitis around the flexor tendons, with intact collateral ligaments, MCP capsule, and extensor tendons. On exam, the finger rested in slight PIP flexion with discomfort on extension, mild sensory diminution over the PIP joint, but no swelling or ecchymosis. X-rays showed no bony abnormalities or arthritis. He has a history of hypertension and allergies to methylprednisolone (causing itching) and dexamethasone (causing palpitations), which limited prior corticosteroid use. The clinical picture is consistent with severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis of the right index finger, likely due to inflammation and scar tissue impeding tendon excursion. After discussion of treatment options, he consented to a cortisone injection with betamethasone, though the procedure was complicated by a painful needle reaction requiring two attempts. He was advised to initiate occupational therapy once weekly for six weeks focusing on active and passive range of motion without restrictions, with the goal of improving function and reducing stiffness.

The lesion began approximately six weeks ago after wearing tight shoes and hiking shortly thereafter. Initially presenting as a blister with burning and stinging pain, the ulcer subsequently unroofed, revealing thick, soft, malodorous tissue with yellow drainage. Despite a 10-day course of antibiotics initiated six days prior, the patient now reports worsening symptoms including black discoloration around the wound, cramping and stiffness extending from the calf to the patella, and a burning red streak ascending the anterior ankle and medial calf. He also endorses systemic symptoms of subjective fever, chills, cough, and new-onset shortness of breath with minimal exertion. Physical examination reveals a 2 cm by 2 cm necrotic heel ulcer with surrounding cellulitis and erythema, foul odor, and calf edema with tenderness but no pain on wound palpation. Peripheral pulses are palpable femorally and at the popliteal level, with dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses detected only by Doppler. Radiographs of the right foot show no evidence of osteomyelitis. Laboratory evaluation reveals poorly controlled hyperglycemia with recent blood glucose readings frequently in the 300–400 mg/dL range and occasional spikes up to 600 mg/dL, despite a stable hemoglobin A1c of 6.7%. The clinical impression is a right non-healing diabetic foot ulcer complicated by cellulitis and possible lymphangitis with concern for underlying venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis given calf symptoms.
