The symptoms began suddenly and are associated with light and sound sensitivity, which suggests an acute process. The localized nature of the headache (left forehead and eye) and associated symptoms raise concern for serious intracranial pathology, particularly conditions that can cause increased intracranial pressure or vascular issues. The absence of other neurological deficits or prior episodes limits some differentials but does not exclude serious causes. The most critical \"can't miss\" diagnosis is intracranial hemorrhage or increased intracranial pressure.

Diagnosis: Intracranial Hemorrhage (e.g., Subarachnoid Hemorrhage or Intracranial Hemorrhage)\nJustification: Sudden onset severe headache (thunderclap), vomiting, dizziness, and neurological symptoms in a teenager raise concern for intracranial bleeding, which is a medical emergency. The persistent headache and vomiting suggest increased intracranial pressure or bleeding.\n2. Diagnosis: Migraine with Aura\nJustification: The patient's age, unilateral throbbing headache, associated visual or sensory symptoms (dizziness, sensitivity to light/noise), and vomiting are characteristic of migraine, which is common in adolescents.\n3. Diagnosis: Tension Headache\nJustification: The headache's description as \"really bad\" and bilateral pressure could suggest tension headache, especially with associated fatigue and sensitivity to stimuli, although less likely given the severity and vomiting.\n4. Diagnosis: Sinusitis\nJustification: The unilateral forehead and eye pain worsened by light and noise could indicate sinusitis, especially if associated with congestion or nasal symptoms, though less severe and less likely to cause vomiting.\n5. Diagnosis: Migrainous Vertigo\nJustification: Dizziness and headache with visual and auditory sensitivities may point toward migrainous vertigo, which often occurs in adolescents with migraines.\n6. Diagnosis: Intracranial Mass or Tumor\nJustification: While less acute, a mass could cause persistent headache, dizziness, and visual symptoms, especially if symptoms have been ongoing for some time.\n7. Diagnosis: Viral or Bacterial Meningitis\nJustification: Although no fever or neck stiffness is mentioned, meningitis can present with headache, nausea, and vomiting, and must be considered in differential diagnosis, especially if symptoms worsen.\n8. Diagnosis: Cluster Headache\nJustification: Severe unilateral headache with autonomic features could suggest cluster headache, though less common in teenagers and typically associated with autonomic symptoms like tearing or nasal congestion.\n9. Diagnosis: Temporal Arteritis\nJustification: Unlikely in a 17-year-old; typically affects older adults, but included for completeness in differential.\n10.

Severity should be classified as severe because of the presence of vomiting, neurological symptoms, and persistent headache, indicating potential increased intracranial pressure or bleeding. The urgency level is immediate, as intracranial hemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt evaluation. Differential diagnoses that still need monitoring include migraine, tension headache, sinusitis, and other intracranial pathologies, but these are less immediate than hemorrhage.\n\nSTEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION:\nThe model should prioritize obtaining urgent imaging (preferably non-contrast CT scan of the head) to confirm or exclude intracranial hemorrhage. Initial management involves stabilizing the patient, possibly with neurological assessment and vital signs, and preparing for potential interventions. Treatment is largely supportive until diagnosis is confirmed. The model should consider the patient's age and the severity of symptoms, emphasizing prompt diagnostics over pharmacotherapy at this stage.\n\nSTEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:\nSince the primary concern is ruling out hemorrhage, pharmacological intervention may include medications like antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron 4 mg orally or IV) to manage vomiting if it persists, and possibly analgesics like acetaminophen for headache relief once hemorrhage is ruled out. These medications are chosen based on guidelines for acute neurological assessment and symptom control. Monitoring should include assessment of neurological status and side effects of medications.\n\nSTEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:\nNon-drug interventions include maintaining the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, and providing patient education about the importance of immediate evaluation. The patient should be instructed to remain calm and avoid strenuous activity. Lifestyle modifications are not primary at this stage but involve ensuring the patient rests and avoids triggers for intracranial pressure escalation.\n\nSTEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:\nFollow-up should occur promptly after imaging results are available, ideally within hours. Monitoring includes neurological status, vital signs, and any signs of increased intracranial pressure. Red flag symptoms like worsening headache, vomiting, altered consciousness, or new neurological deficits should prompt immediate reevaluation. Treatment response should be assessed by symptom resolution and neurological stability.\n\nSTEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:\nCommunication should be clear, empathetic, and tailored to a teenager's concerns. The patient should be informed about the urgency of the situation, the importance of imaging, and what to expect during the evaluation. Address worries about severity, potential outcomes, and treatment plans. Use simple language, visual aids if necessary, and involve family members for support and decision-making.\n\nSTEP 7 - COORDINATION & REFERRALS:\nReferral to neurology or neurosurgery should occur immediately for definitive management. Additional team members include emergency medicine specialists, radiologists, and possibly intensive care if needed. Community resources may include support services for trauma or neurological conditions. Cost and insurance considerations should be addressed promptly to facilitate access to imaging and specialty care.\nANSWER: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):\n\u2022 Administer IV ondansetron 4 mg to control vomiting.\n\u2022 Obtain non-contrast head CT scan within 1 hour to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.\n\u2022 Monitor neurological status (level of consciousness, pupillary response) every 15 minutes.\n\u2022 Instruct the patient to remain lying down, avoid strenuous activity, and rest.\nSHORT-TERM MANAGEMENT (1-4 weeks):\n\u2022 Follow-up in 24-48 hours after imaging results to discuss findings and next steps.\n\u2022 If hemorrhage is confirmed, coordinate urgent neurosurgical consultation for possible intervention.\n\u2022 If no hemorrhage is found, consider outpatient evaluation for migraine or other causes.\n\u2022 Continue supportive care, including analgesics as needed.\n\u2022 Educate the patient about warning signs of worsening condition.\nLONG-TERM CARE (3-6 months):\n\u2022 Schedule neurological follow-up to monitor for residual effects or recurrent symptoms.\n\u2022 Implement preventive strategies for migraine if diagnosed.\n\u2022 Provide patient education about recognizing future symptoms and when to seek urgent care.\n\u2022 Coordinate with neurology or neurosurgery for ongoing management if indicated.\nPATIENT EDUCATION PRIORITIES:\n\u2022 Warning signs requiring immediate medical attention: worsening headache, new neurological deficits, vomiting, altered consciousness.\n\u2022 Medication instructions: take ondansetron as prescribed, report side effects.\n\u2022 Lifestyle modifications: rest, avoid strenuous activity, stay hydrated.\n\u2022 Follow-up instructions: return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop; contact emergency services if condition deteriorates.",
        "thinking": "The treatment reasoning model should approach this case systematically:\n\nSTEP 1 - DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMATION & SEVERITY ASSESSMENT:\nThe model should confirm that the primary concern is a possible intracranial hemorrhage, given the sudden onset severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, and neurological symptoms. Severity should be classified as severe because of the presence of vomiting, neurological symptoms, and persistent headache, indicating potential increased intracranial pressure or bleeding. The urgency level is immediate, as intracranial hemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency requiring prompt evaluation. Differential diagnoses that still need monitoring include migraine, tension headache, sinusitis, and other intracranial pathologies, but these are less immediate than hemorrhage.\n\nSTEP 2 - EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT SELECTION:\nThe model should prioritize obtaining urgent imaging (preferably non-contrast CT scan of the head) to confirm or exclude intracranial hemorrhage. Initial management involves stabilizing the patient, possibly with neurological assessment and vital signs, and preparing for potential interventions. Treatment is largely supportive until diagnosis is confirmed. The model should consider the patient's age and the severity of symptoms, emphasizing prompt diagnostics over pharmacotherapy at this stage.\n\nSTEP 3 - PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:\nSince the primary concern is ruling out hemorrhage, pharmacological intervention may include medications like antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron 4 mg orally or IV) to manage vomiting if it persists, and possibly analgesics like acetaminophen for headache relief once hemorrhage is ruled out. These medications are chosen based on guidelines for acute neurological assessment and symptom control. Monitoring should include assessment of neurological status and side effects of medications.\n\nSTEP 4 - NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS:\nNon-drug interventions include maintaining the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, and providing patient education about the importance of immediate evaluation. The patient should be instructed to remain calm and avoid strenuous activity. Lifestyle modifications are not primary at this stage but involve ensuring the patient rests and avoids triggers for intracranial pressure escalation.\n\nSTEP 5 - MONITORING & FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:\nFollow-up should occur promptly after imaging results are available, ideally within hours. Monitoring includes neurological status, vital signs, and any signs of increased intracranial pressure. Red flag symptoms like worsening headache, vomiting, altered consciousness, or new neurological deficits should prompt immediate reevaluation. Treatment response should be assessed by symptom resolution and neurological stability.\n\nSTEP 6 - PATIENT COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:\nCommunication should be clear, empathetic, and tailored to a teenager's concerns.
