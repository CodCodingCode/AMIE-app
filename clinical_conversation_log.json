  "vignette": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 3-day history of progressively worsening lower left abdominal pain, described as sharp and constant. She reports associated low-grade fever, nausea, and decreased appetite but denies any vomiting. Her bowel habits have changed recently, alternating between constipation and occasional loose stools. She mentions a history of a low-fiber diet and chronic constipation over several years. On examination, tenderness localized to the left lower quadrant is noted without rebound or guarding. Laboratory evaluation reveals mild leukocytosis, and a CT scan of the abdomen confirms the presence of inflamed diverticula in the sigmoid colon consistent with acute diverticulitis. She denies any rectal bleeding or significant family history of colon disease. The patient is advised to start on a high-fiber diet once acute inflammation resolves and is prescribed antibiotics to manage the infection.",
