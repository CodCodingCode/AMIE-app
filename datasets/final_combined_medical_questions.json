Occasionally, I might feel a bit of stiffness, but it's not consistent or severe. My main concerns right now are the weight gain, fatigue, and bruising.\nQuestion: Have you experienced chest pain or pressure, especially when lying down?\nAnswer: I've noticed changes in my skin, like it feeling more fragile and bruising easily.

I've been pretty active at work and try to stay on my feet. I did have a busy month with deadlines, but nothing that kept me from moving around.\nQuestion: Have you noticed any blood in your urine or stool?\nAnswer: I've had some mild discomfort in my chest, but it\u2019s not very severe. It doesn\u2019t really feel like pain, more like a tightness sometimes when I cough or take a deep breath. It's hard to describe, but it comes and goes. I just feel a bit off overall.",

He reports feeling lightheaded during physical activity, which has prompted his visit.\nQuestion: Do you often have difficulty controlling your bladder or experience sudden urges to urinate?\nAnswer: Yes, I have noticed that when I stand up quickly, sometimes I feel lightheaded, and my heart starts racing. It seems worse when I'm upright, and I\u2019ve noticed I feel better when I sit down or lie down. I've also been feeling more fatigued overall, which is frustrating because I used to have more energy. I can't really pinpoint whether this is directly related to standing up, but it does seem to happen more often lately.\nQuestion: Have you had any recent infections or fevers?\nAnswer: I haven't noticed any significant weight loss, but my appetite has been a bit off lately\u2014some days I feel less hungry than usual, while other days I\u2019m fine. It might be related to the stress and anxiety I've been feeling with these palpitations and fainting spells.\nQuestion: Do you have a history of significant gastrointestinal issues, such as bloody stools or vomiting blood?\nAnswer: I haven't noticed any significant weight loss, but my appetite has been a bit off lately\u2014some days I feel less hungry than usual, while other days I\u2019m fine. It might be related to the stress and anxiety I've been feeling with these palpitations and fainting spells.\nQuestion: Have you experienced episodes of severe dizziness or fainting mainly when standing up?\nAnswer: I haven't had any recent infections or fevers that I\u2019m aware of. I felt fine until these symptoms started, but I guess it\u2019s possible I could have had something mild that I didn\u2019t notice. Lately, I\u2019ve just been dealing with the palpitations, fatigue, and lightheadedness.\nQuestion: Do you have a consistent pattern of increased fatigue throughout the day that does not improve with rest?\nAnswer: I haven't had any recent infections or fevers that I\u2019m aware of. I felt fine until these symptoms started, but I guess it\u2019s possible I could have had something mild that I didn\u2019t notice.

I often feel more tired than I used to, and even simple activities seem to require more effort. Resting doesn\u2019t seem to help much, and I'm finding it hard to keep up with my usual routine.

I\u2019ve always been pretty healthy. I do get these frequent headaches now, along with some dizziness and mild confusion sometimes, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related.

I haven't noticed any facial pain specifically, but there have been times when I feel pressure around my eyes, especially during my headaches. It's hard to tell if it's all connected, though.\nQuestion: Do you experience dry skin or hair loss that seems more pronounced than what you\u2019ve experienced in the past?\nAnswer: Yes, I have noticed some physical symptoms during stressful situations. Sometimes I feel my heart racing and I\u2019ve experienced some sweating. It\u2019s not always intense, but I do feel a little shaky occasionally.

My main concerns are the fever, rash, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort. The rash doesn't have a discharge, but it has spread and looks more pronounced. I'm not sure if that related or not.\nQuestion: Have you had any recent exposures to industrial chemicals or metals?\nAnswer: No, I don't have a history of heavy alcohol consumption. I usually drink only occasionally on weekends. My focus right now is on the persistent fevers, rash, and fatigue I've been experiencing. It's been pretty concerning for me.\nQuestion: Do you currently take any medications known to cause neutropenia?\nAnswer: No, I don't have a history of heavy alcohol consumption. I usually drink only occasionally on weekends. My focus right now is on the persistent fevers, rash, and fatigue I've been experiencing.

I\u2019ve just been feeling really unwell with the fevers, rash, and fatigue, and I'm not sure what could be causing it.\nQuestion: Have you had confirmed recent infections with viruses such as hepatitis or cytomegalovirus?\nAnswer: No, I\u2019m not currently taking any medications known to cause neutropenia. I only take an occasional over-the-counter antihistamine for my allergies. I've been experiencing persistent fevers, chills, night sweats, and significant fatigue recently, along with a rash and some abdominal discomfort.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly how I've been feeling.\nQuestion: Do you have any known allergies or asthma triggers that worsen your breathing or throat symptoms?\nAnswer: I don\u2019t have a clear history of chronic nasal congestion or postnasal drip. Occasionally, I feel a bit stuffy, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve noticed consistently. I\u2019ve mainly been focused on the shortness of breath and tightness in my throat. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly what\u2019s been going on, especially given my anxiety, but I don\u2019t think allergies have played a big role.\nQuestion: Have you noticed any recent changes in your voice or difficulty speaking, like hoarseness?\nAnswer: I don\u2019t have a clear history of chronic nasal congestion or postnasal drip.

I\u2019ve always been healthy until recently when I started having these episodes of shortness of breath, especially during physical activities or when I'm stressed. It\u2019s a new experience for me, and I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on.\nQuestion: Have you experienced any episodes of breathing difficulty that occurred primarily at night or during sleep?\nAnswer: No, I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with asthma or any chronic lung conditions.
